The republic was established in the wake of the [[Aftermath of World War I#Austria-Hungary|dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] following [[World War I]]. The First Hungarian Republic replaced the [[Kingdom of Hungary (Austria-Hungary)|Kingdom of Hungary]], and was in turn replaced by the [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungarian Republic]], another short-lived state from 1919 to 1920. During the rule of Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]]'s pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approximately 75% of its former pre-World War I territories ({{convert|325411|km2|abbr=on}}) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. \n\nFollowing this period, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers of World War I]] severely pressured the Hungarians into retreating behind post-war demarcation lines as a provision to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], their attempt to establish new [[nation state]]s among the former kingdom's non-Hungarian citizens&nbsp;\u2013 the principal beneficiaries of which were the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]].

That day, King [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]] appointed the revolt's leader, [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], as Hungarian prime minister. Almost his first act was to formally terminate the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. On 13 November, Charles [[Charles I of Austria#Proclamations|issued a proclamation]] withdrawing from Hungarian politics. A few days later the provisional government proclaimed Hungary a people's republic,<ref name=\"november16\"/> with K\u00e1rolyi as both prime minister and interim president. This event ended 400 years of rule by the [[House of Habsburg]].\n\nThe K\u00e1rolyi government's measures failed to stem popular discontent, especially when the [[Entente powers]] began distributing slices of what many considered [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|Hungary's traditional territory]] to the majority ethnic groups in [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]]. The new government and its supporters had pinned their hopes for maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity on the abandonment of [[Cisleithania]] and Germany, the securing of a separate peace, and exploiting K\u00e1rolyi's close connections in the [[French Third Republic]].\n\nThe Entente considered Hungary a partner in the defeated [[Dual Monarchy]], and dashed the Hungarians' hopes with the delivery of successive diplomatic notes. Each demanded the surrender of more land to other ethnic groups. On 20 March 1919, the French head of the Entente mission in Budapest gave K\u00e1rolyi a note<!--Vix note--> delineating the final postwar boundaries, which the Hungarians found unacceptable.<ref>{{cite book |last= Romsics|first= Ign\u00e1c|title= Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XX. sz\u00e1zadban|year= 2004|publisher= Osiris Kiad\u00f3|location= Budapest|language= Hungarian|isbn= 963-389-590-1|page= 123}}</ref> K\u00e1rolyi and Prime Minister [[D\u00e9nes Berinkey]] were now in an impossible position. They knew accepting the French note would endanger the country's territorial integrity, but were in no position to reject it. In protest, Berinkey resigned.\n\nK\u00e1rolyi informed the cabinet that only the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] could possibly form a new government. Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged with the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]; the latter promised that the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] would help Hungary to restore its [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|original borders]]. Although the Social Democrats held a majority in the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party, the communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]] immediately seized control and announced the establishment of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] on 21 March 1919.\n\n=== Re-establishment and dissolution ===\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Republic on 1 August 1919, a social democratic government\u2014the so-called \"trade union government\"\u2014came to power under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Romsics|first=I.|date=2004|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XX. sz\u00e1zadban|location=Budapest|publisher=Osiris Kiad\u00f3|lang=hu|isbn=963-389-590-1|page=132}}</ref> A decree was issued on 2 August restoring the form of government and the official state name back to \"People's Republic\".<ref name=\"august2\"/> During its brief existence, the Peidl government began to abrogate the edicts passed by the Communist regime.<ref>{{cite book|title=Minisztertan\u00e1csi jegyz\u0151k\u00f6nyvek: 1919. augusztus 3.|publisher=DigitArchiv|page=6|lang=hu}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 August, [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]], leader of the White House Comrades Association\u2014a right-wing, [[counter-revolutionary]] group\u2014seized power in a bloodless coup with the backing of the [[Romanian Land Forces|Royal Romanian Army]].<ref name=\"P\u00f6l\u00f6skei\"/> The next day, [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria|Joseph August]] declared himself [[regent of Hungary]]\u2014he held the position until 23 August, when he was forced to resign<ref>{{cite web|title=Die amtliche Meldung \u00fcber den R\u00fccktritt|publisher=[[Neue Freie Presse]], Morgenblatt|date=1919-08-24|page=2|language=German|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&aid=nfp&datum=19190824&seite=2&zoom=2}}</ref>\u2014and appointed Friedrich as Prime Minister.

The republic was established in the wake of the [[Aftermath of World War I#Austria-Hungary|dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] following [[World War I]]. The First Hungarian Republic replaced the [[Kingdom of Hungary (Austria-Hungary)|Kingdom of Hungary]], and was in turn replaced by the [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungarian Republic]], another short-lived state from 1919 to 1920. During the rule of Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]]'s pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approximately 75% of its former pre-World War I territories ({{convert|325411|km2|abbr=on}}) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. \n\nFollowing this period, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers of World War I]] severely pressured the Hungarians into retreating behind post-war demarcation lines as a provision to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], their attempt to establish new [[nation state]]s among the former kingdom's non-Hungarian citizens&nbsp;\u2013 the principal beneficiaries of which were the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]].

That day, King [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]] appointed the revolt's leader, [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], as Hungarian prime minister. Almost his first act was to formally terminate the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. On 13 November, Charles [[Charles I of Austria#Proclamations|issued a proclamation]] withdrawing from Hungarian politics. A few days later the provisional government proclaimed Hungary a people's republic,<ref name=\"november16\"/> with K\u00e1rolyi as both prime minister and interim president. This event ended 400 years of rule by the [[House of Habsburg]].\n\nThe K\u00e1rolyi government's measures failed to stem popular discontent, especially when the [[Entente powers]] began distributing slices of what many considered [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|Hungary's traditional territory]] to the majority ethnic groups in [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]]. The new government and its supporters had pinned their hopes for maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity on the abandonment of [[Cisleithania]] and Germany, the securing of a separate peace, and exploiting K\u00e1rolyi's close connections in the [[French Third Republic]].\n\nThe Entente considered Hungary a partner in the defeated [[Dual Monarchy]], and dashed the Hungarians' hopes with the delivery of successive diplomatic notes. Each demanded the surrender of more land to other ethnic groups. On 20 March 1919, the French head of the Entente mission in Budapest gave K\u00e1rolyi a note<!--Vix note--> delineating the final postwar boundaries, which the Hungarians found unacceptable.<ref>{{cite book |last= Romsics|first= Ign\u00e1c|title= Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XX. sz\u00e1zadban|year= 2004|publisher= Osiris Kiad\u00f3|location= Budapest|language= Hungarian|isbn= 963-389-590-1|page= 123}}</ref> K\u00e1rolyi and Prime Minister [[D\u00e9nes Berinkey]] were now in an impossible position. They knew accepting the French note would endanger the country's territorial integrity, but were in no position to reject it. In protest, Berinkey resigned.\n\nK\u00e1rolyi informed the cabinet that only the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] could possibly form a new government. Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged with the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]; the latter promised that the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] would help Hungary to restore its [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|original borders]]. Although the Social Democrats held a majority in the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party, the communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]] immediately seized control and announced the establishment of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] on 21 March 1919.\n\n=== Re-establishment and dissolution ===\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Republic on 1 August 1919, a social democratic government\u2014the so-called \"trade union government\"\u2014came to power under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Romsics|first=I.|date=2004|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XX. sz\u00e1zadban|location=Budapest|publisher=Osiris Kiad\u00f3|lang=hu|isbn=963-389-590-1|page=132}}</ref> A decree was issued on 2 August restoring the form of government and the official state name back to \"People's Republic\".<ref name=\"august2\"/> During its brief existence, the Peidl government began to abrogate the edicts passed by the Communist regime.<ref>{{cite book|title=Minisztertan\u00e1csi jegyz\u0151k\u00f6nyvek: 1919. augusztus 3.|publisher=DigitArchiv|page=6|lang=hu}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 August, [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]], leader of the White House Comrades Association\u2014a right-wing, [[counter-revolutionary]] group\u2014seized power in a bloodless coup with the backing of the [[Romanian Land Forces|Royal Romanian Army]].<ref name=\"P\u00f6l\u00f6skei\"/> The next day, [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria|Joseph August]] declared himself [[regent of Hungary]]\u2014he held the position until 23 August, when he was forced to resign<ref>{{cite web|title=Die amtliche Meldung \u00fcber den R\u00fccktritt|publisher=[[Neue Freie Presse]], Morgenblatt|date=1919-08-24|page=2|language=German|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&aid=nfp&datum=19190824&seite=2&zoom=2}}</ref>\u2014and appointed Friedrich as Prime Minister.

Since then, the term \"Conch Republic\" has been expanded to refer to \"all of the Florida Keys, or, that geographic apportionment of land that falls within the legally defined boundaries of [[Monroe County, Florida]], northward to 'Skeeter's Last Chance Saloon' in [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]], [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County, Florida]], with Key West as the nation's capital and all territories north of Key West being referred to as 'The Northern Territories'{{-\"}}.<ref>[http://www.conchrepublic.com/history.htm A brief history of the Conch Republic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102113712/http://www.conchrepublic.com/history.htm |date=2012-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the protests that sparked the creation of the Conch Republic (and others since then) have been described by some as \"tongue-in-cheek,\" they were motivated by frustrations over genuine concerns.

Vehicles were stopped and searched for [[narcotics]] and [[illegal immigrant]]s. The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys' important [[tourism]] industry. [[Eastern Air Lines]], which had a hub at [[Miami International Airport]], saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only [[airline]] to establish [[jet aircraft|jet]] service to [[Key West International Airport]], counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles.\n\nWhen the City Council's complaints went unanswered by the U.S. federal government and attempts to get an [[injunction]] against the roadblock failed in court, as a form of protest Mayor [[Dennis Wardlow]] and the council declared Key West's independence on April 23, 1982. In the eyes of the council, since the U.S. federal government had set up the equivalent of a border station as if they were a foreign nation, they might as well become one. As many of the local citizens were referred to as [[Conch (people)|Conchs]], the nation took the name of the Conch Republic.\n\nAs part of the protest, Mayor Wardlow was proclaimed [[Prime Minister]] of the Republic, which immediately [[Declaration of war|declared war]] against the United States (symbolically breaking a loaf of stale [[Cuban bread]] over the head of a man dressed in a naval uniform), quickly surrendered after one minute (to the man in the uniform), and applied for one billion [[United States dollar|dollars]] in [[foreign aid]].\n\nConch Republic officials were invited to the [[Summit of the Americas]] in [[Miami]] in 1994, and Conch representatives were officially invited to 1995's Florida Jubilee.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Micronations |author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |page=131}}</ref>\n\nThe faux secession and the events surrounding it generated great publicity for the Keys' plight \u2014 the roadblock and inspection station were removed soon afterward. It also resulted in the creation of a new avenue of tourism for the Keys.\n\n===Invasions of 1995===\n\nOn September 20, 1995, it was reported that the [[478th Civil Affairs Battalion]] of the [[United States Army Reserve]] was to conduct a training exercise simulating an invasion of a foreign island. They were to land on Key West and conduct affairs as if the islanders were foreign. However, no one from the 478th notified Conch officials of the exercise.\n\nSeeing another chance at publicity, Wardlow and the forces behind the 1982 Conch Republic secession mobilized the island for a full-scale war, sending the schooner [[Western Union (schooner)|''Western Union'']] out to attack an incoming Coast Guard Cutter with water balloons, conch fritters and stale Cuban bread, to which the Coast Guard responded with their fire hoses (quickly ending the battle), and protested to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for arranging this exercise without consulting the City of Key West. The leaders of the 478th issued an apology the next day, saying they \"in no way meant to challenge or impugn the sovereignty of the Conch Republic\", and submitted to a surrender ceremony on September 22.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Micronations|author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|year=2006|isbn=1-74104-730-7|pages=133}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995\u201396|U.S. federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996]], as a protest, the Republic sent a flotilla of Conch Navy civilian and fire department boats to [[Fort Jefferson, Florida|Fort Jefferson]], located in [[Dry Tortugas National Park]], to reopen it. The action was dubbed a \"full scale invasion\" by the Conch Republic. Inspired by efforts of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to keep its museums open by private donations, local residents had raised private money to keep the park running (a closed park would damage the tourist-dependent local economy), but could find no one to accept the money and reopen the park.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nWhen officials attempted to enter the monument, they were cited.

The move was in response to a recent event regarding [[Cuba]]n [[refugee]]s. On the previous January 4, fifteen Cuban refugees reached the bridge, but were returned to Cuba by the U.S. Border Patrol because the U.S. government had declared the bridge a \"wet feet\" location under the ''[[wet feet, dry feet policy]]''. The rationale was that, since two sections of the span had been removed and it was no longer connected to land, it was not part of U.S. territory subject to the \"dry feet\" rule, and thus the refugees could not stay.\n\nAnderson, seizing upon the U.S.'s apparent disavowal of the abandoned span, claimed it for the Republic. He expressed hope to use the bridge for affordable, ecologically friendly housing. In response, Russel Schweiss, spokesman for Florida governor [[Jeb Bush]], declared \"With all due respect to the Conch Republic, the bridge belongs to all the people of Florida, and we're not currently in negotiations to sell it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/14/State/Conchs_roar_to_bridge.shtml |title=Conchs roar to bridge annexation |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-01-14}}</ref> The refugee decision was later overturned, but only after the refugees had been returned to Cuba.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn another protest, beginning in 2008, the northern keys including Key Largo formed a separation of the Conch Republic known as the Independent Northernmost Territories of the Conch Republic.

Vehicles were stopped and searched for [[narcotics]] and [[illegal immigrant]]s. The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys' important [[tourism]] industry. [[Eastern Air Lines]], which had a hub at [[Miami International Airport]], saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only [[airline]] to establish [[jet aircraft|jet]] service to [[Key West International Airport]], counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles.\n\nWhen the City Council's complaints went unanswered by the U.S. federal government and attempts to get an [[injunction]] against the roadblock failed in court, as a form of protest Mayor [[Dennis Wardlow]] and the council declared Key West's independence on April 23, 1982. In the eyes of the council, since the U.S. federal government had set up the equivalent of a border station as if they were a foreign nation, they might as well become one. As many of the local citizens were referred to as [[Conch (people)|Conchs]], the nation took the name of the Conch Republic.\n\nAs part of the protest, Mayor Wardlow was proclaimed [[Prime Minister]] of the Republic, which immediately [[Declaration of war|declared war]] against the United States (symbolically breaking a loaf of stale [[Cuban bread]] over the head of a man dressed in a naval uniform), quickly surrendered after one minute (to the man in the uniform), and applied for one billion [[United States dollar|dollars]] in [[foreign aid]].\n\nConch Republic officials were invited to the [[Summit of the Americas]] in [[Miami]] in 1994, and Conch representatives were officially invited to 1995's Florida Jubilee.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Micronations |author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |page=131}}</ref>\n\nThe faux secession and the events surrounding it generated great publicity for the Keys' plight \u2014 the roadblock and inspection station were removed soon afterward. It also resulted in the creation of a new avenue of tourism for the Keys.\n\n===Invasions of 1995===\n\nOn September 20, 1995, it was reported that the [[478th Civil Affairs Battalion]] of the [[United States Army Reserve]] was to conduct a training exercise simulating an invasion of a foreign island. They were to land on Key West and conduct affairs as if the islanders were foreign. However, no one from the 478th notified Conch officials of the exercise.\n\nSeeing another chance at publicity, Wardlow and the forces behind the 1982 Conch Republic secession mobilized the island for a full-scale war, sending the schooner [[Western Union (schooner)|''Western Union'']] out to attack an incoming Coast Guard Cutter with water balloons, conch fritters and stale Cuban bread, to which the Coast Guard responded with their fire hoses (quickly ending the battle), and protested to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for arranging this exercise without consulting the City of Key West. The leaders of the 478th issued an apology the next day, saying they \"in no way meant to challenge or impugn the sovereignty of the Conch Republic\", and submitted to a surrender ceremony on September 22.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Micronations|author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|year=2006|isbn=1-74104-730-7|pages=133}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995\u201396|U.S. federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996]], as a protest, the Republic sent a flotilla of Conch Navy civilian and fire department boats to [[Fort Jefferson, Florida|Fort Jefferson]], located in [[Dry Tortugas National Park]], to reopen it. The action was dubbed a \"full scale invasion\" by the Conch Republic. Inspired by efforts of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to keep its museums open by private donations, local residents had raised private money to keep the park running (a closed park would damage the tourist-dependent local economy), but could find no one to accept the money and reopen the park.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nWhen officials attempted to enter the monument, they were cited.

The move was in response to a recent event regarding [[Cuba]]n [[refugee]]s. On the previous January 4, fifteen Cuban refugees reached the bridge, but were returned to Cuba by the U.S. Border Patrol because the U.S. government had declared the bridge a \"wet feet\" location under the ''[[wet feet, dry feet policy]]''. The rationale was that, since two sections of the span had been removed and it was no longer connected to land, it was not part of U.S. territory subject to the \"dry feet\" rule, and thus the refugees could not stay.\n\nAnderson, seizing upon the U.S.'s apparent disavowal of the abandoned span, claimed it for the Republic. He expressed hope to use the bridge for affordable, ecologically friendly housing. In response, Russel Schweiss, spokesman for Florida governor [[Jeb Bush]], declared \"With all due respect to the Conch Republic, the bridge belongs to all the people of Florida, and we're not currently in negotiations to sell it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/14/State/Conchs_roar_to_bridge.shtml |title=Conchs roar to bridge annexation |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-01-14}}</ref> The refugee decision was later overturned, but only after the refugees had been returned to Cuba.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn another protest, beginning in 2008, the northern keys including Key Largo formed a separation of the Conch Republic known as the Independent Northernmost Territories of the Conch Republic.

In addition to ''moe'' features, ''moe'' anthropomorphisms are also characterized by their accessories, which serve to emphasize their original forms before anthropomorphosis. The characters here, usually in a kind of [[cosplay]], are drawn to represent an inanimate object or popular consumer product. Part of the humor of this [[personification]] comes from the personality ascribed to the character (often [[Satire|satirical]]) and the sheer arbitrariness of characterizing a variety of machines, objects, and even physical places as cute.\n\nThis form of anthropomorphism is very common in ''[[otaku]]'' subcultures. With the exception of ''kemonomimi'' (which are human-like characters that have animal features), many ''moe'' anthropomorphizations started as ''[[d\u014djin]]'' efforts. An early form of moe anthropomorphism is the [[Gundam]] MS Girl created by Mika Akitaka in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ashcraft, Brian|url=https://kotaku.com/gundam-as-girls-5505193|title=Gundam As Girls|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 30, 2010|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> Many anthropomorphizations were the results of discussions on [[Japan]]ese [[Internet forum]]s such as [[2channel]] or [[Futaba Channel]]. The trend spread out of ''d\u014djin'' circles as commercial anime and manga also prominently feature characters who are personifications of inanimate objects.\n\n''Moe'' anthropomorphism gained a lot of traction in 2019., after the creation of the subreddit r/moemorphism, where users can share their own ''moe'' anthropomorphized drawings. \n\n==Sociological aspects==\nThe [[media studies]] scholar Yuji Sone has argued that since ''moe'' anthropomorphism is usually personified by beautiful young girls, it is an example of the outgrowth of otaku subcultural [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] into sexual fantasies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sone|first=Yuji|date=2014-08-07|title=Canted Desire: Otaku Performance in Japanese Popular Culture|journal=Cultural Studies Review|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=196\u2013222|doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.3700|issn=1837-8692|doi-access=free}}</ref> The [[psychologist]] [[Tamaki Sait\u014d]] regards ''moe'' anthropomorphism as an example of ''[[mitate-e]]'' art due to its simultaneous use of both [[High art|high]] and [[Low culture|low art]] to provide additional, sometimes humorous, meanings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u6790\u3000\u2500\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u30fb\u6587\u5b66\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u4eba|trans-title=Character psychoanalysis \u2500 manga \u00b7 literature \u00b7 Japanese| first=Sait\u014d|last= Tamaki|date=2011|publisher=Chikuma Shob\u014d|isbn=9784480842954 | location=T\u014dky\u014d|language=Japanese| oclc=709665062|page=179}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n<!-- Always PROVIDE a RELIABLE source for each samples you enter HERE! -->\n\n[[File:Kemonomimi dog.png|left|upright|thumb|A ''kemonomimi'' with the ears and tail of a dog]]\n\n===Animals===\n''[[wikt:\u7363\u8033|Kemonomimi]]'', literally meaning \"animal ears\", is the concept of depicting human and human-like characters with animal ears, and by extension, other features such as tails. Kemonomimi is often used in moe anthropomorphism, to depict animal characters in human form. [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|Catgirl]]s and catboys are the most prolific in this category, although bunnygirls, foxgirls, doggirls, and wolfgirls are also common. Kemonomimi characters typically appear human except for added animal-like qualities. A notable franchise featuring moe anthropomorphism and ''kemonomimi'' is ''[[Kemono Friends]]'', which is focused on a myriad of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] animals in the form of girls and young women, ranging from real animals to [[cryptid]]s and [[legendary creature]]s. Another notable series is ''[[Uma Musume Pretty Derby]]'' which focuses on girls as famous Japanese [[racehorses]].\n\n===Monsters===\nThe \"monster girl\" concept gives ''moe'' appearances to typically hideous [[monster]]s from legend, mythology, and fantasy. Their \"evil\" traits may be fully retained, de-emphasized into mere personality tics, or removed altogether. It was popularized by such manga as ''[[Monster Musume]]'' and ''[[A Centaur's Life]]'', and grown into its own genre.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-list/2015-03-28/.86269|title=The List - 7 Manga for Monster Girl Lovers|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en}}</ref> Rarely, the monster girls are relatively unchanged from their original form and personality, such as [[Mermaids in popular culture|mermaids]] and [[centaurides]].\n\n===Computers===\n{{See also|OS-tan}}\n\nAlthough ''[[Chobits]]'' (2001) and Toy's iMac Girl (1998) came first, the [[Internet meme|meme]] of turning computer-related phenomena into ''moe'' subjects did not start until {{nihongo|Shiitake-chan|\u3057\u3044\u305f\u3051\u3061\u3083\u3093}}, the anthropomorphization of [[Internet Explorer]]'s ''Stop'' button.

An early form of moe anthropomorphism is the [[Gundam]] MS Girl created by Mika Akitaka in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ashcraft, Brian|url=https://kotaku.com/gundam-as-girls-5505193|title=Gundam As Girls|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 30, 2010|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> Many anthropomorphizations were the results of discussions on [[Japan]]ese [[Internet forum]]s such as [[2channel]] or [[Futaba Channel]]. The trend spread out of ''d\u014djin'' circles as commercial anime and manga also prominently feature characters who are personifications of inanimate objects.\n\n==Sociological aspects==\nThe [[media studies]] scholar Yuji Sone has argued that since ''moe'' anthropomorphism is usually personified by beautiful young girls, it is an example of the outgrowth of otaku subcultural [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] into sexual fantasies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sone|first=Yuji|date=2014-08-07|title=Canted Desire: Otaku Performance in Japanese Popular Culture|journal=Cultural Studies Review|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=196\u2013222|doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.3700|issn=1837-8692|doi-access=free}}</ref> The [[psychologist]] [[Tamaki Sait\u014d]] regards ''moe'' anthropomorphism as an example of ''[[mitate-e]]'' art due to its simultaneous use of both [[High art|high]] and [[Low culture|low art]] to provide additional, sometimes humorous, meanings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u6790\u3000\u2500\u30de\u30f3\u30ac\u30fb\u6587\u5b66\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u4eba|trans-title=Character psychoanalysis \u2500 manga \u00b7 literature \u00b7 Japanese| first=Sait\u014d|last= Tamaki|date=2011|publisher=Chikuma Shob\u014d|isbn=9784480842954 | location=T\u014dky\u014d|language=Japanese| oclc=709665062|page=179}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n<!-- Always PROVIDE a RELIABLE source for each samples you enter HERE! -->\n\n[[File:Kemonomimi dog.png|left|upright|thumb|A ''kemonomimi'' with the ears and tail of a dog]]\n\n===Animals===\n''[[wikt:\u7363\u8033|Kemonomimi]]'', literally meaning \"animal ears\", is the concept of depicting human and human-like characters with animal ears, and by extension, other features such as tails. Kemonomimi is often used in moe anthropomorphism, to depict animal characters in human form. [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|Catgirl]]s and catboys are the most prolific in this category, although bunnygirls, foxgirls, doggirls, and wolfgirls are also common. Kemonomimi characters typically appear human except for added animal-like qualities. A notable franchise featuring moe anthropomorphism and ''kemonomimi'' is ''[[Kemono Friends]]'', which is focused on a myriad of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] animals in the form of girls and young women, ranging from real animals to [[cryptid]]s and [[legendary creature]]s. Another notable series is ''[[Uma Musume Pretty Derby]]'' which focuses on girls as famous Japanese [[racehorses]].\n\n===Monsters===\nThe \"monster girl\" concept gives ''moe'' appearances to typically hideous [[monster]]s from legend, mythology, and fantasy. Their \"evil\" traits may be fully retained, de-emphasized into mere personality tics, or removed altogether. It was popularized by such manga as ''[[Monster Musume]]'' and ''[[A Centaur's Life]]'', and grown into its own genre.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-list/2015-03-28/.86269|title=The List - 7 Manga for Monster Girl Lovers|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en}}</ref> Rarely, the monster girls are relatively unchanged from their original form and personality, such as [[Mermaids in popular culture|mermaids]] and [[centaurides]].\n\n===Computers===\n{{See also|OS-tan}}\n\nAlthough ''[[Chobits]]'' (2001) and Toy's iMac Girl (1998) came first, the [[Internet meme|meme]] of turning computer-related phenomena into ''moe'' subjects did not start until {{nihongo|Shiitake-chan|\u3057\u3044\u305f\u3051\u3061\u3083\u3093}}, the anthropomorphization of [[Internet Explorer]]'s ''Stop'' button.

Anne-Marie later married [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and currently lives in [[Greece]].\n\nMargrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in [[Fredensborg Palace]] in [[North Zealand]]. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Southern Jutland]]. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[File:Margrethe II of Denmark 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Margrethe in 1966]]\nAt the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]] branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]] would one day assume the throne.\n\nThe process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] permitted female [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne of Denmark, according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]]. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to [[Los Angeles]], and to the [[Paramount Studios]], where they met several celebrities, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Elvis>{{cite web|title=Elvis Presley with Princesses Margrethe of Denmark, Astrid of Norway, and Margaretha of Sweden|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=11 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909182159/http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nMargrethe was educated at the private school [[N.

Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of \"His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark\" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish [[throne]].<ref name=r1/> They were married for over fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.\n\nMargrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]]. A second child, named [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Joachim]], was born 7 June 1969.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Faroe stamp 302 Queen Margrethe.jpg|thumb|200px|Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the [[Faroese people]]. Stamp FR 302 of [[Postverk F\u00f8roya]], [[Faroe Islands]], issued 14 January 1997.]]\n\n===Succession===\nShortly after [[Frederick IX of Denmark|King Frederick IX]] delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he fell ill. At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish [[monarch|sovereign]] under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] 15 January 1972, by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Jens Otto Krag]]. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style \"[[By the Grace of God]], Queen of Denmark\" ({{lang-da|Margrethe den Anden, af Guds N\u00e5de Danmarks Dronning}}). The Queen chose the [[Royal mottos of Danish monarchs|motto]]: ''God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.''<ref name=\"Margrethe and Henrik Biography\"/>\n\nIn her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said: {{quote|My beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.<ref name=\"radical royalist\">{{cite journal|url=http://radicalroyalist.blogspot.com.br/2012_01_01_archive.html#post-body-3282259268133616607|publisher=Radical Royalist|title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark 40 years on the Throne|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref>}}\n\n===Constitutional role===\nThe Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. \n\nAs an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAfter an election where the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a \u201cDronningerunde\u201d (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the [[List of political parties in Denmark|Danish political parties]].<ref name=Todays>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |title=The Monarchy today |publisher=Kongehuset.dk |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215082552/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal [[Det Radikale Venstre]] did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the [[Folketing]], is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history{{when|date=January 2020}} that any party has held a majority on its own.)\n\nOnce the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State ([[privy council]]), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the [[Cabinet of Denmark]].\n\nIn addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]], an infantry regiment of the [[British Army]], following a tradition in her family.<ref name=r1/>\n\n===Ruby Jubilee===\nQueen Margrethe II celebrated her [[Ruby Jubilee]], the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012.<ref name=BBC40>{{cite news |title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marks 40 years on the throne |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16531823 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and numerous TV interviews.\n\n=== Immigration debate ===\nIn an interview within the 2016 book ''De dybeste r\u00f8dder'' (''The Deepest Roots''), according to historians at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Saxo Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] she showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.<ref name=\"tv2_dk_23October2016\">{{cite news|title=Historiker om Margrethes danskheds-udtalelse: - Hun har fulgt folkesj\u00e6lens bekymringer|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2016-10-23-historiker-om-margrethes-danskheds-udtalelse-hun-har-fulgt-folkesjaelens|accessdate=25 October 2016|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)]]|date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"b_dk_22October2016\">{{cite news|title=Dronning Margrethe om integration: \"Det er ikke en naturlov, at man bliver dansker af at bo i Danmark\"|url=http://www.b.dk/politiko/dronning-margrethe-om-integration-det-er-ikke-en-naturlov-at-man-bliver-dans|accessdate=25 October 2016|newspaper=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and interests==\n\nThe official residences of the Queen are [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen and [[Fredensborg Palace]].

She sent them to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]] in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002.

Born into the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]], a [[royal house]] with origins in [[northern Germany]], she was the eldest child of [[Frederick IX of Denmark]] and [[Ingrid of Sweden]]. She became [[heir presumptive]] to her father in 1953, when [[Danish Act of Succession|a constitutional amendment]] allowed women to inherit the throne.\n\nMargrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972. On her accession, she became the first female monarch of Denmark since [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]], ruler of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms in 1375\u20131412 during the [[Kalmar Union]]. In 1967, she married [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]], with whom she had two sons: [[Crown Prince Frederik]] and [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Amalienborg cph.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg]], photographed in 2006]]\nPrincess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at [[Amalienborg]] in [[Copenhagen]] as the first child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (later [[King Frederick IX]] and [[Queen Ingrid]]). Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning [[King Christian X]], while her mother was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]]). Her birth took place just one week after [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invasion of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940.<ref name=r1/>\n\nShe was [[baptism|baptised]] on 14 May in the [[Holmen Church]] in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=r1/> The Princess's [[godparent]]s were: [[King Christian X]] (paternal grandfather); [[Prince Knud of Denmark|Hereditary Prince Knud]] (paternal uncle); [[Prince Axel of Denmark|Prince Axel]] (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V of Sweden]] (maternal great-grandfather); [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]] (maternal grandfather); [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten]] (her maternal uncle); [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (maternal great-grandfather).\n\nShe was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, [[Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also the [[King of Iceland]], she was given the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name \u00de\u00f3rhildur.<ref>{{cite web | title = Navnet til den ny prinsesse... | website = nfi.ku.dk | publisher = Nordisk Forskningsinstitut, [[University of Copenhagen]] | date = 18 May 2012 | url = http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | access-date = 23 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202083411/http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | archive-date = 2 February 2017 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her younger sister [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark|Princess Benedikte]] was born. Princess Benedikte later married [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister, [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Princess Anne-Marie]], was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and currently lives in [[Greece]].\n\nMargrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in [[Fredensborg Palace]] in [[North Zealand]]. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Southern Jutland]]. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[File:Margrethe II of Denmark 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Margrethe in 1966]]\nAt the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]] branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]] would one day assume the throne.\n\nThe process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] permitted female [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne of Denmark, according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]]. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to [[Los Angeles]], and to the [[Paramount Studios]], where they met several celebrities, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Elvis>{{cite web|title=Elvis Presley with Princesses Margrethe of Denmark, Astrid of Norway, and Margaretha of Sweden|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=11 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909182159/http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nMargrethe was educated at the private school [[N.

Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of \"His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark\" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish [[throne]].<ref name=r1/> They were married for over fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.\n\nMargrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]]. A second child, named [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Joachim]], was born 7 June 1969.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Faroe stamp 302 Queen Margrethe.jpg|thumb|200px|Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the [[Faroese people]]. Stamp FR 302 of [[Postverk F\u00f8roya]], [[Faroe Islands]], issued 14 January 1997.]]\n\n===Succession===\nShortly after [[Frederick IX of Denmark|King Frederick IX]] delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he fell ill. At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish [[monarch|sovereign]] under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] 15 January 1972, by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Jens Otto Krag]]. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style \"[[By the Grace of God]], Queen of Denmark\" ({{lang-da|Margrethe den Anden, af Guds N\u00e5de Danmarks Dronning}}). The Queen chose the [[Royal mottos of Danish monarchs|motto]]: ''God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.''<ref name=\"Margrethe and Henrik Biography\"/>\n\nIn her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said: {{quote|My beloved father, our King, is dead.

May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.<ref name=\"radical royalist\">{{cite journal|url=http://radicalroyalist.blogspot.com.br/2012_01_01_archive.html#post-body-3282259268133616607|publisher=Radical Royalist|title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark 40 years on the Throne|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref>}}\n\n===Constitutional role===\nThe Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. \n\nAs an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAfter an election where the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a \u201cDronningerunde\u201d (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the [[List of political parties in Denmark|Danish political parties]].<ref name=Todays>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |title=The Monarchy today |publisher=Kongehuset.dk |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215082552/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal [[Det Radikale Venstre]] did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the [[Folketing]], is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history{{when|date=January 2020}} that any party has held a majority on its own.)\n\nOnce the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State ([[privy council]]), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the [[Cabinet of Denmark]].\n\nIn addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]], an infantry regiment of the [[British Army]], following a tradition in her family.<ref name=r1/>\n\n===Ruby Jubilee===\nQueen Margrethe II celebrated her [[Ruby Jubilee]], the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012.<ref name=BBC40>{{cite news |title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marks 40 years on the throne |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16531823 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and numerous TV interviews.\n\n=== Immigration debate ===\nIn an interview within the 2016 book ''De dybeste r\u00f8dder'' (''The Deepest Roots''), according to historians at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Saxo Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] she showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.<ref name=\"tv2_dk_23October2016\">{{cite news|title=Historiker om Margrethes danskheds-udtalelse: - Hun har fulgt folkesj\u00e6lens bekymringer|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2016-10-23-historiker-om-margrethes-danskheds-udtalelse-hun-har-fulgt-folkesjaelens|accessdate=25 October 2016|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)]]|date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"b_dk_22October2016\">{{cite news|title=Dronning Margrethe om integration: \"Det er ikke en naturlov, at man bliver dansker af at bo i Danmark\"|url=http://www.b.dk/politiko/dronning-margrethe-om-integration-det-er-ikke-en-naturlov-at-man-bliver-dans|accessdate=25 October 2016|newspaper=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and interests==\n\nThe official residences of the Queen are [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen and [[Fredensborg Palace]].

She sent them to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]] in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002.

Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance.

[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] has long been regarded as the archetypal [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], described by the Renaissance biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] as having qualities that \"transcended nature\" and being \"marvellously endowed with beauty, grace and talent in abundance\".<ref>Giorgio Vasari, ''Lives of the Artists'' p. 254</ref> Interest in and curiosity about Leonardo has continued unabated for five hundred years.<ref>Bortolon, Liana (1967). ''The Life and Times of Leonardo.'' London: Paul Hamlyn.</ref> Modern descriptions and analysis of Leonardo's character, personal desires and intimate behavior have been based upon various sources: records concerning him, his biographies, his own written journals, his paintings, his drawings, his associates, and commentaries that were made concerning him by contemporaries.\n\n==Biography==\nLeonardo was born on 15 April 1452, \"at the third hour of the night\"<ref>His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio, as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', and Reynal & Co., ''Leonardo da Vinci'' (William Morrow and Company, 1956): \"A grandson of mine was born April 15, Saturday, three hours into the night\". The date was recorded in the Julian calendar; as it was Florentine time and sunset was 6:40 pm, three hours after sunset would be sometime around 9:40 pm which was still April 14 by modern reckoning. The conversion to the New Style calendar adds nine days; hence Leonardo was born April 23 according to the modern calendar.</ref> in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] hill town of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the lower valley of the [[Arno River]] in the territory of the [[Republic of Florence]].   He was the [[out-of-wedlock]] son of the wealthy Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci, a Florentine [[Civil law notary|legal notary]], and an orphaned girl, Caterina di Meo Lippi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-05-26-identity-leonardo-da-vinci%E2%80%99s-mother-revealed-new-book |title=Identity of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s mother revealed in new book|publisher=University of Oxford |date=May 26, 2017 |website=ox.ac |access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref><ref name=AV>{{Cite book |first=Alessandro |last=Vezzosi |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Renaissance Man |series='[[New Horizons (Thames & Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series |location=London |publisher=Thames & Hudson |year=1997}}</ref><ref name=Chiesa83>{{Cite book |first=Angela Ottino |last=della Chiesa |title=The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci |year=1967 |page=83}}</ref>  His full birth name was \"Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci\", meaning \"Leonardo, (son) of (Mes)ser Piero from Vinci\".

His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera;<ref name=\"LB\">{{Cite book |first=Liana |last=Bortolon |title=The Life and Times of Leonardo |publisher=Paul Hamlyn |publication-place=London |year=1967}}</ref> Ser Piero married four times and produced children by his two later marriages.<ref>Rosci, p. 20.</ref>  Leonardo's seven brothers were later to argue with him over the distribution of his father's estate.\n\nAt the age of about fourteen Leonardo was apprenticed by his father to the artist [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. Leonardo was eventually to become a paid employee of Verrocchio's studio.  During his time there, Leonardo met many of the most important artists to work in Florence in the late fifteenth century including [[Botticelli]],  [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Pietro Perugino]]. Leonardo helped Verrocchio paint ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', completed around 1475. According to [[Vasari]], Verrocchio, on seeing the beauty of the angel that his young pupil had painted, never painted again.<ref name= Vasari/>\n\n[[Image:Tombe de L\u00e9onard de Vinci.JPG|thumb|180px|Burial place of Leonardo da Vinci, in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert, [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], France]]\nFlorence was at this time a [[Republic of Florence|Republic]], but the city was increasingly under the influence of a single powerful family, [[House of Medici|the Medici]], led by [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who came to be known as \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\".  In 1481 Leonardo commenced an important commission, the painting of a large altarpiece for the church of San Donato in Scopeto. The work was never completed.  Leonardo left Florence and travelled to Milan carrying a gift from Lorenzo to the regent ruler, [[Ludovico Sforza]].  He was employed by Ludovico from 1481 to 1499, during which time his most important works were the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'', the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'' and a huge model of a horse for an equestrian monument which was never completed. Other important events during this time were the arrival in his studio of the boy [[Sala\u00ec]] in 1490, and in 1491 the marriage of Ludovico Sforza to [[Beatrice d'Este]], for which he organized the celebrations. When Milan was invaded by the French in 1499, Leonardo left and spent some time in Venice, and possibly [[Rome]] and [[Naples]] before returning to Florence.<ref name= MK1>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo seen from the inside out'', Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}} pp. 255-274</ref>\n\nIn Florence, Leonardo lived at premises of the [[Servite Order|Servite Community]], and at that time drew the large [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]] for the ''Madonna and Child and St Anne'', which attracted a lot of popular attention. He is also reported to have had a job to do for King [[Louis XII of France]].<ref name=MK1/>  Between 1506 and 1513 Leonardo was once again based mostly in Milan. In 1507 [[Francesco Melzi]] joined his household as an apprentice, and remained with him until his death. In 1513 Leonardo left Milan for Rome and was employed by the Medici family. In 1516 he went to France as court painter to [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]].<ref name= MK1/>  The king gave the chateau of [[Clos Luc\u00e9]] as his home and regarded him with great esteem.  It is said that the king held Leonardo's head as he died. Leonardo is buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert adjacent to the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]] in France.\n\n==Character==\nLeonardo da Vinci was described by his early biographers as a man with great personal appeal, kindness, and generosity. He was generally well loved by his contemporaries. According to Vasari, \"Leonardo's disposition was so lovable that he commanded everyone's affection\". He was \"a sparkling conversationalist\" who charmed [[Ludovico Sforza]] with his wit. Vasari sums him up by saying:\n<blockquote>... his magnificent presence brought comfort to the most troubled soul; he was so persuasive that he could bend other people to his will. ... He was so generous that he fed all his friends, rich or poor... Through his birth Florence received a very great gift, and through his death it sustained an incalculable loss.</blockquote>\n\nVasari also says:\n<blockquote>In the normal course of events many men and women are born with various remarkable qualities and talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind... Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty who displayed infinite grace in everything he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied were solved with ease.</blockquote>\n\nWhile painting ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', Leonado wrote, \"Wine is good, but water is preferable at table. ... Small rooms or dwellings set the mind in the right path, large ones cause it to go astray. ... If you want money in abundance, you will end by not enjoying it.\" He also wrote, \"He who wishes to become rich in a day is hanged in a year.\"{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=168}}\n\nSome of Leonardo's philosophies can be found in a series of fables he wrote for the court of Ludovico Sforza. These were presented as jests (labelled 'prophecies') in which he told a riddle and made his audience guess the title.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=56}} Prevalent themes include the dangers of an inflated sense of self-worth, often as described in opposition to the benefits that one can gain through awareness, humility and endeavour. Leonardo also had a distinctive sense of humour, showing newfound friends a lizard he had decorated in scales, a horn and beard made from [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] to surprise them,{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=150}} and describing a practical joke in his ''[[Treatise on Painting]]'':\n<blockquote>If you want to make a fire which will set a hall in a blaze without injury, do this: first perfume the hall with a dense smoke of incense or some other odoriferous substance: it is a good trick to play. ... then go into the room suddenly with a lighted torch and at once it will be in a blaze.{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=72}}</blockquote>\n\n==Personal relationships==\nLittle is known about Leonardo's intimate relationships from his own writing.  Some evidence of Leonardo's personal relationships emerges both from historic records and from the writings of his many biographers.\n\n===Pupils===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| header_align = center\n| header = Leonardo's pupils\n| image1 = Leonardo Salai.JPG\n| width1 = 158\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Drawing by Leonardo of a young man presumed to be [[Sala\u00ec]]\n| image2 = Francesco melzi.jpg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ''Francesco Melzi'', by [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]], c.&nbsp;1510\n\n}}\nLeonardo maintained long-lasting relationships with two pupils who were apprenticed to him as children. These were [[Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno]], who entered his household in 1490 at the age of 10,<ref>{{cite book |title=Leonardo, the first scientist |last=White |first=Michael |year=2000 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=London |isbn=0-316-64846-9 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OmWWh2BqYkC&dq }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oreno.it | title = Oreno | location = IT | language = Italian}}</ref> and Count [[Francesco Melzi]], the son of a Milanese aristocrat who was apprenticed to Leonardo by his father in 1506, at the age of 14, remaining with him until his death.\n\nGian Giacomo was nicknamed ''Sala\u00ec'' or ''il Salaino'' meaning \"the little devil\". Vasari describes him as \"a graceful and beautiful youth with fine curly hair\". The \"Little Devil\" lived up to his nickname: a year after his entering the household Leonardo made a list of the boy\u2019s misdemeanours, calling him \"a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton\". But despite Sala\u00ec's thievery and general delinquency\u2014he made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions, spent a fortune on apparel, including twenty-four pairs of shoes, and eventually died in a duel\u2014he remained Leonardo's servant and assistant for thirty years. At Leonardo's death he was bequeathed the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', a valuable piece even then, valued in Sala\u00ec's own will at the equivalent of \u00a3200,000.\n\nMelzi accompanied Leonardo in his final days in [[France]]. On Leonardo's death he wrote a letter to inform Leonardo's brothers, describing him as \"like an excellent father to me\" and goes on to say: \"Everyone is grieved at the loss of such a man that Nature no longer has it in her power to produce.\"<ref name = Kemp>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo seen from the inside out'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref>\nMelzi subsequently played an important role as the guardian of Leonardo's notebooks, preparing them for publication in the form directed by the master. He was not to see this project fully realized, but gathered the ''[[Codex Urbinas]]''.\n\n===Sexuality===\nLittle is self-revealed about Leonardo's sexuality, as, although he left hundreds of pages of writing, very little of it is personal in nature. He left no letters, poetry or diary that indicate any romantic interest. He never married and it cannot be stated with certainty that he had a sexually intimate relationship with any person, male or female. One of the few references that Leonardo made to sexuality in his notebooks states: \"The act of procreation and anything that has any relation to it is so disgusting that human beings would soon die out if there were no pretty faces and sensuous dispositions.\"<ref>Sigmund Freud: ''Leonardo da Vinci'', translated by [[Abraham Brill]], 1916, [http://www.bartleby.com/277/1.html#txt12 chapter I. bartleby.com], after Edmondo Solmi: ''Leonardo da Vinci''.

The denunciation accused four people of [[sodomy|sodomizing]] Saltarelli: Leonardo da Vinci, a tailor named Baccino, Bartolomeo di Pasquino, and Leonardo Tornabuoni, a member of the aristocratic Tornabuoni family. Saltarelli's name was known to the authorities because another man had been convicted of sodomy with him earlier the same year.<ref>Crompton, p. 265</ref> Charges against the five were dismissed on the condition that no further accusations appear in the ''tamburo''. The same accusation did in fact appear on June 7, but charges were again dismissed.<ref>Wittkower and Wittkower, pp. 170\u201471</ref>  The charges were dismissed because the accusations did not meet the legal requirement for prosecution: all accusations of sodomy had to be signed, but this one was not. (Such accusations could be made secretly, but not anonymously.) There is speculation that since the family of one of the accused, Leonardo Tornabuoni, was associated with [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.<ref>Saslow, ''Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in Art and Society,'' 1986, p. 197.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bera/activities/globe/leonardo_da_vinci.htm |title='&#39;Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 How do we know Leonardo was gay?'&#39;, website |publisher=Bnl.gov |date=2001-05-03 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> Sodomy was theoretically an extremely serious offense, carrying the death penalty, but its very seriousness made it equally difficult to prove.

The particular drawing, showing an angel with an erect phallus, was rediscovered in a German collection in 1991.

When he began the study of arithmetic, he made, within a few months, such remarkable progress that he could baffle his master with the questions and problems that he raised... All the time, through all his other enterprises, Leonardo never ceased drawing...\"\n\n[[File:The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio & Leonardo).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio and Leonardo)|The Baptism of Christ]]'']]\nLeonardo's father, Ser Piero, realising that his son's talents were extraordinary, took some of his drawings to show his friend, [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], who ran one of the largest artists' workshops in Florence. Leonardo was accepted for apprenticeship and \"soon proved himself a first class geometrician\".  Vasari says that during his youth Leonardo made a number of clay heads of smiling women and children from which casts were still being made and sold by the workshop some 80 years later. Among his earliest significant known paintings are the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' in the Uffizi, the angel that he painted as a collaboration with Verrocchio in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio and Leonardo)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', and a small [[predella]] of the ''Annunciation'' to go beneath an altarpiece by [[Lorenzo di Credi]]. The little predella picture is probably the earliest.\n\nThe diversity of Leonardo's interests, remarked on by Vasari as apparent in his early childhood, was to express itself in his journals which record his scientific observations of nature, his meticulous dissection of corpses to understand anatomy, his experiments with machines for flying, for generating power from water and for besieging cities, his studies of geometry and his architectural plans, as well as personal memos and creative writing including fables.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Philosophy and religion===\nThere is not much firsthand information about Leonardo's religious inclination, but most historians have deemed him as a [[Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Zhu|Zhang|2016|p=227}} Leonardo was not a particularly devout man, but referred to [[God]] as a kind of supreme being. Leonardo could be described as a spiritual [[metaphysician]],{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=165}} who was interested in [[Greek philosophy]] such as that of [[Plato]]{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=103}} and [[Aristotle]]. He describes [[friar]]s as the \"fathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration\" and calls books such as the [[Bible]] \"supreme truth\",{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=118}} while also jesting that \"Many who hold the faith of the Son only build temples in the name of the Mother.\"{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=178}} He argues against the [[Flood myth|myth of a universal flood]] (as in the story of [[Noah]]), doubting that so much water could have evaporated away from the Earth.{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|pp=136\u2013138}} In an early example of [[ichnology]], he explains that the fossils of marine shells would have been scattered in such a deluge, and not gathered in groups, which were in fact left at various times on mountains in [[Lombardy]].{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|pp=142\u2013148}} He discredits [[pagan mythology]] as well, saying that gods the size of planets would appear as mere specks of light in the universe\u2014also calling these personifications \"mortal ... putrid and corrupt in their sepulchers.\"{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=126}}\n\n===R\u00e9sum\u00e9===\nLeonardo sent the following letter to [[Ludovico Sforza]], the ruler of Milan, in 1482:\n\n{{quote |Most Illustrious Lord: Having now sufficiently seen and considered the proofs of all those who count themselves masters and inventors in the instruments of war, and finding that their invention and use does not differ in any respect from those in common practice, I am emboldened... to put myself in communication with your Excellency, in order to acquaint you with my secrets.  I can construct bridges which are very light and strong and very portable with which to pursue and defeat an enemy...  I can also make a kind of cannon, which is light and easy of transport, with which to hurl small stones like hail... I can noiselessly construct to any prescribed point subterranean passages \u2014 either straight or winding \u2014 passing if necessary under trenches or a river...  I can make armored wagons carrying artillery, which can break through the most serried ranks of the enemy. In time of peace, I believe I can give you as complete satisfaction as anyone else in the construction of buildings, both public and private, and in conducting water from one place to another. I can execute sculpture in bronze, marble or clay. Also, in painting, I can do as much as anyone, whoever he may be.

In about 1479 he created a lyre in the shape of a horse's head, which was made \"mostly of silver\", and of \"sonorous and resonant\" tone. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] saw this lyre and wishing to better his relationship with Ludovico Sforza, the usurping Duke of Milan, he sent Leonardo to present this lyre to the Duke as a gift. Leonardo's musical performances so far surpassed those of Ludovico's court musicians that the Duke was delighted.\n<!--- ====Theatrical designer==== needs research --->\n<!--- ====Fastidiousness==== needs research --->\n\n===Love of nature===\nLeonardo always loved nature. One of the reasons was because of his childhood environment. Near his childhood house were mountains, trees, and rivers. There were also many animals. This environment gave him the perfect chance to study the surrounding area; it also may have encouraged him to have interest in painting.<!---This section was contributed by one of our younger editors, and has been only slightly modified.---> Later in life he recalls his exploration of an ominous cavern in the mountains as formative.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n===Vegetarianism===\nLeonardo's love of animals has been documented both in contemporary accounts as recorded in early biographies, and in his notebooks.  Remarkably for the period, he even questioned the morality of eating animals when it was not necessary for health. Statements from his notebook and a comment by a contemporary have led to the widely held view that he was [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Additionally, he categorized humans as being in the same set of species as apes and monkeys, just as he did with other animals in their respective genus.{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|pp=115\u2013116}} He also dissected dead animals for the purpose of [[comparative anatomy]].{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=121}}\n\nEdward MacCurdy (one of the two translators and compilers of Leonardo's notebooks into English) wrote:\n\n{{quote |...The mere idea of permitting the existence of unnecessary suffering, still more that of taking life, was abhorrent to him.

While most men were shaven or wore close-cropped beards, Leonardo's beard flowed over his chest.\n\nHis clothing is described as being unusual in his choice of bright colours, and at a time when most mature men wore long garments, Leonardo's preferred outfit was the short tunic and [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] generally worn by younger men.  This image of Leonardo has been recreated in the statue of him that stands outside the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]].\n\nAccording to Vasari, Leonardo possessed \"great strength and dexterity\", being \"physically so strong that he could withstand violence and with his right hand he could bend the ring of an iron door knocker or a horseshoe as if they were lead\". He was \"striking and handsome\" and \"marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace [and] outstanding physical beauty\", and \"displayed infinite grace in everything he did\". \n\nAuthor Simon Hewitt claims that a figure in the ''Sforzida'' manuscript depicts a youthful Leonardo and that the figure in the illustration has red hair.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorpe |first=Vanessa |title=Italians laughed at Leonardo da Vinci, the ginger genius |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/29/ginger-genius-why-they-laughed-at-odd-leonardo |website=The Observer |accessdate=October 1, 2019 |date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Portraits===\n{{main|Portraits of Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_presumed_self-portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk]]'']]\nLeonardo's face is best known from a [[Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk|drawing in red chalk]] that appears to be a [[self-portrait]]. However, there is some controversy over the identity of the subject, because the man represented appears to be of a greater age than the 67 years lived by Leonardo.

''The Life and Times of Leonardo.'' London: Paul Hamlyn.</ref> Modern descriptions and analysis of Leonardo's character, personal desires and intimate behavior have been based upon various sources: records concerning him, his biographies, his own written journals, his paintings, his drawings, his associates, and commentaries that were made concerning him by contemporaries.\n\n==Biography==\nLeonardo was born on 15 April 1452, \"at the third hour of the night\"<ref>His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio, as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', and Reynal & Co., ''Leonardo da Vinci'' (William Morrow and Company, 1956): \"A grandson of mine was born April 15, Saturday, three hours into the night\". The date was recorded in the Julian calendar; as it was Florentine time and sunset was 6:40 pm, three hours after sunset would be sometime around 9:40 pm which was still April 14 by modern reckoning. The conversion to the New Style calendar adds nine days; hence Leonardo was born April 23 according to the modern calendar.</ref> in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] hill town of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the lower valley of the [[Arno River]] in the territory of the [[Republic of Florence]].

His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera;<ref name=\"LB\">{{Cite book |first=Liana |last=Bortolon |title=The Life and Times of Leonardo |publisher=Paul Hamlyn |publication-place=London |year=1967}}</ref> Ser Piero married four times and produced children by his two later marriages.<ref>Rosci, p. 20.</ref>  Leonardo's seven brothers were later to argue with him over the distribution of his father's estate.\n\nAt the age of about fourteen Leonardo was apprenticed by his father to the artist [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. Leonardo was eventually to become a paid employee of Verrocchio's studio.  During his time there, Leonardo met many of the most important artists to work in Florence in the late fifteenth century including [[Botticelli]],  [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Pietro Perugino]]. Leonardo helped Verrocchio paint ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', completed around 1475. According to [[Vasari]], Verrocchio, on seeing the beauty of the angel that his young pupil had painted, never painted again.<ref name= Vasari/>\n\n[[Image:Tombe de L\u00e9onard de Vinci.JPG|thumb|180px|Burial place of Leonardo da Vinci, in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert, [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], France]]\nFlorence was at this time a [[Republic of Florence|Republic]], but the city was increasingly under the influence of a single powerful family, [[House of Medici|the Medici]], led by [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], who came to be known as \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\".  In 1481 Leonardo commenced an important commission, the painting of a large altarpiece for the church of San Donato in Scopeto. The work was never completed.  Leonardo left Florence and travelled to Milan carrying a gift from Lorenzo to the regent ruler, [[Ludovico Sforza]].  He was employed by Ludovico from 1481 to 1499, during which time his most important works were the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'', the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'' and a huge model of a horse for an equestrian monument which was never completed. Other important events during this time were the arrival in his studio of the boy [[Sala\u00ec]] in 1490, and in 1491 the marriage of Ludovico Sforza to [[Beatrice d'Este]], for which he organized the celebrations. When Milan was invaded by the French in 1499, Leonardo left and spent some time in Venice, and possibly [[Rome]] and [[Naples]] before returning to Florence.<ref name= MK1>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo seen from the inside out'', Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}} pp. 255-274</ref>\n\nIn Florence, Leonardo lived at premises of the [[Servite Order|Servite Community]], and at that time drew the large [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]] for the ''Madonna and Child and St Anne'', which attracted a lot of popular attention. He is also reported to have had a job to do for King [[Louis XII of France]].<ref name=MK1/>  Between 1506 and 1513 Leonardo was once again based mostly in Milan. In 1507 [[Francesco Melzi]] joined his household as an apprentice, and remained with him until his death. In 1513 Leonardo left Milan for Rome and was employed by the Medici family. In 1516 he went to France as court painter to [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]].<ref name= MK1/>  The king gave the chateau of [[Clos Luc\u00e9]] as his home and regarded him with great esteem.  It is said that the king held Leonardo's head as he died. Leonardo is buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert adjacent to the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]] in France.\n\n==Character==\nLeonardo da Vinci was described by his early biographers as a man with great personal appeal, kindness, and generosity. He was generally well loved by his contemporaries. According to Vasari, \"Leonardo's disposition was so lovable that he commanded everyone's affection\". He was \"a sparkling conversationalist\" who charmed [[Ludovico Sforza]] with his wit. Vasari sums him up by saying:\n<blockquote>... his magnificent presence brought comfort to the most troubled soul; he was so persuasive that he could bend other people to his will. ... He was so generous that he fed all his friends, rich or poor... Through his birth Florence received a very great gift, and through his death it sustained an incalculable loss.</blockquote>\n\nVasari also says:\n<blockquote>In the normal course of events many men and women are born with various remarkable qualities and talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind... Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty who displayed infinite grace in everything he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied were solved with ease.</blockquote>\n\nWhile painting ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', Leonado wrote, \"Wine is good, but water is preferable at table. ... Small rooms or dwellings set the mind in the right path, large ones cause it to go astray. ... If you want money in abundance, you will end by not enjoying it.\" He also wrote, \"He who wishes to become rich in a day is hanged in a year.\"{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=168}}\n\nSome of Leonardo's philosophies can be found in a series of fables he wrote for the court of Ludovico Sforza. These were presented as jests (labelled 'prophecies') in which he told a riddle and made his audience guess the title.{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=56}} Prevalent themes include the dangers of an inflated sense of self-worth, often as described in opposition to the benefits that one can gain through awareness, humility and endeavour. Leonardo also had a distinctive sense of humour, showing newfound friends a lizard he had decorated in scales, a horn and beard made from [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] to surprise them,{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=150}} and describing a practical joke in his ''[[Treatise on Painting]]'':\n<blockquote>If you want to make a fire which will set a hall in a blaze without injury, do this: first perfume the hall with a dense smoke of incense or some other odoriferous substance: it is a good trick to play. ... then go into the room suddenly with a lighted torch and at once it will be in a blaze.{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=72}}</blockquote>\n\n==Personal relationships==\nLittle is known about Leonardo's intimate relationships from his own writing.  Some evidence of Leonardo's personal relationships emerges both from historic records and from the writings of his many biographers.\n\n===Pupils===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| header_align = center\n| header = Leonardo's pupils\n| image1 = Leonardo Salai.JPG\n| width1 = 158\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Drawing by Leonardo of a young man presumed to be [[Sala\u00ec]]\n| image2 = Francesco melzi.jpg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ''Francesco Melzi'', by [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]], c.&nbsp;1510\n\n}}\nLeonardo maintained long-lasting relationships with two pupils who were apprenticed to him as children. These were [[Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno]], who entered his household in 1490 at the age of 10,<ref>{{cite book |title=Leonardo, the first scientist |last=White |first=Michael |year=2000 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=London |isbn=0-316-64846-9 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OmWWh2BqYkC&dq }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oreno.it | title = Oreno | location = IT | language = Italian}}</ref> and Count [[Francesco Melzi]], the son of a Milanese aristocrat who was apprenticed to Leonardo by his father in 1506, at the age of 14, remaining with him until his death.\n\nGian Giacomo was nicknamed ''Sala\u00ec'' or ''il Salaino'' meaning \"the little devil\". Vasari describes him as \"a graceful and beautiful youth with fine curly hair\". The \"Little Devil\" lived up to his nickname: a year after his entering the household Leonardo made a list of the boy\u2019s misdemeanours, calling him \"a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton\". But despite Sala\u00ec's thievery and general delinquency\u2014he made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions, spent a fortune on apparel, including twenty-four pairs of shoes, and eventually died in a duel\u2014he remained Leonardo's servant and assistant for thirty years. At Leonardo's death he was bequeathed the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', a valuable piece even then, valued in Sala\u00ec's own will at the equivalent of \u00a3200,000.\n\nMelzi accompanied Leonardo in his final days in [[France]]. On Leonardo's death he wrote a letter to inform Leonardo's brothers, describing him as \"like an excellent father to me\" and goes on to say: \"Everyone is grieved at the loss of such a man that Nature no longer has it in her power to produce.\"<ref name = Kemp>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo seen from the inside out'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref>\nMelzi subsequently played an important role as the guardian of Leonardo's notebooks, preparing them for publication in the form directed by the master. He was not to see this project fully realized, but gathered the ''[[Codex Urbinas]]''.\n\n===Sexuality===\nLittle is self-revealed about Leonardo's sexuality, as, although he left hundreds of pages of writing, very little of it is personal in nature. He left no letters, poetry or diary that indicate any romantic interest. He never married and it cannot be stated with certainty that he had a sexually intimate relationship with any person, male or female. One of the few references that Leonardo made to sexuality in his notebooks states: \"The act of procreation and anything that has any relation to it is so disgusting that human beings would soon die out if there were no pretty faces and sensuous dispositions.\"<ref>Sigmund Freud: ''Leonardo da Vinci'', translated by [[Abraham Brill]], 1916, [http://www.bartleby.com/277/1.html#txt12 chapter I. bartleby.com], after Edmondo Solmi: ''Leonardo da Vinci''.

The denunciation accused four people of [[sodomy|sodomizing]] Saltarelli: Leonardo da Vinci, a tailor named Baccino, Bartolomeo di Pasquino, and Leonardo Tornabuoni, a member of the aristocratic Tornabuoni family. Saltarelli's name was known to the authorities because another man had been convicted of sodomy with him earlier the same year.<ref>Crompton, p. 265</ref> Charges against the five were dismissed on the condition that no further accusations appear in the ''tamburo''. The same accusation did in fact appear on June 7, but charges were again dismissed.<ref>Wittkower and Wittkower, pp. 170\u201471</ref>  The charges were dismissed because the accusations did not meet the legal requirement for prosecution: all accusations of sodomy had to be signed, but this one was not.

When he began the study of arithmetic, he made, within a few months, such remarkable progress that he could baffle his master with the questions and problems that he raised... All the time, through all his other enterprises, Leonardo never ceased drawing...\"\n\n[[File:The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio & Leonardo).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio and Leonardo)|The Baptism of Christ]]'']]\nLeonardo's father, Ser Piero, realising that his son's talents were extraordinary, took some of his drawings to show his friend, [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], who ran one of the largest artists' workshops in Florence. Leonardo was accepted for apprenticeship and \"soon proved himself a first class geometrician\".  Vasari says that during his youth Leonardo made a number of clay heads of smiling women and children from which casts were still being made and sold by the workshop some 80 years later. Among his earliest significant known paintings are the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' in the Uffizi, the angel that he painted as a collaboration with Verrocchio in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio and Leonardo)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', and a small [[predella]] of the ''Annunciation'' to go beneath an altarpiece by [[Lorenzo di Credi]]. The little predella picture is probably the earliest.\n\nThe diversity of Leonardo's interests, remarked on by Vasari as apparent in his early childhood, was to express itself in his journals which record his scientific observations of nature, his meticulous dissection of corpses to understand anatomy, his experiments with machines for flying, for generating power from water and for besieging cities, his studies of geometry and his architectural plans, as well as personal memos and creative writing including fables.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Philosophy and religion===\nThere is not much firsthand information about Leonardo's religious inclination, but most historians have deemed him as a [[Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Zhu|Zhang|2016|p=227}} Leonardo was not a particularly devout man, but referred to [[God]] as a kind of supreme being. Leonardo could be described as a spiritual [[metaphysician]],{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=165}} who was interested in [[Greek philosophy]] such as that of [[Plato]]{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=103}} and [[Aristotle]]. He describes [[friar]]s as the \"fathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration\" and calls books such as the [[Bible]] \"supreme truth\",{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=118}} while also jesting that \"Many who hold the faith of the Son only build temples in the name of the Mother.\"{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=178}} He argues against the [[Flood myth|myth of a universal flood]] (as in the story of [[Noah]]), doubting that so much water could have evaporated away from the Earth.{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|pp=136\u2013138}} In an early example of [[ichnology]], he explains that the fossils of marine shells would have been scattered in such a deluge, and not gathered in groups, which were in fact left at various times on mountains in [[Lombardy]].{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|pp=142\u2013148}} He discredits [[pagan mythology]] as well, saying that gods the size of planets would appear as mere specks of light in the universe\u2014also calling these personifications \"mortal ... putrid and corrupt in their sepulchers.\"{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=126}}\n\n===R\u00e9sum\u00e9===\nLeonardo sent the following letter to [[Ludovico Sforza]], the ruler of Milan, in 1482:\n\n{{quote |Most Illustrious Lord: Having now sufficiently seen and considered the proofs of all those who count themselves masters and inventors in the instruments of war, and finding that their invention and use does not differ in any respect from those in common practice, I am emboldened... to put myself in communication with your Excellency, in order to acquaint you with my secrets.  I can construct bridges which are very light and strong and very portable with which to pursue and defeat an enemy...  I can also make a kind of cannon, which is light and easy of transport, with which to hurl small stones like hail... I can noiselessly construct to any prescribed point subterranean passages \u2014 either straight or winding \u2014 passing if necessary under trenches or a river...  I can make armored wagons carrying artillery, which can break through the most serried ranks of the enemy. In time of peace, I believe I can give you as complete satisfaction as anyone else in the construction of buildings, both public and private, and in conducting water from one place to another. I can execute sculpture in bronze, marble or clay. Also, in painting, I can do as much as anyone, whoever he may be.

In about 1479 he created a lyre in the shape of a horse's head, which was made \"mostly of silver\", and of \"sonorous and resonant\" tone. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] saw this lyre and wishing to better his relationship with Ludovico Sforza, the usurping Duke of Milan, he sent Leonardo to present this lyre to the Duke as a gift. Leonardo's musical performances so far surpassed those of Ludovico's court musicians that the Duke was delighted.\n<!--- ====Theatrical designer==== needs research --->\n<!--- ====Fastidiousness==== needs research --->\n\n===Love of nature===\nLeonardo always loved nature. One of the reasons was because of his childhood environment. Near his childhood house were mountains, trees, and rivers. There were also many animals. This environment gave him the perfect chance to study the surrounding area; it also may have encouraged him to have interest in painting.<!---This section was contributed by one of our younger editors, and has been only slightly modified.---> Later in life he recalls his exploration of an ominous cavern in the mountains as formative.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n===Vegetarianism===\nLeonardo's love of animals has been documented both in contemporary accounts as recorded in early biographies, and in his notebooks.  Remarkably for the period, he even questioned the morality of eating animals when it was not necessary for health. Statements from his notebook and a comment by a contemporary have led to the widely held view that he was [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Additionally, he categorized humans as being in the same set of species as apes and monkeys, just as he did with other animals in their respective genus.{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|pp=115\u2013116}} He also dissected dead animals for the purpose of [[comparative anatomy]].{{sfn|Da Vinci|1971|p=121}}\n\nEdward MacCurdy (one of the two translators and compilers of Leonardo's notebooks into English) wrote:\n\n{{quote |...The mere idea of permitting the existence of unnecessary suffering, still more that of taking life, was abhorrent to him. [[Vasari]] tells, as an instance of his love of animals, how when in Florence he passed places where birds were sold he would frequently take them from their cages with his own hand, and having paid the sellers the price that was asked would let them fly away in the air, thus giving them back their liberty.\n\nThat this horror of inflicting pain was such as to lead him to be a vegetarian is to be inferred from a reference which occurs in a letter sent by [[Andrea Corsali]] to [[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici]], in which, after telling him of an Indian race called [[Gujarati people|Gujerats]], who neither eat anything that contains blood nor permit any injury to any living creature, he adds \"like our Leonardo da Vinci\".<ref>Edward MacCurdy, ''The Mind of Leonardo da Vinci'' (1928) in [http://www.ivu.org/history/davinci/hurwitz.html Leonardo da Vinci's Ethical Vegetarianism]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |first=Jean Paul |last=Richter |title=The Literary Works of Leonardo da Vinci |edition=3rd |year=1970 |origyear=1883 }}, gives the passage in Italian as \"Alcuni gentili chiamati Guzzarati non si cibano di cosa alcuna che teng consentono che si noccia ad alcuna cosa animata, come il nostro Leonardo da Vinci.\"</ref>}}\n\nLeonardo wrote the following in his notebooks, which were not deciphered and made available for reading until the 19th century:\n\n{{quote |If you are as you have described yourself the king of the animals \u2013 it would be better for you to call yourself king of the beasts since you are the greatest of them all! \u2013 why do you not help them so that they may presently be able to give you their young in order to gratify your palate, for the sake of which you have tried to make yourself a tomb for all the animals?

He did work on fortifications, however. In his own words:\n\n{{quote|When besieged by ambitious tyrants I find a means of offence and defense in order to preserve the chief gift of nature, which is liberty; and first I would speak of the position of the walls, and then of how the various peoples can maintain their good and just lords.<ref name=\"Edward MacCurdy 1956\"/>}}\n\nHe referred to war as ''pazzia bestialissima'', the \"most bestial madness\".<ref name=\"Robert Payne, Leonardo 1978\"/>\n\n{{Quote|And thou, man, who by these labours dost look upon the marvelous works of nature, if thou judgest it to be an atrocious act to destroy the same, reflect that it is an infinitely atrocious act to take away the life of man.<ref name=\"Edward MacCurdy 1956\"/>}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci statue outside the Uffizi Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Leonardo outside the [[Uffizi]] Gallery in Florence, based upon contemporary descriptions]]\n\nDescriptions and portraits of Leonardo combine to create an image of a man who was tall for his time and place, athletic and extremely handsome.

Heaton]] (1874), ''Leonardo da Vinci and his works'', Kessinger Publishing, Whitefish, MT, 2004, p. 204: \"The skeleton, which measured five feet eight inches, accords with the height of Leonardo da Vinci. The skull might have served for the model of the portrait Leonardo drew of himself in red chalk a few years before his death. M. Robert Fleury, head master of the Fine Art School at Rome, has handled the skull with respect, and recognized in it the grand and simple outline of this human yet divine head, which once held a world within its limits.\"</ref> However, the remains, which were attributed to Leonardo due to the unusually large skull and accompanying stone fragments inscribed \"EO [...] DUS VINC\", have not yet been positively identified.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/05/05/leonardo-da-vinci-paintings-analysed-for-dna-to-solve-grave-myst/</ref> Portraits indicate that as an older man, he wore his hair long, at a time when most men wore it cropped short, or reaching to the shoulders.  While most men were shaven or wore close-cropped beards, Leonardo's beard flowed over his chest.\n\nHis clothing is described as being unusual in his choice of bright colours, and at a time when most mature men wore long garments, Leonardo's preferred outfit was the short tunic and [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] generally worn by younger men.  This image of Leonardo has been recreated in the statue of him that stands outside the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]].\n\nAccording to Vasari, Leonardo possessed \"great strength and dexterity\", being \"physically so strong that he could withstand violence and with his right hand he could bend the ring of an iron door knocker or a horseshoe as if they were lead\". He was \"striking and handsome\" and \"marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace [and] outstanding physical beauty\", and \"displayed infinite grace in everything he did\". \n\nAuthor Simon Hewitt claims that a figure in the ''Sforzida'' manuscript depicts a youthful Leonardo and that the figure in the illustration has red hair.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorpe |first=Vanessa |title=Italians laughed at Leonardo da Vinci, the ginger genius |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/29/ginger-genius-why-they-laughed-at-odd-leonardo |website=The Observer |accessdate=October 1, 2019 |date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Portraits===\n{{main|Portraits of Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_presumed_self-portrait_-_WGA12798.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk]]'']]\nLeonardo's face is best known from a [[Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk|drawing in red chalk]] that appears to be a [[self-portrait]]. However, there is some controversy over the identity of the subject, because the man represented appears to be of a greater age than the 67 years lived by Leonardo. A solution which has been put forward is that Leonardo deliberately aged himself in the drawing, as a modern [[forensic artist]] might do, in order to provide a model for [[Raphael]]'s painting of him as Plato in ''[[The School of Athens]]''.\nA profile portrait in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan is generally accepted to be a portrait of Leonardo, and also depicts him with flowing beard and long hair.
