Being the largest ethnic group, the Javanese culture and people influence Indonesian politics and culture, a process sometimes described as [[Javanization]].\n\n==Literature==\n[[File:Wayang Pandawa.jpg|thumb|The five Pandawa brothers from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, narrated in the Javanese Wayang kulit.]]\n{{main article|Javanese literature|Javanese poetry}}\n[[Javanese literature]] tradition is among the earliest and the oldest surviving literature traditions in Indonesia. The translations of Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into [[old Javanese]] language took place during the era of [[Medang Kingdom]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]] around 9th to 11th century. The [[Smaradhana]] is also composed during Kediri kingdom, and it became the prelude of later [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]] that spread as far as Siam and Cambodia. Other literary works include, ''[[Ken Arok]] and [[Ken Dedes]]'', based upon [[Pararaton]], the story of the orphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese kingdom.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Majapahit]] several notable works was produced. [[Nagarakretagama]] describes [[Majapahit]] during its height. [[Tantu Pagelaran]] dated from Majapahit period explained the mythical origin of the island and its volcanic nature. [[Kakawin Sutasoma]], written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the [[Majapahit]]. It is the source of the [[motto]] of [[Indonesia]], [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]], which is usually translated as ''Unity in Diversity'', although literally it means '(Although) in pieces, yet One'.

Although ''Kebatinan'' is not strictly a religious affiliation, it addresses ethical and spiritual values as inspired by Javanese tradition. It is not a religion in usual sense of the word, like [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], or [[Christianity]]. There are no scriptures such as the [[Bible]] or the [[Qur'an]], nor are there prophets. During the Soeharto era, this minority is acknowledged and protected as \"penganut kepercayaan\".\n\n==Ceremonies==\nMany traditional Javanese customs or festivals such as meditation, [[slametan]], [[Naloni Mitoni|naloni mitoni]], patangpuluhdinanan, nyatus, nyewu have their roots in the ''[[kebatinan]]'' belief. Javanese of other beliefs modify them accordingly, incorporating Muslims, Christian or Hindu prayers instead. Details of the ceremonies differ from one community to the other.\n\n===Grebeg Maulud===\n[[File:Grebeg Maulud of Keraton Surakarta.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sekaten|Grebeg Maulud]] at Surakarta]]\n\n[[Sekaten|Grebeg Maulud]] is a traditional ceremony held by the royal court of Keraton Surakarta and Jogjakarta, to commemorate the birth of Islam's holy messenger, Muhammad. This ceremony was first held during the reign of the Demak Dynasty dating back to the 15th century. The ceremony starts with prayers in the grand mosques, a parade and a carnival of the people.\n\n===Javanese wedding===\nThere are several variations of Javanese wedding, depending on the custom and social standing of the couple. Popular variation includes Surakartan, Jogjakarta, Paes Kesatrian, and Paes Ageng. The wedding rituals will include Siraman, Midodareni, Peningsetan, Ijab (for Muslims) or wedding sacrament (for Christians).\n\n====Siraman====\nThe bride and groom to be are showered at their respective homes, by families and close friends. Prayers are also given hoping for a good tide.\n\n====Midodareni====\nA night before a Javanese wedding, the bride-to-be has her last dinner with her family, female friends are also invited. Traditional cuisine and prayers are given. Later, the groom's family will also come, bringing Peningsets (offerings to the bride family to seal the tomorrows wedding) in which the bride-to-be is hidden in her room. Only the female relatives of the groom can visit the bride-to-be.\n\n===Naloni Mitoni===\nHeld for the first pregnancy of a woman, when the pregnancy is in its seventh month. Family and close friends are invited. The mother-to-be is shrouded with seven layers of batik, symbolizing hope for a good child and delivery. Prayers and traditional food are also served.\n\n===Selapanan===\nHeld when a child is 35 days, a ritual celebrating the new life. Family members and close friends will come to the event. The child's hair and nails are shaved. prayers, religious readings and a slametan is a common part of the event. After the event, cakes, sweets and eggs (symbolising the new life) will be shared.\n\n===Tedhak Sithen===\nHeld when a child is around eight months old. Family members are invited, to celebrate a child starts walking.\n\n===Khitan===\nFor a boy, khitan, or [[circumcision]], is an important transition toward adulthood. The ritual usually held when the boy is 6 to 12 years old. Following the circumcision it is customary to sacrifice a goat, hold a slametan and [[wayang kulit]] (shadow puppet) performance.<ref name=village>{{Cite book\n | last = Koentjaraningrat\n | authorlink=Koentjaraningrat\n | title = Villages in Indonesia\n | publisher = Equinox Publishing\n | year = 2007\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ukkMK8rVtscC\n | isbn = 978-979-378051-1\n | id = {{ISBN|979-3780-51-7}} }}</ref> Circumcision is one factor that differentiate the Javanese with related [[balinese people|Balinese]] and [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]], which still predominantly Hindu.\n\n===Ruwatan Gembel===\nThe day Hindu children of the Dieng community shave their hair.

According to him, the Santri followed an orthodox interpretation [[Islam]], the abangan was the followed a syncretic form of Islam that mixed Hindu and animist elements (often termed ''[[Kejawen]]''), and the priyayi was the nobility.<ref>{{cite book  | last = McDonald  | first = Hamish  | title = Suharto's Indonesia  | publisher = Fontana  | year = 1980  | location = Melbourne  | pages = 9\u201310  | isbn = 0-00-635721-0}}</ref>\n\nBut today the Geertz opinion is often opposed because he mixed the social groups with belief groups. It was also difficult to apply this social categorisation in classing outsiders, for example other non-[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Indonesians such as persons of [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]], [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] and [[India]]n descent.\n\nSocial stratification is much less rigid in northern coast area, which is much more egalitarian.\n\n===Sultans===\nThe Keratons, the royal palaces of the '''[[Yogyakarta Sultanate]]''' and the '''[[Surakarta Sunanate]]''', are the central of the Javanese culture and social events. Although they are not ruling monarchs, they are still highly revered and look upon in the society. When addressing to the Sultan, a person is expected to speak in the refined \"kromo inggil\", but today formal bahasa Indonesia is also accepted.\n\nNot all Javanese were once subjects of the Yogyakarta Sultanate and the Surakarta Sunanate.\n\n===Priyayi===\nThe [[Priyayi]]s were once part of the ruling aristocrats, they have little function today. Some of Indonesia's ruling political figures are descendants of the priyayis. They are now part of the general society and work in numerous fields.\n\n===Villages===\nVillages are an important administrative unit in Java. It is divided into two types: ''Desa'' with [[election|elective leadership]], usually in rural areas, and ''Kelurahan'', where the leadership is appointed by Indonesian government, usually in urban areas. Village administration is managed by officers, still called with their traditional Javanese names. These are ''lurah'' (village chief), assisted by offices of ''carik'' (village secretary), ''kamituwa'' (officer for social affairs), ''jagabaya'' (officer for security), and ''modin'' (office for [[Islam]]ic affairs and rituals, derived from Arabic [[Imam]] [[ad-Din]], or leader of the faith).<ref name=hans>{{Cite book\n | last = Antl\u00f6v\n | first = Hans\n |author2=Sven Cederroth\n | title = Leadership on Java: gentle hints, authoritarian rule\n | publisher = Routledge\n | year = 1994\n | pages = 108\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6LyHdHQOMC8C&pg=PA108\n | isbn = 978-0-7007-0295-4\n | id = {{ISBN|0-7007-0295-4}} }}</ref>\n\nThese officers traditionally didn't get paid in cash, but allotted a portion in the village's public land to be farmed, called ''tanah bengkok''.<ref name=hans /> In modern-day Indonesia, Village chief is elected directly by [[universal suffrage]] of the villagers, who are 17 years old and above, or already married.<ref>{{Cite web\n | last = \n | first = \n | title = Proses Pemilihan Kepala Desa Dalam Rangka Pelaksanaan Democracy\n | work = \n | publisher = \n | url = http://digilib.itb.ac.id/gdl.php?mod=browse&op=read&id=jiptumm-gdl-s1-2002-anny-4890-demokrasi\n | accessdate = }}</ref> As literacy rate was low before independence, it is customary for the rival candidates to use common items as their campaign symbol, such as fruits, vegetables or traditional foods.

Prior to the wedding, the groom's family will give the bride's family a dowry. Afterwards, the bride's family is responsible for paying for the wedding. The groom's family can help financially, but they are not obliged to do so. Traditionally, divorce is not acceptable, but it was acceptable for the husband to take a second wife or a mistress. Young Javanese normally do not follow these customs, and today most Javanese women will resist infidelity and opt for a divorce.

This is still in use today and superimposed with 7-day week of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and [[Islamic calendar]] to become what is known as the 35-day [[Javanese calendar#Wetonan cycle|Wetonan cycle]].\n\n==Art==\nJavanese origin artforms are among the best known in [[Indonesia]] and the whole archipelago. The famous Javanese [[wayang]] puppetry culture was influenced by Hindu and Buddhist traditions. The Wayang repertoire stories, lakon, are mostly based on epics from India; [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. These epics and stories influenced wayang puppetry as well as Javanese classical dances. The influences from [[Islam]] and the [[Western world]] also can be found. The art of [[batik]], and [[kris]] dagger are of Javanese origin.\n\n===Music===\n{{main article|Music of Java}}\n\n[[Gamelan]] musical ensembles are found in both [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Bali]].

It was also difficult to apply this social categorisation in classing outsiders, for example other non-[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Indonesians such as persons of [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]], [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] and [[India]]n descent.\n\nSocial stratification is much less rigid in northern coast area, which is much more egalitarian.\n\n===Sultans===\nThe Keratons, the royal palaces of the '''[[Yogyakarta Sultanate]]''' and the '''[[Surakarta Sunanate]]''', are the central of the Javanese culture and social events. Although they are not ruling monarchs, they are still highly revered and look upon in the society. When addressing to the Sultan, a person is expected to speak in the refined \"kromo inggil\", but today formal bahasa Indonesia is also accepted.\n\nNot all Javanese were once subjects of the Yogyakarta Sultanate and the Surakarta Sunanate.\n\n===Priyayi===\nThe [[Priyayi]]s were once part of the ruling aristocrats, they have little function today. Some of Indonesia's ruling political figures are descendants of the priyayis. They are now part of the general society and work in numerous fields.\n\n===Villages===\nVillages are an important administrative unit in Java.

Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of Indonesia while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding relevant [[Islamic holidays]]. Javanese calendar presently used mostly for cultural events (such as [[Satu Sura]]). The present Javanese calendar system is a lunar calendar adopted by [[Sultan Agung]] in 1633, based on the Islamic calendar. Previously, Javanese people used a solar system based on the [[Hindu calendar]].\n\nUnlike many other calendars, the Javanese calendar uses a 5-day week known as the ''[[Javanese calendar#Five-day week (Pasaran)|Pasaran]]'' cycle. This is still in use today and superimposed with 7-day week of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and [[Islamic calendar]] to become what is known as the 35-day [[Javanese calendar#Wetonan cycle|Wetonan cycle]].\n\n==Art==\nJavanese origin artforms are among the best known in [[Indonesia]] and the whole archipelago. The famous Javanese [[wayang]] puppetry culture was influenced by Hindu and Buddhist traditions. The Wayang repertoire stories, lakon, are mostly based on epics from India; [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. These epics and stories influenced wayang puppetry as well as Javanese classical dances. The influences from [[Islam]] and the [[Western world]] also can be found. The art of [[batik]], and [[kris]] dagger are of Javanese origin.\n\n===Music===\n{{main article|Music of Java}}\n\n[[Gamelan]] musical ensembles are found in both [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Bali]].

Many have just a single name. For example, [[Sukarno]] or [[Suharto]]. Javanese names may come from traditional Javanese languages, many of which are derived from [[Sanskrit]]. Names with the prefix ''Su-'',which means ''good'', are very popular. After the advent of Islam, many Javanese began to use [[Arabic]] names, especially coast populations, where Islamic influences are stronger. Commoners usually only have one-word names, while nobilities use two-or-more-word names, but rarely a surname. Due to the influence of other cultures, many people started using names from other languages, mainly [[European languages]]. [[Christians|Christian]] Javanese usually use [[Latin]] [[baptism]] names followed by a traditional Javanese name.\n\nSome people use a [[patronymic]]. For example, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]]'s name is derived from his father's name ([[Wahid Hasyim]]) who was an independence fighter and minister. In turn, Wahid Hasyim's name was derived from that of his father: [[Hasyim Asyari]], a famous cleric and founder of the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] organisation.\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{main article|Javanese cuisine}}\n[[File:Javanese Cuisine, Djogdja.jpg|thumb|left|Example of Javanese cuisine.
