The town's public market is also the main center of commerce for a number of barangays in the neighbouring towns.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1878, Zaragoza was born as Bario San Vicente upon recommendation of Don Francisco to Governor  Cillos. Later, Municipal President Cirilo Acosta moved the town hall building to the present site where the Post Office and Comelec extension offices are located. Mayor Pascual Linsangan completed the building. Mayor Francisco Ramirez added the Sangguniang Bayan Session Hall, with Plaza stage, fountain and fenced the site in 1971.

This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics.

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

It varies from almost dark blonde to almost black hair. It is characterized by higher levels of the dark [[pigment]] [[eumelanin]] and lower levels of the pale pigment [[pheomelanin]].

All of these terms ultimately derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''bhr\u016bn-'' \"brown, grey\". The form \"brun\" (pronounced {{IPAc-en|b|r|u\u02d0|n|}}) is still commonly used in Scotland, particularly in rural areas, and is also the word for \"brown\" in the [[Scandinavian language]]s. In modern English usage, however, it has lost the diminutive meaning and usually refers to any brown- or black-haired girl or woman, or the associated hair color. ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' defines \"brunet\" as \"a person having brown or black hair\"\u2014with which they may have \"a relatively dark complexion\u2014spelled brunet when used of a boy or man and usually brunette when used of a girl or woman\".<ref name=\"Brunet\"/> Although ''brunet'' is the masculine version of the popular diminutive form used to describe a little boy or young man with brown hair, the use of \"brunet\" is uncommon in English. {{fact|date=January 2020}} One is more likely to say about a man or boy, \"He has brown hair\" or \"He is brown-haired\" than to say, \"He is a brunette\" (or brunet).\n\nLighter or darker shades of brown hair may be referred to as \"light brunette\" or \"dark brunette\", though in such cases one is generally referring only to the hair color, not using the term as a metaphor for the person; one would be unlikely to say, \"She is a light brunette.\" Rather, one would say, \"She has light-brown hair.\"\n\n==Geographic distribution==\nBrown-haired individuals predominate in most parts of [[Europe]]. In northern and central Europe medium to light brown shades are the most common, while darker shades prevail in the rest of the continent. Brown hair, mostly medium to light brown shades, are also dominant in Australia, Canada and the United States among [[European Americans]] from the [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an ([[British people|British]], [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavian]], [[Baltic states|Baltic]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]]/[[Flemish]], [[German people|German]] (including [[Swiss-German]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and [[Austrians|Austrian]]), [[Slovenes|Slovenian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Russian people|Russian]]) as well as Southern ([[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) and Southeastern European ([[Croats|Croatian]], [[Serbs|Serbian]]).\n\nSimilarly to [[blond]] hair, brown hair occurs commonly among [[Australian Aborigine]] and [[Melanesian]] populations.<ref name=\"Modern Human Variation\"/>\n\nDark brown hair is predominant in the Mediterranean parts of Europe, the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Central Asia]], and in parts of [[South Asia]].

Brown hair has more eumelanin than [[blond hair]] but also has far less than black. There are two different types of eumelanin, which are distinguished from each other by their pattern of [[polymer]] bonds. The two types are black eumelanin and brown eumelanin. Black eumelanin is the darkest; brown eumelanin is much lighter than black. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes [[grey hair]]. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes yellow ([[Blond hair|blond]]) color hair. Often, natural blond or red hair will darken to a brown color over time. Brown-haired people have medium-thick strands of hair.\n\nBrown-haired people are thought to produce more skin-protecting eumelanin and are associated with having a more even skin tone. The range of skin colors associated with brown hair is vast, ranging from the palest of skin tones to a dark [[olive skin|olive complexion]].\n\n==Varieties of brown hair==\nBrown hair comes in a wide variety of shades from the very darkest of brown (almost black) to lightest brown (almost blond) showing small signs of [[blondism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ladyinfo.com/brown-hair-colors/ |title=The Best Brown Hair Colors Today |date=22 September 2011 |publisher=LadyInfo.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804074737/http://www.ladyinfo.com/brown-hair-colors/ |archive-date=4 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shades of brown hair include:\n\n* {{anchor|deepest brunette}} '''deepest brunette''': the darkest brown, which can be a very dark [[Chestnut (color)|chestnut]]; sometimes appears to be off black at a distance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wiggoddess.com/exclusivelyyoucolors.html |title=Hair Color Chart |last1=McAfee |first1=Clare |publisher=wiggoddess.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815055818/http://www.wiggoddess.com/exclusivelyyoucolors.html |archivedate=15 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* {{anchor|dark brown}} '''[[dark brown]]'''\n* {{anchor|milk chocolate brown }} '''milk chocolate brown''' : dark brown \n* {{anchor|dark chestnut brown}} ''' dark chestnut brown'''\n* {{anchor|light chestnut}} '''light chestnut brown'''\n* {{anchor|medium brown}} '''medium brown''': standard brunette, comparable to [[Russet (color)]] brown\n* {{anchor|walnut brown}} '''walnut brown''': a warmer variant of medium brown, comparable to a light chestnut\n* {{anchor|medium brown}} '''caramel brown''': brown with yellowish tone.\n* {{anchor|light golden brown}} '''light golden brown''' : the lightest brown, almost dark blond\n* {{anchor|mousy}} '''mousy''': a dull light brown color, sometimes seen as a dark blond\n* {{anchor|light ash brown}} '''light ash brown''': almost blond hair \n* {{anchor|lightest brown}} '''lightest brown''': light brown that goes mid blonde in the sun\n* {{anchor|maple brown}} '''maple brown''': a dark golden brown color, like maple syrup\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"120\" heights=\"200\">\n File:Eoin Macken.jpg|deepest brunette<br><small>([[Eoin Macken]])</small>\n File:Eddie Van Halen (1993).jpg|dark brown<br><small>([[Eddie Van Halen]])</small>\n File:Brian May (2007).jpg|dark chestnut brown<br><small>([[Brian May]])</small>\n File:animal print T.jpg| medium brown<br><small>([[Italy#Demographics|Italian]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] girl)</small>\n File:Girl in a Kabul orphanage, 01-07-2002.jpg|cinnamon brown<br><small>([[Afghan]] [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] girl)</small>\n File:Ministru prezidents Valdis Dombrovskis tiekas ar V\u0101cijas \u0101rlietu ministru Gvido Vestervelli (7849819858) (cropped).jpg|light ash brown<br><small>([[Guido Westerwelle]])</small>\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural connotations===\nIn Western popular culture, a common stereotype is that brunettes are stable, serious, smart and sophisticated.

''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' defines \"brunet\" as \"a person having brown or black hair\"\u2014with which they may have \"a relatively dark complexion\u2014spelled brunet when used of a boy or man and usually brunette when used of a girl or woman\".<ref name=\"Brunet\"/> Although ''brunet'' is the masculine version of the popular diminutive form used to describe a little boy or young man with brown hair, the use of \"brunet\" is uncommon in English. {{fact|date=January 2020}} One is more likely to say about a man or boy, \"He has brown hair\" or \"He is brown-haired\" than to say, \"He is a brunette\" (or brunet).\n\nLighter or darker shades of brown hair may be referred to as \"light brunette\" or \"dark brunette\", though in such cases one is generally referring only to the hair color, not using the term as a metaphor for the person; one would be unlikely to say, \"She is a light brunette.\" Rather, one would say, \"She has light-brown hair.\"\n\n==Geographic distribution==\nBrown-haired individuals predominate in most parts of [[Europe]]. In northern and central Europe medium to light brown shades are the most common, while darker shades prevail in the rest of the continent. Brown hair, mostly medium to light brown shades, are also dominant in Australia, Canada and the United States among [[European Americans]] from the [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an ([[British people|British]], [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavian]], [[Baltic states|Baltic]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]]/[[Flemish]], [[German people|German]] (including [[Swiss-German]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and [[Austrians|Austrian]]), [[Slovenes|Slovenian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Russian people|Russian]]) as well as Southern ([[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) and Southeastern European ([[Croats|Croatian]], [[Serbs|Serbian]]).\n\nSimilarly to [[blond]] hair, brown hair occurs commonly among [[Australian Aborigine]] and [[Melanesian]] populations.<ref name=\"Modern Human Variation\"/>\n\nDark brown hair is predominant in the Mediterranean parts of Europe, the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Central Asia]], and in parts of [[South Asia]]. Very dark brown hair, easily mistaken for [[black hair]], can be found occasionally in parts of [[East Asia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.co.id/fascinating-facts-about-chinese-people-2015-8/#.VgGwu3tNJPO|title=Fascinating facts about 90% of Chinese people - Business Insider|date=12 August 2015|publisher=|access-date=22 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923004538/http://www.businessinsider.co.id/fascinating-facts-about-chinese-people-2015-8/#.VgGwu3tNJPO|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> This is also true of [[Southern Cone|Southern Cone of South America]] (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, central-southern Brazil).\n\nIt may occasionally be found among Indigenous Siberians and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]];(formerly) especially for mostly populations in [[Southeast Asia]] due to pigment changes (such as [[Philippines|the Philippines]] and [[Vietnam]]) for example  particularly when they are young, as well as in many other groups.\n\n==Biochemistry==\nThe pigment [[eumelanin]] gives brown hair its distinctive color. Brown hair has more eumelanin than [[blond hair]] but also has far less than black. There are two different types of eumelanin, which are distinguished from each other by their pattern of [[polymer]] bonds. The two types are black eumelanin and brown eumelanin. Black eumelanin is the darkest; brown eumelanin is much lighter than black. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes [[grey hair]]. A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes yellow ([[Blond hair|blond]]) color hair. Often, natural blond or red hair will darken to a brown color over time. Brown-haired people have medium-thick strands of hair.\n\nBrown-haired people are thought to produce more skin-protecting eumelanin and are associated with having a more even skin tone. The range of skin colors associated with brown hair is vast, ranging from the palest of skin tones to a dark [[olive skin|olive complexion]].\n\n==Varieties of brown hair==\nBrown hair comes in a wide variety of shades from the very darkest of brown (almost black) to lightest brown (almost blond) showing small signs of [[blondism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ladyinfo.com/brown-hair-colors/ |title=The Best Brown Hair Colors Today |date=22 September 2011 |publisher=LadyInfo.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804074737/http://www.ladyinfo.com/brown-hair-colors/ |archive-date=4 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shades of brown hair include:\n\n* {{anchor|deepest brunette}} '''deepest brunette''': the darkest brown, which can be a very dark [[Chestnut (color)|chestnut]]; sometimes appears to be off black at a distance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wiggoddess.com/exclusivelyyoucolors.html |title=Hair Color Chart |last1=McAfee |first1=Clare |publisher=wiggoddess.com |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815055818/http://www.wiggoddess.com/exclusivelyyoucolors.html |archivedate=15 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* {{anchor|dark brown}} '''[[dark brown]]'''\n* {{anchor|milk chocolate brown }} '''milk chocolate brown''' : dark brown \n* {{anchor|dark chestnut brown}} ''' dark chestnut brown'''\n* {{anchor|light chestnut}} '''light chestnut brown'''\n* {{anchor|medium brown}} '''medium brown''': standard brunette, comparable to [[Russet (color)]] brown\n* {{anchor|walnut brown}} '''walnut brown''': a warmer variant of medium brown, comparable to a light chestnut\n* {{anchor|medium brown}} '''caramel brown''': brown with yellowish tone.\n* {{anchor|light golden brown}} '''light golden brown''' : the lightest brown, almost dark blond\n* {{anchor|mousy}} '''mousy''': a dull light brown color, sometimes seen as a dark blond\n* {{anchor|light ash brown}} '''light ash brown''': almost blond hair \n* {{anchor|lightest brown}} '''lightest brown''': light brown that goes mid blonde in the sun\n* {{anchor|maple brown}} '''maple brown''': a dark golden brown color, like maple syrup\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"120\" heights=\"200\">\n File:Eoin Macken.jpg|deepest brunette<br><small>([[Eoin Macken]])</small>\n File:Eddie Van Halen (1993).jpg|dark brown<br><small>([[Eddie Van Halen]])</small>\n File:Brian May (2007).jpg|dark chestnut brown<br><small>([[Brian May]])</small>\n File:animal print T.jpg| medium brown<br><small>([[Italy#Demographics|Italian]] [[Sicily|Sicilian]] girl)</small>\n File:Girl in a Kabul orphanage, 01-07-2002.jpg|cinnamon brown<br><small>([[Afghan]] [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] girl)</small>\n File:Ministru prezidents Valdis Dombrovskis tiekas ar V\u0101cijas \u0101rlietu ministru Gvido Vestervelli (7849819858) (cropped).jpg|light ash brown<br><small>([[Guido Westerwelle]])</small>\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural connotations===\nIn Western popular culture, a common stereotype is that brunettes are stable, serious, smart and sophisticated.

The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time).it is possible to restart time itself\n\n==Ancient and medieval views==\nThe earliest recorded [[Western philosophy]] of [[time]] was expounded by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian thinker [[Ptahhotep]] (c. 2650\u20132600 BC) who said:\n\n{{quote|Follow your desire as long as you live, and do not perform more than is ordered, do not lessen the time of following desire, for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit... |''11th [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] of Ptahhotep'' <ref>[[John Bartlett (publisher)|John Bartlett]] -  [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IhVDgAAQBAJ&pg Bartlett's Familiar Quotations] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IhVDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP130 (page locatable by contents)] Hachette UK, 2 December 2014 {{ISBN|031625018X}} Accessed December 13th, 2017</ref>}}\n\nThe ''[[Vedas]]'', the earliest texts on [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]], dating back to the late [[2nd millennium BC]], describe ancient [[Hindu cosmology]], in which the [[universe]] goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana: Mysteries of the Sacred Universe |first1=Richard L. |last1=Thompson |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-208-1919-1 |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC&pg=PA225  Extract of page 225]</ref> [[Ancient philosophy|Ancient]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], including [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]], wrote essays on the nature of time.<ref>Dagobert Runes, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', p. 318</ref>\n\n[[Incas]] regarded space and time as a single concept, named '''pacha''' ({{lang-qu|pacha}}, {{lang-ay|pacha}}).<ref>Atuq Eusebio Manga Qespi, Instituto de ling\u00fc\u00edstica y Cultura Amerindia de la Universidad de Valencia.

If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.\" He goes on to comment on the difficulty of thinking about time, pointing out the inaccuracy of common speech: \"For but few things are there of which we speak properly; of most things we speak improperly, still the things intended are understood.\"<ref>St. Augustine, ''Confessions'', Book 11. http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/augconf/aug11.htm (Accessed 19/5/14).</ref>  But Augustine presented the first philosophical argument for the reality of Creation (against Aristotle) in the context of his discussion of time,  saying that knowledge of time depends on the knowledge of the movement of things,  and therefore time cannot be where there are no creatures to measure its passing (Confessions Book XI \u00b630; [[The City of God|City of God]] Book XI ch.6).\n\nIn contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning, now known as [[Temporal finitism]].

[[Idealism|Idealists]], by contrast, deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some [[anti-realism|anti-realists]], whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.\n\nIn 1781, [[Immanuel Kant]] published the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' notion that, together with other ''a priori'' notions such as [[space]], allows us to comprehend [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Kant holds that neither space nor time are [[Substance theory|substance]], entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] how far apart [[Physical body|object]]s are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]]s. Although space and time are held to be ''transcendentally ideal'' in this sense, they are also ''empirically real''\u2014that is, not mere illusions.\n\nSome idealist writers, such as [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] in ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'', have argued that time is an illusion (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]], below).\n\nThe writers discussed here are for the most part realists in this regard; for instance, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] held that his [[monadology|monad]]s existed, at least independently of the mind of the observer.\n\n==Absolutism and relationalism==\n\n===Leibniz and Newton<!--linked from 'Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum'-->===\nThe great debate between defining notions of space and time as real objects themselves (absolute), or mere orderings upon actual objects ([[relationalism|relational]]), began between physicists [[Isaac Newton]] (via his spokesman, Samuel Clarke) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] in the papers of the [[Leibniz\u2013Clarke correspondence]].\n\nArguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of [[thought experiment]]s with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the [[principle of sufficient reason]] and the [[identity of indiscernibles]]. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.\n\nThe example Leibniz uses involves two proposed universes situated in absolute space. The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists. Such a situation, however, is not possible, according to Leibniz, for if it were, a universe's position in absolute space would have no sufficient reason, as it might very well have been anywhere else. Therefore, it contradicts the principle of sufficient reason, and there could exist two distinct universes that were in all ways indiscernible, thus contradicting the identity of indiscernibles.\n\nStanding out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the [[bucket argument]]: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.\n\nIn this response, Clarke argues for the necessity of the existence of [[absolute space]] to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely [[relationalism|relationalist account]]. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating bucket as well as in the stationary bucket containing spinning water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing\u2014absolute space.\n\nLeibniz describes a space that exists only as a relation between objects, and which has no existence apart from the existence of those objects. Motion exists only as a relation between those objects. Newtonian space provided the absolute frame of reference within which objects can have motion. In Newton's system, the frame of reference exists independently of the objects contained within it. These objects can be described as moving in relation to space itself. For almost two centuries, the evidence of a concave water surface held authority.\n\n===Mach===\nAnother important figure in this debate is 19th-century physicist [[Ernst Mach]]. While he did not deny the existence of phenomena like that seen in the bucket argument, he still denied the absolutist conclusion by offering a different answer as to what the bucket was rotating in relation to: the [[fixed stars]].\n\nMach suggested that thought experiments like the bucket argument are problematic. If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm that the bucket was indeed spinning. It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat.\n\nMach argued that, in effect, the water experiment in an otherwise empty universe would remain flat. But if another object were introduced into this universe, perhaps a distant star, there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating. The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve. To account for the curve that we observe, an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water. Mach argued that the momentum of an object, whether angular or linear, exists as a result of the sum of the effects of other objects in the universe ([[Mach's Principle]]).\n\n===Einstein===\n[[Albert Einstein]] proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the [[principle of relativity]]. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by [[Maxwell's equations]], which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the [[speed of light]]. However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the [[luminiferous ether]]. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate.\n\nAll attempts to measure any speed relative to this ether failed, which can be seen as a confirmation of Einstein's postulate that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. [[Special relativity]] is a formalization of the principle of relativity that does not contain a privileged inertial frame of reference, such as the luminiferous ether or absolute space, from which Einstein inferred that no such frame exists.\n\nEinstein generalized relativity to frames of reference that were non-inertial. He achieved this by positing the [[equivalence principle|Equivalence Principle]], which states that the force felt by an observer in a given gravitational field and that felt by an observer in an accelerating frame of reference are indistinguishable. This led to the conclusion that the mass of an object warps the geometry of the space-time surrounding it, as described in [[Einstein's field equation]]s.\n\nIn classical physics, an inertial reference frame is one in which an object that experiences no forces does not accelerate. In general relativity, an inertial frame of reference is one that is following a [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]] of space-time. An object that moves against a geodesic experiences a force. An object in [[free fall]] does not experience a force, because it is following a geodesic. An object standing on the earth, however, will experience a force, as it is being held against the geodesic by the surface of the planet.\n\nEinstein partially advocates [[Mach's principle]] in that distant stars explain inertia because they provide the gravitational field against which acceleration and inertia occur. But contrary to Leibniz's account, this warped space-time is as integral a part of an object as are its other defining characteristics, such as volume and mass. If one holds, contrary to idealist beliefs, that objects exist independently of the mind, it seems that relativistics commits them to also hold that space and temporality have exactly the same type of independent existence.\n\n==Conventionalism==\nThe position of conventionalism states that there is no fact of the matter as to the geometry of space and time, but that it is decided by convention. The first proponent of such a view, [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], reacting to the creation of the new [[non-Euclidean geometry]], argued that which geometry applied to a space was decided by convention, since different geometries will describe a set of objects equally well, based on considerations from his [[sphere-world]].\n\nThis view was developed and updated to include considerations from relativistic physics by [[Hans Reichenbach]]. Reichenbach's conventionalism, applying to space and time, focuses around the idea of [[coordinative definition]].\n\nCoordinative definition has two major features. The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the [[wavelength]] of [[cadmium]] to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.\n\nSuch a use of coordinative definition is in effect, on Reichenbach's conventionalism, in the General Theory of Relativity where light is assumed, i.e. not discovered, to mark out equal distances in equal times. After this setting of coordinative definition, however, the geometry of spacetime is set.\n\nAs in the absolutism/relationalism debate, contemporary philosophy is still in disagreement as to the correctness of the conventionalist doctrine.\n\n==Structure of space-time==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\nBuilding from a mix of insights from the historical debates of absolutism and conventionalism as well as reflecting on the import of the technical apparatus of the General Theory of Relativity, details as to the structure of [[spacetime|space-time]] have made up a large proportion of discussion within the philosophy of space and time, as well as the [[philosophy of physics]]. The following is a short list of topics.\n\n===Relativity of simultaneity===\nAccording to [[special relativity]] each point in the universe can have a different set of events that compose its present instant. This has been used in the [[Rietdijk\u2013Putnam argument]] to demonstrate that relativity predicts a [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|block universe]] in which events are fixed in four dimensions.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Invariance vs. covariance===\nBringing to bear the lessons of the absolutism/relationalism debate with the powerful mathematical tools invented in the 19th and 20th century, [[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]] draws a distinction between invariance upon mathematical [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] and covariance upon transformation.\n\nInvariance, or symmetry, applies to ''objects'', i.e. the [[symmetry group]] of a space-time theory designates what features of objects are invariant, or absolute, and which are dynamical, or variable.\n\nCovariance applies to ''formulations'' of theories, i.e. the [[Group (mathematics)|covariance group]] designates in which range of [[coordinate system]]s the laws of physics hold.\n\nThis distinction can be illustrated by revisiting Leibniz's thought experiment, in which the universe is shifted over five feet. In this example the position of an object is seen not to be a property of that object, i.e. location is not invariant. Similarly, the covariance group for [[classical mechanics]] will be any coordinate systems that are obtained from one another by shifts in position as well as other translations allowed by a [[Galilean transformation]].\n\nIn the classical case, the invariance, or symmetry, group and the covariance group coincide, but they part ways in relativistic physics. The symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes all differentiable transformations, i.e., all properties of an object are dynamical, in other words there are no absolute objects. The formulations of the general theory of relativity, unlike those of classical mechanics, do not share a standard, i.e., there is no single formulation paired with transformations. As such the covariance group of the general theory of relativity is just the covariance group of every theory.\n\n===Historical frameworks===\nA further application of the modern mathematical methods, in league with the idea of invariance and covariance groups, is to try to interpret historical views of space and time in modern, mathematical language.\n\nIn these translations, a theory of space and time is seen as a [[manifold]] paired with [[vector spaces]], the more vector spaces the more facts there are about objects in that theory. The historical development of spacetime theories is generally seen to start from a position where many facts about objects are incorporated in that theory, and as history progresses, more and more structure is removed.\n\nFor example, Aristotelian space and time has both absolute position and special places, such as the center of the cosmos, and the circumference. Newtonian space and time has absolute position and is [[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]], but does not have special positions.\n\n===Holes===\nWith the general theory of relativity, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether spacetime is a substance, since the general theory of relativity largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. One powerful argument against spacetime [[substantivalism]], offered by [[John Earman]] is known as the \"[[hole argument]]\".\n\nThis is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nDefine a function ''d'' as the [[identity function]] over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] H belonging to M. Over H ''d'' comes to differ from identity by a [[smooth function]].\n\nWith use of this function ''d'' we can construct two [[mathematical model]]s, where the second is generated by applying ''d'' to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time ''t''=0, where ''t'' is a time function created by a [[foliation]] of spacetime, but differ after ''t''=0.\n\nThese considerations show that, since substantivalism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantivalism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantivalism.\n\n==Direction of time==\nThe problem of the [[Arrow of time|direction of time]] arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]]; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the [[macroscopic]] level, is ''not'' time-reversal invariant.<ref>Borchert, D.M. (2006) Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Ed. Vol. 9. MI: Cengage Learning. P. 468.</ref> Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future.\n\n===Causation solution===\nOne solution to this problem takes a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view, in which the direction of time follows from an asymmetry of [[Causality|causation]]. We know more about the past because the elements of the past are causes for the effect that is our perception. We feel we can't affect the past and can affect the future because we ''can't'' affect the past and ''can'' affect the future.\n\nThere are two main objections to this view. First is the problem of distinguishing the cause from the effect in a non-arbitrary way. The use of causation in constructing a temporal ordering could easily become circular. The second problem with this view is its explanatory power. While the causation account, if successful, may account for some time-asymmetric phenomena like perception and action, it does not account for many others.\n\nHowever, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between i) temporal direction and ii) the implications of form and functional capacity.\n\nThe application of these ideas of form and functional capacity only dictates temporal direction in relation to complex scenarios involving specific, non-metaphysical agency which is not merely dependent on human perception of time. However, this last observation in itself is not sufficient to invalidate the implications of the example for the progressive nature of time in general.\n\n===Thermodynamics solution===\nThe second major family of solutions to this problem, and by far the one that has generated the most literature, finds the existence of the direction of time as relating to the nature of thermodynamics.\n\nThe answer from classical [[thermodynamics]] states that while our basic physical theory is, in fact, time-reversal symmetric, thermodynamics is not. In particular, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the net [[entropy]] of a closed system never decreases, and this explains why we often see glass breaking, but not coming back together.\n\nBut in [[statistical mechanics]] things become more complicated. On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a [[statistical]] postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is ''overwhelmingly'' likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.\n\nCurrent thermodynamic solutions to the problem of the direction of time aim to find some further fact, or feature of the laws of nature to account for this discrepancy.\n\n===Laws solution===\nA third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in [[quantum mechanics]], relating to the [[weak nuclear force]], are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}}\n\nOne recent proponent of the laws solution is [[Tim Maudlin]] who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin [2007]). However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: \"[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past\" [ibid, 2010 edition, p.&nbsp;108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.\n\n==Flow of time==\nThe problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], in which he proposes two \"temporal series\". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the [[A-series and B-series|A-series]]. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, ''simpliciter'' and in comparison to each other. The [[A-series and B-series|B-series]] eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations ''earlier than'' and ''later than''.\n\nMcTaggart, in his paper \"[[The Unreality of Time]]\", argues that time is unreal since a) the A-series is inconsistent and b) the B-series alone cannot account for the nature of time as the A-series describes an essential feature of it.\n\nBuilding from this framework, two camps of solution have been offered. The first, the A-theorist solution, takes becoming as the central feature of time, and tries to construct the B-series from the A-series by offering an account of how B-facts come to be out of A-facts. The second camp, the B-theorist solution, takes as decisive McTaggart's arguments against the A-series and tries to construct the A-series out of the B-series, for example, by temporal indexicals.\n\n== Dualities ==\n{{expand section|date=May 2016}}\n[[Quantum field theory]] models have shown that it is possible for theories in two different space-time backgrounds, like [[AdS/CFT]] or [[T-duality]], to be equivalent.\n\n==Presentism and eternalism==\n{{Main|Presentism (philosophy of time)|Eternalism (philosophy of time)}}\nAccording to [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentism]], time is an ordering of various [[reality|realities]]. At a certain time some things exist and others do not. This is the only reality we can deal with and we cannot for example say that [[Homer]] exists because at the present time he does not. An [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalist]], on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things&mdash;past, present and future&mdash;can be said to be just as real as things in the present. According to this theory, then, Homer really ''does'' exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time&mdash;just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words ''near'', ''far'', ''above'', ''below'', and such are directly comparable to phrases such as ''in the past'', ''a minute ago'', and so on).\n\n==Endurantism and perdurantism==\n{{Main|Endurantism|Perdurantism}}\nThe positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An [[endurantism|endurantist]] holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A [[perdurantism|perdurantist]] on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its \"[[temporal part]]s\" or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists such as [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] have attacked this position. They argue that perdurantism is the superior view for its ability to take account of change in objects.\n\nOn the whole, [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentists]] are also endurantists and [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalists]] are also perdurantists (and vice versa), but this is not a necessary relation and it is possible to claim, for instance, that time's passage indicates a series of ordered realities, but that objects within these realities somehow exist outside of the reality as a whole, even though the realities as wholes are not related. However, such positions are rarely adopted.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Arrow of time]]\n* ''[[Being and Time]]''\n* [[Chronometry]]\n* [[Einstein's thought experiments]]\n* ''[[The End of Time (book)|The End of Time]]''\n* [[Eternal return]]\n* [[Metaphysics]]\n* [[Mili\u010d \u010capek]]\n* [[Presentism (philosophy of time)]]\n* ''[[Process and Reality]]''\n* [[Process philosophy]]\n* [[Spacetime]]\n* [[Temporal parts]]\n* [[Time geography]]\n* ''[[Time Reborn]]''\n* [[Time travel]] in science and [[time travel in fiction]]\n* [[Quentin Smith]]\n* [[Zeno's paradoxes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* Albert, David (2000) ''Time and Chance''.

While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early [[analytic philosophy]]. The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time).\n\n==Ancient and medieval views==\nThe earliest recorded [[Western philosophy]] of [[time]] was expounded by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian thinker [[Ptahhotep]] (c. 2650\u20132600 BC) who said:\n\n{{quote|Follow your desire as long as you live, and do not perform more than is ordered, do not lessen the time of following desire, for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit... |''11th [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] of Ptahhotep'' <ref>[[John Bartlett (publisher)|John Bartlett]] -  [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IhVDgAAQBAJ&pg Bartlett's Familiar Quotations] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IhVDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP130 (page locatable by contents)] Hachette UK, 2 December 2014 {{ISBN|031625018X}} Accessed December 13th, 2017</ref>}}\n\nThe ''[[Vedas]]'', the earliest texts on [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]], dating back to the late [[2nd millennium BC]], describe ancient [[Hindu cosmology]], in which the [[universe]] goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana: Mysteries of the Sacred Universe |first1=Richard L. |last1=Thompson |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-208-1919-1 |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC&pg=PA225  Extract of page 225]</ref> [[Ancient philosophy|Ancient]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], including [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]], wrote essays on the nature of time.<ref>Dagobert Runes, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', p. 318</ref>\n\n[[Incas]] regarded space and time as a single concept, named '''pacha''' ({{lang-qu|pacha}}, {{lang-ay|pacha}}).<ref>Atuq Eusebio Manga Qespi, Instituto de ling\u00fc\u00edstica y Cultura Amerindia de la Universidad de Valencia.

If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.\" He goes on to comment on the difficulty of thinking about time, pointing out the inaccuracy of common speech: \"For but few things are there of which we speak properly; of most things we speak improperly, still the things intended are understood.\"<ref>St. Augustine, ''Confessions'', Book 11. http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/augconf/aug11.htm (Accessed 19/5/14).</ref>  But Augustine presented the first philosophical argument for the reality of Creation (against Aristotle) in the context of his discussion of time,  saying that knowledge of time depends on the knowledge of the movement of things,  and therefore time cannot be where there are no creatures to measure its passing (Confessions Book XI \u00b630; [[The City of God|City of God]] Book XI ch.6).\n\nIn contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning, now known as [[Temporal finitism]].

[[Idealism|Idealists]], by contrast, deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some [[anti-realism|anti-realists]], whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.\n\nIn 1781, [[Immanuel Kant]] published the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' notion that, together with other ''a priori'' notions such as [[space]], allows us to comprehend [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Kant holds that neither space nor time are [[Substance theory|substance]], entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] how far apart [[Physical body|object]]s are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]]s. Although space and time are held to be ''transcendentally ideal'' in this sense, they are also ''empirically real''\u2014that is, not mere illusions.\n\nSome idealist writers, such as [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] in ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'', have argued that time is an illusion (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]], below).\n\nThe writers discussed here are for the most part realists in this regard; for instance, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] held that his [[monadology|monad]]s existed, at least independently of the mind of the observer.\n\n==Absolutism and relationalism==\n\n===Leibniz and Newton<!--linked from 'Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum'-->===\nThe great debate between defining notions of space and time as real objects themselves (absolute), or mere orderings upon actual objects ([[relationalism|relational]]), began between physicists [[Isaac Newton]] (via his spokesman, Samuel Clarke) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] in the papers of the [[Leibniz\u2013Clarke correspondence]].\n\nArguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of [[thought experiment]]s with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the [[principle of sufficient reason]] and the [[identity of indiscernibles]]. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.\n\nThe example Leibniz uses involves two proposed universes situated in absolute space. The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists. Such a situation, however, is not possible, according to Leibniz, for if it were, a universe's position in absolute space would have no sufficient reason, as it might very well have been anywhere else. Therefore, it contradicts the principle of sufficient reason, and there could exist two distinct universes that were in all ways indiscernible, thus contradicting the identity of indiscernibles.\n\nStanding out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the [[bucket argument]]: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.\n\nIn this response, Clarke argues for the necessity of the existence of [[absolute space]] to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely [[relationalism|relationalist account]]. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating bucket as well as in the stationary bucket containing spinning water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing\u2014absolute space.\n\nLeibniz describes a space that exists only as a relation between objects, and which has no existence apart from the existence of those objects. Motion exists only as a relation between those objects. Newtonian space provided the absolute frame of reference within which objects can have motion. In Newton's system, the frame of reference exists independently of the objects contained within it. These objects can be described as moving in relation to space itself. For almost two centuries, the evidence of a concave water surface held authority.\n\n===Mach===\nAnother important figure in this debate is 19th-century physicist [[Ernst Mach]]. While he did not deny the existence of phenomena like that seen in the bucket argument, he still denied the absolutist conclusion by offering a different answer as to what the bucket was rotating in relation to: the [[fixed stars]].\n\nMach suggested that thought experiments like the bucket argument are problematic. If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm that the bucket was indeed spinning. It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat.\n\nMach argued that, in effect, the water experiment in an otherwise empty universe would remain flat. But if another object were introduced into this universe, perhaps a distant star, there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating. The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve. To account for the curve that we observe, an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water. Mach argued that the momentum of an object, whether angular or linear, exists as a result of the sum of the effects of other objects in the universe ([[Mach's Principle]]).\n\n===Einstein===\n[[Albert Einstein]] proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the [[principle of relativity]]. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by [[Maxwell's equations]], which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the [[speed of light]]. However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the [[luminiferous ether]]. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate.\n\nAll attempts to measure any speed relative to this ether failed, which can be seen as a confirmation of Einstein's postulate that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. [[Special relativity]] is a formalization of the principle of relativity that does not contain a privileged inertial frame of reference, such as the luminiferous ether or absolute space, from which Einstein inferred that no such frame exists.\n\nEinstein generalized relativity to frames of reference that were non-inertial. He achieved this by positing the [[equivalence principle|Equivalence Principle]], which states that the force felt by an observer in a given gravitational field and that felt by an observer in an accelerating frame of reference are indistinguishable. This led to the conclusion that the mass of an object warps the geometry of the space-time surrounding it, as described in [[Einstein's field equation]]s.\n\nIn classical physics, an inertial reference frame is one in which an object that experiences no forces does not accelerate. In general relativity, an inertial frame of reference is one that is following a [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]] of space-time. An object that moves against a geodesic experiences a force. An object in [[free fall]] does not experience a force, because it is following a geodesic. An object standing on the earth, however, will experience a force, as it is being held against the geodesic by the surface of the planet.\n\nEinstein partially advocates [[Mach's principle]] in that distant stars explain inertia because they provide the gravitational field against which acceleration and inertia occur. But contrary to Leibniz's account, this warped space-time is as integral a part of an object as are its other defining characteristics, such as volume and mass. If one holds, contrary to idealist beliefs, that objects exist independently of the mind, it seems that relativistics commits them to also hold that space and temporality have exactly the same type of independent existence.\n\n==Conventionalism==\nThe position of conventionalism states that there is no fact of the matter as to the geometry of space and time, but that it is decided by convention. The first proponent of such a view, [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], reacting to the creation of the new [[non-Euclidean geometry]], argued that which geometry applied to a space was decided by convention, since different geometries will describe a set of objects equally well, based on considerations from his [[sphere-world]].\n\nThis view was developed and updated to include considerations from relativistic physics by [[Hans Reichenbach]]. Reichenbach's conventionalism, applying to space and time, focuses around the idea of [[coordinative definition]].\n\nCoordinative definition has two major features. The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the [[wavelength]] of [[cadmium]] to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.\n\nSuch a use of coordinative definition is in effect, on Reichenbach's conventionalism, in the General Theory of Relativity where light is assumed, i.e. not discovered, to mark out equal distances in equal times. After this setting of coordinative definition, however, the geometry of spacetime is set.\n\nAs in the absolutism/relationalism debate, contemporary philosophy is still in disagreement as to the correctness of the conventionalist doctrine.\n\n==Structure of space-time==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\nBuilding from a mix of insights from the historical debates of absolutism and conventionalism as well as reflecting on the import of the technical apparatus of the General Theory of Relativity, details as to the structure of [[spacetime|space-time]] have made up a large proportion of discussion within the philosophy of space and time, as well as the [[philosophy of physics]]. The following is a short list of topics.\n\n===Relativity of simultaneity===\nAccording to [[special relativity]] each point in the universe can have a different set of events that compose its present instant. This has been used in the [[Rietdijk\u2013Putnam argument]] to demonstrate that relativity predicts a [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|block universe]] in which events are fixed in four dimensions.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Invariance vs. covariance===\nBringing to bear the lessons of the absolutism/relationalism debate with the powerful mathematical tools invented in the 19th and 20th century, [[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]] draws a distinction between invariance upon mathematical [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] and covariance upon transformation.\n\nInvariance, or symmetry, applies to ''objects'', i.e. the [[symmetry group]] of a space-time theory designates what features of objects are invariant, or absolute, and which are dynamical, or variable.\n\nCovariance applies to ''formulations'' of theories, i.e. the [[Group (mathematics)|covariance group]] designates in which range of [[coordinate system]]s the laws of physics hold.\n\nThis distinction can be illustrated by revisiting Leibniz's thought experiment, in which the universe is shifted over five feet. In this example the position of an object is seen not to be a property of that object, i.e. location is not invariant. Similarly, the covariance group for [[classical mechanics]] will be any coordinate systems that are obtained from one another by shifts in position as well as other translations allowed by a [[Galilean transformation]].\n\nIn the classical case, the invariance, or symmetry, group and the covariance group coincide, but they part ways in relativistic physics. The symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes all differentiable transformations, i.e., all properties of an object are dynamical, in other words there are no absolute objects. The formulations of the general theory of relativity, unlike those of classical mechanics, do not share a standard, i.e., there is no single formulation paired with transformations. As such the covariance group of the general theory of relativity is just the covariance group of every theory.\n\n===Historical frameworks===\nA further application of the modern mathematical methods, in league with the idea of invariance and covariance groups, is to try to interpret historical views of space and time in modern, mathematical language.\n\nIn these translations, a theory of space and time is seen as a [[manifold]] paired with [[vector spaces]], the more vector spaces the more facts there are about objects in that theory. The historical development of spacetime theories is generally seen to start from a position where many facts about objects are incorporated in that theory, and as history progresses, more and more structure is removed.\n\nFor example, Aristotelian space and time has both absolute position and special places, such as the center of the cosmos, and the circumference. Newtonian space and time has absolute position and is [[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]], but does not have special positions.\n\n===Holes===\nWith the general theory of relativity, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether spacetime is a substance, since the general theory of relativity largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. One powerful argument against spacetime [[substantivalism]], offered by [[John Earman]] is known as the \"[[hole argument]]\".\n\nThis is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nDefine a function ''d'' as the [[identity function]] over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] H belonging to M. Over H ''d'' comes to differ from identity by a [[smooth function]].\n\nWith use of this function ''d'' we can construct two [[mathematical model]]s, where the second is generated by applying ''d'' to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time ''t''=0, where ''t'' is a time function created by a [[foliation]] of spacetime, but differ after ''t''=0.\n\nThese considerations show that, since substantivalism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantivalism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantivalism.\n\n==Direction of time==\nThe problem of the [[Arrow of time|direction of time]] arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]]; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the [[macroscopic]] level, is ''not'' time-reversal invariant.<ref>Borchert, D.M. (2006) Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Ed. Vol. 9. MI: Cengage Learning. P. 468.</ref> Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future.\n\n===Causation solution===\nOne solution to this problem takes a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view, in which the direction of time follows from an asymmetry of [[Causality|causation]]. We know more about the past because the elements of the past are causes for the effect that is our perception. We feel we can't affect the past and can affect the future because we ''can't'' affect the past and ''can'' affect the future.\n\nThere are two main objections to this view. First is the problem of distinguishing the cause from the effect in a non-arbitrary way. The use of causation in constructing a temporal ordering could easily become circular. The second problem with this view is its explanatory power. While the causation account, if successful, may account for some time-asymmetric phenomena like perception and action, it does not account for many others.\n\nHowever, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between i) temporal direction and ii) the implications of form and functional capacity.\n\nThe application of these ideas of form and functional capacity only dictates temporal direction in relation to complex scenarios involving specific, non-metaphysical agency which is not merely dependent on human perception of time. However, this last observation in itself is not sufficient to invalidate the implications of the example for the progressive nature of time in general.\n\n===Thermodynamics solution===\nThe second major family of solutions to this problem, and by far the one that has generated the most literature, finds the existence of the direction of time as relating to the nature of thermodynamics.\n\nThe answer from classical [[thermodynamics]] states that while our basic physical theory is, in fact, time-reversal symmetric, thermodynamics is not. In particular, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the net [[entropy]] of a closed system never decreases, and this explains why we often see glass breaking, but not coming back together.\n\nBut in [[statistical mechanics]] things become more complicated. On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a [[statistical]] postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is ''overwhelmingly'' likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.\n\nCurrent thermodynamic solutions to the problem of the direction of time aim to find some further fact, or feature of the laws of nature to account for this discrepancy.\n\n===Laws solution===\nA third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in [[quantum mechanics]], relating to the [[weak nuclear force]], are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}}\n\nOne recent proponent of the laws solution is [[Tim Maudlin]] who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin [2007]). However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: \"[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past\" [ibid, 2010 edition, p.&nbsp;108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.\n\n==Flow of time==\nThe problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], in which he proposes two \"temporal series\". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the [[A-series and B-series|A-series]]. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, ''simpliciter'' and in comparison to each other. The [[A-series and B-series|B-series]] eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations ''earlier than'' and ''later than''.\n\nMcTaggart, in his paper \"[[The Unreality of Time]]\", argues that time is unreal since a) the A-series is inconsistent and b) the B-series alone cannot account for the nature of time as the A-series describes an essential feature of it.\n\nBuilding from this framework, two camps of solution have been offered. The first, the A-theorist solution, takes becoming as the central feature of time, and tries to construct the B-series from the A-series by offering an account of how B-facts come to be out of A-facts. The second camp, the B-theorist solution, takes as decisive McTaggart's arguments against the A-series and tries to construct the A-series out of the B-series, for example, by temporal indexicals.\n\n== Dualities ==\n{{expand section|date=May 2016}}\n[[Quantum field theory]] models have shown that it is possible for theories in two different space-time backgrounds, like [[AdS/CFT]] or [[T-duality]], to be equivalent.\n\n==Presentism and eternalism==\n{{Main|Presentism (philosophy of time)|Eternalism (philosophy of time)}}\nAccording to [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentism]], time is an ordering of various [[reality|realities]]. At a certain time some things exist and others do not. This is the only reality we can deal with and we cannot for example say that [[Homer]] exists because at the present time he does not. An [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalist]], on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things&mdash;past, present and future&mdash;can be said to be just as real as things in the present. According to this theory, then, Homer really ''does'' exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time&mdash;just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words ''near'', ''far'', ''above'', ''below'', and such are directly comparable to phrases such as ''in the past'', ''a minute ago'', and so on).\n\n==Endurantism and perdurantism==\n{{Main|Endurantism|Perdurantism}}\nThe positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An [[endurantism|endurantist]] holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A [[perdurantism|perdurantist]] on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its \"[[temporal part]]s\" or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists such as [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] have attacked this position. They argue that perdurantism is the superior view for its ability to take account of change in objects.\n\nOn the whole, [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentists]] are also endurantists and [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalists]] are also perdurantists (and vice versa), but this is not a necessary relation and it is possible to claim, for instance, that time's passage indicates a series of ordered realities, but that objects within these realities somehow exist outside of the reality as a whole, even though the realities as wholes are not related. However, such positions are rarely adopted.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Arrow of time]]\n* ''[[Being and Time]]''\n* [[Chronometry]]\n* [[Einstein's thought experiments]]\n* ''[[The End of Time (book)|The End of Time]]''\n* [[Eternal return]]\n* [[Metaphysics]]\n* [[Mili\u010d \u010capek]]\n* [[Presentism (philosophy of time)]]\n* ''[[Process and Reality]]''\n* [[Process philosophy]]\n* [[Spacetime]]\n* [[Temporal parts]]\n* [[Time geography]]\n* ''[[Time Reborn]]''\n* [[Time travel]] in science and [[time travel in fiction]]\n* [[Quentin Smith]]\n* [[Zeno's paradoxes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* Albert, David (2000) ''Time and Chance''.

A detailed analysis of the Compact by the Academic Senate \"Futures Report\" indicated, despite the large fee increases, the University core budget did not recover to 2000 levels.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Committee on Planning and Budget|title=Current Budget Trends and The Future of the University of California|publisher=University of California|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/committees/ucpb/futures.report0506.pdf|date=May 2006|accessdate=March 6, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226210332/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/committees/ucpb/futures.report0506.pdf|archivedate=February 26, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Undergraduate student fees have risen 90% from 2003 to 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paddock |first=Richard C. |title=Less to bank on at state universities |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-compact7oct07,0,5052218,full.story?coll=la-home-center |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=October 6, 2007 |accessdate=October 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606013321/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-compact7oct07%2C0%2C5052218%2Cfull.story?coll=la-home-center |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2011, for the first time in UC's history, student fees exceeded contributions from the State of California.<ref>{{cite news |title=University of California Budget|url=http://budget.universityofcalifornia.edu/?page_id=1120}}</ref>\n\nThe [[California courts of appeal|First District Court of Appeal]] in San Francisco ruled in 2007 that the University of California owed nearly $40 million in refunds to about 40,000 students who were promised that their tuition fees would remain steady, but were hit with increases when the state ran short of money in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |last=Egelko|first=Bob|title=UC owes millions in refunds to students, appeals court rules|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/03/BAAOT5MKR.DTL|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 3, 2007|accessdate=November 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, the University of California announced it will [[Fossil fuel divestment|divest]] its $83 billion in endowment and pension funds from the fossil fuel industry, citing \u2018financial risk\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2019/09/uc-divests-fossil-fuels-citing-finance-renewable-energy-climate-change/|title=Citing 'financial risk,' UC pledges to divest from fossil fuels|last=Mello|first=Felicia|date=2019-09-18|website=CalMatters|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\n===Faculty pay===\nFaculty compensation is comparable with institutions of similar academic ranking<ref>{{cite web|url=http://accountability.universityofcalifornia.edu/index/6.3.1|title=University of California \u2013 Accountability Report|work=universityofcalifornia.edu|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213105033/http://accountability.universityofcalifornia.edu/index/6.3.1|archivedate=December 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but slightly higher than in the [[California State University]] system.

Academic year salaries are for those whose work covers a standard 9-month academic calendar; fiscal year salaries (not listed here) are extrapolations of the academic year salary to cover the entire fiscal year (11 months, since the last month is considered usable as vacation) for those who provide full-year service. Fiscal year salaries are computed by using the monthly rate of the academic year salary and multiplying by 11.\n\nThe UC system provides for merit pay higher than the nominal maximum of a salary range.

Graduate and professional school admissions are handled directly by each department or program to which one applies.\n\n=== Freshmen ===\nBefore 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus that otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were ''redirected'' to another campus with available space. Students who didn't want to be redirected were refunded their application fees. In 1986, that system changed to the current \"multiple filing\" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.<ref>[http://ucop.edu/student-affairs/_files/aa_final2.pdf Undergraduate Access to the University of California After the Elimination of Race-Conscious Policies] March 2003 University of California Office of the President</ref>\n\nThe University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below).

In the first phase, students were admitted based solely on academic achievement. This accounted for between 50 and 75% of the admissions. In the second phase, the university conducted a \"comprehensive review\" of the student's achievements, including extracurricular activities, essay, family history, and life challenges, to admit the remainder. Students who did not qualify for regular admission were \"admitted by exception\"; in 2002, approximately 2% of newly admitted undergraduates were admitted by exception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/compreview/exception.pdf|title=University of California.

At some campuses, such as [[UC Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]] and [[UC Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]], a point system is used to weight [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], [[SAT]] Reasoning or [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] scores, and SAT Subject scores, while at [[UCSD|San Diego]], [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[UCLA|Los Angeles]], academic achievement is examined in the context of the school and the surrounding community, known as a holistic review.\n\n[[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Race]], [[gender]], [[Nationality|national origin]], and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] have not been used as UC admission criteria since the passing of [[California Proposition 209 (1996)|Proposition 209]]. However, this information is collected for statistical purposes.\n\n====Eligibility in the Local Context====\nEligibility in the Local Context, commonly referred to as ELC, is met by applicants ranked in the top 9% of their high school class in terms of performance on an 11-unit pattern of UC-approved high school courses. Beginning with fall 2007 applicants, ELC also requires a UC-calculated GPA of at least 3.0.

A third national laboratory associated with UC is in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].]]\nThe University of California directly manages and operates one [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucop.edu/laboratory-management/|title=Office of the National Laboratories {{!}} UCOP|website=www.ucop.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL) ([[Berkeley, California]])\n\nUC is a limited partner in two separate private [[Limited liability company|limited liability companies]] that manage and operate two other Department of Energy national laboratories:\n* [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) ([[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]) operated by [[Los Alamos National Security]], LLC.\n* [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) ([[Livermore, California]]) operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC.\n\n====Laboratory missions====\n'''Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory''' conducts unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines with key efforts focused on fundamental studies of the universe, quantitative biology, nanoscience, new energy systems and environmental solutions, and the use of integrated computing as a tool for discovery.\n\n'''Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory''' uses advanced science and technology to ensure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain reliable. LLNL also has major research programs in supercomputing and predictive modeling, energy and environment, bioscience and biotechnology, basic science and applied technology, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and homeland security. It is also home to the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\n'''Los Alamos National Laboratory''' focuses most of its work on ensuring the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Other work at LANL involves research programs into preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and US national security, such as protection of the US homeland from terrorist attack.\n\nThe UC system's ties to the three laboratories have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked with the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. During the [[World War II]] [[Manhattan Project]], Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed the electromagnetic method for separation of uranium isotopes used to develop the first atomic bombs. The Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs have been involved in designing U.S. nuclear weapons from their inception until the shift into [[stockpile stewardship]] after the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nHistorically the two national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after [[Ernest O. Lawrence]], have had very close relationships on research projects, as well as sharing some business operations and staff. In fact, [[LLNL]] was not officially severed administratively from [[LBNL]] until the early 1970s. They also have much deeper ties to the university than the Los Alamos Lab, a fact seen in their respective original names; the University of California Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore.\n\n====Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore====\nThe UC system's ties to the labs have so far outlasted all periods of internal controversy. However, in 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy for the first time opened the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) contract for bidding by other vendors. UC entered into a partnership with [[Bechtel Corporation]], [[BWXT]], and the [[Washington Group International]], and together they created a private company called [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] (LANS). The only other bidder on the LANL contract was a [[Lockheed Martin]] Corporation-created company that included, among others, the [[University of Texas System]]. In December 2005, a seven-year contract to manage the laboratory was awarded to the Los Alamos National Security, LLC.<ref>{{cite news \n|last=Broad|first=William J.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/national/22alamos.html|title=California Is Surprise Winner in Bid to Run Los Alamos|work=New York Times|date=December 22, 2005|accessdate=February 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]]. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL.\n\nOn October 1, 2007, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, a limited liability company whose members are Bechtel National, the University of California, Babcock & Wilcox, the Washington Division of URS Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, and The Texas A&M University System.\n\nOther than UC appointing three members to the two separate boards of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually no responsibility for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.\n\n===High-performance networking===\nThe University of California is a founding and charter member of the [[Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California]], a nonprofit organization that provides high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K-20 research and education community.\n\n===Other national research centers===\nFrom September 2003 to July 2016, UC managed a contract valued at more than $330 million to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] at [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] \u2014the largest grant ever awarded the University. [[UC Santa Cruz]] managed the UARC for the University of California, with the goal of increasing the science output, safety, and effectiveness of [[NASA]]'s missions through new technologies and scientific techniques.\n\nSince 2002, the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-funded [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] at [[UC San Diego]] has been managed by the University of California, which took over from the previous manager, [[General Atomics]].\n\n===Observatories===\nThe University of California manages two [[Observatory|observatories]] as a multi-campus research unit headquartered at [[UC Santa Cruz]].\n*[[Lick Observatory]] atop [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], in the [[Diablo Range]] just east of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].\n*[[Keck Observatory]] at the {{convert|4,145|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} summit of [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]].\n\nThe Astronomy Department at the [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] campus manages the [[Hat Creek Radio Observatory]] in [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]].\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n| width = 225\n| image1 = UC Davis Medical Center.jpg\n| alt1 = UC Davis Medical Center\n| caption1 = UC Davis Medical Center\n| image2 = ucirvinemedicalcenter.jpg\n| alt2 = UC Irvine Medical Center\n| caption2 = UC Irvine Medical Center\n| image3 = UCLA Reagan Medical Center.JPG\n| alt3 = Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center\n| caption3 = Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center\n| image4 = UCSD Medical Center Hillcrest.jpg\n| alt4 = UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest\n| caption4 = UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest\n| image5 = UCSF Medical Center and Sutro Tower in 2008.jpg\n| alt5 = UCSF Medical Center\n| caption5 = UCSF Medical Center\n}}\n\n===Medical centers and schools===\nThe University of California operates five medical centers throughout the state:\n\n* [[UC Davis Medical Center]], in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]];\n* [[UC Irvine Medical Center]], in [[Orange, California|Orange]];\n* [[UCLA Health System|UCLA Medical Center]], comprising two distinct hospitals:\n**[[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]], in Los Angeles;\n**[[Santa Monica - UCLA Medical Center]], in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]];\n* [[UCSD Medical Center|UC San Diego Medical Center]], comprising two distinct hospitals:\n**[[UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest]], in [[San Diego]]; \n**[[Jacobs Medical Center]], in [[La Jolla]]; and\n* [[UCSF Medical Center]], in San Francisco.\n\nEach medical center serves as the primary [[Teaching hospital|teaching site]] for that campus's [[medical school]]. UCSF is perennially among the top five programs in both research and primary care, and both UCLA and UC San Diego consistently rank among the top fifteen research schools, according to annual rankings published by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools|title=2013 Best Medical Schools|year=2012|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref>  The teaching hospitals affiliated with each school are also highly regarded - the [[UCSF Medical Center]] was ranked the number one hospital in California and number 5 in the country by ''U.S. News and World Report'''s 2017 Honor Roll for Best Hospitals in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-hospitals/articles/2010/07/14/best-hospitals-2010-11-the-honor-roll.html|title=U.S. News Best Hospitals 2012\u201313: the Honor Roll|last1=Comarow|first1=Avery|date=July 16, 2012|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> UC also has a sixth medical school\u2014[[UC Riverside School of Medicine]], the only one in the UC system without its own hospital.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the UC hospitals became the cores of full-fledged regional health systems; they were gradually supplemented by many outpatient clinics, offices, and institutes. Three UC hospitals are actually county hospitals that were sold to UC, which means that UC currently plays a major role in providing healthcare to the indigent. The medical hospitals operated by UC Irvine (acquired in 1976), UC Davis (acquired in 1978), and UC San Diego (acquired in 1984), each began as the respective county hospitals of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]], and [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].  As of 2016, UC medical centers handle each year about 4.5 million outpatient visits, 356,000 emergency room visits, and 165,000 inpatient admissions.<ref name=\"At a glance\" />\n\nThere are two medical centers that bear the UCLA name, but are not operated by UCLA: [[Harbor\u2013UCLA Medical Center]] and [[Olive View \u2013 UCLA Medical Center]]. They are actually [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]-operated facilities that UCLA uses as [[teaching hospital]]s.\n\n===UC Extension===\nFor over a century, the University has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals. At present, UC Extension enrolls over 500,000 students each year in over 17,000 courses. One of the reasons for its large size is that UC Extension is a dominant provider of [[Continuing Legal Education]] and [[Continuing Medical Education]] in California. For example, the systemwide portion of UC Extension (directly controlled by the UC Office of the President) operates [[CEB (Continuing Education of the Bar)|Continuing Education of the Bar]] under a joint venture agreement with the [[State Bar of California]].\n\n===UC Agriculture and Natural Resources===\nThe University of California division of Agriculture and Natural Resources plays an important role in the State's agriculture industry, as mandated by the UC's legacy as a land-grant institution. In addition to conducting agriculture and [[Youth development]] research, every county in the state has a [[cooperative extension]] office with county farm advisors. The county offices also support [[4-H]] programs and have nutrition, family and consumer sciences advisors who assist local government. Currently, the division's University of California 4-H Youth Development Program<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ca4h.org/|title=University of California 4-H Youth Development Program|publisher=Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> is a national leader in studying [[thriving]] in the field of [[youth development]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://4h.ucanr.edu/About/Framework/PYD/Thrive|title=4-H Thrive|last=Resources|first=University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural|website=4h.ucanr.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n===UC Natural Reserve System===\nThe [[University of California Natural Reserve System|NRS]] was established in January 1965 to provide UC faculty with large areas of land where they could conduct long-term ecosystem research without having to worry about outside disturbances like tourists. Today, the NRS manages 39 reserves that total more than {{convert|756,000|acre|km2}}.\n\n===Travel and conference facilities===\n* UC Berkeley operates the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station in [[Mo'orea]], [[French Polynesia]] on land donated in 1981 by the heir to the founder of the [[Gump's]] home furnishings store.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Geissinger |first1=Steve |last2=Geissinger |first2=Michael |title=Despite state budget crunch, UC runs 'Fantasy Island' station |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/04/14/despite-state-budget-crunch-uc-runs-fantasy-island-station/ |accessdate=3 February 2019 |work=East Bay Times |publisher=Bay Area News Group |date=14 April 2008}}</ref>\n* UC Berkeley's Cal Alumni Association operates travel excursions for alumni (and their families) under its \"Cal Discoveries Travel\" brand (formerly BearTreks); many of the tour guides are Berkeley professors. CAA also operates the oldest and largest alumni association-run family camp in the world, the Lair of the Golden Bear. Located at an altitude of 5600 feet in [[Pinecrest, Tuolumne County, California|Pinecrest, California]], the Lair is a home-away-from-home for almost 10,000 campers annually. Its attendees are largely Cal alumni and their families, but the Lair is open to everyone.\n* Berkeley Lab operates its own [[hotel]], the Berkeley Lab Guest House, available to persons with business at the Lab itself or UC Berkeley.\n* UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services operates two on-campus hotels, the 61-room Guest House and the 254-room Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center, and a lavish off-campus conference center at [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] (with a mix of chalet-like condominiums, lodge rooms, and stand-alone cottages). During the summer, the Lake Arrowhead conference center hosts the Bruin Woods vacation programs for UCLA alumni and their families. \n* Separately, UCLA Health operates the 100-room Tiverton House just south of the UCLA campus to serve its patients and their families. \n* UC Santa Cruz leased the University Inn and Conference Center in downtown Santa Cruz from 2001 to 2011 for use as off-campus student housing.\n* The UC Office of the President's Education Abroad Program operates two mini-campuses that support UC students, faculty, and alumni overseas: California House in [[London]] and La Casa de la Universidad de California in [[Mexico City]]. UC Davis's UC Center Sacramento supports students [[Internship|interning]] with the [[Government of California|California state government]]. None of these facilities have on-site housing, but there is also a [[University of California, Washington Center|UC Washington Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with a dormitory for students interning with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\n===University Airport===\n[[UC Davis]] operates the [[University Airport]] as a utility airport for [[air shuttle]] service in the contractual transportation of university employees and agricultural samples.

Prior to the promulgation of the Master Plan, UC was to admit undergraduates from the top 15%.  UC does not currently adhere to all tenets of the original Master Plan, such as the directives that no campus was to exceed total enrollment of 27,500 students (in order to ensure quality) and that public higher education should be [[College tuition in the United States|tuition-free]] for California residents. Five campuses, Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego each have current total enrollment at over 30,000.\n\nAfter the state electorate severely limited long-term [[property tax]] revenue by enacting [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]] in 1978, UC was forced to make up for the resulting collapse in state financial support by imposing a variety of fees which were tuition

There are also seven ''[[List of Latin phrases: E|ex officio]]'' members\u2014the [[Governor of California|governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of California|lieutenant governor]], speaker of the [[California State Assembly|State Assembly]], [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction|State Superintendent of Public Instruction]], president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC, and the UC president. The Academic Senate, made up of faculty members, is empowered by the Regents to set academic policies. In addition, the system-wide faculty chair and vice-chair sit on the Board of Regents as non-voting members.\n\nOriginally, the President was directly in charge of the first campus, Berkeley. In turn, other UC locations (with the exception of Hastings College of the Law) were treated as off-site departments of the Berkeley campus. In March 1951, the Regents reorganized the university so that day-to-day \"[[chief executive officer]]\" functions for the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses were transferred in 1952 to [[Chancellor (education)|chancellors]] who were entrusted with a high degree of autonomy.<ref name=\"Stadtman2\" /><ref name=\"MargaretLeslieDavis\" /><ref name=\"ClarkKerr1\" /><ref name=\"ChancellorDuties\" /> As noted above, the Regents promoted five additional UC locations to campuses and allowed them to have Chancellors of their own in a series of decisions from 1958 to 1964,<ref name=\"Stadtman3\" /> and the three campuses added since then have also been run by Chancellors.  In turn, all Chancellors (again, with the exception of Hastings) report as equals to the UC President.

Graduate and professional school admissions are handled directly by each department or program to which one applies.\n\n=== Freshmen ===\nBefore 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus that otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were ''redirected'' to another campus with available space. Students who didn't want to be redirected were refunded their application fees. In 1986, that system changed to the current \"multiple filing\" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.<ref>[http://ucop.edu/student-affairs/_files/aa_final2.pdf Undergraduate Access to the University of California After the Elimination of Race-Conscious Policies] March 2003 University of California Office of the President</ref>\n\nThe University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below).

In the first phase, students were admitted based solely on academic achievement. This accounted for between 50 and 75% of the admissions. In the second phase, the university conducted a \"comprehensive review\" of the student's achievements, including extracurricular activities, essay, family history, and life challenges, to admit the remainder.

At some campuses, such as [[UC Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]] and [[UC Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]], a point system is used to weight [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], [[SAT]] Reasoning or [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] scores, and SAT Subject scores, while at [[UCSD|San Diego]], [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[UCLA|Los Angeles]], academic achievement is examined in the context of the school and the surrounding community, known as a holistic review.\n\n[[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Race]], [[gender]], [[Nationality|national origin]], and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] have not been used as UC admission criteria since the passing of [[California Proposition 209 (1996)|Proposition 209]]. However, this information is collected for statistical purposes.\n\n====Eligibility in the Local Context====\nEligibility in the Local Context, commonly referred to as ELC, is met by applicants ranked in the top 9% of their high school class in terms of performance on an 11-unit pattern of UC-approved high school courses. Beginning with fall 2007 applicants, ELC also requires a UC-calculated GPA of at least 3.0.

LLNL also has major research programs in supercomputing and predictive modeling, energy and environment, bioscience and biotechnology, basic science and applied technology, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and homeland security. It is also home to the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\n'''Los Alamos National Laboratory''' focuses most of its work on ensuring the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Other work at LANL involves research programs into preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and US national security, such as protection of the US homeland from terrorist attack.\n\nThe UC system's ties to the three laboratories have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked with the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. During the [[World War II]] [[Manhattan Project]], Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed the electromagnetic method for separation of uranium isotopes used to develop the first atomic bombs. The Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs have been involved in designing U.S. nuclear weapons from their inception until the shift into [[stockpile stewardship]] after the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nHistorically the two national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after [[Ernest O. Lawrence]], have had very close relationships on research projects, as well as sharing some business operations and staff. In fact, [[LLNL]] was not officially severed administratively from [[LBNL]] until the early 1970s. They also have much deeper ties to the university than the Los Alamos Lab, a fact seen in their respective original names; the University of California Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore.\n\n====Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore====\nThe UC system's ties to the labs have so far outlasted all periods of internal controversy. However, in 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy for the first time opened the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) contract for bidding by other vendors. UC entered into a partnership with [[Bechtel Corporation]], [[BWXT]], and the [[Washington Group International]], and together they created a private company called [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] (LANS). The only other bidder on the LANL contract was a [[Lockheed Martin]] Corporation-created company that included, among others, the [[University of Texas System]]. In December 2005, a seven-year contract to manage the laboratory was awarded to the Los Alamos National Security, LLC.<ref>{{cite news \n|last=Broad|first=William J.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/national/22alamos.html|title=California Is Surprise Winner in Bid to Run Los Alamos|work=New York Times|date=December 22, 2005|accessdate=February 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]]. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL.\n\nOn October 1, 2007, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, a limited liability company whose members are Bechtel National, the University of California, Babcock & Wilcox, the Washington Division of URS Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, and The Texas A&M University System.\n\nOther than UC appointing three members to the two separate boards of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually no responsibility for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.\n\n===High-performance networking===\nThe University of California is a founding and charter member of the [[Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California]], a nonprofit organization that provides high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K-20 research and education community.\n\n===Other national research centers===\nFrom September 2003 to July 2016, UC managed a contract valued at more than $330 million to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] at [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] \u2014the largest grant ever awarded the University. [[UC Santa Cruz]] managed the UARC for the University of California, with the goal of increasing the science output, safety, and effectiveness of [[NASA]]'s missions through new technologies and scientific techniques.\n\nSince 2002, the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-funded [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] at [[UC San Diego]] has been managed by the University of California, which took over from the previous manager, [[General Atomics]].\n\n===Observatories===\nThe University of California manages two [[Observatory|observatories]] as a multi-campus research unit headquartered at [[UC Santa Cruz]].\n*[[Lick Observatory]] atop [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], in the [[Diablo Range]] just east of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].\n*[[Keck Observatory]] at the {{convert|4,145|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} summit of [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]].\n\nThe Astronomy Department at the [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] campus manages the [[Hat Creek Radio Observatory]] in [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]].\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n| width = 225\n| image1 = UC Davis Medical Center.jpg\n| alt1 = UC Davis Medical Center\n| caption1 = UC Davis Medical Center\n| image2 = ucirvinemedicalcenter.jpg\n| alt2 = UC Irvine Medical Center\n| caption2 = UC Irvine Medical Center\n| image3 = UCLA Reagan Medical Center.JPG\n| alt3 = Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center\n| caption3 = Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center\n| image4 = UCSD Medical Center Hillcrest.jpg\n| alt4 = UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest\n| caption4 = UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest\n| image5 = UCSF Medical Center and Sutro Tower in 2008.jpg\n| alt5 = UCSF Medical Center\n| caption5 = UCSF Medical Center\n}}\n\n===Medical centers and schools===\nThe University of California operates five medical centers throughout the state:\n\n* [[UC Davis Medical Center]], in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]];\n* [[UC Irvine Medical Center]], in [[Orange, California|Orange]];\n* [[UCLA Health System|UCLA Medical Center]], comprising two distinct hospitals:\n**[[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]], in Los Angeles;\n**[[Santa Monica - UCLA Medical Center]], in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]];\n* [[UCSD Medical Center|UC San Diego Medical Center]], comprising two distinct hospitals:\n**[[UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest]], in [[San Diego]]; \n**[[Jacobs Medical Center]], in [[La Jolla]]; and\n* [[UCSF Medical Center]], in San Francisco.\n\nEach medical center serves as the primary [[Teaching hospital|teaching site]] for that campus's [[medical school]]. UCSF is perennially among the top five programs in both research and primary care, and both UCLA and UC San Diego consistently rank among the top fifteen research schools, according to annual rankings published by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools|title=2013 Best Medical Schools|year=2012|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref>  The teaching hospitals affiliated with each school are also highly regarded - the [[UCSF Medical Center]] was ranked the number one hospital in California and number 5 in the country by ''U.S. News and World Report'''s 2017 Honor Roll for Best Hospitals in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-hospitals/articles/2010/07/14/best-hospitals-2010-11-the-honor-roll.html|title=U.S. News Best Hospitals 2012\u201313: the Honor Roll|last1=Comarow|first1=Avery|date=July 16, 2012|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> UC also has a sixth medical school\u2014[[UC Riverside School of Medicine]], the only one in the UC system without its own hospital.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the UC hospitals became the cores of full-fledged regional health systems; they were gradually supplemented by many outpatient clinics, offices, and institutes. Three UC hospitals are actually county hospitals that were sold to UC, which means that UC currently plays a major role in providing healthcare to the indigent. The medical hospitals operated by UC Irvine (acquired in 1976), UC Davis (acquired in 1978), and UC San Diego (acquired in 1984), each began as the respective county hospitals of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento County]], and [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].  As of 2016, UC medical centers handle each year about 4.5 million outpatient visits, 356,000 emergency room visits, and 165,000 inpatient admissions.<ref name=\"At a glance\" />\n\nThere are two medical centers that bear the UCLA name, but are not operated by UCLA: [[Harbor\u2013UCLA Medical Center]] and [[Olive View \u2013 UCLA Medical Center]]. They are actually [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]-operated facilities that UCLA uses as [[teaching hospital]]s.\n\n===UC Extension===\nFor over a century, the University has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals. At present, UC Extension enrolls over 500,000 students each year in over 17,000 courses. One of the reasons for its large size is that UC Extension is a dominant provider of [[Continuing Legal Education]] and [[Continuing Medical Education]] in California. For example, the systemwide portion of UC Extension (directly controlled by the UC Office of the President) operates [[CEB (Continuing Education of the Bar)|Continuing Education of the Bar]] under a joint venture agreement with the [[State Bar of California]].\n\n===UC Agriculture and Natural Resources===\nThe University of California division of Agriculture and Natural Resources plays an important role in the State's agriculture industry, as mandated by the UC's legacy as a land-grant institution. In addition to conducting agriculture and [[Youth development]] research, every county in the state has a [[cooperative extension]] office with county farm advisors. The county offices also support [[4-H]] programs and have nutrition, family and consumer sciences advisors who assist local government. Currently, the division's University of California 4-H Youth Development Program<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ca4h.org/|title=University of California 4-H Youth Development Program|publisher=Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> is a national leader in studying [[thriving]] in the field of [[youth development]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://4h.ucanr.edu/About/Framework/PYD/Thrive|title=4-H Thrive|last=Resources|first=University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural|website=4h.ucanr.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n===UC Natural Reserve System===\nThe [[University of California Natural Reserve System|NRS]] was established in January 1965 to provide UC faculty with large areas of land where they could conduct long-term ecosystem research without having to worry about outside disturbances like tourists. Today, the NRS manages 39 reserves that total more than {{convert|756,000|acre|km2}}.\n\n===Travel and conference facilities===\n* UC Berkeley operates the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station in [[Mo'orea]], [[French Polynesia]] on land donated in 1981 by the heir to the founder of the [[Gump's]] home furnishings store.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Geissinger |first1=Steve |last2=Geissinger |first2=Michael |title=Despite state budget crunch, UC runs 'Fantasy Island' station |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/04/14/despite-state-budget-crunch-uc-runs-fantasy-island-station/ |accessdate=3 February 2019 |work=East Bay Times |publisher=Bay Area News Group |date=14 April 2008}}</ref>\n* UC Berkeley's Cal Alumni Association operates travel excursions for alumni (and their families) under its \"Cal Discoveries Travel\" brand (formerly BearTreks); many of the tour guides are Berkeley professors. CAA also operates the oldest and largest alumni association-run family camp in the world, the Lair of the Golden Bear. Located at an altitude of 5600 feet in [[Pinecrest, Tuolumne County, California|Pinecrest, California]], the Lair is a home-away-from-home for almost 10,000 campers annually. Its attendees are largely Cal alumni and their families, but the Lair is open to everyone.\n* Berkeley Lab operates its own [[hotel]], the Berkeley Lab Guest House, available to persons with business at the Lab itself or UC Berkeley.\n* UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services operates two on-campus hotels, the 61-room Guest House and the 254-room Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center, and a lavish off-campus conference center at [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] (with a mix of chalet-like condominiums, lodge rooms, and stand-alone cottages). During the summer, the Lake Arrowhead conference center hosts the Bruin Woods vacation programs for UCLA alumni and their families. \n* Separately, UCLA Health operates the 100-room Tiverton House just south of the UCLA campus to serve its patients and their families. \n* UC Santa Cruz leased the University Inn and Conference Center in downtown Santa Cruz from 2001 to 2011 for use as off-campus student housing.\n* The UC Office of the President's Education Abroad Program operates two mini-campuses that support UC students, faculty, and alumni overseas: California House in [[London]] and La Casa de la Universidad de California in [[Mexico City]]. UC Davis's UC Center Sacramento supports students [[Internship|interning]] with the [[Government of California|California state government]]. None of these facilities have on-site housing, but there is also a [[University of California, Washington Center|UC Washington Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with a dormitory for students interning with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\n===University Airport===\n[[UC Davis]] operates the [[University Airport]] as a utility airport for [[air shuttle]] service in the contractual transportation of university employees and agricultural samples. It is also a public general aviation airport. University Airport's ICAO identifier is KEDU.\n\n===Seaport===\n[[UC San Diego]]'s [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] owns a seaport, the Nimitz Marine Facility, which is just south of Shelter Island on [[Point Loma]], San Diego. The port is used as an operating base for all of its oceanographic vessels and platforms.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|California|San Francisco Bay Area}}\n* [[Police departments at the University of California]]\n* [[University of California Press]]\n* [[University of California Student Association]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Douglass|first=John Aubrey|title=The California Idea and American Higher Education: 1850 to the 1960 Master Plan|location=Stanford, California|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780804731898}}\n* {{cite book |last=Johnson|first=Dean C.|title=The University of California: History and Achievements|location=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Printing Department|year=1996|isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Marginson |first1=Simon |title=The Dream Is Over: The Crisis of Clark Kerr's California Idea of Higher Education |date=2016 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520966208 |language=en |doi=10.1525/luminos.17 |doi-access=free}}\n* {{cite book |last=Stadtman|first=Verne A.|title=The University of California 1868\u20131968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Co.|year=1970|isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=Stadtman|first=Verne A., editor|title=The Centennial Record of the University of California|location=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Printing Department|year=1967|isbn=}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|University of California}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/}}\n* {{Wikisource portal-inline|University of California}}\n\n{{University of California}}\n{{Navboxes\n|titlestyle = background:#1295D8; color:#FFFFFF; border: 2px solid #FFB511;\n|list =\n{{UCPresidents}}\n{{University of California student newspapers}}\n{{International Forum of Public Universities}}\n{{APRU}}\n{{Public Ivy}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:University of California| ]]\n[[Category:Public universities and colleges in California|University of California system]]\n[[Category:Public university systems in the United States|California, University of]]\n[[Category:Schools accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1868|California, University of]]\n[[Category:1868 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:California culture]]\n", "name_user": "AndyrooP", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed UCSC image to picture of the McHenry Library.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"}
