He was the son of Michael Pfeiffer and Barbara Laquet. The Pfeiffer family family immigrated from France. Their son and his family were among the first European settlers in the area. In the winter of 1869, Michael and Barbara Laquet Pfeiffer were on their way to the south coast of Big Sur when they were forced to stop for the season in the Sycamore Canyon area near present-day Big Sur Village. They liked the area so much they decided against moving south again the following spring. They brought four children with them: Charles, John, Mary Ellen, and Julia. They later had four more:  William, Frank, Flora, and Adelaide. After the [[Homestead Acts#Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act of 1862]] was passed by Congress, he filed for patents on his land in 1883 and 1889.<ref>{{cite web |title=Micheal Pfeiffer of Monterey County {{!}} 2 Land Patents |url=https://thelandpatents.com/owners/1112682 |website=The Land Patents |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hikinginbigsur.com/hikes_oakgrove.html|title= Hiking in Big Sur - Oak Grove Trail Loop|website=HikingInBigSur.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Many features in Big Sur are named for the descendants of the Pfeiffers.\n\nIn 1930, John Pfeiffer was offered $210,000 for his land by a Los Angeles developer who intended to build a subdivision.

The next year the Boy Scouts built Camp Esselen at another location within the park. This site was improved until 1945, when limitations of the site, closeness to public camping facilities, and jurisdictional conflicts between the Scouts and the state forced the council to request reimbursement from the state for $8,000 in improvements.

He was the son of Michael Pfeiffer and Barbara Laquet. The Pfeiffer family family immigrated from France. Their son and his family were among the first European settlers in the area. In the winter of 1869, Michael and Barbara Laquet Pfeiffer were on their way to the south coast of Big Sur when they were forced to stop for the season in the Sycamore Canyon area near present-day Big Sur Village. They liked the area so much they decided against moving south again the following spring. They brought four children with them: Charles, John, Mary Ellen, and Julia. They later had four more:  William, Frank, Flora, and Adelaide. After the [[Homestead Acts#Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act of 1862]] was passed by Congress, he filed for patents on his land in 1883 and 1889.<ref>{{cite web |title=Micheal Pfeiffer of Monterey County {{!}} 2 Land Patents |url=https://thelandpatents.com/owners/1112682 |website=The Land Patents |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hikinginbigsur.com/hikes_oakgrove.html|title= Hiking in Big Sur - Oak Grove Trail Loop|website=HikingInBigSur.com|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Many features in Big Sur are named for the descendants of the Pfeiffers.\n\nIn 1930, John Pfeiffer was offered $210,000 by a developer for his land by a Los Angeles developer who intended to build a subdivision.

The next year the Boy Scouts built Camp Esselen at another location within the park. This site was improved until 1945, when limitations of the site, closeness to public camping facilities, and jurisdictional conflicts between the Scouts and the state forced the council to request reimbursement from the state for $8,000 in improvements. The council continued to use the camp until 1953.

I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\n==== Conspiracy or coordination ====\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts.

Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, ''e.g.'', Justice Manual \u00a7\u00a7 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or \"taint\") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United States.

I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\n==== Conspiracy or coordination ====\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts.

Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, ''e.g.'', Justice Manual \u00a7\u00a7 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or \"taint\") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United States.

With the launching of [[MTV Base|MTV Base Africa]], artists within West Africa were able to grant themselves a large platform. Artists such as [[M.I Abaga|MI Abaga]], [[Naeto C]], and [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] were among the first to take advantage of this, however most of the artists were merely making interpretations of hip hop and R&B. While this allowed them to build local audiences, it blocked them from a wider platform due to the language barriers in-place. [[P-Square]] released their album ''[[Game Over (P-Square album)|Game Over]]'' in 2007, which was unique for its usage of Nigerian rhythms and melodies. Meanwhile, artists such as [[Flavour N'abania]] were able to find success by embracing older genres, such as [[highlife]], and remixing it into something more modern, as seen in his song \"[[Nwa Baby|Nwa Baby (Ashawo Remix)]]\". By 2011, artists within the burgeoning scene were beginning to become stars across the continent. P-Square released \"[[Chop My Money|Chop My Money (Remix)]]\" alongside popular Senegalese-American artist [[Akon]] in 2011.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nHowever it wasn't until \"[[Oliver Twist (D'banj song)|Oliver Twist]]\", released by Nigerian artist [[D'banj]] in the summer of 2011, that afrobeats first saw international success.

With the launching of [[MTV Base|MTV Base Africa]], artists within West Africa were able to grant themselves a large platform. Artists such as [[M.I Abaga|MI Abaga]], [[Naeto C]], and [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] were among the first to take advantage of this, however most of the artists were merely making interpretations of hip hop and R&B. While this allowed them to build local audiences, it blocked them from a wider platform due to the language barriers in-place. [[P-Square]] released their album ''[[Game Over (P-Square album)|Game Over]]'' in 2007, which was unique for its usage of Nigerian rhythms and melodies. Meanwhile, artists such as [[Flavour N'abania]] were able to find success by embracing older genres, such as [[highlife]], and remixing it into something more modern, as seen in his song \"[[Nwa Baby|Nwa Baby (Ashawo Remix)]]\". By 2011, artists within the burgeoning scene were beginning to become stars across the continent. P-Square released \"[[Chop My Money|Chop My Money (Remix)]]\" alongside popular Senegalese-American artist [[Akon]] in 2011.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nHowever it wasn't until \"[[Oliver Twist (D'banj song)|Oliver Twist]]\", released by Nigerian artist [[D'banj]] in the summer of 2011, that afrobeats first saw international success.

As the delayed train waited for the signals to change, one of the travellers remarked \"where the b... hell are we?\" and the reply became the basis for the immortal joke about Wigan's Pier.  [[George Formby, Sr.]] perpetuated the joke around the turn of the century in the music halls in Wigan, adding that when he passed the Pier he noticed the tide was in (referring to the constant flooding in the low-lying area). Formby died in February 1921, and with the demise of the [[Colliery|collieries]] in the area, the gantry had long passed out of existence.

It was horribly cold. The \u2018flashes\u2019 were covered with ice the colour of raw umber, the bargemen were muffled to the eyes in sacks, the lock gates wore beards of ice. It seemed a world from which vegetation had been banished; nothing existed except smoke, shale, ice, mud, ashes, and foul water.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=George Orwell|title=The Road to Wigan Pier, ch 7|date=1937}}</ref>\n\nToday, the slag heaps have been removed or landscaped with trees, the factories are closed or converted to housing, and the canal is only used for recreational boating and fishing.\n\n==Existing buildings==\nThe pier was at the end of a [[narrow gauge]] [[tramway (mineral)|tramway]] from a colliery. The wagons would be brought right to the edge of the canal to be tippled so that their contents went straight into the waiting barges. The original wooden pier is believed to have been demolished in 1929, with the iron from the tippler being sold as scrap. Because of the more recent pride in the area's heritage, a replica tippler, consisting of two curved rails, has been erected at the original location.<ref name=pww />\n\n[[Image:wigan terminus warehouse.jpg|thumb|left|The original terminus of the canal, completed 1777]]\n[[File:The Orwell at Wigan Pier, 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Gibson's Warehouse was built in 1777 and is now ''The Orwell at Wigan Pier'']]\nThe former Wigan Terminus Warehouses were built in the eighteenth century and refurbished in the 1980s.
