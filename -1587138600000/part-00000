Although he was trained in Orthodox seminaries in Berlin, he believed there was a need for an institution providing a dual curriculum of secular [[academic]] studies and religious [[Torah]] studies.\n\nThe founders of the university hoped to produce [[alumni]] committed to Jewish religious tradition, Zionist ideology, and science. In 1965, the professors and lecturers were all religious Jews, as were the majority of students. [[Yosef Burg]], one of the prominent leaders of the [[religious Zionist movement]], warned that admission of too many non-religious into the university could undermine its character: \"If you spill too much water into a wine bottle, you will have no wine.\" Today, the student population includes secular and non-Jewish students, including [[Arab]]s. Seven courses in [[Jewish studies]] are required for graduation. In hiring senior academic staff, the university used to give preference to religious Jews,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} although this is no longer true, and the faculty includes many secular Jewish members, and also Arab faculty, such as Dr. Totry - Jubran Manal at the law faculty. Presidents who followed were [[Max Jammer]] (1967\u201377), [[Emanuel Rackman]] (1977\u201386), [[Michael Albeck]] (1986\u201389), [[Ernest Krausz]] (1989), [[Zvi Arad]] (1989\u201392), and [[Shlomo Eckstein]] (1992-96).<ref name=\"autogeneratedil\"/>\n\n[[Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin's]] convicted assassin, [[Yigal Amir]], was a student of law and computer science at Bar-Ilan, prompting charges that the university had become a hotbed of political [[extremism]].

It houses over 30 laboratories investigating brain complexity at multiple levels, from single [[neuron]]s, through information processing and computations in neural networks to cognition, behavior and human mind. The center's core members and affiliates combine multiple fields that are crucial for brain understanding, including molecular and systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, linguistics, mathematics, computer sciences, engineering and physics. Numerous research approaches are employed by the center's scientists, such as brain stimulation techniques, neuroimaging, electrophysiology, molecular techniques, computational methods, mathematical modeling and behavioral and cognitive paradigms. The center was founded in 2002 thanks to the contributions of the Gonda family, the president of Bar-Ilan University Moshe Kaveh, and [[Moshe Abeles]], a pioneer of Israel's neuroscience research, [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture|Emet Prize]] laureate (2004) and the founding director of the [[Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation]] at the Hebrew University (1992\u20131999), has led the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center for nearly a decade. Since 2011, the center is headed by [[Moshe Bar (neuroscientist)|Moshe Bar]], a cognitive neuroscientist and an expert in brain imaging technologies. Bar returned to Israel to head the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center as its new director after thirteen years at Harvard University.\n\n=== Magnetoencephalography ===\n\nThe Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center hosts the only [[magnetoencephalography]] facility in Israel, operated by the Electromagnetic Brain Imaging Unit established in 2008. Magnetoencephalography is a brain imaging technique that allows studying human brain responses by measuring the magnetic fields produced by electrical brain activity at superb (millisecond) temporal resolution. The unit is headed by Professor Abraham Goldstein. It is equipped with a 248 [[magnetometer]] sensors whole-head system, positioned inside a double-wall magnetically shielded room by IMEDCO. Once a week, magnetoencephalography is dedicated to serving the community by providing clinical and diagnostic services, such as localization of epileptic foci, via BrainMap.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{see also|Category:Bar-Ilan University alumni}}\n[[File:Gila Gamliel.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Gila Gamliel]]]]\n[[File:Tzipi Livni 2.JPG|thumb|80px|[[Tzipi Livni]]]]\n[[File:Ami Ayalon.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Ami Ayalon]]]] \n* [[Zvi Arad]] (1942-2018) - mathematician, acting President of Bar-Ilan University, President of [[Netanya Academic College]]\n* [[Ami Ayalon]] - Former head of the [[Shin Bet]] and member of the [[Knesset]] for the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]].\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]] - Israeli politician and formerly a member of the Knesset for the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union Party]].\n* [[Kotel Da-Don]] - Croatian [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi of the Bet Israel community in Zagreb.\n* [[Avi Dichter]] - current Minister of Home Front Defence.

Although he was trained in Orthodox seminaries in Berlin, he believed there was a need for an institution providing a dual curriculum of secular [[academic]] studies and religious [[Torah]] studies.\n\nThe founders of the university hoped to produce [[alumni]] committed to Jewish religious tradition, Zionist ideology, and science. In 1965, the professors and lecturers were all religious Jews, as were the majority of students. [[Yosef Burg]], one of the prominent leaders of the [[religious Zionist movement]], warned that admission of too many non-religious into the university could undermine its character: \"If you spill too much water into a wine bottle, you will have no wine.\" Today, the student population includes secular and non-Jewish students, including [[Arab]]s. Seven courses in [[Jewish studies]] are required for graduation. In hiring senior academic staff, the university used to give preference to religious Jews,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} although this is no longer true, and the faculty includes many secular Jewish members, and also Arab faculty, such as Dr. Totry - Jubran Manal at the law faculty. Presidents who followed were [[Max Jammer]] (1967-77), [[Emanuel Rackman]] (1977-86), [[Michael Albeck]] (1986-89), [[Ernest Krausz]] (1989), [[Zvi Arad]] (1989-92), and [[Shlomo Eckstein]] (1992-96).<ref name=\"autogeneratedil\"/>\n\n[[Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin's]] convicted assassin, [[Yigal Amir]], was a student of law and computer science at Bar-Ilan, prompting charges that the university had become a hotbed of political [[extremism]].

The center offers several graduate level tracks, including a direct Ph.D. program, an M.Sc. program, and a combined program. Candidates are accepted from a variety of backgrounds, including biology, psychology, mathematics, physics, and computer science. Accepted students are exempt from tuition and receive a full scholarship during the course of their studies, allowing to fully concentrate on the research.\n\nThe Ph.D. training program builds on six single-semester required core courses, a set of preparatory courses, and a variety of elective courses. Students have to complete 8 credits in advanced courses. Additionally, students participate in a number of multidisciplinary activities including a weekly research seminar and two hands-on short-term research projects. Several advanced optional courses are available, allowing students to specialize in one of the three sub-fields:\n\n1. Computational Neuroscience\n\n2. Neurobiology and Behavior\n\n3. Language and Cognition\n\nThe center also offers an undergraduate interdisciplinary program in neuroscience, providing a solid knowledge base in wide range of neuroscience related disciplines, such as life sciences, psychology, linguistics, mathematics and computer sciences, and physics, with a specialization in the field of choice.\n\nThe center takes part in the summer science research internship program, where undergraduate science majors from American universities perform research internships in Bar-Ilan labs under the mentorship of faculty members.\n\n===Special programs===\nBar-Ilan offers an International B.A. Program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biuinternational.com |title=International B.A. Programs: Bar-Ilan University &#124; Israel's premier university for Olim and Overseas students!International B.A. Programs: Bar-Ilan University &#124; Israel's premier university for Olim and Overseas students! |publisher=Biuinternational.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref> taught entirely in [[English language|English]], and is the first university in Israel to offer a full undergraduate program taught entirely in English.

It houses over 30 laboratories investigating brain complexity at multiple levels, from single [[neuron]]s, through information processing and computations in neural networks to cognition, behavior and human mind. The center's core members and affiliates combine multiple fields that are crucial for brain understanding, including molecular and systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, linguistics, mathematics, computer sciences, engineering and physics. Numerous research approaches are employed by the center's scientists, such as brain stimulation techniques, neuroimaging, electrophysiology, molecular techniques, computational methods, mathematical modeling and behavioral and cognitive paradigms. The center was founded in 2002 thanks to the contributions of the Gonda family, the president of Bar-Ilan University Moshe Kaveh, and [[Moshe Abeles]], a pioneer of Israel's neuroscience research, [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture|Emet Prize]] laureate (2004) and the founding director of the [[Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation]] at the Hebrew University (1992\u20131999), has led the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center for nearly a decade. Since 2011, the center is headed by [[Moshe Bar (neuroscientist)|Moshe Bar]], a cognitive neuroscientist and an expert in brain imaging technologies. Bar returned to Israel to head the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center as its new director after thirteen years at Harvard University.\n\n=== Magnetoencephalography ===\n\nThe Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center hosts the only [[magnetoencephalography]] facility in Israel, operated by the Electromagnetic Brain Imaging Unit established in 2008. Magnetoencephalography is a brain imaging technique that allows studying human brain responses by measuring the magnetic fields produced by electrical brain activity at superb (millisecond) temporal resolution. The unit is headed by Professor Abraham Goldstein. It is equipped with a 248 [[magnetometer]] sensors whole-head system, positioned inside a double-wall magnetically shielded room by IMEDCO. Once a week, magnetoencephalography is dedicated to serving the community by providing clinical and diagnostic services, such as localization of epileptic foci, via BrainMap.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{see also|Category:Bar-Ilan University alumni}}\n[[File:Gila Gamliel.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Gila Gamliel]]]]\n[[File:Tzipi Livni 2.JPG|thumb|80px|[[Tzipi Livni]]]]\n[[File:Ami Ayalon.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Ami Ayalon]]]] \n* [[Zvi Arad]] (1942-2018) - mathematician, acting President of Bar-Ilan University, President of [[Netanya Academic College]]\n* [[Ami Ayalon]] - Former head of the [[Shin Bet]] and member of the [[Knesset]] for the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]].\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]] - Israeli politician and formerly a member of the Knesset for the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union Party]].\n* [[Kotel Da-Don]] - Croatian [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi of the Bet Israel community in Zagreb.\n* [[Avi Dichter]] - current Minister of Home Front Defence.

This means that before becoming Denton citizens, the \u201cresidents had virtually no access to municipal services (i.e., garbage, sanitation, fire protection, street repair, lights, water utilities, etc.)\u201d<ref>https://www.liberationnews.org/this-neighborhood-in-denton-has-had-poisoned-water-for-decades-now-theyre-fighting-back/</ref> With a history of neglected basic public services, residents of the Green Tree Estates have not felt as if they have a voice in their community. Even after being annexed by the city of Denton, \u201cthe water remains undrinkable, and other municipal services have failed to materialize.\u201d<ref>https://www.liberationnews.org/this-neighborhood-in-denton-has-had-poisoned-water-for-decades-now-theyre-fighting-back/</ref> Around October of 2019, system owner, Don Roddy, made plans to cut the community\u2019s water system without giving the appropriate 120-day notification as required by the Texas Public Utilities Commission. <ref>https://www.liberationnews.org/this-neighborhood-in-denton-has-had-poisoned-water-for-decades-now-theyre-fighting-back/</ref> Roddy denied Denton City Council\u2019s request to keep the water system going until a resolution was found. The city then reached out to the Public Utility Commission and requested the PUC enforce the full 120-day notice.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/water-options-running-low-for-small-mobile-home-neighborhood/article_555c6e97-92d0-5d37-b237-3c2c55167ef9.html</ref> In the first neighborhood meeting to address the issue, Denton\u2019s director of utilities, Ken Banks, estimated that bringing in a modern water system to the neighborhood would exceed $500,000. An attending representative sent from the PUC maintained that the city could not enforce a longer notice, but declined to make any further public statement. Furthermore, \u201cthe Public Utility Commission would not accept the city\u2019s evidence that the well was a retail utility and thus subject to the longer notice.\u201d<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/water-options-running-low-for-small-mobile-home-neighborhood/article_555c6e97-92d0-5d37-b237-3c2c55167ef9.html</ref> <ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/mayor-to-declare-public-emergency-for-green-tree-water-supply/article_183fc397-f58d-5231-9798-b573c66a4182.html</ref> It was later reported that Roddy had reached out to the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality and reported some of the connections were illegal, allowing Roddy to disconnect service at any time.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton/small-denton-neighborhood-seeks-viable-water-options-as-they-prepare-to-lose-current-service/article_d26a6601-c96a-5620-939c-a9d0c3063953.html</ref> A second neighborhood meeting was held two weeks later to discuss next steps. City Manager, Todd Hileman, discussed how declaring the situation as an emergency would allow for temporary funding to ease the situation until a more permanent plan could be put into action. A translator was present at this meeting to convey information to the Green Tree Estates residents. The residents disagreed with other temporary city plans to alleviate the issue, including the idea to bring in portable toilets and a central community shower trailer.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-city-council-could-declare-emergency-for-residents-of-green-tree-estates/article_82aa8360-d6b9-54b2-92fb-16f5426e38d3.html</ref> The residents expressed that as tax-paying citizens, they were seeking equitable benefits that any other Denton resident would receive. Deputy City Manager, Mario Canizares, recognized that the residents had \u201cno problem paying. It\u2019s just getting the water there that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Other council members addressed concerns about the legality of some of the solutions posed, as well as concerns regarding the plumbing and electrical work being too difficult to install in the mobile homes.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/mayor-to-declare-public-emergency-for-green-tree-water-supply/article_183fc397-f58d-5231-9798-b573c66a4182.html</ref> \n\nOn November 13, 2019, Denton Mayor, Chris Watts, issued a declaration of a local state of disaster for the Green Tree Estates neighborhood before the water service would be discontinued. This allowed for 90-day temporary funding for the Green Tree Estates residents.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/mayor-declares-disaster-for-green-tree-estates/article_eb37b512-6dbb-5665-a454-714907663225.html</ref> The next day, the city of Denton delivered 55-gallon barrels for the residents to fill up before their water was turned off. However, the existing water was such poor quality that these drums were considered useless by any resident who did not have access to a filter.<ref>https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/denton-county/a-small-community-in-denton-braces-to-lose-water-friday/287-eb0dee86-f9ea-4ba0-8809-113b0756315c</ref> The following day a special city council meeting was scheduled to discuss next steps. It was decided that the city would supply the community with 14 275-gallon tanks filled with non-potable water. The city also made plans to refill the containers regularly. Green Tree Estates residents expressed their concerns that this was not going to be enough water to support their entire families.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-votes-to-provide-temporary-water-services-to-green-tree-estates-for-90-days/article_1d3ba7f2-c13f-5b85-8f29-ed0d267600bd.htm</ref> On December 10, 2019, \u201cthe Denton City Council agreed to extend an emergency declaration over water service to the Green Tree Estates until school lets out in May.\u201d Around this same time, \u201ca housing advocacy group threatened to file a fair housing complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on behalf of Green Tree Estates.\u201d The group's coordinator ultimately decided to put a hold on filing the complaint due to the city's decision to extend the emergency declaration. While long-term plans had been discussed, costs were a concern for both residents and city council members. It was decided that commitment towards a long-term solution would be made in February 2020. City leaders asked for the cooperation from the Green Tree Estates residents regarding conducting home inspections as well as helping to identify which residents owned their properties and which were tenants. Through these actions, \u201cadvocacy groups and the city of Denton could work together on the needed easements for new water lines.\u201d City manager, Todd Hileman, claimed that the city\u2019s ability to get those easements was \u201ckey\u201d to settling on a long-term solution. However, residents of the Green Tree Estates expressed confusion stating that they didn\u2019t understand what was being asked of them.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-to-extend-emergency-declaration-for-green-tree-through-may/article_eacda077-f51e-51a0-b245-bb3e56b2c0f1.html</ref> \n\nBy February 4, 2020, none of the 14 families living in the Green Tree Estates had completed the courtesy inspections of their homes from the city of Denton. Instead, the neighborhood\u2019s attorney recommended the residents bring in their own inspectors. A Univision television reporter reported that \u201cthe residents want to calculate the total costs before deciding to connect to the system.\u201d Lastly, the residents told the deputy director of public affairs that they needed more time for the assessments and the work and asked the city council to extend the public emergency until May 2021. Some council members were uneasy with the request for the extension to continue for more than a year, but other members were more comfortable with it as long as progress is shown to be made.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-continues-to-work-with-green-tree-residents-on-water-issue/article_e8e7f6d9-39eb-5587-8457-985fe57d47aa.html</ref> It was decided at a later meeting that council would revisit the issue on April 21 to assess which the residents can connect to Denton\u2019s main water system.<ref>https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/for-neighbors-with-serious-water-worries-the-future-is-unclear/287-d0e45259-d986-48c0-98d1-4bdfc33fbac5</ref> \n== '''Outside organizational contributions''' ==\n\u201c[[Habitat for Humanity]] of Denton County is stepping in to help residents look for ways to pay for the installation and help the city with the logistics.\u201d<ref>https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/for-neighbors-with-serious-water-worries-the-future-is-unclear/287-d0e45259-d986-48c0-98d1-4bdfc33fbac5</ref> [[League of United Latin American Citizens]](LULAC) is an organization that seeks to advance the economic condition, educational attainment, political influence, housing, health and civil rights of Hispanic Americans through community-based programs.<ref>https://lulac.org/about/</ref> LULAC has been organizing ways to help the community and make sure their needs are met.

This means that before becoming Denton citizens, the \u201cresidents had virtually no access to municipal services (i.e., garbage, sanitation, fire protection, street repair, lights, water utilities, etc.)\u201d<ref>https://www.liberationnews.org/this-neighborhood-in-denton-has-had-poisoned-water-for-decades-now-theyre-fighting-back/</ref> With a history of neglection to basic public services, residents of the Green Tree Estates have not felt as if they have a voice in their community. Even after being annexed by the city of Denton, \u201cthe water remains undrinkable, and other municipal services have failed to materialize.\u201d<ref>https://www.liberationnews.org/this-neighborhood-in-denton-has-had-poisoned-water-for-decades-now-theyre-fighting-back/</ref> Around October of 2019, system owner, Don Roddy, made plans to cut the community\u2019s water system without giving the appropriate 120-day notification as required by the Texas Public Utilities Commission. <ref>https://www.liberationnews.org/this-neighborhood-in-denton-has-had-poisoned-water-for-decades-now-theyre-fighting-back/</ref> Roddy denied Denton City Council\u2019s request to keep the water system going until a resolution was found. The city then reached out to the Public Utility Commission and requested the PUC enforce the full 120-day notice.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/water-options-running-low-for-small-mobile-home-neighborhood/article_555c6e97-92d0-5d37-b237-3c2c55167ef9.html</ref> In the first neighborhood meeting to address the issue, Denton\u2019s director of utilities, Ken Banks, estimated that bringing in a modern water system to the neighborhood would exceed $500,000. An attending representative sent from the PUC maintained that the city could not enforce a longer notice, but declined to make any further public statement. Furthermore, \u201cthe Public Utility Commission would not accept the city\u2019s evidence that the well was a retail utility and thus subject to the longer notice.\u201d<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/water-options-running-low-for-small-mobile-home-neighborhood/article_555c6e97-92d0-5d37-b237-3c2c55167ef9.html</ref> <ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/mayor-to-declare-public-emergency-for-green-tree-water-supply/article_183fc397-f58d-5231-9798-b573c66a4182.html</ref> It was later reported that Roddy had reached out to the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality and reported some of the connections were illegal, allowing Roddy to disconnect service at any time.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton/small-denton-neighborhood-seeks-viable-water-options-as-they-prepare-to-lose-current-service/article_d26a6601-c96a-5620-939c-a9d0c3063953.html</ref> A second neighborhood meeting was held two weeks later to discuss next steps. City Manager, Todd Hileman, discussed how declaring the situation as an emergency would allow for temporary funding to ease the situation until a more permanent plan could be put into action. A translator was present at this meeting to convey information to the Green Tree Estates residents. The residents disagreed with other temporary city plans to alleviate the issue, including the idea to bring in portable toilets and a central community shower trailer.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-city-council-could-declare-emergency-for-residents-of-green-tree-estates/article_82aa8360-d6b9-54b2-92fb-16f5426e38d3.html</ref> The residents expressed that as tax-paying citizens, they were seeking equitable benefits that any other Denton resident would receive. Deputy City Manager, Mario Canizares, recognized that the residents had \u201cno problem paying. It\u2019s just getting the water there that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Other council members addressed concerns about the legality of some of the solutions posed, as well as concerns regarding the plumbing and electrical work being too difficult to install in the mobile homes.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/mayor-to-declare-public-emergency-for-green-tree-water-supply/article_183fc397-f58d-5231-9798-b573c66a4182.html</ref> \n\nOn November 13, 2019, Denton Mayor, Chris Watts, issued a declaration of a local state of disaster for the Green Tree Estates neighborhood before the water service would be discontinued. This allowed for 90-day temporary funding for the Green Tree Estates residents.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/mayor-declares-disaster-for-green-tree-estates/article_eb37b512-6dbb-5665-a454-714907663225.html</ref> The next day, the city of Denton delivered 55-gallon barrels for the residents to fill up before their water was turned off. However, the existing water was such poor quality that these drums were considered useless by any resident who did not have access to a filter.<ref>https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/denton-county/a-small-community-in-denton-braces-to-lose-water-friday/287-eb0dee86-f9ea-4ba0-8809-113b0756315c</ref> The following day a special city council meeting was scheduled to discuss next steps. It was decided that the city would supply the community with 14 275-gallon tanks filled with non-potable water. The city also made plans to refill the containers regularly. Green Tree Estates residents expressed their concerns that this was not going to be enough water to support their entire families.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-votes-to-provide-temporary-water-services-to-green-tree-estates-for-90-days/article_1d3ba7f2-c13f-5b85-8f29-ed0d267600bd.htm</ref> On December 10, 2019, \u201cthe Denton City Council agreed to extend an emergency declaration over water service to the Green Tree Estates until school lets out in May.\u201d Around this same time, \u201ca housing advocacy group threatened to file a fair housing complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on behalf of Green Tree Estates.\u201d The group's coordinator ultimately decided to put a hold on filing the complaint due to the city's decision to extend the emergency declaration. While long-term plans had been discussed, costs were a concern for both residents and city council members. It was decided that commitment towards a long-term solution would be made in February 2020. City leaders asked for the cooperation from the Green Tree Estates residents regarding conducting home inspections as well as helping to identify which residents owned their properties and which were tenants. Through these actions, \u201cadvocacy groups and the city of Denton could work together on the needed easements for new water lines.\u201d City manager, Todd Hileman, claimed that the city\u2019s ability to get those easements was \u201ckey\u201d to settling on a long-term solution. However, residents of the Green Tree Estates expressed confusion stating that they didn\u2019t understand what was being asked of them.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-to-extend-emergency-declaration-for-green-tree-through-may/article_eacda077-f51e-51a0-b245-bb3e56b2c0f1.html</ref> \n\nBy February 4, 2020, none of the 14 families living in the Green Tree Estates had completed the courtesy inspections of their homes from the city of Denton. Instead, the neighborhood\u2019s attorney recommended the residents bring in their own inspectors. A Univision television reporter reported that \u201cthe residents want to calculate the total costs before deciding to connect to the system.\u201d Lastly, the residents told the deputy director of public affairs that they needed more time for the assessments and the work and asked the city council to extend the public emergency until May 2021. Some council members were uneasy with the request for the extension to continue for more than a year, but other members were more comfortable with it as long as progress is shown to be made.<ref>https://dentonrc.com/news/denton-continues-to-work-with-green-tree-residents-on-water-issue/article_e8e7f6d9-39eb-5587-8457-985fe57d47aa.html</ref> It was decided at a later meeting that council would revisit the issue on April 21 to assess which the residents can connect to Denton\u2019s main water system.<ref>https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/for-neighbors-with-serious-water-worries-the-future-is-unclear/287-d0e45259-d986-48c0-98d1-4bdfc33fbac5</ref> \n== '''Outside organizational contributions''' ==\n\u201cHabitat for Humanity of Denton County is stepping in to help residents look for ways to pay for the installation and help the city with the logistics.\u201d<ref>https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/for-neighbors-with-serious-water-worries-the-future-is-unclear/287-d0e45259-d986-48c0-98d1-4bdfc33fbac5</ref> League of United Latin American Citizens(LULAC) is an organization that seeks to advance the economic condition, educational attainment, political influence, housing, health and civil rights of Hispanic Americans through community-based programs.<ref>https://lulac.org/about/</ref> LULAC has been organizing ways to help the community and make sure their needs are met.

International students attend this campus, as well as academics in special programs. It is the campus for most students in their third or fourth years. It is the location of the office of the university president, as well as the international college, the graduate school, and other faculties. There are laboratories, classrooms, seminar rooms, libraries, computer centre, and an indoor sports centre. An art gallery, the Bangkok University Gallery (BUG), opened on the campus in 2006.

Also on the campus are the Bangkok University Stadium, home stadium of [[Bangkok University FC]], [[Thailand Premier League 2006]] champions, the Surat Osathanugrah Library, and Pongtip Osathanugrah Communication Arts Complex. The BU Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum, an important archaeological research facility, is on the Rangsit campus.
