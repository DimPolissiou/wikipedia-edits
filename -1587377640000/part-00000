It was released in January 2015 as the second single from their debut studio album, ''[[Start Here (album)|Start Here]]''. The song, written by the duo and Tiffany Vartanyan, is an inspirational anthem about a girl wanting to find success. It garnered a positive reception from critics praising the production and the girls' vocal performances for elevating the overall theme of the song.\n\n\"Fly\" peaked at number nine on both the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Country Airplay]] and [[Hot Country Songs]] charts respectively. It also charted at number 61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart. The song was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and has sold over 321,000 copies in that country as of November 2015. It received similar chart success in Canada, peaking at number 18 on the [[Canada Country|Country]] chart and number 66 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song, directed by Brian Lazzaro, features the duo writing and performing the song while intercut with images of butterflies, babies playing and children climbing on ropes and ladders. A second video has the duo performing at the [[Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt]] while also showing patients performing on stage and interacting with their doctors.\n\n==Content==\nThe song is an inspirational song primarily backed by acoustic instruments and by a prominent [[fiddle]] and it's in the key of F major. The song is in strong contrast with the duo's previous single \"[[Girl in a Country Song]]\": while the latter used irony and satire to criticize Nashville\u2019s emphasis on dated and exploitive female stereotypes, \"Fly\" delivers a sincere narrative account of a girl striving for success.\n\n{{\" '}}Fly' is not about when the going's easy and the path's smooth,\u201d Taylor Dye shared about the song. \"It's when everything's going wrong\u2026 when you're sure it's not going to happen\u2026 and somehow still take that step.

It is the northernmost [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] in the country, and also the smallest, both in population and land area. Its [[capital city|capital]] is [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]] located on the island of [[Batan Island|Batan]].<!--Batanes means \"Islands of batan\"-->\n\nThe island group is located approximately {{convert|162|km}} north of the [[Luzon]] mainland and about {{convert|190|km|mi|abbr=off}} south of [[Taiwan]], separated from the [[Babuyan Islands]] of [[Cagayan|Cagayan Province]] by the [[Balintang Channel]], and from Taiwan by the [[Bashi Channel]]. The entire province is listed in the [[UNESCO]] tentative list for inscription in the [[World Heritage List]]. The government has been finalizing the site's inscription, establishing museums and conservation programs since 2001. The government aims to push for the site's inclusion between 2018 and 2019. Seven intangible heritage elements of the Ivatan have been set by the Philippine government in its initial inventory in 2012. The elements are undergoing a process to be included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]] between 2018 and 2025.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Batanes'' derives from the words ''Batan'', the local word for the Ivatan people.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ivatan Man.jpg|thumb|An Ivatan holding one of many types of traditional Ivatan baskets.]]\nThe ancestors of today's Ivatans descended from Austronesians who migrated to the islands 4,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. They lived in fortified mountain areas called ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'' and drank sugar-cane wine, or ''palek''. They also used gold as currency and produced a thriving agriculture-based industry. They were also seafarers and boat-builders.\n\nIn 1687, a crew of English [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]] headed by [[William Dampier]] came with a Dutch crew and named the islands in honour of their country's nobility. Itbayat was named \"Orange Isle\" after [[William III of England|William of Orange]], and Batan was named \"Grafton Isle\" after [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton]]. Sabtang Isle was named \"Monmouth Isle\" after [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]]. Capt. Dampier stayed for less than three months, and did not claim the islands for the British crown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hgz91?refreqid=excelsior:e1a088eb56e01b6e796960adc0b44a24|title=4000 Years of Migration and Cultural Exchange: The Archaeology of the Batanes Islands, Northern Philippines on JSTOR|website=www.jstor.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the auspices of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas]]. The Bashi Channel was increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control.<ref>Howard T. Fry, \"The Eastern Passage and Its Impact on Spanish Policy in the Philippines, 1758\u20131790\", ''Philippine Studies,'' vol.33, First Quarter, 1985, pp.3\u201321, p.18.</ref> The [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]] remained on their ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'', or mountain fortresses for some time. In 1790, Governor Guerrero {{Clarify|date=February 2007|reason=The Governor-general of the Philippines at this point in time is [[F\u00e9lix Berenguer de Marquina]], unless Guerrero refers to a governor of Batanes.}} decreed that Ivatans were to live in the lowlands and leave their remote ''idjang''. The mangpus, the indigenous Ivatan leader of the islands during that time, made a revolution against the Spaniards afterwards. With much ammunition and steel armors, the Spanish authorities quelled the uprising, effectively subjugating the rebels. Basco and Ivana were the first towns established under full Spanish control. Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana. Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge. Soon, Ilocanos came to the islands and integrated with the local population. Roads, ports, bridges, churches and government buildings were built in this time. Limestone technology used by the Spanish was also spread to the islands, making bridges strong and fortified. Some of these bridges still remain at Ivana and Mahatao. By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became ''ilustrados'', who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the [[Katipunan]]. These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.{{citation needed}}\n\nToward the end of the Spanish administration, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan. In 1909, the new American authorities organized it into an independent province. During the American colonial period, additional public schools were constructed and more Ivatan became aware of their place in the Philippines. In 1920, the first wireless telegraph was installed, followed by an airfield in 1930. New roads were constructed and the Batanes High School was instituted.{{citation needed}}\n\nBecause of their strategic location, the islands was one of the first points occupied by invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Pacific War]]. The morning of December 8, 1941, the Batan Task Force from [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] landed on the Batan Islands, which became the first American territory occupied by the Japanese. The purpose of the invasion was to secure the existing small airfield outside Basco, which was accomplished without resistance. Japanese fighters from Basco took part in the raid on [[History of Clark Air Base|Clark Air Base]] the following day. However, over the next several days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco unnecessary, and on December 10, 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn to participate in the [[Japanese invasion of Camiguin Island|invasion of Camiguin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Landings|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-6.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first School Superintendents on Batan was [[Victor de Padua]], an Ilocano, who in 1942\u201345 during the Japanese occupation was made Provincial Governor. Early in 1945 the island was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 12th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. In 1984, [[Pacita Abad]], the foremost Ivatan visual artist, became the first woman to be awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) award, breaking 25 years of male dominance. In her acceptance speech, she said, \"it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women\u201d and referred proudly to her mother.<ref>https://www.pacitaabad.com/Activities/Awards.php</ref>\n[[File:Oldest House in Ivatan.jpg|thumb|A ''Sinadumparan'' Ivatan house, one of the oldest structures in the Batanes islands. The house is made of [[limestone]] and [[coral]] and its roofing of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon grass]].]]\nIn 1993, the Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, which encompassed the entire province, was listed in the Tentative List of the Philippines for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] inscription in the future.<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/521/</ref> In 1997, the Indigenous Peoples Rights act or IPRA was passed in Philippine Congress. the law paved the way for the indigenous territorial rights of the Ivatans. The province has since promoted its Ivatan roots. Part of the Ilocano population has returned to mainland Luzon. In December 7, 2004, [[Pacita Abad]] died after finishing her last international art work while suffering from cancer.<ref>http://www.artnet.com/artists/pacita-abad/biography</ref>\n\n{{Back to contents}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe province has a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} comprising ten islands situated within the [[Luzon Strait]] between the Balintang Channel and [[Taiwan]]. The islands are sparsely populated and subject to frequent typhoons. The three largest islands, [[Batan Island|Batan]], [[Itbayat Island|Itbayat]], and [[Sabtang Island|Sabtang]], are the only inhabited islands.\n\nThe northernmost island in the province, also the northernmost land in the entire Philippines, is [[Mavulis Island|Mavulis (or Y'ami) Island]]. Other islands in the chain are Misanga (or North), Ditarem, [[Siayan Island|Siayan]], Diogo (or Dinem), [[Ivuhos]], and [[Dequey]]. The islands are part of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]].\n\n===Topography===\nAlmost one-half of Batanes is [[hill]]s and [[mountain]]s. [[Batan Island]] is generally mountainous on the north and southeast. It has a basin in the interior. [[Itbayat Island]] slopes gradually to the west, being mountainous and hilly along its northern, eastern coast. As for Sabtang, mountains cover the central part, making the island slope outward to the coast.\n\nThe islands are situated between the vast expanse of the waters of [[Bashi Channel]] and [[Balintang Channel]], where the Pacific Ocean merges with the China Sea. The area is a sea lane between the [[Philippines]] and [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]. It is rich with marine resources, including the rarest sea [[coral]]s in the world.{{Which|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[File:Batanes Hills.png|thumb|right|Batanes Hills]]\n\nThe province is hilly and mountainous, with only 1,631.5 hectares or 7.1% of its area level to undulating, and 78.2% or 17,994.4 hectares varying from rolling to steep and very steep. Forty two percent (42%) or 9,734.40 hectares are steep to very steep land. Because of the terrain of the province, drainage is good and prolonged flooding is non-existent. The main island of Batan has the largest share of level and nearly level lands, followed by Itbayat and Sabtang, respectively. Itbayat has gently rolling hills and nearly level areas on semi-plateaus surrounded by continuous massive cliffs rising from {{convert|20|to(-)|70|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], with no shorelines. Sabtang has its small flat areas spread sporadically on its coasts, while its interior is dominated by steep mountains and deep canyons. Batan Island and Sabtang have intermittent stretches of sandy beaches and rocky shorelines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe terrain of the province, while picturesque at almost every turn, has limited the potential for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.\n\n[[File:Batanes Stone house.jpg|thumb|Batanes Stone house]]\n\n===Climate===\nBatanes has a [[tropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''). The average yearly temperature is {{convert|26.0|C|F|1}}, and the average monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|22.0|C|F|1}} in January to {{convert|28.5|C|F|1}} in July, similar to that of Southern Taiwan. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year; the rainiest month is August while the driest month is April. November to February are the coldest months. There is a misconception that Batanes is constantly battered by typhoons.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Batanes is mentioned frequently in connection with typhoons, because it holds the northernmost weather station in the Philippines, thus, it is also a reference point for all typhoons that enter the Philippine area; however, in September 2016, [[Typhoon Meranti (2016)|Typhoon Meranti]] impacted the entire province, including a landfall on Itbayat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Steven|title=Eye of typhoon Meranti passes over Philippines' Itbayat|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/eye-of-typhoon-meranti-passes-over-philippines-itbayat/3125510.html|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=Channel NewsAsia|date=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nBatanes is subdivided into 6 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], all encompassed by a [[Legislative district of Batanes|lone congressional district]].\n[[File:Ph fil batanes.png|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Political divisions}}]]\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:white;font-size:95%;border-collapse:collapse;margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!

The remaining faiths are other Christian Churches.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Goats in Batanes.png|thumb|Livestock freely roaming in the green hills in Batanes]]\n\nAn extensive survey of the [[ecology]] of Batanes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quantum-conservation.org/BatanesSurvey20082.htm|title=Final Report Batanes Biodiversity Survey<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=quantum-conservation.org|accessdate=31 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113171159/http://www.quantum-conservation.org/BatanesSurvey20082.htm|archive-date=13 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> provided the scientific basis for confirming the need for a national park in Batanes protecting the Batanes protected landscapes and seascapes, proposed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], submitted on 15 August 1993.

Although it is reportedly growing in some other places such as coasts of [[Luzon]], [[Catanduanes]] and even [[Taiwan]], full blossoming and fruiting are observed only in Batanes. Its fruiting capacity on the island remains a mystery but is likely due to several factors such as climate, soil and type of substratum of the island.\n\nSeveral species of birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the island; many of those are [[endemic]] to the Philippines. The island is also a sanctuary of different [[bird migration|migratory bird]]s during winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAbout 75% of the [[Ivatan people|Ivatans]] are farmers and fishermen. The rest are employed in the government and services sector. Garlic and cattle are major cash crops. Ivatans also plant ''camote'' (sweet potato), cassava, ''gabi'' or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi. Sugarcane is raised to produce ''palek'', a kind of native wine, and vinegar.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, fish catch has declined due to the absence of technical know-how. Employment opportunities are scarce. Most of the educated Ivatans have migrated to urban centers or have gone abroad.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nA [[Wind-Diesel Hybrid Power Systems|wind diesel]] generating plant was commissioned in 2004.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDistance and bad weather work against its economic growth. Certain commodities like rice, soft drinks, and gasoline carry a 75% to 100% mark-up over Manila retail prices.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Transportation==\nThe island province of Batanes is accessible by air via the [[Basco Airport]] and [[Itbayat Airport]]. There are 3 flights per week from [[Manila]] by SkyJetAir, and from [[Tuguegarao]] (Cagayan) by small local airliners (as of January 2013). [[PAL Express]] flies to Batanes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday since May 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyadventurista.com/2013/02/airphil-express-to-launch-manila-batanes-flights-on-may.html|title=Airphil Express flies Manila to Basco (Batanes) starting May 2013|author=|date=|website=pinoyadventurista.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Values==\nThe Ivatan people of Batanes are one of the most [[egalitarian]] societies in the Philippines. The prime motivator of the cultural values of the Ivatans are imbibed in their pre-colonial belief systems of respecting [[nature]] and all people. The Ivatans, both the older and younger generations, have one of the highest incidences of social acceptance to minority groups in the country. The Ivatans also have a high respect for the elderly and the prowess of natural phenomena such as waves, sea breeze, lightning, thunders, earthquakes, and wildlife congregations. Discriminating someone based on skin color, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and traditions on nature is unacceptable in Ivatan values. [[Land grabbing]] is also a grave crime in Ivatan societies, making ancestral domain certification an important part of Ivatan jurisprudence since the enactment of the IPRA Law. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Heritage==\n{{Specific section|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Natural===\n[[File:Sabtang Island, Batanes.JPG|thumb|right|White sand beach at [[Sabtang, Batanes|Sabtang]] island]]\n* ''[[Sabtang Island]]'' is undisturbed and unspoiled. It has intermittent white sand beaches with steep mountains and deep canyons with small level areas sporadically found along the coastline. Southwest of Batan Island, Sabtang is accessible by 30-minute falowa ride from Radiwan Port in Ivana. Sabtang Island is also the take off point for [[Ivuhos]] Island from Barangay Nakanmuan.\n* ''[[Itbayat Island]]'' is located north of Batan Island. Itbayat is shaped like a giant bowl. The island is surrounded by massive boulders and cliffs rising from {{convert|20|to(-)|70|ft|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and has no shoreline. It has a dirt airstrip for light aircraft.

This was done to ensure that the structures\u2014which symbolize the Ivatan's strength and resilience against disasters\u2014outlast the high-pressure winds of typhoon that is expected to unleash. Tapangkos or covering were also installed on the doors and windows of several buildings in Batanes, including the capitol building. During heavy storms it was also a time for bayanihan of the residents as they helped each other tie down roofs.\n\n===Man-made===\n\n* ''Radar Tukon'' was a United States weather station on a hilltop. It offers a magnificent 360-degree view of Batan Island, the South China Sea, Mt. Iraya, Basco proper, boulder lined cliffs and the Pacific Ocean.

The government has been finalizing the site's inscription, establishing museums and conservation programs since 2001. The government aims to push for the site's inclusion between 2018 and 2019. Seven intangible heritage elements of the Ivatan have been set by the Philippine government in its initial inventory in 2012. The elements are undergoing a process to be included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]] between 2018 and 2025.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Batanes'' derives from the words ''Batan'', the local word for the Ivatan people.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ivatan Man.jpg|thumb|An Ivatan holding one of many types of traditional Ivatan baskets.]]\nThe ancestors of today's Ivatans descended from Austronesians who migrated to the islands 4,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. They lived in fortified mountain areas called ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'' and drank sugar-cane wine, or ''palek''. They also used gold as currency and produced a thriving agriculture-based industry. They were also seafarers and boat-builders.\n\nIn 1687, a crew of English [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]] headed by [[William Dampier]] came with a Dutch crew and named the islands in honour of their country's nobility. Itbayat was named \"Orange Isle\" after [[William III of England|William of Orange]], and Batan was named \"Grafton Isle\" after [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton]]. Sabtang Isle was named \"Monmouth Isle\" after [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]]. Capt. Dampier stayed for less than three months, and did not claim the islands for the British crown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hgz91?refreqid=excelsior:e1a088eb56e01b6e796960adc0b44a24|title=4000 Years of Migration and Cultural Exchange: The Archaeology of the Batanes Islands, Northern Philippines on JSTOR|website=www.jstor.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the auspices of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas]]. The Bashi Channel was increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control.<ref>Howard T. Fry, \"The Eastern Passage and Its Impact on Spanish Policy in the Philippines, 1758\u20131790\", ''Philippine Studies,'' vol.33, First Quarter, 1985, pp.3\u201321, p.18.</ref> The [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]] remained on their ''[[Batanes castles|idjangs]]'', or mountain fortresses for some time. In 1790, Governor Guerrero {{Clarify|date=February 2007|reason=The Governor-general of the Philippines at this point in time is [[F\u00e9lix Berenguer de Marquina]], unless Guerrero refers to a governor of Batanes.}} decreed that Ivatans were to live in the lowlands and leave their remote ''idjang''. The mangpus, the indigenous Ivatan leader of the islands during that time, made a revolution against the Spaniards afterwards. With much ammunition and steel armors, the Spanish authorities quelled the uprising, effectively subjugating the rebels. Basco and Ivana were the first towns established under full Spanish control. Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana. Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge. Soon, Ilocanos came to the islands and integrated with the local population. Roads, ports, bridges, churches and government buildings were built in this time. Limestone technology used by the Spanish was also spread to the islands, making bridges strong and fortified. Some of these bridges still remain at Ivana and Mahatao. By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became ''ilustrados'', who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the [[Katipunan]]. These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.{{citation needed}}\n\nToward the end of the Spanish administration, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan. In 1909, the new American authorities organized it into an independent province. During the American colonial period, additional public schools were constructed and more Ivatan became aware of their place in the Philippines. In 1920, the first wireless telegraph was installed, followed by an airfield in 1930. New roads were constructed and the Batanes High School was instituted.\n\nBecause of their strategic location, the islands was one of the first points occupied by invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Pacific War]]. The morning of December 8, 1941, the Batan Task Force from [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] landed on the Batan Islands, which became the first American territory occupied by the Japanese. The purpose of the invasion was to secure the existing small airfield outside Basco, which was accomplished without resistance. Japanese fighters from Basco took part in the raid on [[History of Clark Air Base|Clark Air Base]] the following day. However, over the next several days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco unnecessary, and on December 10, 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn to participate in the [[Japanese invasion of Camiguin Island|invasion of Camiguin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Landings|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-6.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first School Superintendents on Batan was [[Victor de Padua]], an Ilocano, who in 1942\u201345 during the Japanese occupation was made Provincial Governor. Early in 1945 the island was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 12th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. In 1984, [[Pacita Abad]], the foremost Ivatan visual artist, became the first woman to be awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) award, breaking 25 years of male dominance. In her acceptance speech, she said, \"it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women\u201d and referred proudly to her mother.<ref>https://www.pacitaabad.com/Activities/Awards.php</ref>\n[[File:Oldest House in Ivatan.jpg|thumb|A ''Sinadumparan'' Ivatan house, one of the oldest structures in the Batanes islands.

The province has since promoted its Ivatan roots. Part of the Ilocano population has returned to mainland Luzon. In December 7, 2004, [[Pacita Abad]] died after finishing her last international art work while suffering from cancer.<ref>http://www.artnet.com/artists/pacita-abad/biography</ref>\n\n{{Back to contents}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe province has a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} comprising ten islands situated within the [[Luzon Strait]] between the Balintang Channel and [[Taiwan]]. The islands are sparsely populated and subject to frequent typhoons. The three largest islands, [[Batan Island|Batan]], [[Itbayat Island|Itbayat]], and [[Sabtang Island|Sabtang]], are the only inhabited islands.\n\nThe northernmost island in the province, also the northernmost land in the entire Philippines, is [[Mavulis Island|Mavulis (or Y'ami) Island]]. Other islands in the chain are Misanga (or North), Ditarem, [[Siayan Island|Siayan]], Diogo (or Dinem), [[Ivuhos]], and [[Dequey]]. The islands are part of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]].\n\n===Topography===\nAlmost one-half of Batanes is [[hill]]s and [[mountain]]s. [[Batan Island]] is generally mountainous on the north and southeast. It has a basin in the interior. [[Itbayat Island]] slopes gradually to the west, being mountainous and hilly along its northern, eastern coast. As for Sabtang, mountains cover the central part, making the island slope outward to the coast.\n\nThe islands are situated between the vast expanse of the waters of [[Bashi Channel]] and [[Balintang Channel]], where the Pacific Ocean merges with the China Sea. The area is a sea lane between the [[Philippines]] and [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]. It is rich with marine resources, including the rarest sea [[coral]]s in the world.{{Which|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[File:Batanes Hills.png|thumb|right|Batanes Hills]]\n\nThe province is hilly and mountainous, with only 1,631.5 hectares or 7.1% of its area level to undulating, and 78.2% or 17,994.4 hectares varying from rolling to steep and very steep. Forty two percent (42%) or 9,734.40 hectares are steep to very steep land. Because of the terrain of the province, drainage is good and prolonged flooding is non-existent. The main island of Batan has the largest share of level and nearly level lands, followed by Itbayat and Sabtang, respectively. Itbayat has gently rolling hills and nearly level areas on semi-plateaus surrounded by continuous massive cliffs rising from {{convert|20|to(-)|70|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], with no shorelines. Sabtang has its small flat areas spread sporadically on its coasts, while its interior is dominated by steep mountains and deep canyons. Batan Island and Sabtang have intermittent stretches of sandy beaches and rocky shorelines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe terrain of the province, while picturesque at almost every turn, has limited the potential for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.\n\n[[File:Batanes Stone house.jpg|thumb|Batanes Stone house]]\n\n===Climate===\nBatanes has a [[tropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''). The average yearly temperature is {{convert|26.0|C|F|1}}, and the average monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|22.0|C|F|1}} in January to {{convert|28.5|C|F|1}} in July, similar to that of Southern Taiwan. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year; the rainiest month is August while the driest month is April. November to February are the coldest months. There is a misconception that Batanes is constantly battered by typhoons.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Batanes is mentioned frequently in connection with typhoons, because it holds the northernmost weather station in the Philippines, thus, it is also a reference point for all typhoons that enter the Philippine area; however, in September 2016, [[Typhoon Meranti (2016)|Typhoon Meranti]] impacted the entire province, including a landfall on Itbayat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Steven|title=Eye of typhoon Meranti passes over Philippines' Itbayat|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/eye-of-typhoon-meranti-passes-over-philippines-itbayat/3125510.html|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=Channel NewsAsia|date=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nBatanes is subdivided into 6 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], all encompassed by a [[Legislative district of Batanes|lone congressional district]].\n[[File:Ph fil batanes.png|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Political divisions}}]]\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:white;font-size:95%;border-collapse:collapse;margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!

The northern half of the Ivatan homeland, [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and Orchid Island which were formally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]], fell to the Dutch who were in turn expelled in 1662 by forces of the Chinese [[Southern Ming]] dynasty, led by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] who then set himself up as The [[Kingdom of Tungning|King of Taiwan]].\n\nThe southern half of the Ivatan homeland, the islands of Batanes, was reinforced and fortified by Spanish refugees from Formosa before being formally joined in the 18th century with the Spanish government in Manila.\n\nThe main languages spoken in Batanes are [[Ivatan language|Ivatan]], which is spoken on the islands of Batan and Sabtang; [[Itbayaten]], which is spoken primarily on the island of Itbayat. The Ivatan which is dominant in the province is considered to be one of the [[Austronesian languages]]. From college level down to elementary level, the language is widely spoken.<ref>[http://www.batanesonline.com/LiteraryArts/IvatanLanguage.htm www.BatanesOnline.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212194455/http://www.batanesonline.com/LiteraryArts/IvatanLanguage.htm |date=2007-12-12 }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nThe large majority (94%) of the island's people adhere to [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholicism]].

Although it is reportedly growing in some other places such as coasts of [[Luzon]], [[Catanduanes]] and even [[Taiwan]], full blossoming and fruiting are observed only in Batanes. Its fruiting capacity on the island remains a mystery but is likely due to several factors such as climate, soil and type of substratum of the island.\n\nSeveral species of birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the island; many of those are [[endemic]] to the Philippines. The island is also a sanctuary of different [[bird migration|migratory bird]]s during winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAbout 75% of the [[Ivatan people|Ivatans]] are farmers and fishermen. The rest are employed in the government and services sector. Garlic and cattle are major cash crops. Ivatans also plant ''camote'' (sweet potato), cassava, ''gabi'' or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi. Sugarcane is raised to produce ''palek'', a kind of native wine, and vinegar.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, fish catch has declined due to the absence of technical know-how. Employment opportunities are scarce. Most of the educated Ivatans have migrated to urban centers or have gone abroad.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nA [[Wind-Diesel Hybrid Power Systems|wind diesel]] generating plant was commissioned in 2004.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDistance and bad weather work against its economic growth. Certain commodities like rice, soft drinks, and gasoline carry a 75% to 100% mark-up over Manila retail prices.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Transportation==\nThe island province of Batanes is accessible by air via the [[Basco Airport]] and [[Itbayat Airport]]. There are 3 flights per week from [[Manila]] by SkyJetAir, and from [[Tuguegarao]] (Cagayan) by small local airliners (as of January 2013). [[PAL Express]] flies to Batanes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday since May 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyadventurista.com/2013/02/airphil-express-to-launch-manila-batanes-flights-on-may.html|title=Airphil Express flies Manila to Basco (Batanes) starting May 2013|author=|date=|website=pinoyadventurista.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Values==\nThe Ivatan people of Batanes are one of the most [[egalitarian]] societies in the Philippines. The prime motivator of the cultural values of the Ivatans are imbibed in their pre-colonial belief systems of respecting [[nature]] and all people. The Ivatans, both the older and younger generations, have one of the highest incidences of social acceptance to minority groups in the country. The Ivatans also have a high respect for the elderly and the prowess of natural phenomena such as waves, sea breeze, lightning, thunders, earthquakes, and wildlife congregations. Discriminating someone based on skin color, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and traditions on nature is unacceptable in Ivatan values. [[Land grabbing]] is also a grave crime in Ivatan societies, making ancestral domain certification an important part of Ivatan jurisprudence since the enactment of the IPRA Law. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Heritage==\n{{Specific section|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Natural===\n[[File:Sabtang Island, Batanes.JPG|thumb|right|White sand beach at [[Sabtang, Batanes|Sabtang]] island]]\n* ''[[Sabtang Island]]'' is undisturbed and unspoiled. It has intermittent white sand beaches with steep mountains and deep canyons with small level areas sporadically found along the coastline.

(Compare with [[pastiche]], which is a \"pasting\" together.)Edit this if your retarted may sometimes include [[Clipping (publications)|magazine and newspaper clippings]], [[ribbon]]s, [[paint]], bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, [[photograph]]s and other [[found object]]s, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.\n\nThe term ''Rapist'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early precedents===\nTechniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.<ref name=\"Origins\" /> The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].<ref name=\"Origins\" /> An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}</ref>\nMany institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.<ref>http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview</ref> Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' <ref>[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]</ref> at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].\n\n===Collage and modernism===\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90x144&nbsp;cm, Staatliche Museum, [[Berlin]].]]\nDespite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.\n\nFor example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage \"was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.\".<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage \"Introduction to collage\"]. Tate Gallery website</ref> According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches \"collided with the surface plane of the painting.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works \"gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other,\" according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: \"References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art.\" This juxtaposition of signifiers, \"at once serious and tongue-in-cheek,\" was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: \"Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\n===Collage in painting===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913-14, Head (T\u00eate), cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913-14, ''Head (T\u00eate)'', cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh]]\nCollage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):\n\n\"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\nIn 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e)'',<ref>''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Mus\u00e9e National Picasso Paris</ref> Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.\n\n[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#\u00c9tr\u00e9cissements|etr\u00e9cissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mari\u00ebn]] from a method first explored by Mari\u00ebn. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.\n\nThe [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.\nWesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,<ref>(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)</ref> exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.\n\nAnother technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.\n\n===Collage with wood===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&page_number=5&template_id=1&sort_order=1 MoMA]</ref> part of a series of experimental collages.]] -->\n[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918\u20131986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]</ref> The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.\n\nIn a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/> Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.\n\nIt was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, \"As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/louise-nevelson-sky-cathedral-1958/ |title=Louise Nevelson, Sky Cathedral 1958  |publisher=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81006 |title=Sky Cathedral |work=MoMA Highlights |location=New York |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222</ref> Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.\n\nMuch wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.\n\nFrequently, what is called \"wood collage art\" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable \"[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s\" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)\n\n===Decoupage===\n[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|d\u00e9coup\u00e9e]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]\n{{Main|Decoupage}}\nDecoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].\n\nThere are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].\n\nThe craft became known as d\u00e9coupage in [[France]] (from the verb ''d\u00e9couper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].\n\nThe most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].\n\n===Photomontage===\n{{Main|Photomontage}}\nCollage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.\n[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]\n\n''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.<ref name=tomorrow>[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm \"This is tomorrow\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to \"image 027TT-1956.jpg\"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref> Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.<ref>[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm \"Just what is it\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref>\n\nOther methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian \"combination printing\", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]\u2019s (1912\u20131988) series of black and white \"photomontage projections\" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8\u00bd \u00d7 11&nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.\n\nThe 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create \"paste-ups\" digitally.\n\nCreating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to \"undo\" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.\n\n===Digital collage===\nDigital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].\n\n===Three-dimensional collage===\nA 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.\n\n===Mosaic===\nIt is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design. Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.\n\n===eCollage===\nThe term \"eCollage\" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.\n\n===Collage artists===\n<!--NOTE: Please add only existing articles about collage artists.

Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.\n\n===In music===\n[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955\u20131957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\n{{Main|Sound collage}}\nThe concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that \"[[sound collage|musical collages]]\" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].<ref name=\"timemagazine\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, \"mash-up\" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called \"literature of sound.\" In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).<ref name=\"soundonsound\">{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===In illustration===\nCollage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].\n\n===In artist's books===\n\nCollage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.<ref>https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.\n\nThe [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.\n\n===In fashion design===\nCollage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.\n\n===In film===\n{{main|Collage film}}\nCollage film is traditionally defined as, \u201cA film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.\u201d Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director\u2019s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.\n\n====In post-production====\nThe use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel\u2019s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.\n\n==Legal issues==\nWhen collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.\n\nDue to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].<ref>See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.</ref> Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.\n\nThe copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the \"first sale\" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].<ref>''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)</ref> The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.<ref>See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.</ref> The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.<ref>''Blanch v. Koons'', -- F.3d --, 2006 WL 3040666 (2d Cir.

(Compare with [[pastiche]], which is a \"pasting\" together.)\n\nA collage may sometimes include [[Clipping (publications)|magazine and newspaper clippings]], [[ribbon]]s, [[paint]], bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, [[photograph]]s and other [[found object]]s, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.\n\nThe term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early precedents===\nTechniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.<ref name=\"Origins\" /> The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].<ref name=\"Origins\" /> An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}</ref>\nMany institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.<ref>http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview</ref> Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' <ref>[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]</ref> at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].\n\n===Collage and modernism===\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90x144&nbsp;cm, Staatliche Museum, [[Berlin]].]]\nDespite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.\n\nFor example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage \"was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.\".<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage \"Introduction to collage\"]. Tate Gallery website</ref> According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches \"collided with the surface plane of the painting.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works \"gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other,\" according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: \"References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art.\" This juxtaposition of signifiers, \"at once serious and tongue-in-cheek,\" was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: \"Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\n===Collage in painting===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913-14, Head (T\u00eate), cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913-14, ''Head (T\u00eate)'', cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh]]\nCollage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):\n\n\"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\nIn 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e)'',<ref>''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Mus\u00e9e National Picasso Paris</ref> Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.\n\n[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#\u00c9tr\u00e9cissements|etr\u00e9cissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mari\u00ebn]] from a method first explored by Mari\u00ebn. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.\n\nThe [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.\nWesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,<ref>(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)</ref> exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.\n\nAnother technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.\n\n===Collage with wood===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&page_number=5&template_id=1&sort_order=1 MoMA]</ref> part of a series of experimental collages.]] -->\n[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918\u20131986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]</ref> The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.\n\nIn a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/> Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.\n\nIt was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, \"As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/louise-nevelson-sky-cathedral-1958/ |title=Louise Nevelson, Sky Cathedral 1958  |publisher=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81006 |title=Sky Cathedral |work=MoMA Highlights |location=New York |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222</ref> Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.\n\nMuch wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.\n\nFrequently, what is called \"wood collage art\" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable \"[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s\" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)\n\n===Decoupage===\n[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|d\u00e9coup\u00e9e]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]\n{{Main|Decoupage}}\nDecoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].\n\nThere are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].\n\nThe craft became known as d\u00e9coupage in [[France]] (from the verb ''d\u00e9couper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].\n\nThe most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].\n\n===Photomontage===\n{{Main|Photomontage}}\nCollage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.\n[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]\n\n''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.<ref name=tomorrow>[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm \"This is tomorrow\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to \"image 027TT-1956.jpg\"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref> Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.<ref>[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm \"Just what is it\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref>\n\nOther methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian \"combination printing\", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]\u2019s (1912\u20131988) series of black and white \"photomontage projections\" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8\u00bd \u00d7 11&nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.\n\nThe 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create \"paste-ups\" digitally.\n\nCreating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to \"undo\" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.\n\n===Digital collage===\nDigital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].\n\n===Three-dimensional collage===\nA 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.\n\n===Mosaic===\nIt is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design. Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.\n\n===eCollage===\nThe term \"eCollage\" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.\n\n===Collage artists===\n<!--NOTE: Please add only existing articles about collage artists.

Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.\n\n===In music===\n[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955\u20131957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\n{{Main|Sound collage}}\nThe concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that \"[[sound collage|musical collages]]\" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].<ref name=\"timemagazine\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, \"mash-up\" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called \"literature of sound.\" In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).<ref name=\"soundonsound\">{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===In illustration===\nCollage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].\n\n===In artist's books===\n\nCollage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.<ref>https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.\n\nThe [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.\n\n===In fashion design===\nCollage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.\n\n===In film===\n{{main|Collage film}}\nCollage film is traditionally defined as, \u201cA film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.\u201d Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director\u2019s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.\n\n====In post-production====\nThe use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel\u2019s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.\n\n==Legal issues==\nWhen collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.\n\nDue to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].<ref>See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.</ref> Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.\n\nThe copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the \"first sale\" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].<ref>''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)</ref> The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.<ref>See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.</ref> The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.<ref>''Blanch v.
