She is part of the [[BC Ferries]] fleet.\n\n==History==\n\n''Queen of Alberni'' was built by Vancouver Shipyards Co. Ltd. in [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]] in 1976. She joined the other two {{sclass2-|C|ferry|0}} ferries, ''[[Queen of Coquitlam]]'' and ''[[Queen of Cowichan]]'', that were also built in that year, with the other two C-class ferries, ''[[Queen of Surrey]]'' and ''[[Queen of Oak Bay]]'', joining later.\n\n''Queen of Alberni'' was different from the others, as she only had one car deck designed to carry overheight vehicles. Her lack of an upper car deck put its capacity at 145 overheight vehicles. The ferry's high truck capacity made her a natural for the service's Tsawwassen-Duke Point route (established in 1990 as the [[Mid-Island Express]], running between Tsawwassen and Departure Bay; and later between Tsawwassen and Duke Point), which is intended for a high volume of overheight vehicles. This route is also served by {{MV|Coastal Inspiration}}, a {{sclass2-|Coastal|ferry|1}}. In 1984, the ship was stretched and lifted, gaining an upper car deck for non-overheight vehicles, leading to a new vehicle capacity of 292. In 1999, the ship underwent another refit in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].\n\nThe ship has a different system of ship evacuation since it carries fewer passengers. All of the lifejackets are stored in large containers scattered throughout the two passenger decks. The ship has three evacuation stations on each side of the top passenger deck, or sun deck. The combined capacity of these six stations is 1,200.\n\nIn 2007,  ''Queen of Alberni'' completed a 40 million dollar mid-life upgrade which will prepare the 31-year-old vessel for another 20 years of service.\n\n==Accidents==\n\nThe life of ''Queen of Alberni'' has seen quite a few mishaps. Only three years after her launch in 1976, the vessel ran aground in [[Active Pass]]. Many cars and trucks were damaged when the ship tilted over, and some flipped over completely. There were no major injuries and the only casualty was a racehorse that was being transported. Misfortune struck again in 1989 when ship smashed into the dock at the Departure Bay terminal in [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]]. Six people were injured.\n\nAnother accident would come on March 12, 1992. At around 8:00am ''Queen of Alberni'' left the Tsawwassen terminal with heavy fog and almost zero visibility. The Japanese [[bulk carrier]] ''Shinwa Maru'' left the [[Westshore Terminals Income Fund|Westshore Terminal No. 1]] at nearby [[Roberts Bank]], British Columbia at 7:40am. At 8:06am the two ships made contact after seeing each other on [[radar]] to arrange a safe passage. At 8:08am the two vessels collided. ''Queen of Alberni'' hit ''Shinwa Maru'' about {{convert|25|m|ft}} aft of the [[Bow (ship)|bow]], {{convert|3|m|ft}} above the [[waterline]], and at a 70-degree angle. Two people aboard ''Queen of Alberni'' were seriously injured while none aboard ''Shinwa Maru'' were injured. ''Queen of Alberni'' had minor damage to the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and some of the cafeteria equipment was displaced. ''Shinwa Maru'', however, was damaged when the ferry penetrated the #1 [[Hold (compartment)|cargo hold]] and [[ballast tank]]s.\n\nOn December 15, 2001  ''Queen of Alberni'' got caught in a heavy wind storm which turned a regular 2-hour crossing into a 7\u00bd-hour ordeal.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bcferries.com/onboard-experiences/fleet/profile-queen_of_alberni.html BC Ferries: ''Queen of Alberni'']\n*[http://www.westcoastferries.ca/ferries/bcferries/queenofalberni.html West Coast Ferries: ''Queen of Alberni'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060624004821/http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/reports/marine/earlier/m92w1022/m92w1022.asp The Canadian Transportation Safety Board report on 1992 collision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130627202201/http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/1997/t-659-92_5219/t-659-92.html Court case following 1992 collision, Shinwa Kaiun K.K. v.

Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil pattern used on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes. \n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Occurrences during [[prenatal development]] may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|title=Prenatal thumb sucking is related to postnatal handedness| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.08.009|pmid=15707608|volume=43|issue=3|journal=Neuropsychologia|pages=313\u2013315|year=2005 | last1 = Hepper | first1 = Peter G.}}</ref> In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson EL, Campbell JM, Michel GF | year = 2013 | title = Unimanual to bimanual: Tracking the development of handedness from 6 to 24 months | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 181\u2013188 | pmc=3615031 | doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.01.009 | pmid=23454419}}</ref>\n\n=== Division of labor ===\nOne common theory as to how handedness affects the hemispheres is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster, the more people are using it. Bowlers have to adjust their shots to compensate for changed rotation of the ball as the game or series goes on. A left-handed bowler throws their shot up the opposite side of the lane than a right-handed bowler, and therefore deals with less breakdown. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes. \n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a [[dip pen]]. While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains.<ref>McManus, IC.

Press, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Negative connotations and discrimination===\n\nMoreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in [[Los Angeles]], who meets and befriends an [[amnesia]]c woman (Harring) recovering from a car accident. The story follows several other [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] and characters, including a Hollywood film director (Theroux).\n\nOriginally conceived as a [[television pilot]], a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's cut, however, television executives rejected it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch's characteristic style, has left the general meaning of the film's events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics, and cast members to speculate on what transpires. He gave the film the tagline \"A love story in the city of dreams\".<ref name=\"macaulay\"/>\n\nCategorized as a [[psychological thriller]], ''Mulholland Drive'' earned Lynch the ''[[Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne]]'' (Best Director Award) at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]], sharing the prize with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]''. Furthermore, Lynch would also earn an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The film launched Harring's career, boosted Watts' Hollywood profile considerably, and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress [[Ann Miller]].\n\n''Mulholland Drive'' is now widely regarded as one of Lynch's finest works and one of the greatest films of the 21st century, ranking 28th in the [[The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|2012 ''Sight & Sound'' critics' poll]] of the best films ever made<ref name=\"Christie 2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|title=The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|last=Christie|first=Ian|year=2012|publisher=[[British Film Institute|bfi.org.uk]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301135739/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|archivedate=March 1, 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Critics' top 100\">{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics/|title=Critics' top 100|work=bfi.org.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026034922/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics|archivedate=October 26, 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}</ref> and topping a 2016 [[100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|poll]] by [[BBC|BBC Culture]] of the best films since 2000.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37164880|title=Mulholland Drive tops BBC Culture greatest film poll|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823222718/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37164880|archivedate=August 23, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=August 23, 2016|date=August 23, 2016}}</ref> [[A.

Betty is startled to find the woman, who has amnesia and assumes the name \"Rita\" after seeing a poster for the film ''[[Gilda]]'' starring [[Rita Hayworth]]. To help the woman remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. At a diner called Winkie's, a man tells his companion about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Meanwhile, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.\n\nWhile trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkie's and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \"Diane Selwyn.\" They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she does not answer. Betty goes to an audition, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to a soundstage where a film called ''The Sylvia North Story'', directed by Adam, is being cast. When Camilla Rhodes auditions, Adam capitulates to casting her. Betty locks eyes with Adam, but she flees before she can meet him, saying she is late to meet a friend. Betty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's apartment and break in when no one answers the door. In the bedroom, they find the body of a woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to their apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. She and Betty have sex that night. At 2 a.m., Rita insists they go to a theater called Club Silencio. The emcee explains in different languages that everything is an illusion; [[Rebekah Del Rio]] comes on stage and begins singing the [[Roy Orbison]] song \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" in Spanish, then collapses while her vocals continue\u2014her performance was a recording. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor with a thump.\n\nDiane Selwyn wakes up in her bed in the same apartment that Betty and Rita investigated. She looks exactly like Betty, but is a failed actress driven into a deep depression by her failed affair with Camilla Rhodes, a successful actress who looks exactly like Rita. At Camilla's invitation, Diane attends a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. At dinner, Diane states she came to Hollywood when her Aunt Ruth died and left her some money, and she met Camilla at an audition for ''The Sylvia North Story''. Another woman who looks like the \"Camilla Rhodes\" from earlier kisses Camilla, and they turn and smile at Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make an important announcement, but they dissolve into laughter and kiss while Diane watches, crying. Later, Diane meets the hit man at Winkie's, appearing to hire him to kill Camilla. He tells her she will find a blue key in her apartment when the job is completed. In her apartment, Diane looks at the blue key on her coffee table. Distraught, she is terrorized by hallucinations and runs screaming to her bed, where she shoots herself. A woman at the theater whispers, \"Silencio.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn\n* [[Laura Elena Harring]] as Rita/Camilla Rhodes\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Adam Kesher\n* [[Ann Miller]] as Coco\n* [[Mark Pellegrino]] as Joe\n\n=== Supporting ===\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Detective McKnight\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Detective Domgaard\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Vincenzo Castigliane\n* [[Angelo Badalamenti]] as Luigi Castigliane\n* [[Monty Montgomery (producer)|Monty Montgomery]] as The Cowboy\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Louise Bonner\n* [[James Karen]] as Wally Brown\n* [[Chad Everett]] as Jimmy Katz\n* [[Richard Green (actor)|Richard Green]] as The Magician\n* [[Rebekah Del Rio]] as Herself\n* [[Melissa George]] as 1st Camilla Rhodes\n* [[Jeanne Bates]] as Irene\n* Dan Birnbaum as Irene's Companion\n* [[Lori Heuring]] as Lorraine\n* [[Marcus Graham]] as Mr. Darby\n* [[Michael J.

Tony Krantz, the agent who was responsible for the development of Twin Peaks, was \"fired up\" about doing another television show. Ironically, Lynch written \"I will never do television again\" on a piece of plywood. It was originally a script for a pilot for ABC. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only on the story of Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, \"I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble\u2014she ''is'' trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you.{{' \"}}Lynch showed ABC a rough cut of the pilot. The person who saw it, according to Lynch, was watching it at six in the morning and was having coffee and standing up. He hated the pilot and ABC immediately cancelled it. Pierre Edleman, Lynch's friend from Paris, came to visit and started talking to him about the film being a feature. Edleman went back to Paris. Canal+ wanted to give Lynch money to make it into a feature and it took a year to negotiate. {{sfn|Woods|2000|p=206}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGd6lnYTTY8&t=1905s|title=David Lynch In Conversation- 34:22-36:07|date=2015-06-15|website=via YouTube}}</ref>\n\nLynch described the attractiveness of the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: \"I'm a sucker for a continuing story&nbsp;...

In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable to cope with the guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.<ref name=\"tang\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/07/mulholland_dream/ |last=Tang |first=Jean |title=All you have to do is dream |date=November 7, 2001 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229232151/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/07/mulholland_dream/ |archivedate=December 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis interpretation was similar to what Naomi Watts construed, when she said in an interview, \"I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the [[damsel in distress]] and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls her as if she were a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be.\"<ref name=\"fuller\"/> Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, \"There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely.\"<ref name=\"pearce\">{{cite news |last=Pearce |first=Gareth |date=January 6, 2002 |title=Why Naomi is a girl's best friend |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |page=14}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' asked six well-known film critics for their own perceptions of the overall meaning in ''Mulholland Drive''.

[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] seem to accept this interpretation, but both hesitate to overanalyze the film. Ebert states, \"There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.\" Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: \"Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or perhaps these things are the [[non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]] and subconscious of dreams.\"<ref name=\"lewis\">{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Robin |date=January 17, 2007 |title=Nice Film If You Can Get It: Understanding ''Mulholland Drive'' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,634856,00.html#article_continue |accessdate=August 17, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830011241/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0%2C%2C634856%2C00.html |archivedate=August 30, 2008}}</ref> [[Philip French]] from ''[[The Observer]]'' sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] rejects the theory of Betty's life as Diane's dream, but also warns against too much analysis.<ref name=\"lewis\" />\n\nMedia theorist Siobhan Lyons similarly disagrees with the dream theory, arguing that it is a \"superficial interpretation [which] undermines the strength of the absurdity of reality that often takes place in Lynch's universe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/moving-beyond-the-dream-theory-a-new-approach-to-mulholland-drive/|title=Moving Beyond the Dream Theory: A New Approach to 'Mulholland Drive'|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref> Instead, Lyons posits that Betty and Diane are in fact two different people who happen to look similar, a common motif among Hollywood starlets. In a similar interpretation, Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla may exist in [[multiverse|parallel universes]] that sometimes interconnect.

Rita falls asleep several times; in between these episodes, disconnected scenes such as the men having a conversation at Winkie's, Betty's arrival in Los Angeles and the bungled hit take place, suggesting that Rita may be dreaming them. The opening shot of the film zooms into a bed containing an unknown sleeper, instilling, according to film scholar Ruth Perlmutter, the necessity to ask if what follows is reality.<ref name=\"perlmutter\">{{cite journal |last=Permutter |first=Ruth |date=April 2005 |title=Memories, Dreams, Screens |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Film and Video]] |issue=22 |volume=2 |pages=125\u2013134|doi=10.1080/10509200590461837 }}</ref> Professor of dream studies Kelly Bulkeley argues that the early scene at the diner, as the only one in which dreams or dreaming are explicitly mentioned, illustrates \"revelatory truth and [[epistemology|epistemological]] uncertainty in Lynch's film\".<ref name=\"Dreams\">{{cite journal |last=Bulkeley |first=Kelly |date=March 2003 |title=Dreaming and the Cinema of David Lynch |journal=Dreaming |issue=13 |volume=1 |page=57 |doi=10.1023/a:1022190318612}}</ref> The monstrous being from the dream, who is the subject of conversation of the men in Winkie's, reappears at the end of the film right before and after Diane commits suicide. Bulkeley asserts that the lone discussion of dreams in that scene presents an opening to \"a new way of understanding everything that happens in the movie\".<ref name=\"Dreams\" />\n\nPhilosopher and film theorist [[Robert Sinnerbrink]] similarly notes that the images following Diane's apparent suicide undermine the \"dream and reality\" interpretation. After Diane shoots herself, the bed is consumed with smoke, and Betty and Rita are shown beaming at each other, after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers \"''Silencio''\" as the screen fades to black. Sinnerbrink writes that the \"concluding images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image\", also noting that it might be that the \"last sequence comprises the fantasy images of Diane's dying consciousness, concluding with the real moment of her death: the final ''Silencio''\".<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\">{{cite journal |last=Sinnerbrink |first=Robert |year=2005 |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol9-2005/n34sinnerbrink |title=Cinematic Ideas: David Lynch's ''Mulholland Drive'' |journal=Film-Philosophy |issue=9 |volume=34 |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref> Referring to the same sequence, film theorist Andrew Hageman notes that \"the ninety-second coda that follows Betty/Diane's suicide is a cinematic space that persists after the curtain has dropped on her living consciousness, and this persistent space is the very theatre where the illusion of illusion is continually unmasked\".<ref name=\"hageman\">{{cite journal|last=Hageman |first=Andrew |date=June 2008 |url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=11&id=1022 |title=The Uncanny Ecology of ''Mulholland Drive'' |journal=Scope \u2013 an Online Journal of Film and Television Studies |issue=11 |accessdate=August 17, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807090000/http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=11&id=1022 |archivedate=August 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFilm theorist David Roche writes that Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but rather force the audience into the role of becoming detectives themselves to make sense of the narratives, and that ''Mulholland Drive'', like other Lynch films, frustrates \"the spectator's need for a rational [[diegesis]] by playing on the spectator's mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis\".

Although the audience still struggles to make sense of the stories, the characters are no longer trying to solve their mysteries. Roche concludes that ''Mulholland Drive'' is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together \"by the spectator-detective's desire to make sense\" of it.<ref name=\"Roche\" />\n\n===A \"poisonous valentine to Hollywood\"===\n[[File:Mulholland Drive at night.jpg|alt=The street lights and homes of San Fernando Valley lit up at night|thumb|The view of Los Angeles from Mulholland Drive has become an iconic representation of the city's opportunities.]]\nDespite the proliferation of theories, critics note that no explanation satisfies all of the loose ends and questions that arise from the film.

The non-linear film is \"incapable of sustaining narrative coherence\", as Lee Wallace argues that, \"lesbianism dissolves the ideological conventions of narrative realism, operating as the switch point for the contesting storyworlds within Lynch\u2019s elaborately plotted film\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Wallace|first=Lee|title=Lesbianism, Cinema, Space|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-99243-5|location=New York|pages=99\u2013116}}</ref> The presence of mirrors and doppelgangers throughout the film \"are common representations of lesbian desire\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Postfeminism and the Fatale Figure in Neo-Noir Cinema |last=Lindop|first=Samantha|year=2015|doi=10.1057/9781137503596|isbn=978-1-137-50359-6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London}}</ref> The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita\u2013which borders on outright obsession\u2013has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966) and [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: \"The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire\".<ref name=\"Filippo74\">Filippo (2013), 74.</ref> Lynch pays direct homage to ''Persona'' in the scene where Rita dons the blonde wig, styled exactly like Betty's own hair. Rita and Betty then gaze at each other in the mirror \"drawing attention to their physical similarity, linking the sequence to theme of embrace, physical coupling and the idea of merging or doubling\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Mirroring and doubles, which are prominent themes throughout the film, serve to further queer the form and content of the film.\n\nSeveral theorists have accused Lynch of perpetuating stereotypes and clich\u00e9s of lesbians, bisexuals and lesbian relationships. Rita (the femme fatale) and Betty (the school girl) represent two classic stock lesbian characters; Heather Love identifies two key clich\u00e9s used in the film: \"Lynch presents lesbianism in its innocent and expansive form: lesbian desire appears as one big adventure, an entr\u00e9e into a glamorous and unknown territory\".<ref name=\"love\">Heather Love, \"Spectacular failure: the figure of the lesbian in ''Mulholland Drive''\", ''New Literary History'' 1, no. 35 (Winter 2004): 117\u2013132. {{doi|10.1353/nlh.2004.0021}}.</ref> Simultaneously, he presents the tragic lesbian triangle, \"in which an attractive but unavailable woman dumps a less attractive woman who is figured as exclusively lesbian\", perpetuating the stereotype of the bisexual \"ending up with a man\"<ref name=\"love\" />. Maria San Filippo recognizes that Lynch relies on classic film noir archetypes to develop Camilla's eventual betrayal: these archetypes \"become ingrained to such a degree that viewers are immediately cued that \u201cRita\u201d is not what she seems and that it is only a matter of time before she reveals her duplicitous nature.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filippo|first=Maria San|date=2011-01-06|title=The \"Other\" Dreamgirl|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=7|issue=1\u20132|pages=13\u201349|language=en|doi=10.1300/J159v07n01_03}}</ref> For Love, Diane's exclusively lesbian desire is \"between success and failure, between sexiness and abjection, even between life and death\" if she is rejected.<ref name=\"love\" /> Diane is the tragic lesbian clich\u00e9 pining after the bisexual in the heterosexual relationship. Love's analysis of the film notes the media's peculiar response to the film's lesbian content: \"reviewers rhapsodized in particular and at length about the film's sex scenes, as if there were a contest to see who could enjoy this representation of female same-sex desire the most.\"<ref name=\"love\" /> She points out that the film used a classic theme in literature and film depicting lesbian relationships: Camilla as achingly beautiful and available, rejecting Diane for Adam. Popular reaction to the film suggests the contrasting relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla are \"understood as both the hottest thing on earth and, at the same time, as something fundamentally sad and not at all erotic\" as \"the heterosexual order asserts itself with crushing effects for the abandoned woman\".<ref name=\"love\" />\n\nHeterosexuality as primary is important in the latter half of the film, as the ultimate demise of Diane and Camilla's relationship springs from the matrimony of the heterosexual couple. At Adam's party, they begin to announce that Camilla and Adam are getting married; through laughs and kisses, the declaration is delayed because it is obvious and expected. The heterosexual closure of the scene is  interrupted by ta scene change. As Lee Wallace suggests, by planning a hit against Camilla, \"Diane circumvents the heterosexual closure of the industry story but only by going over to its storyworld, an act that proves fatal for both women, the cause and effect relations of the thriller being fundamentally incompatible with the plot of lesbianism as the film presents it\".<ref name=\":0\" />  For Joshua Bastian Cole,  Adam's character serves as Diane's foil, what she can never be, which is why Camilla leaves her. In her fantasy, Adam has his own subplot which leads to his humiliation. While this subplot can be understood as a revenge fantasy born from jealousy, Cole argues that this is an example of Diane's transgender gaze: \"Adam functions like a mirror- a male object upon which Diane might project herself\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bastian Cole|first=Joshua|date=March 2018|title=Passing Glances: Recognizing the Trans Gaze in Mulholland Drive|journal=Somatechnics|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.3366/soma.2018.0238|issn=2044-0138}}</ref> Diane's prolonged eye-contact with Dan at Winkie's is another example of the trans gaze. For Cole, \"Diane\u2019s strange recognition of Dan, which is not quite identification but something else, feels trans in its oblique line, drawn between impossible doubles\" and their similar names (Dan/Diane) which is no mistake.<ref name=\":2\" /> He stresses that the lesbian understanding of the film has overshadowed potential trans interpretations; his reading of Diane's trans gaze is a contribution to the queer narrative of the film''.''\n\nMedia portrayals of Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen relationships were varied and conflicting. Watts said of the filming of the scene, \"I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had tears in my eyes because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit.\"<ref>[[Dennis Hensley]], \"Lust Highway\", ''[[Total Film]]'' 61 (February 2002): 72\u201374.</ref> However, in another interview Watts stated, \"I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic.\"<ref name=\"pearce\" /> While Harring was quoted saying, \"The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [her] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [over].

But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious.<ref name=\"taubin\" /> Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on [[Doris Day]], [[Tippi Hedren]] and [[Kim Novak]], observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone \"who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it's somebody else's\".<ref name=\"fuller\" /> This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had na\u00efvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a \"complicit actor\" who had \"embraced the very structure that\" destroyed her.<ref name=\"hageman\" /> In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated:\n\n<blockquote>I had to therefore come up with my own decisions about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience.

The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty's previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynch's use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters.<ref name=\"toles\" /> Betty's acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film that ultimately turns against her.<ref name=\"perlmutter\" />\n\n'''Rita''' (Laura Elena Harring) is the mysterious and helpless apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert was so impressed with Harring that he said of her \"all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55&nbsp;years for a ''[[Gilda]]'' remake\".<ref name=\"ebert\" /> She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire to make sense of the film through her identity.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=198}} Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is \"the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her\".<ref name=\"lopate\" /> A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave.<ref name=\"hudson\" /> Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of ''Mulholland Drive'' can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=199}} According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=94}}\n\n[[File:Rita Poster Mulholland.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|alt=Laura Elena Harring wet from a shower and wrapped in a red towel, looking into the mirror at a reflection of the theatrical poster for the film ''Gilda''|The dark-haired woman (Harring) assumes the name \"Rita\" after seeing the name on a poster. Her search for her identity has been interpreted by film scholars as representing the audience's desire to make sense of the film.]]\n\nAfter Betty and Rita find the decomposing body, they flee the apartment and their images are split apart and reintegrated. David Roche notes that Rita's lack of identity causes a breakdown that \"occurs not only at the level of the character but also at the level of the image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters\".<ref name=\"Roche\" /> Immediately they return to Betty's aunt's apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig\u2014ostensibly to disguise herself\u2014but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the melding of both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Rita's personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla.<ref name=\"nochimson\" />\n\n'''Diane Selwyn''' (Naomi Watts) is the palpably frustrated and depressed woman, who seems to have ridden the coattails of Camilla, whom she idolizes and adores, but who does not return her affection. She is considered to be the reality of the too-good-to-be-true Betty, or a later version of Betty after living too long in Hollywood.<ref name=\"holden\" /> For Steven Dillon, the plot of the film \"makes Rita the perfect empty vessel for Diane's fantasies\", but because Rita is only a \"blank cover girl\" Diane has \"invested herself in emptiness\", which leads her to depression and apparently to suicide.{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=95}} Hence, Diane is the personification of dissatisfaction, painfully illustrated when she is unable to climax while masturbating, in a scene that indicates \"through blurred, jerky, point of view shots of the stony wall\u2014not only her tears and humiliation but the disintegration of her fantasy and her growing desire for revenge\".<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\" /> One analysis of Diane suggests her devotion to Camilla is based on a manifestation of [[narcissism]], as Camilla embodies everything Diane wants and wants to be.<ref name=\"ridgway\">{{cite journal |last=Ridgway |first=Franklin |date=Fall 2006 |title=You Came Back!; Or Mulholland Treib |journal=Post Script: Essays in Film and the Humanities |issue=26 |volume=1 |pages=43\u201361}}</ref> Although she is portrayed as weak and the ultimate loser, for Jeff Johnson, author of a book about morality in Lynch films, Diane is the only character in the second portion of the film whose moral code remains intact. She is \"a decent person corrupted by the miscellaneous miscreants who populate the film industry\".{{sfn|Johnson|2004|p=137}} Her guilt and regret are evident in her suicide, and in the clues that surface in the first portion of the film. Rita's fear, the dead body and the illusion at Club Silencio indicate that something is dark and wrong in Betty and Rita's world. In becoming free from Camilla, her moral conditioning kills her.{{sfn|Johnson|2004|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n'''Camilla Rhodes''' (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) is little more than a face in a photo and a name that has inspired many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam.

In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adam's mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely pays attention to Diane's embarrassed tale of how she got into acting.<ref name=\"ridgway\" />\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Mulholland Drive Mr Roque.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A short, strange-looking man seated in a large wooden wheelchair under an intense beam of light in a large and sparsely furnished room; a desk is in a far corner and the walls are covered in curtains.|Dwarf actor [[Michael J.

By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst, Jennifer Hudson, writes of him, \"Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams.\"<ref name=\"hudson\" />\n\nDavid Lynch uses various methods of deception in ''Mulholland Drive''. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, who seems to control film studios, is portrayed by [[dwarfism|dwarf]] actor [[Michael J. Anderson]] (also from ''[[Twin Peaks]]''). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small.{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=209}} During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate \"cruel and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]\" act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only to see what she senses.<ref name=\"ridgway\" /> In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: \"It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not.\"<ref name=\"ridgway\"/>\n\nAccording to Stephen Dillon, Lynch's use of different camera positions throughout the film, such as hand-held points of view, makes the viewer \"identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space\", but that Lynch at moments also \"disconnects the camera from any particular point of view, thereby ungrounding a single or even a human perspective\" so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling \"our sense of the individual and the human\".{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=100}} Andrew Hageman similarly notes that the camera work in the film \"renders a very disturbing sense of place and presence\", such as the scene in Winkie's where the \"camera floats irregularly during the shot-reverse shot dialogue\" by which the \"spectator becomes aware that a set of normally objective shots have become disturbingly subjective\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> Scholar Curt Hersey recognizes several [[avant-garde]] techniques used in the film including lack of transitions, abrupt transitions, motion speed, nontraditional camera movement, [[computer-generated imagery]], nondiegetic images, [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear narration]] and [[intertextuality]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hersey |first=Curt |year=2002 |title=Diegetic Breaks and the Avant-Garde |journal=The Journal of Moving Image Studies |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FightMulholland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring arguing on two sides of an open door|An emotionally troubled Diane exchanges words with Camilla.

Diane's scenes feature choppier editing and dirtier lighting that symbolize her physical and spiritual impoverishment,<ref name=\"nochimson\" /> which contrasts with the first portion of the film where \"even the plainest decor seems to sparkle\", Betty and Rita glow with light and transitions between scenes are smooth.<ref name=\"mcgowan\">{{cite journal |last=McGowan |first=Todd |year=2004 |title=Lost on Mulholland Drive: Navigating David Lynch's Panegyric to Hollywood |journal=Cinema Journal |issue=43 |volume=2 |pages=67\u201389 |doi=10.1353/cj.2004.0008}}</ref> Lynch moves between scenes in the first portion of the film by using panoramic shots of the mountains, palm trees and buildings in Los Angeles. In the darker part of the film, sound transitions to the next scene without a visual reference where it is taking place. At Camilla's party, when Diane is most humiliated, the sound of crashing dishes is heard that carries immediately to the scene where dishes have been dropped in the diner, and Diane is speaking with the hit man. Sinnerbrink also notes that several scenes in the film, such as the one featuring Diane's hallucination of Camilla after Diane wakes up, the image of the being from behind Winkie's after Diane's suicide, or the \"repetition, reversal and displacement of elements that were differently configured\" in the early portion of the film, creates the [[Uncanny|uncanny effect]] where viewers are presented with familiar characters or situations in altered times or locations.<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\" /> Similarly, Hageman has identified the early scene at Winkie's as \"extremely uncanny\", because it is a scene where the \"boundaries separating physical reality from the imaginary realities of the unconscious disintegrate\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> Author Valtteri Kokko has identified three groups of \"uncanny metaphors\"; the [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of multiple characters played by the same actors, dreams and an everyday object\u2014primarily the blue box\u2014that initiates Rita's disappearance and Diane's real life.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kokko |first=Valtteri |year=2004 |url=http://www.widerscreen.fi/2004/1/psychological_horror_in_the_films_of_lynch.htm |title=Psychological Horror in the Films of David Lynch |journal=Wider Screen |issue=1 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927081849/http://www.widerscreen.fi/2004/1/psychological_horror_in_the_films_of_lynch.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother recurring element in Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, \"you look at the image and the scene silent, it's doing the job it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There's so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it's really magical.\"<ref name=\"divine\"/> In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added \"a hint of the steam [from the wreck] and the screaming kids\", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified.{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=208}} Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects.<ref name=\"horan\">{{cite web |last=Horan |first=Anthony |title=Mulholland Drive

sound\", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise \"creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> ''Mulholland Drive''{{'}}s ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering is an example of Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, \"The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over

two pop songs from the 1960s directly after one another, playing as two actresses are auditioning by [[lip sync]]hing them.

written and directed by [[David Lynch]] and starring [[Naomi Watts]], [[Laura Harring]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Ann Miller]], [[Mark Pellegrino]] and [[Robert Forster]]. It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in [[Los Angeles]], who meets and befriends an [[amnesia]]c woman (Harring) recovering from a car accident. The story follows several other [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] and characters, including a Hollywood film director (Theroux).\n\nOriginally conceived as a [[television pilot]], a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's cut, however, television executives rejected it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch's characteristic style, has left the general meaning of the film's events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics, and cast members to speculate on what transpires. He gave the film the tagline \"A love story in the city of dreams\".<ref name=\"macaulay\"/>\n\nCategorized as a [[psychological thriller]], ''Mulholland Drive'' earned Lynch the ''[[Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne]]'' (Best Director Award) at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]], sharing the prize with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]''. Furthermore, Lynch would also earn an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The film launched Harring's career, boosted Watts' Hollywood profile considerably, and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress [[Ann Miller]].\n\n''Mulholland Drive'' is now widely regarded as one of Lynch's finest works and one of the greatest films of the 21st century, ranking 28th in the [[The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|2012 ''Sight & Sound'' critics' poll]] of the best films ever made<ref name=\"Christie 2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|title=The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|last=Christie|first=Ian|year=2012|publisher=[[British Film Institute|bfi.org.uk]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301135739/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|archivedate=March 1, 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Critics' top 100\">{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics/|title=Critics' top 100|work=bfi.org.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026034922/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics|archivedate=October 26, 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}</ref> and topping a 2016 [[100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|poll]] by [[BBC|BBC Culture]] of the best films since 2000.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37164880|title=Mulholland Drive tops BBC Culture greatest film poll|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823222718/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37164880|archivedate=August 23, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=August 23, 2016|date=August 23, 2016}}</ref> [[A.

Injured and in shock, she makes her way down into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment. Later that morning, an aspiring actress named Betty Elms arrives at the apartment, which is normally occupied by her Aunt Ruth. Betty is startled to find the woman, who has amnesia and assumes the name \"Rita\" after seeing a poster for the film ''[[Gilda]]'' starring [[Rita Hayworth]]. To help the woman remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. At a diner called Winkie's, a man tells his companion about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Meanwhile, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.\n\nWhile trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkie's and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \"Diane Selwyn.\" They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she does not answer. Betty goes to an audition, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to a soundstage where a film called ''The Sylvia North Story'', directed by Adam, is being cast. When Camilla Rhodes auditions, Adam capitulates to casting her. Betty locks eyes with Adam, but she flees before she can meet him, saying she is late to meet a friend. Betty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's apartment and break in when no one answers the door. In the bedroom, they find the body of a woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to their apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. She and Betty have sex that night. At 2 a.m., Rita insists they go to a theater called Club Silencio. The emcee explains in different languages that everything is an illusion; [[Rebekah Del Rio]] comes on stage and begins singing the [[Roy Orbison]] song \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" in Spanish, then collapses while her vocals continue\u2014her performance was a recording. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor with a thump.\n\nDiane Selwyn wakes up in her bed in the same apartment that Betty and Rita investigated. She looks exactly like Betty, but is a failed actress driven into a deep depression by her failed affair with Camilla Rhodes, a successful actress who looks exactly like Rita. At Camilla's invitation, Diane attends a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. At dinner, Diane states she came to Hollywood when her Aunt Ruth died and left her some money, and she met Camilla at an audition for ''The Sylvia North Story''. Another woman who looks like the \"Camilla Rhodes\" from earlier kisses Camilla, and they turn and smile at Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make an important announcement, but they dissolve into laughter and kiss while Diane watches, crying. Later, Diane meets the hit man at Winkie's, appearing to hire him to kill Camilla. He tells her she will find a blue key in her apartment when the job is completed. In her apartment, Diane looks at the blue key on her coffee table. Distraught, she is terrorized by hallucinations and runs screaming to her bed, where she shoots herself. A woman at the theater whispers, \"Silencio.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn\n* [[Laura Elena Harring]] as Rita/Camilla Rhodes\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Adam Kesher\n* [[Ann Miller]] as Coco\n* [[Mark Pellegrino]] as Joe\n\n=== Supporting ===\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Detective McKnight\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Detective Domgaard\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Vincenzo Castigliane\n* [[Angelo Badalamenti]] as Luigi Castigliane\n* [[Monty Montgomery (producer)|Monty Montgomery]] as The Cowboy\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Louise Bonner\n* [[James Karen]] as Wally Brown\n* [[Chad Everett]] as Jimmy Katz\n* [[Richard Green (actor)|Richard Green]] as The Magician\n* [[Rebekah Del Rio]] as Herself\n* [[Melissa George]] as 1st Camilla Rhodes\n* [[Jeanne Bates]] as Irene\n* Dan Birnbaum as Irene's Companion\n* [[Lori Heuring]] as Lorraine\n* [[Marcus Graham]] as Mr. Darby\n* [[Michael J.

Tony Krantz, the agent who was responsible for the development of Twin Peaks, was \"fired up\" about doing another television show. Ironically, Lynch written \"I will never do television again\" on a piece of plywood. It was originally a script for a pilot for ABC. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only on the story of Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, \"I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble\u2014she ''is'' trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you.{{' \"}}Lynch showed ABC a rough cut of the pilot. The person who saw it, according to Lynch, was watching it at six in the morning and was having coffee and standing up. He hated the pilot and ABC immediately cancelled it.

In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable to cope with the guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.<ref name=\"tang\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/07/mulholland_dream/ |last=Tang |first=Jean |title=All you have to do is dream |date=November 7, 2001 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229232151/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/07/mulholland_dream/ |archivedate=December 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis interpretation was similar to what Naomi Watts construed, when she said in an interview, \"I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the [[damsel in distress]] and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls her as if she were a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be.\"<ref name=\"fuller\"/> Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, \"There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely.\"<ref name=\"pearce\">{{cite news |last=Pearce |first=Gareth |date=January 6, 2002 |title=Why Naomi is a girl's best friend |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |page=14}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' asked six well-known film critics for their own perceptions of the overall meaning in ''Mulholland Drive''. Neil Roberts of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and Tom Charity of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' subscribe to the theory that Betty is Diane's projection of a happier life. [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] seem to accept this interpretation, but both hesitate to overanalyze the film. Ebert states, \"There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.\" Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: \"Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or perhaps these things are the [[non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]] and subconscious of dreams.\"<ref name=\"lewis\">{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Robin |date=January 17, 2007 |title=Nice Film If You Can Get It: Understanding ''Mulholland Drive'' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,634856,00.html#article_continue |accessdate=August 17, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830011241/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0%2C%2C634856%2C00.html |archivedate=August 30, 2008}}</ref> [[Philip French]] from ''[[The Observer]]'' sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] rejects the theory of Betty's life as Diane's dream, but also warns against too much analysis.<ref name=\"lewis\" />\n\nMedia theorist Siobhan Lyons similarly disagrees with the dream theory, arguing that it is a \"superficial interpretation [which] undermines the strength of the absurdity of reality that often takes place in Lynch's universe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/moving-beyond-the-dream-theory-a-new-approach-to-mulholland-drive/|title=Moving Beyond the Dream Theory: A New Approach to 'Mulholland Drive'|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref> Instead, Lyons posits that Betty and Diane are in fact two different people who happen to look similar, a common motif among Hollywood starlets. In a similar interpretation, Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla may exist in [[multiverse|parallel universes]] that sometimes interconnect.

Rita falls asleep several times; in between these episodes, disconnected scenes such as the men having a conversation at Winkie's, Betty's arrival in Los Angeles and the bungled hit take place, suggesting that Rita may be dreaming them. The opening shot of the film zooms into a bed containing an unknown sleeper, instilling, according to film scholar Ruth Perlmutter, the necessity to ask if what follows is reality.<ref name=\"perlmutter\">{{cite journal |last=Permutter |first=Ruth |date=April 2005 |title=Memories, Dreams, Screens |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Film and Video]] |issue=22 |volume=2 |pages=125\u2013134|doi=10.1080/10509200590461837 }}</ref> Professor of dream studies Kelly Bulkeley argues that the early scene at the diner, as the only one in which dreams or dreaming are explicitly mentioned, illustrates \"revelatory truth and [[epistemology|epistemological]] uncertainty in Lynch's film\".<ref name=\"Dreams\">{{cite journal |last=Bulkeley |first=Kelly |date=March 2003 |title=Dreaming and the Cinema of David Lynch |journal=Dreaming |issue=13 |volume=1 |page=57 |doi=10.1023/a:1022190318612}}</ref> The monstrous being from the dream, who is the subject of conversation of the men in Winkie's, reappears at the end of the film right before and after Diane commits suicide. Bulkeley asserts that the lone discussion of dreams in that scene presents an opening to \"a new way of understanding everything that happens in the movie\".<ref name=\"Dreams\" />\n\nPhilosopher and film theorist [[Robert Sinnerbrink]] similarly notes that the images following Diane's apparent suicide undermine the \"dream and reality\" interpretation. After Diane shoots herself, the bed is consumed with smoke, and Betty and Rita are shown beaming at each other, after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers \"''Silencio''\" as the screen fades to black. Sinnerbrink writes that the \"concluding images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image\", also noting that it might be that the \"last sequence comprises the fantasy images of Diane's dying consciousness, concluding with the real moment of her death: the final ''Silencio''\".<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\">{{cite journal |last=Sinnerbrink |first=Robert |year=2005 |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol9-2005/n34sinnerbrink |title=Cinematic Ideas: David Lynch's ''Mulholland Drive'' |journal=Film-Philosophy |issue=9 |volume=34 |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref> Referring to the same sequence, film theorist Andrew Hageman notes that \"the ninety-second coda that follows Betty/Diane's suicide is a cinematic space that persists after the curtain has dropped on her living consciousness, and this persistent space is the very theatre where the illusion of illusion is continually unmasked\".<ref name=\"hageman\">{{cite journal|last=Hageman |first=Andrew |date=June 2008 |url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=11&id=1022 |title=The Uncanny Ecology of ''Mulholland Drive'' |journal=Scope \u2013 an Online Journal of Film and Television Studies |issue=11 |accessdate=August 17, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807090000/http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=11&id=1022 |archivedate=August 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFilm theorist David Roche writes that Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but rather force the audience into the role of becoming detectives themselves to make sense of the narratives, and that ''Mulholland Drive'', like other Lynch films, frustrates \"the spectator's need for a rational [[diegesis]] by playing on the spectator's mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis\". In Lynch's films, the spectator is always \"one step behind narration\" and thus \"narration prevails over diegesis\".<ref name=\"Roche\">{{cite journal |last=Roche |first=David |year=2004 |url=http://erea.revues.org/index432.html |title=The Death of the Subject in David Lynch's ''Lost Highway'' and ''Mulholland Drive'' |journal=E-rea: Revue \u00e9lectronique d'\u00e9tudes sur le monde anglophone |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=43}}</ref> Roche also notes that there are multiple mysteries in the film that ultimately go unanswered by the characters who meet dead ends, like Betty and Rita, or give in to pressures as Adam does. Although the audience still struggles to make sense of the stories, the characters are no longer trying to solve their mysteries. Roche concludes that ''Mulholland Drive'' is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together \"by the spectator-detective's desire to make sense\" of it.<ref name=\"Roche\" />\n\n===A \"poisonous valentine to Hollywood\"===\n[[File:Mulholland Drive at night.jpg|alt=The street lights and homes of San Fernando Valley lit up at night|thumb|The view of Los Angeles from Mulholland Drive has become an iconic representation of the city's opportunities.]]\nDespite the proliferation of theories, critics note that no explanation satisfies all of the loose ends and questions that arise from the film. Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes, \"''Mulholland Drive'' has little to do with any single character's love life or professional ambition.

The non-linear film is \"incapable of sustaining narrative coherence\", as Lee Wallace argues that, \"lesbianism dissolves the ideological conventions of narrative realism, operating as the switch point for the contesting storyworlds within Lynch\u2019s elaborately plotted film\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Wallace|first=Lee|title=Lesbianism, Cinema, Space|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-99243-5|location=New York|pages=99\u2013116}}</ref> The presence of mirrors and doppelgangers throughout the film \"are common representations of lesbian desire\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Postfeminism and the Fatale Figure in Neo-Noir Cinema |last=Lindop|first=Samantha|year=2015|doi=10.1057/9781137503596|isbn=978-1-137-50359-6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London}}</ref> The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita\u2013which borders on outright obsession\u2013has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966) and [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: \"The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire\".<ref name=\"Filippo74\">Filippo (2013), 74.</ref> Lynch pays direct homage to ''Persona'' in the scene where Rita dons the blonde wig, styled exactly like Betty's own hair. Rita and Betty then gaze at each other in the mirror \"drawing attention to their physical similarity, linking the sequence to theme of embrace, physical coupling and the idea of merging or doubling\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Mirroring and doubles, which are prominent themes throughout the film, serve to further queer the form and content of the film.\n\nSeveral theorists have accused Lynch of perpetuating stereotypes and clich\u00e9s of lesbians, bisexuals and lesbian relationships. Rita (the femme fatale) and Betty (the school girl) represent two classic stock lesbian characters; Heather Love identifies two key clich\u00e9s used in the film: \"Lynch presents lesbianism in its innocent and expansive form: lesbian desire appears as one big adventure, an entr\u00e9e into a glamorous and unknown territory\".<ref name=\"love\">Heather Love, \"Spectacular failure: the figure of the lesbian in ''Mulholland Drive''\", ''New Literary History'' 1, no. 35 (Winter 2004): 117\u2013132. {{doi|10.1353/nlh.2004.0021}}.</ref> Simultaneously, he presents the tragic lesbian triangle, \"in which an attractive but unavailable woman dumps a less attractive woman who is figured as exclusively lesbian\", perpetuating the stereotype of the bisexual \"ending up with a man\"<ref name=\"love\" />. Maria San Filippo recognizes that Lynch relies on classic film noir archetypes to develop Camilla's eventual betrayal: these archetypes \"become ingrained to such a degree that viewers are immediately cued that \u201cRita\u201d is not what she seems and that it is only a matter of time before she reveals her duplicitous nature.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filippo|first=Maria San|date=2011-01-06|title=The \"Other\" Dreamgirl|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=7|issue=1\u20132|pages=13\u201349|language=en|doi=10.1300/J159v07n01_03}}</ref> For Love, Diane's exclusively lesbian desire is \"between success and failure, between sexiness and abjection, even between life and death\" if she is rejected.<ref name=\"love\" /> Diane is the tragic lesbian clich\u00e9 pining after the bisexual in the heterosexual relationship. Love's analysis of the film notes the media's peculiar response to the film's lesbian content: \"reviewers rhapsodized in particular and at length about the film's sex scenes, as if there were a contest to see who could enjoy this representation of female same-sex desire the most.\"<ref name=\"love\" /> She points out that the film used a classic theme in literature and film depicting lesbian relationships: Camilla as achingly beautiful and available, rejecting Diane for Adam. Popular reaction to the film suggests the contrasting relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla are \"understood as both the hottest thing on earth and, at the same time, as something fundamentally sad and not at all erotic\" as \"the heterosexual order asserts itself with crushing effects for the abandoned woman\".<ref name=\"love\" />\n\nHeterosexuality as primary is important in the latter half of the film, as the ultimate demise of Diane and Camilla's relationship springs from the matrimony of the heterosexual couple. At Adam's party, they begin to announce that Camilla and Adam are getting married; through laughs and kisses, the declaration is delayed because it is obvious and expected. The heterosexual closure of the scene is  interrupted by ta scene change. As Lee Wallace suggests, by planning a hit against Camilla, \"Diane circumvents the heterosexual closure of the industry story but only by going over to its storyworld, an act that proves fatal for both women, the cause and effect relations of the thriller being fundamentally incompatible with the plot of lesbianism as the film presents it\".<ref name=\":0\" />  For Joshua Bastian Cole,  Adam's character serves as Diane's foil, what she can never be, which is why Camilla leaves her. In her fantasy, Adam has his own subplot which leads to his humiliation. While this subplot can be understood as a revenge fantasy born from jealousy, Cole argues that this is an example of Diane's transgender gaze: \"Adam functions like a mirror- a male object upon which Diane might project herself\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bastian Cole|first=Joshua|date=March 2018|title=Passing Glances: Recognizing the Trans Gaze in Mulholland Drive|journal=Somatechnics|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.3366/soma.2018.0238|issn=2044-0138}}</ref> Diane's prolonged eye-contact with Dan at Winkie's is another example of the trans gaze. For Cole, \"Diane\u2019s strange recognition of Dan, which is not quite identification but something else, feels trans in its oblique line, drawn between impossible doubles\" and their similar names (Dan/Diane) which is no mistake.<ref name=\":2\" /> He stresses that the lesbian understanding of the film has overshadowed potential trans interpretations; his reading of Diane's trans gaze is a contribution to the queer narrative of the film''.''\n\nMedia portrayals of Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen relationships were varied and conflicting. Watts said of the filming of the scene, \"I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had tears in my eyes because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit.\"<ref>[[Dennis Hensley]], \"Lust Highway\", ''[[Total Film]]'' 61 (February 2002): 72\u201374.</ref> However, in another interview Watts stated, \"I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic.\"<ref name=\"pearce\" /> While Harring was quoted saying, \"The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [her] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [over]. Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians.\"<ref name=\"ferber\">Lawrence Ferber, \"Sapphic Strangeness\", ''Watermark'', October 11, 2001, 31.</ref> Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in ''Mulholland Drive'' is not as important as desire: \"who we are does not count for much\u2014what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do.\"<ref name=\"love\" />\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:BettyMulholland.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Naomi Watts beaming and facing into soft light holding the arm of an older woman while they take a down escalator at Los Angeles International Airport|Betty (Watts) arrives in Los Angeles; pictured with Irene ([[Jeanne Bates]]).

But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious.<ref name=\"taubin\" /> Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on [[Doris Day]], [[Tippi Hedren]] and [[Kim Novak]], observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone \"who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it's somebody else's\".<ref name=\"fuller\" /> This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had na\u00efvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a \"complicit actor\" who had \"embraced the very structure that\" destroyed her.<ref name=\"hageman\" /> In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated:\n\n<blockquote>I had to therefore come up with my own decisions about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience.

The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty's previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynch's use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters.<ref name=\"toles\" /> Betty's acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film that ultimately turns against her.<ref name=\"perlmutter\" />\n\n'''Rita''' (Laura Elena Harring) is the mysterious and helpless apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert was so impressed with Harring that he said of her \"all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55&nbsp;years for a ''[[Gilda]]'' remake\".<ref name=\"ebert\" /> She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire to make sense of the film through her identity.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=198}} Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is \"the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her\".<ref name=\"lopate\" /> A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave.<ref name=\"hudson\" /> Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of ''Mulholland Drive'' can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=199}} According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=94}}\n\n[[File:Rita Poster Mulholland.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|alt=Laura Elena Harring wet from a shower and wrapped in a red towel, looking into the mirror at a reflection of the theatrical poster for the film ''Gilda''|The dark-haired woman (Harring) assumes the name \"Rita\" after seeing the name on a poster. Her search for her identity has been interpreted by film scholars as representing the audience's desire to make sense of the film.]]\n\nAfter Betty and Rita find the decomposing body, they flee the apartment and their images are split apart and reintegrated. David Roche notes that Rita's lack of identity causes a breakdown that \"occurs not only at the level of the character but also at the level of the image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters\".<ref name=\"Roche\" /> Immediately they return to Betty's aunt's apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig\u2014ostensibly to disguise herself\u2014but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the melding of both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Rita's personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla.<ref name=\"nochimson\" />\n\n'''Diane Selwyn''' (Naomi Watts) is the palpably frustrated and depressed woman, who seems to have ridden the coattails of Camilla, whom she idolizes and adores, but who does not return her affection. She is considered to be the reality of the too-good-to-be-true Betty, or a later version of Betty after living too long in Hollywood.<ref name=\"holden\" /> For Steven Dillon, the plot of the film \"makes Rita the perfect empty vessel for Diane's fantasies\", but because Rita is only a \"blank cover girl\" Diane has \"invested herself in emptiness\", which leads her to depression and apparently to suicide.{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=95}} Hence, Diane is the personification of dissatisfaction, painfully illustrated when she is unable to climax while masturbating, in a scene that indicates \"through blurred, jerky, point of view shots of the stony wall\u2014not only her tears and humiliation but the disintegration of her fantasy and her growing desire for revenge\".<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\" /> One analysis of Diane suggests her devotion to Camilla is based on a manifestation of [[narcissism]], as Camilla embodies everything Diane wants and wants to be.<ref name=\"ridgway\">{{cite journal |last=Ridgway |first=Franklin |date=Fall 2006 |title=You Came Back!; Or Mulholland Treib |journal=Post Script: Essays in Film and the Humanities |issue=26 |volume=1 |pages=43\u201361}}</ref> Although she is portrayed as weak and the ultimate loser, for Jeff Johnson, author of a book about morality in Lynch films, Diane is the only character in the second portion of the film whose moral code remains intact. She is \"a decent person corrupted by the miscellaneous miscreants who populate the film industry\".{{sfn|Johnson|2004|p=137}} Her guilt and regret are evident in her suicide, and in the clues that surface in the first portion of the film. Rita's fear, the dead body and the illusion at Club Silencio indicate that something is dark and wrong in Betty and Rita's world. In becoming free from Camilla, her moral conditioning kills her.{{sfn|Johnson|2004|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n'''Camilla Rhodes''' (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) is little more than a face in a photo and a name that has inspired many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam.

Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have \"sucked the life out of Diane\".<ref name=\"love\" /> Immediately after telling Diane that she drives her wild, Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a film set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane\u2014at Camilla's request\u2014where Adam shows another actor just how to kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Diane's conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Diane's desire for Camilla.<ref name=\"wyman\">{{cite web |last3=Wyman |first3=Bill |last1=Garrone |first1=Max |last2=Klein |first2=Andy |title=Everything you were afraid to ask about 'Mulholland Drive' |work=Salon |date=October 23, 2001 |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/10/23/mulholland_drive_analysis/index.html |accessdate=August 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522071207/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/10/23/mulholland_drive_analysis/index.html |archivedate=May 22, 2009  }}</ref>\n\n'''Adam Kesher''' (Justin Theroux) is established in the first portion of the film as a \"vaguely arrogant\",{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=208}} but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another.

After he checks into a seedy motel and pays with cash, the manager arrives to tell him that his credit is no good. Witnessed by Diane, Adam is pompous and self-important. He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from the first part of the film to the second.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|pp=205\u2013206}} One analysis of Adam's character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Betty's cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power.<ref name=\"nochimson\" />\n\nMinor characters include The Cowboy (Monty Montgomery), the Castigliani Brothers (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti) and Mr. Roque (Michael J. Anderson), all of whom are somehow involved in pressuring Adam to cast Camilla Rhodes in his film. These characters represent the death of creativity for film scholars,<ref name=\"ridgway\" />{{sfn|Sheen|Davison|2004|p=171}} and they portray a \"vision of the industry as a closed hierarchical system in which the ultimate source of power remains hidden behind a series of representatives\".<ref name=\"taubin\" /> Ann Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. Coco, in the first part of the film, represents the old guard in Hollywood, who welcomes and protects Betty. In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adam's mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely pays attention to Diane's embarrassed tale of how she got into acting.<ref name=\"ridgway\" />\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Mulholland Drive Mr Roque.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A short, strange-looking man seated in a large wooden wheelchair under an intense beam of light in a large and sparsely furnished room; a desk is in a far corner and the walls are covered in curtains.|Dwarf actor [[Michael J.

By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst, Jennifer Hudson, writes of him, \"Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams.\"<ref name=\"hudson\" />\n\nDavid Lynch uses various methods of deception in ''Mulholland Drive''. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, who seems to control film studios, is portrayed by [[dwarfism|dwarf]] actor [[Michael J. Anderson]] (also from ''[[Twin Peaks]]''). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small.{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=209}} During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate \"cruel and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]\" act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only to see what she senses.<ref name=\"ridgway\" /> In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: \"It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not.\"<ref name=\"ridgway\"/>\n\nAccording to Stephen Dillon, Lynch's use of different camera positions throughout the film, such as hand-held points of view, makes the viewer \"identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space\", but that Lynch at moments also \"disconnects the camera from any particular point of view, thereby ungrounding a single or even a human perspective\" so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling \"our sense of the individual and the human\".{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=100}} Andrew Hageman similarly notes that the camera work in the film \"renders a very disturbing sense of place and presence\", such as the scene in Winkie's where the \"camera floats irregularly during the shot-reverse shot dialogue\" by which the \"spectator becomes aware that a set of normally objective shots have become disturbingly subjective\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> Scholar Curt Hersey recognizes several [[avant-garde]] techniques used in the film including lack of transitions, abrupt transitions, motion speed, nontraditional camera movement, [[computer-generated imagery]], nondiegetic images, [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear narration]] and [[intertextuality]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hersey |first=Curt |year=2002 |title=Diegetic Breaks and the Avant-Garde |journal=The Journal of Moving Image Studies |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FightMulholland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring arguing on two sides of an open door|An emotionally troubled Diane exchanges words with Camilla.

In the darker part of the film, sound transitions to the next scene without a visual reference where it is taking place. At Camilla's party, when Diane is most humiliated, the sound of crashing dishes is heard that carries immediately to the scene where dishes have been dropped in the diner, and Diane is speaking with the hit man. Sinnerbrink also notes that several scenes in the film, such as the one featuring Diane's hallucination of Camilla after Diane wakes up, the image of the being from behind Winkie's after Diane's suicide, or the \"repetition, reversal and displacement of elements that were differently configured\" in the early portion of the film, creates the [[Uncanny|uncanny effect]] where viewers are presented with familiar characters or situations in altered times or locations.<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\" /> Similarly, Hageman has identified the early scene at Winkie's as \"extremely uncanny\", because it is a scene where the \"boundaries separating physical reality from the imaginary realities of the unconscious disintegrate\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> Author Valtteri Kokko has identified three groups of \"uncanny metaphors\"; the [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of multiple characters played by the same actors, dreams and an everyday object\u2014primarily the blue box\u2014that initiates Rita's disappearance and Diane's real life.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kokko |first=Valtteri |year=2004 |url=http://www.widerscreen.fi/2004/1/psychological_horror_in_the_films_of_lynch.htm |title=Psychological Horror in the Films of David Lynch |journal=Wider Screen |issue=1 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927081849/http://www.widerscreen.fi/2004/1/psychological_horror_in_the_films_of_lynch.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother recurring element in Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, \"you look at the image and the scene silent, it's doing the job it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done.
