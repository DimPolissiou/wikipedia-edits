In eukaryotes, this is known as pre-mRNA which undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce mature mRNA. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of single nucleotides by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand, behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\nRibosomes are complex molecule machines, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit) which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>. In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[Peptidyl transferase|peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=Second}}</ref>.\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=Second}}</ref>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage.

In eukaryotes, this is known as pre-mRNA which undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce mature mRNA. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand.

The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain.

Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits. <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is the single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref> which changes codon 6 from encoding glutamic acid to encoding valine <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. \n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to the tissue and can lead to [[tissue death|necrosis]] which causes pain to the individual <ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2}}</ref>. \n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm <ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049}}</ref>.

Examples of processes which add chemical groups to the target protein include [[Protein methylation|methylation]], [[Protein acetylation|acetylation]] and [[Protein phosphorylation|phosphorylation]]. \n\nMethylation is the reversible addition of a [[methyl group]] onto an amino acid catalysed by an enzyme known as a [[methyltransferase]]. Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. One example of a protein which is commonly methylated is a [[histone]], DNA is wrapped around histones in the nucleus, a highly specific pattern of [[histone methylation]] is used to control gene transcription in the nucleus <ref name=\"Murn 2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Murn |first1=Jernej |last2=Shi |first2=Yang |title=The winding path of protein methylation research: milestones and new frontiers |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |date=2017 |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=517\u2013527 |doi=10.1038/nrm.2017.35}}</ref>. \n\nHistone-based regulation of gene transcription is also modified by acetylation. Acetylation is the reversible covalent addition of an [[acetyl group]] onto a lysine amino acid, from a donor molecule known as [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl coenzyme A]], by the enzyme [[acetyltransferase]]. The nuclear proteins [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation|histones undergo acetylation]] on their lysine residues by enzymes known as [[histone acetyltransferase]]. The effect of acetylation is to weaken the interactions between the histone and DNA which makes more genes accessible for transcription <ref name=\"Bannister 2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Bannister |first1=Andrew J |last2=Kouzarides |first2=Tony |title=Regulation of chromatin by histone modifications |journal=Cell Research |date=2011 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013395 |doi=10.1038/cr.2011.22}}</ref>. \n\nThe final, prevalent post-translational chemical group modification is phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids within the protein, mainly [[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]], by a protein [[kinase]]. Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=Sixth}}</ref>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>. \n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].   \n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=Sixth}}</ref>.\n\n===Formation of intramolecular bonds===\nDisulphide bond \n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n", "name_user": "Kep17", "label": "safe", "comment": "Addition of missed reference to the acetylation section within addition of chemical groups - post translational modifications", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"}

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

They stated that it is not possible for the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Japan on a person-to-person basis, but that there is a possibility that it can regulate the overall speed of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/newpage_00006.html|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u91dd\u306e\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u898b\u89e3 (Opinion on the Realization of Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control)|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70 (Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting)|date=February 24, 2020|website=Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>&nbsp; They cited the next week or two as a \"critical moment\" on whether the country would experience a large cluster that could result in the collapse of the medical system and socio-economic chaos. After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.&nbsp; Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to \"chaos,\" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the ''Diamond Princess''. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into \"breeding grounds\" of COVID-19.<ref name=\"nippon1\">[https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00269/coronavirus-basic-policy-impacts-japan%e2%80%99s-health-education-systems.html?cx_recs_click=true \"Coronavirus Basic Policy Impacts Japan\u2019s Health, Education Systems\"]. Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp; June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters are demanding an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests.

disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823

the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion\"/><ref name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref

feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the

discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\". Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign. For the demand to set up an independent commission to investigate police misconduct, she insisted that the existing mechanism, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) would suffice.<ref name=\"scmp_3017795\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190709\"/>\n\nAfter condemning the protesters for storming the legislature on 1 July for their \"use of extreme violence\"<ref name=\"hkfp_20190702_condemnsoccupation\"/> and defacing the national emblem during the 21 July protest,<ref name=\"coconutshk_20190722\"/> Lam suggested in early August that the protests had derailed from their original purposes and that its goal was to challenge China's sovereignty and damage \"[[one country, two systems]]\".<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> She suggested that the radical protesters were dragging Hong Kong to a \"point of no return\"<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\" /> and that they had \"no stake in society\",<ref name=\"standardhk_132809\"/> a remark that received criticisms from some civil servants.<ref name=\"standardhk_133040\"/>\n\nFollowing a rally on 18 August that was attended by more than 1.7&nbsp;million people, Lam announced that she would create platforms for dialogue.<ref name=\"scmp_3023512\"/> On 4 September, Lam announced that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill, introduce measures such as introducing new members to the IPCC, engaging in dialogue in a community level, and inviting academics to evaluate the deep-rooted problems of Hong Kong. However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners.

Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts

Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

{"title_page": "Positive disintegration", "text_new": "The '''theory of positive disintegration''' ('''TPD''') by [[Kazimierz D\u0105browski]] is a theory of [[personality development]]. Unlike mainstream [[psychology]], D\u0105browski's theoretical framework views psychological tension and [[anxiety]] as necessary for growth.  These \"disintegrative\" processes are therefore seen as \"positive\", whereas people who fail to go through positive disintegration may remain for their entire lives in a state of \"primary integration\", lacking true individuality. Advancing into disintegration and into the higher levels of development is predicated on having developmental potential, including overexcitabilities, above-average reactions to stimuli.\n\nUnlike some other theories of development such as [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels.  TPD is not a theory of stages, and levels do not correlate with age.\n\n==D\u0105browski's theory==\nKazimierz D\u0105browski (1902\u20131980), a [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychologist]], developed the Theory of Positive Disintegration which led to the 1964 publication of the eponymous book, \"Positive Disintegration\". He was heavily influenced by his [[Catholic]] upbringing which inspired personal sacrifice and intimated perpetual torment for some. He pursued a lifelong obsession with self-mutilation resulting in his semi-autobiographical 1937 work, \"Psychological Basis of Self Mutilation.\" His personal experience as a victim of [[medical torture]]{{by whom?|date=May 2019}} for several months as a member of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]], being only one of the 36 surviving psychiatrists in Poland out of the 400 practicing at the beginning of [[World War II]], informed his world view.{{CN|date=May 2019}} He believed that the key to the treatment of mental illness was intense personal suffering and hence singled out the self-infliction of suffering as essential to personal development. <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=C4sf_XDicrUC |title=Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration |year = 2008| page=7|isbn=9780910707848 |last1=Mendaglio |first1=Sal }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26692/Dissertation.pdf?sequence=2 |title=A Hermeneutic Historical Study of Kazimierz Dabrowski and his Theory of Positive Disintegration| year=2002|author=Battaglia, M.}}</ref>\n\nD\u0105browski's ''theory of personality development'' emphasised several major features including:\n* personality is not a given universal trait, it must be created&mdash;shaped&mdash;by the individual to reflect his or her own unique character (personality shaping)\n* personality develops as a result of the action of developmental potential (DP) (overexcitability and the autonomous factor), not everyone displays sufficient DP to create a unique personality.\n* developmental potential is represented in the population by a [[normal distribution|normal]] (bell) curve.  D\u0105browski used a multilevel approach to describe the continuum of developmental levels seen in the population.\n* developmental potential creates crisis characterized by strong anxieties and depressions&mdash;psychoneurosis&mdash;that precipitate disintegration\n* for personality to develop, initial integrations based on instinct and socialization must disintegrate&mdash;a process D\u0105browski called positive disintegration\n* the development of a hierarchy of individual values&mdash;[[emotional]] reactions&mdash;is a critical component in developing one's personality and one's autonomy, thus, in contrast to most psychological theories, emotions play a major role in this approach\n* emotional reactions guide the individual in creating his or her individual personality ideal, an autonomous standard that acts as the goal of individual development\n* the individual must examine his or her essence and subsequently make existential choices that emphasize those aspects of essence that are higher and \"more myself\" and inhibit those aspects that are lower or \"less myself\" based upon his or her own personality ideal\n* critical components of individual development include autoeducation and autopsychotherapy\n\n===Factors in personality development===\nD\u0105browski observed that most people live their lives in a state of \"primary or primitive integration\" largely guided by biological impulses (\"first factor\") and/or by uncritical endorsement and adherence to social conventions (\"second factor\"). He called this initial integration Level I. D\u0105browski observed that at this level there is no true individual expression of the autonomous human self. Individual expression at Level I is influenced and constrained by the first two factors.\n\nThe first factor channels energy and talents toward accomplishing self-serving goals that reflect the \"lower instincts\" and biological ego\u2014its primary focus is on survival and self-advancement. Often talents are used in antisocial or asocial ways. For example, at the lowest edge of Level I many criminals display this type of selfish behavior. They tend to advance their own goals at the expense of others.\n\nThe second factor, the social environment (milieu) and [[peer pressure]], constrains individual expression and [[creativity]] by encouraging a group view of life and discouraging individual thought and expression. The second factor externalizes values and morals, thereby externalizing conscience. Social forces shape expectations.  Behavior and one's talents and creativity are funneled into forms that follow and support the existing social milieu. \"My mom says we should always be aware of what our lawn looks like because we want other people to think well of us when they drive by.\"{{CN|date=May 2019}} Because conscience is derived from an external social context, so long as society holds ethical standards, people influenced by the second factor will behave ethically. However, if a society becomes corrupt, people strongly influenced by second factor will not dissent. [[Socialization]] without individual examination leads to a rote and robotic existence (the \"robopath\" described by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]). Individual reactions are not unique, they are based upon social contexts (\"I cry at funerals and laugh at weddings\u2014everyone does\"). According to D\u0105browski, people primarily motivated by second factor represent a significant majority of the general population.{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\nD\u0105browski felt that our society was largely influenced by the two lower factors and could be characterized as operating at Level I. For example, our emphasis on corporate success (\"a dog eat dog mentality\") means that many [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]]s operate on the basis of first factor\u2014they will quickly sacrifice another to enhance their own advancement. As well, our educational, political, corporate, and media systems are self-promoting and discourage real examination or individual autonomy\u2014the second factor. Alternatively, social justifications are often used: \"of course I break the speed limit, everyone does.\"  Or a soldier may explain that he or she was simply \"following orders\". Thus, this external value system absolves the individual of any individual responsibility.{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\nD\u0105browski also described a group of people who display a different course: an individualized developmental pathway. Such people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which D\u0105browski called negative adjustment) and are said to move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. D\u0105browski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our [[status quo]] and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc.{{CN|date=May 2019}} If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for D\u0105browski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be\u2014how the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her \"new\" autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on.\n\n===Development potential===\nAdvanced development is often seen in people who exhibit strong developmental potential (\"DP\"). Developmental potential represents a constellation of genetic features, expressed and mediated through environmental interaction.  Many factors are incorporated in developmental potential but three major aspects are highlighted: overexcitability (OE), specific abilities and talents, and a strong drive toward autonomous growth, a feature D\u0105browski called the \"third factor\".{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\n====Overexcitability====\nThe most evident aspect of developmental potential is [[overexcitability]] (OE), a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. The greater the OE, the more intense are the day-to-day experiences of life. D\u0105browski outlined five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual, and emotional. These overexcitabilities, especially the latter three, often cause a person to experience daily life more intensely and to feel the extremes of the joys and sorrows of life profoundly. D\u0105browski studied human exemplars and found that heightened overexcitability was a key part of their developmental and life experience. These people are steered and driven by their value \"rudder\", their sense of emotional OE. Combined with imaginational and intellectual OE, these people have a powerful perception of the world.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1972|p=6}}\n\nAlthough based in the nervous system, overexcitabilities come to be expressed psychologically through the development of structures that reflect the emerging autonomous self. The most important of these conceptualizations are dynamisms: biological or mental forces that control behavior and its development. Instincts, drives and intellectual processes combined with emotions are dynamisms.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1972|p=294}} With advanced development, dynamisms increasingly reflect movement toward autonomy.\n\n====Abilities and talents====\nThe second aspect of developmental potential, specific abilities and talents, tends to serve the person's developmental level. As outlined, people at lower levels use talents to support egocentric goals or to climb the social and corporate ladders. At higher levels, specific talents and abilities become an important force as they are channeled by the person's value hierarchy into expressing and achieving the person's vision of his or her ideal personality and his or her view of how the world ought to be.\n\n====The third factor====\nThe third aspect of developmental potential (DP), which is simply referred to as 'the third factor', is a drive toward individual growth and autonomy. The third factor is critical as it applies one's talents and creativity toward autonomous expression, and second, it provides motivation to strive for more and to try to imagine and achieve goals currently beyond one's grasp. D\u0105browski was clear to differentiate third factor from [[free will]]. He felt that free will did not go far enough in capturing the motivating aspects that he attributed to third factor.  For example, an individual can exercise free will and show little motivation to grow or change as an individual. Third factor specifically describes a motivation\u2014a motivation to become one's self. This motivation is often so strong that  in some situations we can observe that one needs to develop oneself and that in so doing, it places one at great peril.  This feeling of \"I've gotta be me\"  especially when it is \"at any cost\" and especially when it is expressed as a strong motivator for self-growth is beyond the usual conceptualization ascribed to free will.{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\nA person whose DP is high enough ''will generally'' undergo disintegration, despite any external social or family efforts to prevent it. A person whose DP is low will ''generally not'' undergo disintegration (or positive personality growth) even in a conducive environment.\n\nThe notion that some people have an innate potential for development that is determined by a higher sensitivity or overexcitability (analogous to the first aspect of DP) and by a related tendency to develop individual differences and autonomy from the group (analogous to the third aspect of DP) was independently developed by Elaine Aron (see [[Highly sensitive person]])<ref>{{cite journal |last=Aron |first=E. N. |title=The Clinical Implications of Jungs Concept of Sensitiveness |journal=Journal of Jungian Theory and Practice |volume=8 |year=2006 |issue= |pages=11\u201343 |quote=Sensitive persons can certainly have mood disorders, but should not be mistaken for being chronically depressed only because of a pessimistic view of the future of the world or of their own abilities (a pessimism which may well be accurate, as in the case of depressive realism). Likewise they do not have an anxiety disorder merely because they worry more than the nonsensitive, and they do not have a personality disorder (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, etc.) merely because their unusualness has been present throughout their lives as an impediment to the cheerful, resilient functioning expected of most people most of the time.... They cannot shut out the world's achingly subtle, fleeting beauty or its inexplicable cruelty and suffering. They must find their own meaning in it. |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.490.9371 }}</ref> (although Aron's approach is substantially different from D\u0105browski's).\n\n====Developmental obstacles====\nD\u0105browski called OE \"a tragic gift\" to reflect that the road of the person with strong OE is not a smooth or easy one. Potentials to experience great highs are also potentials to experience great lows. Similarly, potentials to express great creativity hold the likelihood of experiencing a great deal of personal conflict and [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]. This stress both drives development and is a result of developmental conflicts, both intrapsychic and social. [[Suicide]] is a significant risk in the acute phases of this stress. The isolation often experienced by these people heightens the risk of [[self-harm]].\n\nD\u0105browski advocated [[#Autopsychotherapy|autopsychotherapy]], educating the person about OEs and the disintegrative process to give him or her a context within which to understand intense feelings and needs. D\u0105browski suggested giving people support in their efforts to develop and find their own [[self-expression]]. Children and adults with high DP have to find and walk their own path, often at the expense of fitting in with their social peers and even with their families.  At the core of autopsychotherapy is the awareness that no one can show anyone else the \"right\" path.  Everyone has to find their own path for themselves. Alluding to the knights on the [[Grail Quest]], the Jungian analyst, [[Joseph Campbell]] allegedly said: \"If a path exists in the forest, don't follow it, for though it took someone else to the Grail, it will not take you there, because it is not your path\".{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\n==The levels==\nThe first and fifth levels are characterized by psychological integration, harmony, and little inner conflict. There is little internal conflict at Level I because just about every behavior is justified\u2014it is either good for the individual and is therefore \"right\", or the individual's society endorses it and it is therefore \"right\".  In either case, with a high level of confidence the individual acts as he or she perceives anyone else would, and does what anyone is \"supposed to do\". At Level V there is no internal conflict because what a person does is always in accord with their own internal sense of values. Of course, there is often external conflict at both Levels I and V.\n\nLevels II, III and IV describe various degrees and types of dis-integration and literal disease.\n\nD\u0105browski was very clear that the levels he presents \"represent a heuristic device\". In the process of development the structures of two or even three contiguous levels may exist side by side, although it must be understood that they exist in conflict. The conflict is resolved when one of the structures is eliminated, or at least comes under complete control of another structure.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1996|p=17}}\n\n===Level I: Primary integration===\nAs outlined above, the first level is called primitive or primary integration. People at this level are often influenced primarily by either prominent first factor (heredity/impulse) and/or second factor (social environment) forces.  The majority of people at Level I are integrated at the environmental or social level (D\u0105browski called them average people); however, many also exhibit shades of both impulse and socialization. D\u0105browski distinguished the two subgroups of Level I by degree: \"the state of primary integration is a state contrary to mental health. A fairly high degree of primary integration is present in the average person; a very high degree of primary integration is present in the psychopath\".{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=121}} Marked by selfishness and [[egocentrism]] (both reticent and explicit), those at level one development generally seek self-fulfillment above all, justifying their pursuits through a sort of \"it's all about me\" thinking; or, more simply put, they adhere strongly to the phrase \"the end justifies the means\", sometimes disregarding the severity of the \"means\". Many people who are considered \"leaders\" often fall into this category.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=127}}\n\nA vast majority of people either do not break down their primitive integration at all, or after a relatively short period of disintegration, usually experienced at the time of adolescence and early youth, end in a reintegration at the former level or in partial integration of some of the functions at slightly higher levels, without a transformation of the whole mental structure.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|Kawczak|Piechowski|1970|p=4}} Primary integration in the average person was proposed to be of a certain value due to its stability and predictability, and when accompanied by kindness and good-will, could represent persons who can provide support and stability to those experiencing disintegration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schl\u00e4ppy|first=Marie-Lise|date=2019|title=Understanding Mental Health Through the Theory of Positive Disintegration: A Visual Aid|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01291/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=10|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01291|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>\n\n===Level II: Unilevel disintegration===\nThe prominent feature of this level is an initial, brief and often intense [[crisis]] or series of crises.  Crises are spontaneous and occur on only one level. These crises involve alternatives that may appear to be different but ultimately are on the same level.\n\nUnilevel disintegration occurs during developmental crises such as puberty or menopause, in periods of difficulty in handling some stressful external event, or under psychological and psychopathological conditions such as nervousness and psychoneurosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=A more or less organized form of growth through positive disintegration. Lower psychoneuroses are predominantly psychosomatic in nature, higher psychoneuroses are highly conscious internal struggles whose tensions and frustrations are not anymore translated into somatic disorders.}}</ref>  Unilevel disintegration consists of processes on a single structural and emotional level; there is a prevalence of automatic dynamisms with only slight self-consciousness and self-control.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=6}}\n\nConflicts on the same level (horizontal) produce ambitendencies and ambivalences: the person is equally attracted by different but equivalent choices on the same level (ambitendencies) and is not able to decide what to do because he or she has no real preference between the choices (ambivalences).  If developmental forces are strong enough, ultimately, the person is thrust into an [[existentialism|existential]] crisis: one's social rationales no longer account for one's experiences and there are no alternative explanations.  During this phase, existential despair is the predominant emotion.  The resolution of this phase begins as individually chosen values begin to replace [[social mores]] that have been ingrained by rote and are integrated into a new hierarchy of personal values.  These new values often conflict with the person's previous social values.  Many of the status quo explanations for the \"way things are,\" learned through education and from the social order, collapse under conscious, individual scrutiny. This causes more conflicts focused on the person's analysis of his or her own reactions to the world at large and of the behavior of self and others. Common behaviors and the ethics of the prevailing social order come to be seen as inadequate, wrong or hypocritical.  Positive maladjustment prevails. For D\u0105browski, these crises represent a strong potential for development toward personal growth and mental health.  Using a positive definition, mental health reflects more than social conformity: it involves a careful, personal examination of the world and of one's values, leading to the development of an individual personality.\n\nLevel II is a transitional period. D\u0105browski said you either fall back (reintegration on a lower level), end negatively, in suicide or [[psychosis]] or move ahead to Level III.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=7}}\n\nThe transition from Level II to Level III involves a fundamental shift that requires a phenomenal amount of energy.  This period is the crossroads of development: from here one must either progress or regress. The struggle between D\u0105browski's three factors reflects this transitional crisis: \"Do I follow my instincts (first factor), my teachings (second factor) or my heart (third factor)?\"  The developmental answer is to transform one's lower instincts (automatic reactions like anger) into positive motivation, to resist rote and social answers, and to listen to one's inner sense of what one ought to do.\n\n===Level III: Spontaneous multilevel disintegration===\nLevel III describes a new type of conflict: a vertical conflict between two alternatives that are not simply different, but that exist on different levels. One is genuinely higher and the other is lower in comparison. These vertical conflicts initially arise from involuntary perceptions of higher versus lower choices in life. \"You just look at something, maybe for the 1000th time (to use the words of [[G. K. Chesterton]]), and it strikes you\u2014you see this one thing differently and once you do, it changes things. You can no longer 'go back and see it the way you did before.'\" D\u0105browski called this vertical dimension multilevelness. Multilevelness is a gradual realization of the \"possibility of the higher\" (a phrase D\u0105browski used frequently) and of the subsequent contrasts between the higher and the lower in life. These vertical comparisons often illustrate the lower, actual behavior of a person in contrast to higher, imagined ideals and alternative idealized choices. D\u0105browski believed that the authentic individual would choose the higher path as the clear and obvious one to follow (erasing the ambivalences and ambitendencies of unilevel conflicts). If the person's actual behavior subsequently falls short of the ideal, internal disharmony and a drive to review and reconstruct one's life often follow. Multilevelness thus represents a new and powerful type of conflict, a conflict that is developmental in D\u0105browski's approach.\n\nVertical conflicts are critical in leading to autonomy and advanced personality growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Disintegration is multilevel (or vertical), if there are conflicts between higher and lower levels of instinctive, emotional or intellectual functions, e.g. higher and lower forms of the sexual instinct, or the instinct of self-preservation, etc. It consists mainly in differentiation and hierarchization of various levels of functions with a tendency towards gradual stabilization of a new hierarchy. In the course of positive multilevel disintegration primitive, animalistic drives and structures are subject to a disintegration, that is weakening, loosening and even total destruction under the impact of developmental dynamisms (cf.) and gradually give way to new, higher levels and new, higher structures. There is a growth of consciousness of inner conflicts, self-consciousness and self-control. The processes of inner psychic transformation gain in intensity and authenticity (cf.). There is a gradual build-up of the inner psychic milieu (cf.) with its main dynamisms such as \"subject-object\" in oneself, the third factor, inner psychic transformation, autonomy and authentism, and the personality ideal.}}</ref> If the person is to achieve higher levels, the shift to multilevelness must occur. If a person does not have the developmental potential to move into a multilevel view, then he or she will fall back from the crises of Level II to reintegrate at Level I. In the shift to multilevelness, the horizontal (unilevel), stimulus-response model of life is replaced by a vertical and hierarchical analysis. This vertical view becomes anchored by one's emerging individual value structure, and all events are seen in relation to personal ideals. These personal value ideals become the personality ideal: how the person wants to live his or her life. As events in life are seen in relation to this multilevel, vertical view, it becomes impossible to support positions that favor the lower course when higher goals can be identified (or imagined).\n\n===Level IV: Directed multilevel disintegration===\nIn Level IV the person takes full control of their development. The involuntary spontaneous development of Level III is replaced by a deliberate, conscious and self-directed review of life from the multilevel perspective. This level marks the real emergence of the third factor, described by D\u0105browski as an autonomous factor \"of conscious choice (valuation) by which one affirms or rejects certain qualities in oneself and in one's environment\".{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1972|p=306}} The person consciously reviews his or her existing belief system and tries to replace lower, automatic views and reactions with carefully thought out, examined and chosen ideals. These new values will increasingly be reflected in the person's behavior. Behavior becomes less reactive, less automatic and more deliberate as behavioral choices fall under the influence of the person's higher, chosen ideals.\n\nSocial mores are reviewed and re-accepted by a conscious internalization when the individual feels it is appropriate. Likewise, when the person feels it is proper, a social value is reviewed and may be rejected to be replaced by a self-perceived higher alternative value. One's social orientation comes to reflect a deep responsibility based on both intellectual and emotional factors. At the highest levels, \"individuals of this kind feel responsible for the realization of justice and for the protection of others against harm and injustice. Their feelings of responsibility extend almost to everything.\"{{sfn|D\u0105browski|Kawczak|Sochanska|1973|p=97}} This perspective results from seeing life in relation to one's hierarchy of values (the multilevel view) and the subsequent appreciation of the potential of how life could be, and ought to be, lived. One's disagreements with the (lower level) world are expressed compassionately in doing what one can to help achieve the \"ought\".\n\nGiven their genuine (authentic) prosocial outlook, people achieving higher development also raise the level of their society. Prosocial here is not just support of the existing social order. If the social order is lower and you are adjusted to it, then you also reflect the lower (negative adjustment in D\u0105browski's terms, a Level I feature). Here, prosocial is a genuine cultivation of social interactions based on higher values. These positions often conflict with the status quo of a lower society (positive maladjustment). In other words, to be maladjusted to a low-level society is a positive feature.\n\n===Level V: Secondary integration===\nThe fifth level displays an integrated and harmonious character, but one vastly different from that at the first level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=The integration of all mental functions into a harmonious structure controlled by higher emotions such as the dynamism of personality ideal, autonomy and authenticity. Secondary integration is the outcome of the full process of positive disintegration.}}</ref> At this highest level, one's behavior is guided by conscious, carefully weighed decisions based on an individualized and chosen hierarchy of personal values. Behavior conforms to this inner standard of how life ought to be lived, and thus little inner conflict arises.\n\nLevel V is often marked by creative expression. Especially at Level V, problem solving and art represent the highest and noblest features of human life. Art captures the innermost emotional states and is based on a deep empathy and understanding of the subject. Often, human suffering and sacrifice are the subjects of these works. Truly visionary works, works that are unique and novel, are created by people expressing a vision unrestrained by convention. Advances in society, through politics, philosophy and religion, are therefore commonly associated with strong individual creativity or accomplishments.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Therapy===\nThe theory of positive disintegration has an extremely broad scope and has implications for many areas. One central application applies to psychological and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. D\u0105browski advocated a comprehensive, multidimensional diagnosis of the person's situation, including symptoms and developmental potentials.\n\n====Symptoms and developmental potential====\nIf the disintegration appears to fit into a developmental context, then the person is educated in the theory and encouraged to take a developmental view of his or her situation and experiences. Rather than being eliminated, symptoms are reframed to yield insight and understanding into life and the person's unique situation.\n\n====The importance of narratives====\nD\u0105browski illustrated his theory through autobiographies of and biographies about those who have experienced positive disintegration. The gifted child, the suicidal teen or the troubled artist is often experiencing the features of TPD, and if they accept and understand the meaning of their intense feelings and crisis, they can move ahead, not fall apart. The completion of an extensive autobiography to help the individual gain perspective on his or her past and present is an important component in the autopsychotherapy process. In this process, the therapist plays a very small role and acts more as an initial stimulus than an ongoing therapist.  D\u0105browski asked clients to read his books and to see how his ideas might relate to their lives.\n\n====Autopsychotherapy====\nFor D\u0105browski, the goal of therapy is to eliminate the therapist by providing a context within which a person can understand and help oneself, an approach to therapy that he called autopsychotherapy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Psychotherapy, preventive measures, or changes in living conditions consciously applied to oneself in order to control possible mental disequilibrium.}}</ref> The client is encouraged to embark on a journey of self-discovery with an emphasis on looking for the contrast between what is higher versus what is lower within his or her personality and value structure. The person is encouraged to further explore his or her value structure especially as it relates to the rationale and justification of positions. Discrepancies between values and behavior are highlighted. The approach is called autopsychotherapy to emphasize the important role that the individual must play in his or her own therapy process and in the larger process of personality development.  The individual must come to see that he or she is in charge of determining or creating his or her own unique personality ideal and value structure. This includes a critical review of social mores and values that have been learned.\n\nD\u0105browski was very concerned about what he called one-sided development<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Type of development limited to one talent or ability, or to a narrow range of abilities and mental functions. In such development the creative instinct and empathy appear absent. In exceptionally capable individuals their one-sided development may come under the control of a primitive disposing and directing center and in the extreme case may take the form of psychopathy or paranoia.}}</ref>, in which people display significant advanced development in only one aspect of life, usually intellectual. He believed that it is crucial to balance one's development.\n\n====Overexcitability====\nD\u0105browski also encouraged people to see their reactions (overexcitabilities) and their [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] view of the world in the context of their developmental potential. The experience of, and reaction to, crisis are a very important aspect of this approach and people are encouraged to experience personal crisis with a positive and developmental view.\n\nD\u0105browski reminds clients that without internal disease there is little stimulus for change or growth. Rather than trying to rapidly ameliorate symptoms, this approach encourages individuals to fully experience their feelings and to try to maintain a positive and developmental orientation to what they may perceive as strong depression or anxiety. Of course, this is a unique approach in today's world of seeking immediate and total relief of any unpleasant psychological experience (although it can be compared to Aron's to some extent).\n\n===Education===\n\nAnother primary focus is on education, in particular, over the past 25 years, on the experience of creative and [[gifted]]\nstudents. D\u0105browski hypothesized that these students will disproportionately show strong overexcitability and therefore will be prone to the disintegrative process.\n\n==D\u0105browski and the gifted individual==\nIn an appendix to D\u0105browski (1967), results of investigations done in 1962 with Polish youth are reported. Specifically, \"a group of gifted children and young people aged 8 to 23\" were examined (p.&nbsp;251). Of the 80 youth studied, 30 were \"intellectually gifted\" and 50 were from \"drama, ballet, and plastic art schools\" (p.&nbsp;251). D\u0105browski found that every one of the children displayed overexcitability, \"which constituted the foundation for the emergence of neurotic and psychoneurotic sets. Moreover it turned out that these children also showed sets of nervousness, neurosis, and psychoneurosis of various kinds and intensities, from light vegetative symptoms, or anxiety symptoms, to distinctly and highly intensive psychasthenic or hysterical sets\" (p.&nbsp;253). D\u0105browski asked why these children should display such \"states of nervousness or psychoneurosis\" and suggested that it was due to the presence of OE (p.&nbsp;255). \"Probably the cause is more than average sensitivity which not only permits one to achieve outstanding results in learning and work, but at the same time increases the number of points sensitive to all experiences that may accelerate anomalous reactions revealing themselves in psychoneurotic sets\" (p.&nbsp;255).\n\nThe association between OE and giftedness appears to be borne out in the research (Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995). It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. D\u0105browski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth.\n\n==Key ideas==\nThe theory is based on key ideas that may be listed as follows:\n\n*That our lower animal instincts (first factor) must be inhibited and transformed into \"higher\" forces for us to be Human (this ability to transform our instincts is what separates us from other animals).\n*That the common initial personality integration, based upon socialization (second factor), does not reflect true personality.\n*At the initial level of integration, there is little internal conflict as when one \"goes along with the group\", there is little sense of individual wrongdoing. External conflicts often relate to the blockage of social goals\u2014career frustrations for example. The social mores and values prevail with little question or conscious examination.\n*True personality must be based upon a system of values that are consciously and volitionally chosen by the person to reflect their own individual sense of \"how life ought to be\" and their \"personality ideal\"\u2014the ideal person they feel they \"ought to be\".\n*The lower animal instincts and the forces of peer groups and [[socialization]] are inferior to the autonomous self (personality) constructed by the conscious person.\n*To break down the initial integration, crises and disintegrations are needed, usually provided by life experience.\n*These disintegrations are positive if the person can achieve positive and developmental solutions to the situation.\n*\"Unilevel crises\" are not developmental as the person can only choose between equal alternatives (go left or go right?).\n*A new type of perception involves \"multilevelness\", a vertical view of life that compares lower versus higher alternatives and now allows the individual to choose a higher resolution to a crisis over other available, but lower, alternatives\u2014the developmental solution.\n*\"Positive disintegration\" is a vital developmental process.\n*D\u0105browski developed the idea of \"developmental potential\" to describe the forces needed to achieve autonomous personality development.\n*Developmental potential includes several factors including innate abilities and talents, \"overexcitability\" and the \"third factor\".\n*Overexcitability is a measure of an individual's level of nervous response. D\u0105browski found that the exemplars he studied all displayed an overly sensitive nervous system, also making them prone to [[angst]], depression and anxiety\u2014psychoneuroses in D\u0105browski's terms, a very positive and developmental feature.\n*The third factor is a measure of an individual's drive toward autonomy.\n*D\u0105browski's approach is very interesting philosophically as it is Platonic, reflecting the bias of [[Plato]] toward [[essence]]\u2014an individual's essence is a critical determinant of his or her developmental course in life. However, D\u0105browski also added a major [[Existentialism|existential]] aspect as well, what one depends upon the anxieties felt and on how one resolves the day to day challenges one faces. Essence must be realized through an existential and experiential process of development. The characterization advanced by [[Kierkegaard]] of \"Knights of faith\" may be compared to D\u0105browski's autonomous individual.\n*Reviewed the role of logic and reasoning in development and concludes that intellect alone does not fully help us know what to do in life. Incorporates [[Jean Piaget]]'s views of development into a broader scheme guided by emotion. Emotion (how one feels about something) is the more accurate guide to life's major decisions.\n*When multilevel and autonomous development is achieved, a secondary integration is seen reflecting the mature personality state. The individual has no inner conflict; they are in internal harmony as their actions reflect their deeply felt hierarchy of values.\n*Rejected [[Abraham Maslow]]'s description of [[self-actualization]] (D\u0105browski was a personal friend and correspondent of Maslow's). Actualization of an undifferentiated human self is not a developmental outcome in D\u0105browski's terms. D\u0105browski applied a multilevel (vertical) approach to self and saw the need to become aware of and to inhibit and reject the lower instinctual aspects of the intrinsic human self (aspects that Maslow would have us \"embrace without guilt\") and to actively choose and assemble higher elements into a new unique self. D\u0105browski would have us differentiate the initial self into higher and lower aspects, as we define them, and to reject the lower and actualize the higher in creating our unique personality.\n\n==Secondary integration versus self-actualization==\nPeople have often equated Maslow's concept of self-actualization with D\u0105browski's level of secondary integration. There are some major differences between these two ideas. Fundamentally, Maslow described self-actualization as a process where the  self is accepted \"as is\",  so both higher and lower aspects of the self are actualized. D\u0105browski introduces the notion that although the lower aspects may  initially be intrinsic to the self, as human beings we are able to become aware of their lower nature.  We are able to develop [[self-awareness]] into how we feel about these low levels\u2014if we feel badly about behaving in these  lower ways, then we are able to cognitively and volitionally  decide to inhibit and eliminate these behaviors. In this way, the  higher aspects of the self  are actualized while the lower aspects are inhibited and, for D\u0105browski, this is what is unique about humans and sets us apart from other animals \u2014 no other animal is able to differentiate their lower instincts and therefore can not inhibit their animalistic impulses, an idea also expressed in [[Helmuth_Plessner#The_three_categories_of_nature's_a_priori_and_the_\"eccentricity\"_of_human_intentionality|Plessner's eccentricity]]. D\u0105browski has gone beyond Maslow's idea of self-actualization and it is not appropriate to equate the two authors on this point.\n\n==Obstacles to the theory==\nBoth D\u0105browski and his work have faced many obstacles. Personally, he was severely affected by both [[World Wars]]. His work went against the grain as a humanistic theory promoting personal growth in the political atmosphere of [[Poland]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Another problem has been language. D\u0105browski wrote in [[Polish language|Polish]] and translated his works into [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[English language|English]] was the last language he learned and likely the most difficult in terms of capturing the subtleties of his ideas. In spite of these problems, D\u0105browski persevered with his studies of human development, developed his theory and practiced psychiatry all his life.\n\nD\u0105browski died in 1980 and his students went on to explore careers of their own. Many of these students continue to study and speak on the theory, most advancing a deeply personal understanding of what the theory means to them.\n\nSince 1980, there has been a small but consistent demand for D\u0105browski's works. This demand has largely evolved in the United States where Michael Piechowski applied his vision of the theory to gifted education. Many in education and in [[gifted education]] have looked to D\u0105browski's theory to help provide a context for their students. Although a small part of the overall theory, this aspect has generated a number of Master's and Ph.D. theses and introduced the theory to a large audience.\n\nThe reader interested in D\u0105browski has faced a serious scarcity of resources, especially of D\u0105browski's English works. His books are long out of print and rare, and his papers are held by a few people but not circulated. There are also many Polish works by D\u0105browski (about 20 books) on the theory, on psychotherapy, on education and on philosophy that have not been translated into English.\n\nOne severe hurdle to the investigation and study of the theory of positive disintegration is the fact that no suitable psychological test exists that measures any D\u0105browskian constructs well. The most widely known instrument, the Overexcitability Questionnaire\u2014Two, has poor psychometric properties.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=An investigation of measurement invariance across genders on the Overexcitability Questionnaire--Two|journal=Journal of Advanced Academics|date=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=578\u2013293|doi=10.1177/1932202x11414821}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Anti-psychiatry]]\n*[[Antifragility]]\n*[[Eustress]]\n*[[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]\n*[[Personality psychology]]\n*[[Personal development]]\n*[[Posttraumatic growth]]\n*[[Role suction]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com}}\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = D\u0105browski | first1 = K. | year = 1937 | title = Psychological Basis of Self Mutilation | url = | journal = Genetic Psychology Monographs | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 1\u2013104 }}\n*{{Cite book|last=D\u0105browski|first=K.|year=1964|title=Positive Disintegration|location=Boston, Mass.|publisher=Little Brown.|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = D\u0105browski | first1 = K. | year = 1966 | title = The Theory of Positive Disintegration | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 229\u201344 }}\n*{{Cite book|last=D\u0105browski|first=K.|year=1967|title=Personality-shaping through Positive Disintegration|location=Boston, Mass.|publisher=Little Brown.|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last1=D\u0105browski|first1=K.|first2=A.|last2=Kawczak|first3=M.

Unlike mainstream [[psychology]], D\u0105browski's theoretical framework views psychological tension and [[anxiety]] as necessary for growth.  These \"disintegrative\" processes are therefore seen as \"positive\", whereas people who fail to go through positive disintegration may remain for their entire lives in a state of \"primary integration\", lacking true individuality. Advancing into disintegration and into the higher levels of development is predicated on having developmental potential, including overexcitabilities, above-average reactions to stimuli.\n\nUnlike some other theories of development such as [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels.  TPD is not a theory of stages, and levels do not correlate with age.\n\n==D\u0105browski's theory==\nKazimierz D\u0105browski (1902\u20131980), a [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychologist]], developed the Theory of Positive Disintegration which led to the 1964 publication of the eponymous book, \"Positive Disintegration\". He was heavily influenced by his [[Catholic]] upbringing which inspired personal sacrifice and intimated perpetual torment for some. He pursued a lifelong obsession with self-mutilation resulting in his semi-autobiographical 1937 work, \"Psychological Basis of Self Mutilation.\" His personal experience as a victim of [[medical torture]]{{by whom?|date=May 2019}} for several months as a member of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]], being only one of the 36 surviving psychiatrists in Poland out of the 400 practicing at the beginning of [[World War II]], informed his world view.{{CN|date=May 2019}} He believed that the key to the treatment of mental illness was intense personal suffering and hence singled out the self-infliction of suffering as essential to personal development. <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=C4sf_XDicrUC |title=Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration |year = 2008| page=7|isbn=9780910707848 |last1=Mendaglio |first1=Sal }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26692/Dissertation.pdf?sequence=2 |title=A Hermeneutic Historical Study of Kazimierz Dabrowski and his Theory of Positive Disintegration| year=2002|author=Battaglia, M.}}</ref>\n\nD\u0105browski's ''theory of personality development'' emphasised several major features including:\n* personality is not a given universal trait, it must be created&mdash;shaped&mdash;by the individual to reflect his or her own unique character (personality shaping)\n* personality develops as a result of the action of developmental potential (DP) (overexcitability and the autonomous factor), not everyone displays sufficient DP to create a unique personality.\n* developmental potential is represented in the population by a [[normal distribution|normal]] (bell) curve.  D\u0105browski used a multilevel approach to describe the continuum of developmental levels seen in the population.\n* developmental potential creates crises characterized by strong anxieties and depressions&mdash;psychoneurosis&mdash;that precipitate disintegration\n* for personality to develop, initial integrations based on instinct and socialization must disintegrate&mdash;a process D\u0105browski called positive disintegration\n* the development of a hierarchy of individual values&mdash;[[emotional]] reactions&mdash;is a critical component in developing one's personality and one's autonomy, thus, in contrast to most psychological theories, emotions play a major role in this approach\n* emotional reactions guide the individual in creating his or her individual personality ideal, an autonomous standard that acts as the goal of individual development\n* the individual must examine his or her essence and subsequently make existential choices that emphasize those aspects of essence that are higher and \"more myself\" and inhibit those aspects that are lower or \"less myself\" based upon his or her own personality ideal\n* critical components of individual development include autoeducation and autopsychotherapy\n\n===Factors in personality development===\nD\u0105browski observed that most people live their lives in a state of \"primary or primitive integration\" largely guided by biological impulses (\"first factor\") and/or by uncritical endorsement and adherence to social conventions (\"second factor\"). He called this initial integration Level I. D\u0105browski observed that at this level there is no true individual expression of the autonomous human self. Individual expression at Level I is influenced and constrained by the first two factors.\n\nThe first factor channels energy and talents toward accomplishing self-serving goals that reflect the \"lower instincts\" and biological ego\u2014its primary focus is on survival and self-advancement. Often talents are used in antisocial or asocial ways. For example, at the lowest edge of Level I many criminals display this type of selfish behavior. They tend to advance their own goals at the expense of others.\n\nThe second factor, the social environment (milieu) and [[peer pressure]], constrains individual expression and [[creativity]] by encouraging a group view of life and discouraging individual thought and expression. The second factor externalizes values and morals, thereby externalizing conscience. Social forces shape expectations.  Behavior and one's talents and creativity are funneled into forms that follow and support the existing social milieu. \"My mom says we should always be aware of what our lawn looks like because we want other people to think well of us when they drive by.\"{{CN|date=May 2019}} Because conscience is derived from an external social context, so long as society holds ethical standards, people influenced by the second factor will behave ethically. However, if a society becomes corrupt, people strongly influenced by second factor will not dissent. [[Socialization]] without individual examination leads to a rote and robotic existence (the \"robopath\" described by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]). Individual reactions are not unique, they are based upon social contexts (\"I cry at funerals and laugh at weddings\u2014everyone does\"). According to D\u0105browski, people primarily motivated by second factor represent a significant majority of the general population.{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\nD\u0105browski felt that our society was largely influenced by the two lower factors and could be characterized as operating at Level I. For example, our emphasis on corporate success (\"a dog eat dog mentality\") means that many [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]]s operate on the basis of first factor\u2014they will quickly sacrifice another to enhance their own advancement. As well, our educational, political, corporate, and media systems are self-promoting and discourage real examination or individual autonomy\u2014the second factor. Alternatively, social justifications are often used: \"of course I break the speed limit, everyone does.\"  Or a soldier may explain that he or she was simply \"following orders\". Thus, this external value system absolves the individual of any individual responsibility.{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\nD\u0105browski also described a group of people who display a different course: an individualized developmental pathway. Such people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which D\u0105browski called negative adjustment) and are said to move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. D\u0105browski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our [[status quo]] and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc.{{CN|date=May 2019}} If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for D\u0105browski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be\u2014how the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her \"new\" autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on.\n\n===Development potential===\nAdvanced development is often seen in people who exhibit strong developmental potential (\"DP\"). Developmental potential represents a constellation of genetic features, expressed and mediated through environmental interaction.  Many factors are incorporated in developmental potential but three major aspects are highlighted: overexcitability (OE), specific abilities and talents, and a strong drive toward autonomous growth, a feature D\u0105browski called the \"third factor\".{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\n====Overexcitability====\nThe most evident aspect of developmental potential is [[overexcitability]] (OE), a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. The greater the OE, the more intense are the day-to-day experiences of life. D\u0105browski outlined five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual, and emotional. These overexcitabilities, especially the latter three, often cause a person to experience daily life more intensely and to feel the extremes of the joys and sorrows of life profoundly. D\u0105browski studied human exemplars and found that heightened overexcitability was a key part of their developmental and life experience. These people are steered and driven by their value \"rudder\", their sense of emotional OE. Combined with imaginational and intellectual OE, these people have a powerful perception of the world.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1972|p=6}}\n\nAlthough based in the nervous system, overexcitabilities come to be expressed psychologically through the development of structures that reflect the emerging autonomous self. The most important of these conceptualizations are dynamisms: biological or mental forces that control behavior and its development. Instincts, drives and intellectual processes combined with emotions are dynamisms.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1972|p=294}} With advanced development, dynamisms increasingly reflect movement toward autonomy.\n\n====Abilities and talents====\nThe second aspect of developmental potential, specific abilities and talents, tends to serve the person's developmental level. As outlined, people at lower levels use talents to support egocentric goals or to climb the social and corporate ladders. At higher levels, specific talents and abilities become an important force as they are channeled by the person's value hierarchy into expressing and achieving the person's vision of his or her ideal personality and his or her view of how the world ought to be.\n\n====The third factor====\nThe third aspect of developmental potential (DP), which is simply referred to as 'the third factor', is a drive toward individual growth and autonomy. The third factor is critical as it applies one's talents and creativity toward autonomous expression, and second, it provides motivation to strive for more and to try to imagine and achieve goals currently beyond one's grasp. D\u0105browski was clear to differentiate third factor from [[free will]]. He felt that free will did not go far enough in capturing the motivating aspects that he attributed to third factor.  For example, an individual can exercise free will and show little motivation to grow or change as an individual. Third factor specifically describes a motivation\u2014a motivation to become one's self. This motivation is often so strong that  in some situations we can observe that one needs to develop oneself and that in so doing, it places one at great peril.  This feeling of \"I've gotta be me\"  especially when it is \"at any cost\" and especially when it is expressed as a strong motivator for self-growth is beyond the usual conceptualization ascribed to free will.{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\nA person whose DP is high enough ''will generally'' undergo disintegration, despite any external social or family efforts to prevent it. A person whose DP is low will ''generally not'' undergo disintegration (or positive personality growth) even in a conducive environment.\n\nThe notion that some people have an innate potential for development that is determined by a higher sensitivity or overexcitability (analogous to the first aspect of DP) and by a related tendency to develop individual differences and autonomy from the group (analogous to the third aspect of DP) was independently developed by Elaine Aron (see [[Highly sensitive person]])<ref>{{cite journal |last=Aron |first=E. N. |title=The Clinical Implications of Jungs Concept of Sensitiveness |journal=Journal of Jungian Theory and Practice |volume=8 |year=2006 |issue= |pages=11\u201343 |quote=Sensitive persons can certainly have mood disorders, but should not be mistaken for being chronically depressed only because of a pessimistic view of the future of the world or of their own abilities (a pessimism which may well be accurate, as in the case of depressive realism). Likewise they do not have an anxiety disorder merely because they worry more than the nonsensitive, and they do not have a personality disorder (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, etc.) merely because their unusualness has been present throughout their lives as an impediment to the cheerful, resilient functioning expected of most people most of the time.... They cannot shut out the world's achingly subtle, fleeting beauty or its inexplicable cruelty and suffering. They must find their own meaning in it. |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.490.9371 }}</ref> (although Aron's approach is substantially different from D\u0105browski's).\n\n====Developmental obstacles====\nD\u0105browski called OE \"a tragic gift\" to reflect that the road of the person with strong OE is not a smooth or easy one. Potentials to experience great highs are also potentials to experience great lows. Similarly, potentials to express great creativity hold the likelihood of experiencing a great deal of personal conflict and [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]. This stress both drives development and is a result of developmental conflicts, both intrapsychic and social. [[Suicide]] is a significant risk in the acute phases of this stress. The isolation often experienced by these people heightens the risk of [[self-harm]].\n\nD\u0105browski advocated [[#Autopsychotherapy|autopsychotherapy]], educating the person about OEs and the disintegrative process to give him or her a context within which to understand intense feelings and needs. D\u0105browski suggested giving people support in their efforts to develop and find their own [[self-expression]]. Children and adults with high DP have to find and walk their own path, often at the expense of fitting in with their social peers and even with their families.  At the core of autopsychotherapy is the awareness that no one can show anyone else the \"right\" path.  Everyone has to find their own path for themselves. Alluding to the knights on the [[Grail Quest]], the Jungian analyst, [[Joseph Campbell]] allegedly said: \"If a path exists in the forest, don't follow it, for though it took someone else to the Grail, it will not take you there, because it is not your path\".{{CN|date=May 2019}}\n\n==The levels==\nThe first and fifth levels are characterized by psychological integration, harmony, and little inner conflict. There is little internal conflict at Level I because just about every behavior is justified\u2014it is either good for the individual and is therefore \"right\", or the individual's society endorses it and it is therefore \"right\".  In either case, with a high level of confidence the individual acts as he or she perceives anyone else would, and does what anyone is \"supposed to do\". At Level V there is no internal conflict because what a person does is always in accord with their own internal sense of values. Of course, there is often external conflict at both Levels I and V.\n\nLevels II, III and IV describe various degrees and types of dis-integration and literal disease.\n\nD\u0105browski was very clear that the levels he presents \"represent a heuristic device\". In the process of development the structures of two or even three contiguous levels may exist side by side, although it must be understood that they exist in conflict. The conflict is resolved when one of the structures is eliminated, or at least comes under complete control of another structure.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1996|p=17}}\n\n===Level I: Primary integration===\nAs outlined above, the first level is called primitive or primary integration. People at this level are often influenced primarily by either prominent first factor (heredity/impulse) and/or second factor (social environment) forces.  The majority of people at Level I are integrated at the environmental or social level (D\u0105browski called them average people); however, many also exhibit shades of both impulse and socialization. D\u0105browski distinguished the two subgroups of Level I by degree: \"the state of primary integration is a state contrary to mental health. A fairly high degree of primary integration is present in the average person; a very high degree of primary integration is present in the psychopath\".{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=121}} Marked by selfishness and [[egocentrism]] (both reticent and explicit), those at level one development generally seek self-fulfillment above all, justifying their pursuits through a sort of \"it's all about me\" thinking; or, more simply put, they adhere strongly to the phrase \"the end justifies the means\", sometimes disregarding the severity of the \"means\". Many people who are considered \"leaders\" often fall into this category.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=127}}\n\nA vast majority of people either do not break down their primitive integration at all, or after a relatively short period of disintegration, usually experienced at the time of adolescence and early youth, end in a reintegration at the former level or in partial integration of some of the functions at slightly higher levels, without a transformation of the whole mental structure.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|Kawczak|Piechowski|1970|p=4}} Primary integration in the average person was proposed to be of a certain value due to its stability and predictability, and when accompanied by kindness and good-will, could represent persons who can provide support and stability to those experiencing disintegration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schl\u00e4ppy|first=Marie-Lise|date=2019|title=Understanding Mental Health Through the Theory of Positive Disintegration: A Visual Aid|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01291/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=10|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01291|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>\n\n===Level II: Unilevel disintegration===\nThe prominent feature of this level is an initial, brief and often intense [[crisis]] or series of crises.  Crises are spontaneous and occur on only one level. These crises involve alternatives that may appear to be different but ultimately are on the same level.\n\nUnilevel disintegration occurs during developmental crises such as puberty or menopause, in periods of difficulty in handling some stressful external event, or under psychological and psychopathological conditions such as nervousness and psychoneurosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=A more or less organized form of growth through positive disintegration. Lower psychoneuroses are predominantly psychosomatic in nature, higher psychoneuroses are highly conscious internal struggles whose tensions and frustrations are not anymore translated into somatic disorders.}}</ref>  Unilevel disintegration consists of processes on a single structural and emotional level; there is a prevalence of automatic dynamisms with only slight self-consciousness and self-control.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=6}}\n\nConflicts on the same level (horizontal) produce ambitendencies and ambivalences: the person is equally attracted by different but equivalent choices on the same level (ambitendencies) and is not able to decide what to do because he or she has no real preference between the choices (ambivalences).  If developmental forces are strong enough, ultimately, the person is thrust into an [[existentialism|existential]] crisis: one's social rationales no longer account for one's experiences and there are no alternative explanations.  During this phase, existential despair is the predominant emotion.  The resolution of this phase begins as individually chosen values begin to replace [[social mores]] that have been ingrained by rote and are integrated into a new hierarchy of personal values.  These new values often conflict with the person's previous social values.  Many of the status quo explanations for the \"way things are,\" learned through education and from the social order, collapse under conscious, individual scrutiny. This causes more conflicts focused on the person's analysis of his or her own reactions to the world at large and of the behavior of self and others. Common behaviors and the ethics of the prevailing social order come to be seen as inadequate, wrong or hypocritical.  Positive maladjustment prevails. For D\u0105browski, these crises represent a strong potential for development toward personal growth and mental health.  Using a positive definition, mental health reflects more than social conformity: it involves a careful, personal examination of the world and of one's values, leading to the development of an individual personality.\n\nLevel II is a transitional period. D\u0105browski said you either fall back (reintegration on a lower level), end negatively, in suicide or [[psychosis]] or move ahead to Level III.{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1964|p=7}}\n\nThe transition from Level II to Level III involves a fundamental shift that requires a phenomenal amount of energy.  This period is the crossroads of development: from here one must either progress or regress. The struggle between D\u0105browski's three factors reflects this transitional crisis: \"Do I follow my instincts (first factor), my teachings (second factor) or my heart (third factor)?\"  The developmental answer is to transform one's lower instincts (automatic reactions like anger) into positive motivation, to resist rote and social answers, and to listen to one's inner sense of what one ought to do.\n\n===Level III: Spontaneous multilevel disintegration===\nLevel III describes a new type of conflict: a vertical conflict between two alternatives that are not simply different, but that exist on different levels. One is genuinely higher and the other is lower in comparison. These vertical conflicts initially arise from involuntary perceptions of higher versus lower choices in life. \"You just look at something, maybe for the 1000th time (to use the words of [[G. K. Chesterton]]), and it strikes you\u2014you see this one thing differently and once you do, it changes things. You can no longer 'go back and see it the way you did before.'\" D\u0105browski called this vertical dimension multilevelness. Multilevelness is a gradual realization of the \"possibility of the higher\" (a phrase D\u0105browski used frequently) and of the subsequent contrasts between the higher and the lower in life. These vertical comparisons often illustrate the lower, actual behavior of a person in contrast to higher, imagined ideals and alternative idealized choices. D\u0105browski believed that the authentic individual would choose the higher path as the clear and obvious one to follow (erasing the ambivalences and ambitendencies of unilevel conflicts). If the person's actual behavior subsequently falls short of the ideal, internal disharmony and a drive to review and reconstruct one's life often follow. Multilevelness thus represents a new and powerful type of conflict, a conflict that is developmental in D\u0105browski's approach.\n\nVertical conflicts are critical in leading to autonomy and advanced personality growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Disintegration is multilevel (or vertical), if there are conflicts between higher and lower levels of instinctive, emotional or intellectual functions, e.g. higher and lower forms of the sexual instinct, or the instinct of self-preservation, etc. It consists mainly in differentiation and hierarchization of various levels of functions with a tendency towards gradual stabilization of a new hierarchy. In the course of positive multilevel disintegration primitive, animalistic drives and structures are subject to a disintegration, that is weakening, loosening and even total destruction under the impact of developmental dynamisms (cf.) and gradually give way to new, higher levels and new, higher structures. There is a growth of consciousness of inner conflicts, self-consciousness and self-control. The processes of inner psychic transformation gain in intensity and authenticity (cf.). There is a gradual build-up of the inner psychic milieu (cf.) with its main dynamisms such as \"subject-object\" in oneself, the third factor, inner psychic transformation, autonomy and authentism, and the personality ideal.}}</ref> If the person is to achieve higher levels, the shift to multilevelness must occur. If a person does not have the developmental potential to move into a multilevel view, then he or she will fall back from the crises of Level II to reintegrate at Level I. In the shift to multilevelness, the horizontal (unilevel), stimulus-response model of life is replaced by a vertical and hierarchical analysis. This vertical view becomes anchored by one's emerging individual value structure, and all events are seen in relation to personal ideals. These personal value ideals become the personality ideal: how the person wants to live his or her life. As events in life are seen in relation to this multilevel, vertical view, it becomes impossible to support positions that favor the lower course when higher goals can be identified (or imagined).\n\n===Level IV: Directed multilevel disintegration===\nIn Level IV the person takes full control of their development. The involuntary spontaneous development of Level III is replaced by a deliberate, conscious and self-directed review of life from the multilevel perspective. This level marks the real emergence of the third factor, described by D\u0105browski as an autonomous factor \"of conscious choice (valuation) by which one affirms or rejects certain qualities in oneself and in one's environment\".{{sfn|D\u0105browski|1972|p=306}} The person consciously reviews his or her existing belief system and tries to replace lower, automatic views and reactions with carefully thought out, examined and chosen ideals. These new values will increasingly be reflected in the person's behavior. Behavior becomes less reactive, less automatic and more deliberate as behavioral choices fall under the influence of the person's higher, chosen ideals.\n\nSocial mores are reviewed and re-accepted by a conscious internalization when the individual feels it is appropriate. Likewise, when the person feels it is proper, a social value is reviewed and may be rejected to be replaced by a self-perceived higher alternative value. One's social orientation comes to reflect a deep responsibility based on both intellectual and emotional factors. At the highest levels, \"individuals of this kind feel responsible for the realization of justice and for the protection of others against harm and injustice. Their feelings of responsibility extend almost to everything.\"{{sfn|D\u0105browski|Kawczak|Sochanska|1973|p=97}} This perspective results from seeing life in relation to one's hierarchy of values (the multilevel view) and the subsequent appreciation of the potential of how life could be, and ought to be, lived. One's disagreements with the (lower level) world are expressed compassionately in doing what one can to help achieve the \"ought\".\n\nGiven their genuine (authentic) prosocial outlook, people achieving higher development also raise the level of their society. Prosocial here is not just support of the existing social order. If the social order is lower and you are adjusted to it, then you also reflect the lower (negative adjustment in D\u0105browski's terms, a Level I feature). Here, prosocial is a genuine cultivation of social interactions based on higher values. These positions often conflict with the status quo of a lower society (positive maladjustment). In other words, to be maladjusted to a low-level society is a positive feature.\n\n===Level V: Secondary integration===\nThe fifth level displays an integrated and harmonious character, but one vastly different from that at the first level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=The integration of all mental functions into a harmonious structure controlled by higher emotions such as the dynamism of personality ideal, autonomy and authenticity. Secondary integration is the outcome of the full process of positive disintegration.}}</ref> At this highest level, one's behavior is guided by conscious, carefully weighed decisions based on an individualized and chosen hierarchy of personal values. Behavior conforms to this inner standard of how life ought to be lived, and thus little inner conflict arises.\n\nLevel V is often marked by creative expression. Especially at Level V, problem solving and art represent the highest and noblest features of human life. Art captures the innermost emotional states and is based on a deep empathy and understanding of the subject. Often, human suffering and sacrifice are the subjects of these works. Truly visionary works, works that are unique and novel, are created by people expressing a vision unrestrained by convention. Advances in society, through politics, philosophy and religion, are therefore commonly associated with strong individual creativity or accomplishments.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Therapy===\nThe theory of positive disintegration has an extremely broad scope and has implications for many areas. One central application applies to psychological and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. D\u0105browski advocated a comprehensive, multidimensional diagnosis of the person's situation, including symptoms and developmental potentials.\n\n====Symptoms and developmental potential====\nIf the disintegration appears to fit into a developmental context, then the person is educated in the theory and encouraged to take a developmental view of his or her situation and experiences. Rather than being eliminated, symptoms are reframed to yield insight and understanding into life and the person's unique situation.\n\n====The importance of narratives====\nD\u0105browski illustrated his theory through autobiographies of and biographies about those who have experienced positive disintegration. The gifted child, the suicidal teen or the troubled artist is often experiencing the features of TPD, and if they accept and understand the meaning of their intense feelings and crises, they can move ahead, not fall apart. The completion of an extensive autobiography to help the individual gain perspective on his or her past and present is an important component in the autopsychotherapy process. In this process, the therapist plays a very small role and acts more as an initial stimulus than an ongoing therapist.  D\u0105browski asked clients to read his books and to see how his ideas might relate to their lives.\n\n====Autopsychotherapy====\nFor D\u0105browski, the goal of therapy is to eliminate the therapist by providing a context within which a person can understand and help oneself, an approach to therapy that he called autopsychotherapy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Psychotherapy, preventive measures, or changes in living conditions consciously applied to oneself in order to control possible mental disequilibrium.}}</ref> The client is encouraged to embark on a journey of self-discovery with an emphasis on looking for the contrast between what is higher versus what is lower within his or her personality and value structure. The person is encouraged to further explore his or her value structure especially as it relates to the rationale and justification of positions. Discrepancies between values and behavior are highlighted. The approach is called autopsychotherapy to emphasize the important role that the individual must play in his or her own therapy process and in the larger process of personality development.  The individual must come to see that he or she is in charge of determining or creating his or her own unique personality ideal and value structure. This includes a critical review of social mores and values that have been learned.\n\nD\u0105browski was very concerned about what he called one-sided development<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Type of development limited to one talent or ability, or to a narrow range of abilities and mental functions. In such development the creative instinct and empathy appear absent. In exceptionally capable individuals their one-sided development may come under the control of a primitive disposing and directing center and in the extreme case may take the form of psychopathy or paranoia.}}</ref>, in which people display significant advanced development in only one aspect of life, usually intellectual. He believed that it is crucial to balance one's development.\n\n====Overexcitability====\nD\u0105browski also encouraged people to see their reactions (overexcitabilities) and their [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] view of the world in the context of their developmental potential. The experience of, and reaction to, crises are a very important aspect of this approach and people are encouraged to experience personal crises with a positive and developmental view.\n\nD\u0105browski reminds clients that without internal disease there is little stimulus for change or growth. Rather than trying to rapidly ameliorate symptoms, this approach encourages individuals to fully experience their feelings and to try to maintain a positive and developmental orientation to what they may perceive as strong depression or anxiety. Of course, this is a unique approach in today's world of seeking immediate and total relief of any unpleasant psychological experience (although it can be compared to Aron's to some extent).\n\n===Education===\n\nAnother primary focus is on education, in particular, over the past 25 years, on the experience of creative and [[gifted]]\nstudents. D\u0105browski hypothesized that these students will disproportionately show strong overexcitability and therefore will be prone to the disintegrative process.\n\n==D\u0105browski and the gifted individual==\nIn an appendix to D\u0105browski (1967), results of investigations done in 1962 with Polish youth are reported. Specifically, \"a group of gifted children and young people aged 8 to 23\" were examined (p.&nbsp;251). Of the 80 youth studied, 30 were \"intellectually gifted\" and 50 were from \"drama, ballet, and plastic art schools\" (p.&nbsp;251). D\u0105browski found that every one of the children displayed overexcitability, \"which constituted the foundation for the emergence of neurotic and psychoneurotic sets. Moreover it turned out that these children also showed sets of nervousness, neurosis, and psychoneurosis of various kinds and intensities, from light vegetative symptoms, or anxiety symptoms, to distinctly and highly intensive psychasthenic or hysterical sets\" (p.&nbsp;253). D\u0105browski asked why these children should display such \"states of nervousness or psychoneurosis\" and suggested that it was due to the presence of OE (p.&nbsp;255). \"Probably the cause is more than average sensitivity which not only permits one to achieve outstanding results in learning and work, but at the same time increases the number of points sensitive to all experiences that may accelerate anomalous reactions revealing themselves in psychoneurotic sets\" (p.&nbsp;255).\n\nThe association between OE and giftedness appears to be borne out in the research (Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995). It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. D\u0105browski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth.\n\n==Key ideas==\nThe theory is based on key ideas that may be listed as follows:\n\n*That our lower animal instincts (first factor) must be inhibited and transformed into \"higher\" forces for us to be Human (this ability to transform our instincts is what separates us from other animals).\n*That the common initial personality integration, based upon socialization (second factor), does not reflect true personality.\n*At the initial level of integration, there is little internal conflict as when one \"goes along with the group\", there is little sense of individual wrongdoing. External conflicts often relate to the blockage of social goals\u2014career frustrations for example. The social mores and values prevail with little question or conscious examination.\n*True personality must be based upon a system of values that are consciously and volitionally chosen by the person to reflect their own individual sense of \"how life ought to be\" and their \"personality ideal\"\u2014the ideal person they feel they \"ought to be\".\n*The lower animal instincts and the forces of peer groups and [[socialization]] are inferior to the autonomous self (personality) constructed by the conscious person.\n*To break down the initial integration, crises and disintegrations are needed, usually provided by life experience.\n*These disintegrations are positive if the person can achieve positive and developmental solutions to the situation.\n*\"Unilevel crises\" are not developmental as the person can only choose between equal alternatives (go left or go right?).\n*A new type of perception involves \"multilevelness\", a vertical view of life that compares lower versus higher alternatives and now allows the individual to choose a higher resolution to a crisis over other available, but lower, alternatives\u2014the developmental solution.\n*\"Positive disintegration\" is a vital developmental process.\n*D\u0105browski developed the idea of \"developmental potential\" to describe the forces needed to achieve autonomous personality development.\n*Developmental potential includes several factors including innate abilities and talents, \"overexcitability\" and the \"third factor\".\n*Overexcitability is a measure of an individual's level of nervous response. D\u0105browski found that the exemplars he studied all displayed an overly sensitive nervous system, also making them prone to [[angst]], depression and anxiety\u2014psychoneuroses in D\u0105browski's terms, a very positive and developmental feature.\n*The third factor is a measure of an individual's drive toward autonomy.\n*D\u0105browski's approach is very interesting philosophically as it is Platonic, reflecting the bias of [[Plato]] toward [[essence]]\u2014an individual's essence is a critical determinant of his or her developmental course in life. However, D\u0105browski also added a major [[Existentialism|existential]] aspect as well, what one depends upon the anxieties felt and on how one resolves the day to day challenges one faces. Essence must be realized through an existential and experiential process of development. The characterization advanced by [[Kierkegaard]] of \"Knights of faith\" may be compared to D\u0105browski's autonomous individual.\n*Reviewed the role of logic and reasoning in development and concludes that intellect alone does not fully help us know what to do in life. Incorporates [[Jean Piaget]]'s views of development into a broader scheme guided by emotion. Emotion (how one feels about something) is the more accurate guide to life's major decisions.\n*When multilevel and autonomous development is achieved, a secondary integration is seen reflecting the mature personality state. The individual has no inner conflict; they are in internal harmony as their actions reflect their deeply felt hierarchy of values.\n*Rejected [[Abraham Maslow]]'s description of [[self-actualization]] (D\u0105browski was a personal friend and correspondent of Maslow's). Actualization of an undifferentiated human self is not a developmental outcome in D\u0105browski's terms. D\u0105browski applied a multilevel (vertical) approach to self and saw the need to become aware of and to inhibit and reject the lower instinctual aspects of the intrinsic human self (aspects that Maslow would have us \"embrace without guilt\") and to actively choose and assemble higher elements into a new unique self. D\u0105browski would have us differentiate the initial self into higher and lower aspects, as we define them, and to reject the lower and actualize the higher in creating our unique personality.\n\n==Secondary integration versus self-actualization==\nPeople have often equated Maslow's concept of self-actualization with D\u0105browski's level of secondary integration. There are some major differences between these two ideas. Fundamentally, Maslow described self-actualization as a process where the  self is accepted \"as is\",  so both higher and lower aspects of the self are actualized. D\u0105browski introduces the notion that although the lower aspects may  initially be intrinsic to the self, as human beings we are able to become aware of their lower nature.  We are able to develop [[self-awareness]] into how we feel about these low levels\u2014if we feel badly about behaving in these  lower ways, then we are able to cognitively and volitionally  decide to inhibit and eliminate these behaviors. In this way, the  higher aspects of the self  are actualized while the lower aspects are inhibited and, for D\u0105browski, this is what is unique about humans and sets us apart from other animals \u2014 no other animal is able to differentiate their lower instincts and therefore can not inhibit their animalistic impulses, an idea also expressed in [[Helmuth_Plessner#The_three_categories_of_nature's_a_priori_and_the_\"eccentricity\"_of_human_intentionality|Plessner's eccentricity]]. D\u0105browski has gone beyond Maslow's idea of self-actualization and it is not appropriate to equate the two authors on this point.\n\n==Obstacles to the theory==\nBoth D\u0105browski and his work have faced many obstacles. Personally, he was severely affected by both [[World Wars]]. His work went against the grain as a humanistic theory promoting personal growth in the political atmosphere of [[Poland]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Another problem has been language. D\u0105browski wrote in [[Polish language|Polish]] and translated his works into [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[English language|English]] was the last language he learned and likely the most difficult in terms of capturing the subtleties of his ideas. In spite of these problems, D\u0105browski persevered with his studies of human development, developed his theory and practiced psychiatry all his life.\n\nD\u0105browski died in 1980 and his students went on to explore careers of their own. Many of these students continue to study and speak on the theory, most advancing a deeply personal understanding of what the theory means to them.\n\nSince 1980, there has been a small but consistent demand for D\u0105browski's works. This demand has largely evolved in the United States where Michael Piechowski applied his vision of the theory to gifted education. Many in education and in [[gifted education]] have looked to D\u0105browski's theory to help provide a context for their students. Although a small part of the overall theory, this aspect has generated a number of Master's and Ph.D. theses and introduced the theory to a large audience.\n\nThe reader interested in D\u0105browski has faced a serious scarcity of resources, especially of D\u0105browski's English works. His books are long out of print and rare, and his papers are held by a few people but not circulated. There are also many Polish works by D\u0105browski (about 20 books) on the theory, on psychotherapy, on education and on philosophy that have not been translated into English.\n\nOne severe hurdle to the investigation and study of the theory of positive disintegration is the fact that no suitable psychological test exists that measures any D\u0105browskian constructs well. The most widely known instrument, the Overexcitability Questionnaire\u2014Two, has poor psychometric properties.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=An investigation of measurement invariance across genders on the Overexcitability Questionnaire--Two|journal=Journal of Advanced Academics|date=2011|volume=22|issue=4|pages=578\u2013293|doi=10.1177/1932202x11414821}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Anti-psychiatry]]\n*[[Antifragility]]\n*[[Eustress]]\n*[[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]\n*[[Personality psychology]]\n*[[Personal development]]\n*[[Posttraumatic growth]]\n*[[Role suction]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com}}\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = D\u0105browski | first1 = K. | year = 1937 | title = Psychological Basis of Self Mutilation | url = | journal = Genetic Psychology Monographs | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 1\u2013104 }}\n*{{Cite book|last=D\u0105browski|first=K.|year=1964|title=Positive Disintegration|location=Boston, Mass.|publisher=Little Brown.|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = D\u0105browski | first1 = K. | year = 1966 | title = The Theory of Positive Disintegration | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 229\u201344 }}\n*{{Cite book|last=D\u0105browski|first=K.|year=1967|title=Personality-shaping through Positive Disintegration|location=Boston, Mass.|publisher=Little Brown.|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last1=D\u0105browski|first1=K.|first2=A.|last2=Kawczak|first3=M.
