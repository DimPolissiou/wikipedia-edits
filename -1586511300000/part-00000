A few days later, on October 12, 1863, Campbell's brigade made an attack at nightfall in the rain on Confederate Brigadier General [[Philip D. Roddey]]'s Division, which soon disengaged and moved to a camp away from the battlefield. The regiment removed to [[Winchester, Tennessee]], to rest and re-equip. Then on November 25, 1863, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry engaged the Confederate 25th Tennessee Infantry Regiment and Confederate guerrillas at [[Sparta, Tennessee]], eventually driving them off.

On December 24, 1863, Campbell's brigade and an artillery battery were ordered to attack a Confederate force at [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. The Confederates had left Dandridge and taken up a position about {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the east at Hays Ferry where the 1st Tennessee Cavalry became heavily engaged in support of Colonel Garrard's cavalry brigade from the Army of the Ohio.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 122</ref> During the day, the regiment lost 11 killed and 7 wounded before it withdrew to [[New Market, Tennessee]].\n\nOn November 16, 1863, Brigadier General [[Washington Lafayette Elliott]] replaced Major General [[David S. Stanley]] as Chief of Cavalry of the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 108</ref> When McCook's division moved to Knoxville, Brigadier General [[Samuel D. Sturgis]] of the Army of the Ohio took command of the division because he had taken command of all cavalry operating in East Tennessee on December 15, 1863.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 119\"/>\n\nOn December 29, 1863, Brigadier General Sturgis learned that a brigade of Confederate cavalry had moved to Dandridge and sent most of the cavalry opposite Confederate Lieutenant General Longstreet's encampment to destroy it. He left only Campbell's brigade to hold the camp and valley at [[Battle of Mossy Creek|Mossy Creek]], Tennessee. Campbell positioned his regiments and three cannons of Lilly's battery which had not been sent on the mission to Dandridge in the valley. A large Confederate force moved to attack Campbell's regiments, which fell back because they were outnumbered. Then, Colonel Campbell ordered the 1st Tennessee Cavalry to charge the Confederates on the right of a brick house, a prominent feature on the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry made the charge and halted the advance of the entire Confederate line while the 2d Michigan Cavalry, which was fighting dismounted, staggered the Confederate line with rifle fire. Campbell then again ordered his advance regiments to fall back and take a position near Lilly's battery and the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry, fighting as they moved back. Despite Colonel Campbell's misgivings, Colonel Brownlow assumed responsibility of ordering a [[saber]] charge on the advancing Confederate line of battle. The charge drove the Confederates back and the 1st Tennessee took 26 prisoners. However, they in turn were forced back by the superior number of Confederate attackers. The outnumbered Union force was reinforced at a critical moment and together with the reinforcements, Campbell's men forced the Confederates from the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry suffered 9 killed and 9 wounded in the battle.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 127&ndash;132</ref>\n\n===Fair Garden capture and escape===\nAfter the [[Battle of Mossy Creek]], the Union forces withdrew to Knoxville. After a brief expedition to fight [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (Indians) and guerrillas from North Carolina in [[Cocke County, Tennessee]], Colonels Brownlow and Palmer with about one thousand men of the 1st Tennessee Cavalry, 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry and 10th Ohio Cavalry held the army's right wing, watching for arrival of a Confederate force reportedly approaching East Tennessee from North Carolina. Confederate Brigadier General [[William T. Martin]] marched his army across the country from Dandridge and went into camp near Fair Garden, Tennessee. This unexpected movement of Longstreet's cavalry made it necessary to push forward the divisions of McCook and Wolford from Knoxville to support the right wing. Late in the afternoon of January 26, 1864, the Confederates under General Martin were discovered advancing toward [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]] on the Fair Garden road. McCook's division was ordered to meet this force.

The scene so startled the Confederate defenders that most of them immediately fled into the woods, leaving 12 men to be taken prisoner.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 171.

Atlanta fell to Sherman's forces while Croxton's men were at Nashville and Franklin.\n\nThe 1st Tennessee Cavalry carried on from this date without Colonel Brownlow and had several more engagements or operations. As the war wound down to a conclusion, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry made a reconnaissance from Waterloo, Alabama as far as Corinth, Mississippi, starting on January 27, 1865. They returned to Nashville on February 10, 1865, where they remained until mustered out on June 14, 1865, having recently been rejoined by Colonel Brownlow.<ref name=\"CivilWar320\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn January 13, 1866, [[President of the United States]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Brownlow for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865.

Brownlow became [[adjutant general]] of the [[state of Tennessee]] after the election of his father as [[governor of Tennessee]]. He wrote: ''Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Tennessee of the Military Forces of the State from 1861 to 1866.'' In December 1866, Brownlow received an appointment at the grade of captain in the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th United States Cavalry Regiment]] of the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. He delayed reporting because of his state duties and ultimately resigned in 1868 because he was posted to California and did not wish to be that far from Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, 2001. p. 149</ref> His occupations thereafter included railroad superintendent for the [[Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad]], farmer and printer.

Campbell commanded the 1st Brigade, to which the 1st Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry Regiment was assigned.<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/> In that month, Major General [[William Rosecrans]] began the Tullahoma Campaign which forced the Confederates to abandon that town and retreat to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/> Brownlow's regiment covered the retreat of the Union Army to Chattanooga after the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], September 19&ndash;20, 1863.<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/><ref>Carter, 1902, p. 96</ref>\n\nOn September 30, 1863, Confederate Major General [[Joseph Wheeler]] began a ride around the Union Army in an effort to cut their communications and supplies in support of Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s siege of Chattanooga. Brownlow's regiment joined in the pursuit of Wheeler's force, riding over {{convert|300|mi}} in eight days. A few days later, on October 12, 1863, Campbell's brigade made an attack at nightfall in the rain on Confederate Brigadier General [[Philip D. Roddey]]'s Division, which soon disengaged and moved to a camp away from the battlefield. The regiment removed to [[Winchester, Tennessee]], to rest and re-equip. Then on November 25, 1863, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry engaged the Confederate 25th Tennessee Infantry Regiment and Confederate guerrillas at [[Sparta, Tennessee]], eventually driving them off. In early December, they were joined by the other regiments of their brigade.<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/><ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 100&ndash;111</ref>\n\n===Knoxville campaign===\nOn December 7, 1863, McCook's First Division of the Army of the Cumberland Cavalry Corps headed for [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], where the Union garrison under Major General [[Ambrose Burnside]] was threatened by the corps of Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[James Longstreet]], which had been detached from General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s army.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 112</ref> On December 15, the division reached Knoxville and McCook allowed the 1st Tennessee Cavalry to be the first regiment to enter the home town of Colonel Brownlow and many of the men.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 113</ref> Burnside had just been relieved as commander of the Union forces at Knoxville by Brigadier General [[John G. Foster]].<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 114</ref> Longstreet's attack on Knoxville had been repulsed on November 29, 1863, and he moved his force into upper east Tennessee to camp for the winter.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 119\">Carter, 1902, p. 119</ref> McCook's division pursued Longstreet. On December 24, 1863, Campbell's brigade and an artillery battery were ordered to attack a Confederate force at [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. The Confederates had left Dandridge and taken up a position about {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the east at Hays Ferry where the 1st Tennessee Cavalry became heavily engaged in support of Colonel Garrard's cavalry brigade from the Army of the Ohio.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 122</ref> During the day, the regiment lost 11 killed and 7 wounded before it withdrew to [[New Market, Tennessee]].\n\nOn November 16, 1863, Brigadier General [[Washington Lafayette Elliott]] replaced Major General [[David S. Stanley]] as Chief of Cavalry of the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 108</ref> When McCook's division moved to Knoxville, Brigadier General [[Samuel D. Sturgis]] of the Army of the Ohio took command of the division because he had taken command of all cavalry operating in East Tennessee on December 15, 1863.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 119\"/>\n\nOn December 29, 1863, Brigadier General Sturgis learned that a brigade of Confederate cavalry had moved to Dandridge and sent most of the cavalry opposite Confederate Lieutenant General Longstreet's encampment to destroy it. He left only Campbell's brigade to hold the camp and valley at [[Battle of Mossy Creek|Mossy Creek]], Tennessee. Campbell positioned his regiments and three cannons of Lilly's battery which had not been sent on the mission to Dandridge in the valley. A large Confederate force moved to attack Campbell's regiments, which fell back because they were outnumbered. Then, Colonel Campbell ordered the 1st Tennessee Cavalry to charge the Confederates on the right of a brick house, a prominent feature on the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry made the charge and halted the advance of the entire Confederate line while the 2d Michigan Cavalry, which was fighting dismounted, staggered the Confederate line with rifle fire. Campbell then again ordered his advance regiments to fall back and take a position near Lilly's battery and the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry, fighting as they moved back. Despite Colonel Campbell's misgivings, Colonel Brownlow assumed responsibility of ordering a [[saber]] charge on the advancing Confederate line of battle. The charge drove the Confederates back and the 1st Tennessee took 26 prisoners. However, they in turn were forced back by the superior number of Confederate attackers. The outnumbered Union force was reinforced at a critical moment and together with the reinforcements, Campbell's men forced the Confederates from the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry suffered 9 killed and 9 wounded in the battle.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 127&ndash;132</ref>\n\n===Fair Garden capture and escape===\nAfter the [[Battle of Mossy Creek]], the Union forces withdrew to Knoxville. After a brief expedition to fight [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (Indians) and guerrillas from North Carolina in [[Cocke County, Tennessee]], Colonels Brownlow and Palmer with about one thousand men of the 1st Tennessee Cavalry, 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry and 10th Ohio Cavalry held the army's right wing, watching for arrival of a Confederate force reportedly approaching East Tennessee from North Carolina. Confederate Brigadier General [[William T. Martin]] marched his army across the country from Dandridge and went into camp near Fair Garden, Tennessee. This unexpected movement of Longstreet's cavalry made it necessary to push forward the divisions of McCook and Wolford from Knoxville to support the right wing. Late in the afternoon of January 26, 1864, the Confederates under General Martin were discovered advancing toward [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]] on the Fair Garden road. McCook's division was ordered to meet this force. Campbell's brigade moved to strike the Confederates behind the east fork of the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee \u2013 North Carolina)|Pigeon River]] but after an artillery duel, nightfall halted the engagement.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 138&ndash;139</ref>\n\nIn the renewed engagement of January 27, 1864, as nightfall approached, Colonel Brownlow became separated from his men while pursuing Confederates who had been driven from the field. Brownlow was taken prisoner. He hid his grade (rank) and identity from his captors, claiming to be a private, and managed to bribe a guard with a gold watch to permit him to escape. His men were greatly relieved when he returned to camp the next day.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 139&ndash;144</ref> Then, the Union troops fell back to Sevierville and on January 29, 1864, the Union cavalry went into camp at [[Maryville, Tennessee]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} south of Knoxville.<ref name=\"Carter144\">Carter, 1902, p. 144</ref>\n\n===Atlanta campaign; McCook's raid===\nOn February 10, 1864, McCook's division left for [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], to rejoin the Army of the Cumberland and to go into camp at that location until May.<ref name=\"Carter145\">Carter, 1902, p. 145</ref> At Cleveland, the 8th Iowa Cavalry replaced the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry in the First Brigade of the First Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Cumberland.

The fords were impassable because of heavy spring rains.<ref name=\"Carter168\">Carter, 1902, p. 168</ref> McCook's division remained near Soap Creek guarding the ferries. They exchanged gunfire from time to time with Confederates occupying rifle pits on the other side of the Chattahoochee.<ref name=\"Carter168\"/> On July 9, 1864, Brownlow's men were ordered to dislodge them and attempted to do so at a supposed ford near Power's Ferry. They found the river impassable.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 169\">Carter, 1902, p. 169</ref> Colonel Joseph Dorr of the 8th Iowa Cavalry Regiment, acting commander of the brigade, arrived on the scene and ordered Brownlow to complete the mission.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 169\"/> Brownlow then devised one of the most unusual raids of the Civil War, if not in all military history. He had most of his men keep up a steady fire from their side of the shore while he led a squad of nine men to a point about {{convert|1|mi|km}} upstream where they put their guns and cartridge boxes on a small wooden raft and swam naked across the Chattahoochee.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 170</ref> Leaving one man to guard the raft, Brownlow led his naked men through the woods. As they somewhat painfully proceeded without shoes or other clothing for cover, Brownlow ordered them to \"cuss low\" so as not to give themselves away. When they reached the Confederate positions, they emerged, clothed only with cartridge boxes, screaming and shooting. The scene so startled the Confederate defenders that most of them immediately fled into the woods, leaving 12 men to be taken prisoner.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 171. Carter noted on page 172 that General McCook reported that Brownlow returned with 4 prisoners. He does not explain the discrepancy but presumably 8 of the original prisoners escaped in the walk back to the spot where they swam back to the other side of the river.</ref> After swimming back across the river, Brownlow's men expressed even more admiration for their commander who was willing to share the hardships and dangers of the mission and not just to order others to carry out the unusual and uncomfortable task.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 172</ref><ref>Evans, David.

Sherman]] ordered General McCook to lead a raid south of Atlanta toward Fayetteville, Georgia with the objective of destroying {{convert|2|mi|km}} to {{convert|5|mi|km}} of the [[Atlanta and West Point Railroad]], [[Macon and Western Railroad]] and telegraph lines.<ref name=\"Carter176\">Carter, 1902, p. 176</ref> Union Brigadier General [[George Stoneman]], whose division was to participate in the raid. also wanted to free the Union Army prisoners at the [[Andersonville, Georgia|Andersonville]] and [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] prisoner of war camps.<ref name=\"Carter176\"/> McCook led 5,000 men against the Atlanta and Western and Stoneman led 3,500 men against the Macon and Western.<ref name=\"Carter176\"/> On July 27, 1864, McCook moved his division back across the Chattahoochee River and then around to the south. Now part of Brigadier General [[John T. Croxton]]'s brigade, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry reached Palmetto Station, Georgia and about 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and began to destroy telegraph facilities, the depot and supplies. By 9:00 pm., the force moved toward Lovejoy Station, Georgia, which they reached by dawn the next morning.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 177</ref> Then, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry captured a 500&ndash;wagon train and turned it over to the rear guard to be destroyed.<ref name=\"Carter178\">Carter, 1902, p. 178</ref> By 7:00&nbsp;p.m., the regiment began to destroy facilities at Lovejoy Station.<ref name=\"Carter178\"/> General McCook waited until 2:00&nbsp;p.m. in an effort to communicate with General Stoneman and, failing to hear from Stoneman, McCook left just as Confederate Major General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry approached.

Brownlow said he would be \"damned if he would surrender\" because Southern Unionists were treated worse by the Confederates that Northerners.<ref name=\"Carter182\"/> Brownlow led the brigade in an effort to escape with Croxton coming with him. McCook headed for Marietta by another route.<ref name=\"Carter182\"/> The brigade was scattered and Brownlow took command of those with him.<ref name=\"Carter183\">Carter, 1902, p. 183</ref> He found a small bridge and an escape route from the imminent battle and his remaining force got ahead of the Confederate pursuers. They reached the Chattahoochee River at Rotherwood about 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on July 31 and started crossing in two small canoes. Some troopers swam the river with their horses and Brownlow swam back and forth several times to help men across.<ref name=\"Carter183\"/> About 200 to 300 men had made the river crossing when Confederates appeared and began to attack and take many of the exhausted and surprised men as prisoners. Many of those who had gotten across the river could not get their horses across and the group was still about {{convert|75|mi|km}} from Marietta so they were at greater risk of being captured. Brownlow and a small group of men from several regiments got to Marietta on August 1 and others began to arrive on August 2.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 185</ref> Many of McCook's men straggled into Marietta by August 10 but Stoneman and several hundred of his men were captured trying to free the Union prisoners at Macon.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 186\">Carter, 1902, p. 186</ref> Thus, Colonel Brownlow briefly commanded the first brigade of the first division of the Army of the Cumberland from July 30, 1864 to August 12, 1864.<ref name=\"Hunt86\"/><ref>Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

He was ordered to turn his brigade's remaining horses over to the other brigades and to take his men to Nashville for refitting.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 186\"/> Soon after they arrived in Nashville and were refitted, Croxton's brigade had to face Confederate Major General Joseph Wheeler's force which had detached from the main Confederate [[Army of Tennessee]] and were raiding into Tennessee.

Dyer. Croxton drew his men back but Wheeler was forced to withdraw when Union infantry arrived at the battle.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 194</ref> On September 5, Wheeler began to withdraw into Alabama. Atlanta fell to Sherman's forces while Croxton's men were at Nashville and Franklin.\n\nThe 1st Tennessee Cavalry carried on from this date without Colonel Brownlow and had several more engagements or operations. As the war wound down to a conclusion, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry made a reconnaissance from Waterloo, Alabama as far as Corinth, Mississippi, starting on January 27, 1865. They returned to Nashville on February 10, 1865, where they remained until mustered out on June 14, 1865, having recently been rejoined by Colonel Brownlow.<ref name=\"CivilWar320\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn January 13, 1866, [[President of the United States]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Brownlow for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865.

Brownlow became [[adjutant general]] of the [[state of Tennessee]] after the election of his father as [[governor of Tennessee]]. He wrote: ''Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Tennessee of the Military Forces of the State from 1861 to 1866.'' In December 1866, Brownlow received an appointment at the grade of captain in the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th United States Cavalry Regiment]] of the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. He delayed reporting because of his state duties and ultimately resigned in 1868 because he was posted to California and did not wish to be that far from Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, 2001. p. 149</ref> His occupations thereafter included railroad superintendent for the [[Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad]], farmer and printer. Brownlow died at [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], on April 26, 1879, aged 36.

They also performed a live session for BBC Radio 1 at [[Maida Vale Studios]].\n\nThe band headed out on a UK headline tour throughout winter 2013, supported by [[The Algorithm]]. A re-release of their debut EP with 4 bonus tracks was released on 11 November 2013.\n\nThe band has shown support for hacktivism collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], and appear to support \"whistle-blowers\" [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Chelsea Manning]] whom they reference in the song 'Cold Shoulders'.\n\nOn 4 August 2014 Hacktivist released the single and video for \"False Idols\". Lots of references to activism (especially hacktivist collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]) are made throughout the video and within hours the song had reached number 1 on the [[iTunes]] Metal chart. This release was followed on 12 November by \"Deceive and Defy\" (also accompanied by a video), featuring Charlie Holmes of [[Heart in Hand (band)|Heart in Hand]] on vocals. Hacktivist then toured the UK from November to December, supported by Dead Harts and the One Hundred.\n\nFollowing the release of the single \"Buszy\" on 17 January 2016, their debut studio album ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' was released on 4 March 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/41212/hacktivist-stream-debut-album-outside-the-box/|title=Hacktivist Stream Debut Album, Outside The Box - Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-20}}</ref>\n\nOn the 20th of January 2017, it was announced that Hacktivist and Ben Marvin were parting ways due to Ben's family commitments,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Hacktivistband/posts/1395628160468144|title=Hacktivist on Facebook: We are sad to announce the departure of founding member and vocalist Ben Marvin|website=Facebook|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref> and rapper/vocalist Jot Maxi was brought in as the new co-vocalist.\n\nMay 31, 2017 saw the release of single '2 Rotten' with an accompanying video. The track was essentially a heavier remix of track 'Rotten' from ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' but with Jot Maxi taking a leading role as opposed to the 16 bar feature slot he had in the original. The single was well received despite the video not achieving as many YouTube views as previous releases, with the general census across social media being that Jot is a welcome addition to the band and that a 2nd album is eagerly anticipated by fans.\n\nOn the 28th of March 2018 it was announced that Hacktivist and Timfy James had parted ways. Following on from this the band recruited James Hewitt (of bands 'Invocation' and 'Exist Immortal') as their new guitarist and producer with an official announcement made on the 19th of January 2019.

They are noted for using 8 string guitars and 6 string basses both tuned down to Drop E to achieve an extremely low tuned, distorted and dark sound, as well as ambient passages and a \"wall of sound\" production style. Their vocals are primarily [[rapping|rapped]], although they also make use of conventional singing and occasional [[harsh vocals]]. They write their lyrics collectively, focusing on political subjects such as [[anarchism]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[government corruption]], [[censorship]], anti-gun violence, unity against oppression and other social and economic issues.\n\nThe band's music has been described as [[rap metal]]<ref name=metalinjection>{{cite

debut studio album ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' in 2016.\n\n==History==\nHacktivist began in 2011 when former guitarist Timfy James left his previous band 'Heart of a Coward'. James claims that the formation of Hacktivist was a \"fluke\", with no intention of developing such a style, but the group was born when peer J Hurley, a local rapper with little history in the metal scene, began recording vocals over some of James' demos.<ref>[http://metalmouth.net/2013/01/hacktivist/ Interview with Hacktivist] Metal Mouth. January 15, 2013. Retrieved August 6, 2013.</ref> After the demos became very popular online, James decided to recruit a full lineup, bringing in Richard Hawking on drums, Josh Gurner (ex-[[Sacred Mother Tongue]]) on bass and Ben Marvin (James's former bandmate in Heart Of A Coward) as a second vocalist. The band began work on an [[extended play|EP]] in 2012 and debut single \"Unlike Us\" reached No. 2 in the Amazon UK metal chart within 48 hours.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/01/hactivist-uniting-people-djent Hacktivist: 'We're uniting a lot of people'] [[The Guardian]]. 1 November 2012.

This included supporting slots for acts such as [[Enter Shikari]] and [[Korn]] and performances in European festivals such as [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[Download Festival]] and [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] in summer 2013. In April 2013 the group released a new song \"Elevate\", with an accompanying video, for free download<ref>[http://metalmouth.net/2013/04/hacktivist-debut-video-and-offer-free-download/ HACKTIVIST Debut New Video And Offer Free Download] Metal Mouth. 8 April 2013.
