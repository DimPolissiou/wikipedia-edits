However, when she sings, strange events happen. Encouraged by her best friend Nathaniel, Iris auditions for a girl rock band, but ends up destroying the room and is later attacked by two strangers. The judges at the audition, Talia and Auriana, come to help her, and they explain to her that she is actually a [[princess]] with magical powers who must save her kingdom of Ephedia from the clutches of Gramorr, who has taken it over. The only way to save it is to master her powers and to find the Oracle Gems of the Royal Crown of Ephedia, which have been scattered across the Earth. Over the course of the series, the three girls try to live as both ordinary teenagers as well as rock stars of the [[all-female band]] \"LoliRock\", while training Iris in secret and gathering the gems. But when Gramorr sends twin siblings Praxina and Mephisto to fight them and summon monsters to cause chaos, the girls must work together as magical girl warrior princesses.\n\nIn season 2, the three girls are joined by Ephedian girls Carissa and Lyna, who also transform into warrior princesses, but are not part of the band. <!-- http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/153557107138/lolirock-season-2-production-over-drawing --> The girls continue gathering Oracle Gems while helping those in need, but Gramorr and the evil twins continue to get stronger as well. When the last oracle gem is collected, Iris faces the reality of having to say goodbye to Nathaniel and returning to Ephedia, but when Gramorr claims the final gem and is freed, the girls work together to face him in one last battle.\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:Tabitha St. Germain.png|thumb|[[Tabitha St. Germain]] voiced several of the key characters in ''LoliRock'' including Auriana, Amaru, Aunt Ellen, and Carissa]]\n<!-- The following are listed with star billing for the voice actors -->\n* '''{{vanchor|Iris}}''' (voiced by [[Kazumi Evans]] in English version,<ref name=\"english cast\">{{Cite web |url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/133994103918/lolirock-season-1-full-english-voice-cast-all |title=LoliRock Season 1 \u2013 Full english voice cast |last=Team LoliRock |date=26 November 2015 |access-date=13 June 2016 |work=Tumblr}}</ref><!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20160620190743/http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/133994103918/lolirock-season-1-full-english-voice-cast-all --> Lisa Caruso in French version<ref name=\"french cast\">{{Cite web |url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/133994170213/lolirock-season-1-full-french-cast-all-the |title=LoliRock Season 1 \u2013 Full french cast |last=Team LoliRock |date=26 November 2015 |access-date=17 June 2016 |work=Tubmlr}}</ref><!-- save to archive https://web.archive.org/web/20160620190842/http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/133994170213/lolirock-season-1-full-french-cast-all-the -->) \u2013 The lead singer of LoliRock, Iris is a 15-year-old{{efn|The ages for the other characters are listed at the LoliRock production Tumblr: {{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/142466362148/i-always-wonder-how-old-is-izira-mephisto |title=Team LoliRock \u2013 I always wonder how old is izira, mephisto,... |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=15 June 2016 |author=Team LoliRock |work=Tumblr |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424163804/http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/142466362148/i-always-wonder-how-old-is-izira-mephisto |archivedate=24 April 2017 |url-status=dead }}}}<!-- save to archive https://web.archive.org/web/20160620190923/http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/142466362148/i-always-wonder-how-old-is-izira-mephisto --><ref name=\"issuu catalog\" /> girl living in Sunny Bay; she has wavy blonde hair, fair skin, light blue eyes, pink lips and freckles.

Character designer Bertrand Todesco drew inspiration from Betty Autier, a French fashion blogger of \"le blog de betty\". She had dark hair and straight bangs, but Todesco figured the producers wanted a blonde girl for a lead, so he went with the look of [[Jenny Humphrey]] of the TV series ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', portrayed by [[Taylor Momsen]]. The producers also wanted the girls' irises to be star-shaped. Autier's appearance as well as her wardrobe was retained for Talia.<ref name=\"design1\" />\n\nFollowing the initial picture, Todesco needed to design a princess/rockstar outfit, of which he chose a green dress worn by [[Blake Lively]]. The colour was changed to pink as green was not suitable for merchandising. Todeco added a magical pet creature in the custom of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', which would later become Amaru. He designed in the hair streaks for when the girls were rock stars, and dresses that weren't so frilly that they would be complicated to draw.<ref name=\"design1\" />\n\nIn designing Talia and the then-named Aurora, Todesco originally started with a black girl and an Asian girl with typical hairstyles, but later changed his mind.<ref name=\"design2\" /> He then found inspirations from other ''Gossip Girl'' characters as well as actresses [[Amber Stevens West]] and [[Ariana Grande]], the latter of whom was how she acted in the teen sitcom ''[[Victorious (TV series)|Victorious]]'' rather than her current pop singer image. He also referenced [[Keri Hilson]] and [[Alicia Keys]]. ''Victorious'' was also the inspiration for some of the key visuals he used in promoting the series to get funding.<ref name=\"design3\" />\n\nEarly promotions of the series pictured the antagonist named Gromar to be an evil uncle of Iris who imprisoned the king and queen, and that he sent his two evil twin nephews to Earth to thwart Lolirock and take the gems.<ref name=\"licensemag 20131001\" /> Paxson said that they abandoned the idea as it would have made him more of a stereotype.<ref name=\"uncle gramorr rejected\">{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/124071399250/interview-with-writer-madellaine-paxson-behind|title=Interview with Writer Madellaine Paxson \u2013 Behind the Scenes \u2013 LoliRock|author=Team LoliRock|date=14 July 2015|work=Tumblr|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Todesco originally conceived of antagonists Praxina and Mephisto to have guitar playing sound powers that would counter the girls' singing voice powers but the idea was abandoned.<ref name=\"design5\" /> After several iterations, Praxina's final design was approved where she would have a butterfly brooch and motif, while Mephisto's was approved later, after director Jean-Louis had suggested he have a snake motif and a half-covered face.<ref name=\"design5\" /><ref name=\"design6\" /> Eventually Gramorr would have the covered face,<ref name=\"design7\" /><ref name=\"design6\" />\n\nThe design for the crystal [[magic circle]]s and related animation was first done in 2D based off some reference pictures.

The request was to add two new princesses to increase the member count to five. However, the LoliRock developers thought they already had too many characters so they made Lyna and Carissa supporting characters that were \"outside the main gang but always ready and willing to help when needed\". The two girls' transformations resemble Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. The designers considered making one of the two girls look Asian to balance out the overall group's look; they applied the look to both girls, and chose Lyna. There was also a concern that Carissa might be confused with Auriana as the show's redhead, they decided to go with giving her an Irish redhead theme anyway.<ref name=\"lyna and carissa dev\">{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/162714405036/lyna-carissas-developpment|title=Lyna & Carissa's Developpment|author=Team LoliRock|date=7 July 2017 |work=Tumblr|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Themes and writing===\n''LoliRock'' head writer Madellaine Paxson, who had worked on children's shows ''[[Making Fiends (TV series)|Making Fiends]]'', ''[[Power Rangers RPM]]'' as well as the horror film ''[[Blood Punch]]'', described the themes of the show as: friendship and love, magic, singing / music, and good vs. evil. She said the hardest part in writing an episode is the beginning and also in integrating the themes along with a story with a person that needs help. Her favourite scenes from the show were where the princesses are together doing ordinary teenage girl things as they had opportunities for comedy. She summarised the show as having something for everybody, very girly, but good action too.<ref name=\"paxson interview\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efZf6fDXjqw |title=Interview with Writer Madellaine Paxson \u2013 Behind the Scenes \u2013 LoliRock |last=LoliRock |date=9 July 2015 |access-date=18 June 2016 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> In the press release, Zodiak Kids describe the show as having a \"cast of characters that are aspirational role models for a generation of children for whom justice has become a core value\".<ref name=\"press 20150327\" /> Jean-Louis Vandestoc chose a band concept for the series as it was different from his other shows which involved characters that went to school and then saved the world.

They started with a full script and then recorded lines with scratch voices or final voices, as re-recording after storyboarding would be costlier.

Due to limited resources in production, the team posted that Iris would be the only one singing on those songs, so they recorded Yasmin Shah in English and then developed the music videos. After realising that it would be unnatural for the other girls to not sing, they designed Iris to have a microphone while the others would just sing along. They considered recording singing for Talia and Auriana but were constrained by budget. Cassandre Berger provided the singing on the French dub. The voices were then mixed.

However, when she sings, strange events happen. Encouraged by her best friend Nathaniel, Iris auditions for a girl rock band, but ends up destroying the room and is later attacked by two strangers. The judges at the audition, Talia and Auriana, come to help her, and they explain to her that she is actually a [[princess]] with magical powers who must save her kingdom of Ephedia from the clutches of Gramorr, who has taken it over. The only way to save it is to master her powers and to find the Oracle Gems of the Royal Crown of Ephedia, which have been scattered across the Earth. Over the course of the series, the three girls try to live as both ordinary teenagers as well as rock stars of the [[all-female band]] \"LoliRock\", while training Iris in secret and gathering the gems. But when Gramorr sends twin siblings Praxina and Mephisto to fight them and summon monsters to cause chaos, the girls must work together as magical girl warrior princesses.\n\nIn season 2, the three girls are joined by Ephedian girls Carissa and Lyna, who also transform into warrior princesses, but are not part of the band. <!-- http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/153557107138/lolirock-season-2-production-over-drawing --> The girls continue gathering Oracle Gems while helping those in need, but Gramorr and the evil twins continue to get stronger as well.

During the development of Carissa and Lyna's characters, the designers wanted to make one of them styled like an Asian princess, and settled with Lyna, while the Caucasian version of Lyna was used for a guest character Debra in season 2.<ref name=\"lyna and carissa dev\" />{{pb}}<!-- per [[H:LIST]] guidelines\n\n                                                                                                                                                       --->\n* '''{{vanchor|Carissa}}''' (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in English version,<ref name=\"english cast\" /> Fanny Bloc in French version<ref name=\"french cast\" />) \u2013 A princess of Calix, she also debuts in \"Home Part I\".

Carissa's hair was made brown in some of the early depictions so as to not confuse her with the redhead Auriana, but the designers later went with her original Irish redhead hair colour.

He wrote \"I loved the very core of it: a child transforming into an adult, helping people and making good deeds, the nice chara design, and finally the tone of the show: it could be funny and light, but also dramatic and tearful at other times. My soul was marked forever.\" After working on French cartoons ''[[Monster Buster Club]]'' and ''[[Rekkit Rabbit]]'' he wanted to make a [[magical girl]] show. He chose ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' as references for the magical girl part, and ''[[Jem and the Holograms]]'' for the music career part.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/124158192967/back-to-the-roots |title=Back to the roots |last=Jean-Louis Vandestoc / Team LoliRock |date=15 July 2015 |access-date=19 January 2017 |work=Tumblr}}</ref>\n\n===Character design===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout -->\n | align             = <!-- right (default), left, centre, none -->\n | direction         = <!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->\n | background colour  = <!-- box background -->\n | total_width       = 360 <!-- total width of all the displayed images in pixels (an integer, omit \"px\" suffix) -->\n | caption_align     = <!-- left (default), centre, right -->\n\n<!-- Header -->\n | header_background =\n | header_align      = <!-- centre (default), left, right -->\n | header            =\n\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Taylor Momsen 2011.jpg\n | width1            = 2543<!-- full width of the ORIGINAL UNSCALED image -->\n | height1           = 2646<!-- full height of the ORIGINAL UNSCALED image -->\n | alt1              =\n | caption1          = [[Taylor Momsen]], character reference for Iris\n\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Amber Stevens 2010.jpg\n | width2            = 1152 <!-- full width of the ORIGINAL UNSCALED image -->\n | height2           = 1728 <!-- full height of the ORIGINAL UNSCALED image -->\n | alt2              =\n | caption2          = [[Amber Stevens West]], character reference for Talia\n\n<!--image 3-->\n | image3            = Victorious Cast in Concert cropped.png\n | width3            = 327 <!-- full width of the ORIGINAL UNSCALED image -->\n | height3           = 712 <!-- full height of the ORIGINAL UNSCALED image -->\n | alt3              =\n | caption3          = [[Ariana Grande]] character reference for Auriana\n<!-- Footer -->\n | footer_background =\n | footer_align      = <!-- left (default), centre, right -->\n | footer            =\n}}\nThe producers at Marathon Media asked designers to draw Iris for a [[magical girl]] project as a teenage alien princess with ice/crystal powers. Character designer Bertrand Todesco drew inspiration from Betty Autier, a French fashion blogger of \"le blog de betty\". She had dark hair and straight bangs, but Todesco figured the producers wanted a blonde girl for a lead, so he went with the look of [[Jenny Humphrey]] of the TV series ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', portrayed by [[Taylor Momsen]]. The producers also wanted the girls' irises to be star-shaped. Autier's appearance as well as her wardrobe was retained for Talia.<ref name=\"design1\" />\n\nFollowing the initial picture, Todesco needed to design a princess/rockstar outfit, of which he chose a green dress worn by [[Blake Lively]]. The colour was changed to pink as green was not suitable for merchandising. Todeco added a magical pet creature in the custom of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', which would later become Amaru. He designed in the hair streaks for when the girls were rock stars, and dresses that weren't so frilly that they would be complicated to draw.<ref name=\"design1\" />\n\nIn designing Talia and the then-named Aurora, Todesco originally started with a black girl and an Asian girl with typical hairstyles, but later changed his mind.<ref name=\"design2\" /> He then found inspirations from other ''Gossip Girl'' characters as well as actresses [[Amber Stevens West]] and [[Ariana Grande]], the latter of whom was how she acted in the teen sitcom ''[[Victorious (TV series)|Victorious]]'' rather than her current pop singer image. He also referenced [[Keri Hilson]] and [[Alicia Keys]]. ''Victorious'' was also the inspiration for some of the key visuals he used in promoting the series to get funding.<ref name=\"design3\" />\n\nEarly promotions of the series pictured the antagonist named Gromar to be an evil uncle of Iris who imprisoned the king and queen, and that he sent his two evil twin nephews to Earth to thwart Lolirock and take the gems.<ref name=\"licensemag 20131001\" /> Paxson said that they abandoned the idea as it would have made him more of a stereotype.<ref name=\"uncle gramorr rejected\">{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/124071399250/interview-with-writer-madellaine-paxson-behind|title=Interview with Writer Madellaine Paxson \u2013 Behind the Scenes \u2013 LoliRock|author=Team LoliRock|date=14 July 2015|work=Tumblr|accessdate=16 January 2017}}</ref> Todesco originally conceived of antagonists Praxina and Mephisto to have guitar playing sound powers that would counter the girls' singing voice powers but the idea was abandoned.<ref name=\"design5\" /> After several iterations, Praxina's final design was approved where she would have a butterfly brooch and motif, while Mephisto's was approved later, after director Jean-Louis had suggested he have a snake motif and a half-covered face.<ref name=\"design5\" /><ref name=\"design6\" /> Eventually Gramorr would have the covered face,<ref name=\"design7\" /><ref name=\"design6\" />\n\nThe design for the crystal [[magic circle]]s and related animation was first done in 2D based off some reference pictures.

The request was to add two new princesses to increase the member count to five. However, the LoliRock developers thought they already had too many characters so they made Lyna and Carissa supporting characters that were \"outside the main gang but always ready and willing to help when needed\". The two girls' transformations resemble Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. The designers considered making one of the two girls look Asian to balance out the overall group's look; they applied the look to both girls, and chose Lyna. There was also a concern that Carissa might be confused with Auriana as the show's redhead, they decided to go with giving her an Irish redhead theme anyway.<ref name=\"lyna and carissa dev\">{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/162714405036/lyna-carissas-developpment|title=Lyna & Carissa's Developpment|author=Team LoliRock|date=7 July 2017 |work=Tumblr|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Themes and writing===\n''LoliRock'' head writer Madellaine Paxson, who had worked on children's shows ''[[Making Fiends (TV series)|Making Fiends]]'', ''[[Power Rangers RPM]]'' as well as the horror film ''[[Blood Punch]]'', described the themes of the show as: friendship and love, magic, singing / music, and good vs. evil. She said the hardest part in writing an episode is the beginning and also in integrating the themes along with a story with a person that needs help. Her favourite scenes from the show were where the princesses are together doing ordinary teenage girl things as they had opportunities for comedy. She summarised the show as having something for everybody, very girly, but good action too.<ref name=\"paxson interview\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efZf6fDXjqw |title=Interview with Writer Madellaine Paxson \u2013 Behind the Scenes \u2013 LoliRock |last=LoliRock |date=9 July 2015 |access-date=18 June 2016 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> In the press release, Zodiak Kids describe the show as having a \"cast of characters that are aspirational role models for a generation of children for whom justice has become a core value\".<ref name=\"press 20150327\" /> Jean-Louis Vandestoc chose a band concept for the series as it was different from his other shows which involved characters that went to school and then saved the world. The school part was replaced by the girls training or rehearsing for the concert.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/155290204503/from-where-will-come-the-idea-of-this-band |title=From where will come the idea of this band?? |last=Team LoliRock |date=2 January 2017 |access-date=16 January 2017 |work=Tumblr}}</ref> The developers later commented in their production blog [[FAQ]] that Iris was still attending school and that the episodes aren't all during summer vacation.<ref name=\"faq\">{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/faq|title=F.A.Q.|author=Team LoliRock|work=Tumblr|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to posts on the production Tumblr, ''LoliRock'' is classified as somewhere between a script-driven and storyboard-driven show. They started with a full script and then recorded lines with scratch voices or final voices, as re-recording after storyboarding would be costlier. The storyboard is then worked on, and some of the storyboard artists and supervisor adding and changing things they felt were important such as with the kiss scene in the Shanila episode and the Iris becoming a dark princess. Storyboard stage also included fixes for continuity and plot holes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/144656358703/hi-i-hope-you-had-a-good-day-d-i-was-wondering |title=Hi!

Due to limited resources in production, the team posted that Iris would be the only one singing on those songs, so they recorded Yasmin Shah in English and then developed the music videos. After realising that it would be unnatural for the other girls to not sing, they designed Iris to have a microphone while the others would just sing along. They considered recording singing for Talia and Auriana but were constrained by budget. Cassandre Berger provided the singing on the French dub. The voices were then mixed. As the dialogue was done later, the voice actors only sang on the incidental bits such as rehearsals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/133350263328/lolirockers-fanquestions-songs-and-lyrics | title=Team LoliRock \u2013 LoliRockers FanQuestions : Songs and Lyrics | date=16 November 2015 | accessdate=15 June 2016 |work=Tumblr | author=Team LoliRock}}</ref>\n\nThe episodes were written and dubbed in English first and then adapted into French.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/153883769745/whoiam989-its-official-lolirock-is-written-and#notes|title=Team LoliRock \u2013 whoiam989: It's official.

It centers around Nathan Levine, a lazy Specialist 3/C in the Army stationed at [[New Orleans]] who, along with several of his companions in the battalion are assigned to help with the cleanup at a small island named Creole, which has just been hit by a hurricane. He picks up dead bodies back at the island and after the horrific day of work, he heads back thinking about how to go forward with his life, if at all.\n\n=== \"Low-lands\" ===\nDennis Flange, a lawyer at Wasp and Winsome, Attorneys at Law, calls into the office, telling them he's not coming in. What he's going to do instead is sit at home and drink wine with the neighborhood garbage man, Rocco Squarcione. As they sit and talk, Dennis's wife, Cindy, comes home and is noticeably frustrated by Dennis's afternoon activities. To make matters worse, an old rowdy college \"friend\" of the Flanges, named [[Pig Bodine]], shows up in a stolen MG to see his old friend. At this, Cindy orders the three men off the premises. They all get in Rocco's garbage truck, and head down to the dump, patrolled by an old man named Bolingbroke. There, Dennis waxes philosophical about the dump, thinking of it as an allegory for his life up to that point, and possibly his life in the future. Rocco leaves for home, and Bolingbroke, Bodine, and Dennis turn in for the night, swapping [[nautical fiction|sea stories]] as they doze off. Then, in the middle of the night, Dennis hears a woman's voice calling \"Anglo! Anglo with the golden hair!\". Realizing this is him, Dennis runs off into the dump looking for the woman. Remembering that Bolingbroke said that [[Romani people|gypsies]] were in the area, Dennis wonders if the woman he's looking for is a gypsy. Then he sees her. She is the most beautiful woman he's ever seen... and is also three feet tall. She takes him to her home, tunneling deep into the dump, where she asks him to marry her. He declines, saying he's already married. To this, she starts crying, thinking Dennis won't take her. He then thinks she looks like a child, and that he always wanted children, but Cindy was too busy. He then tells her he'll stay... for a while.\n\n=== \"Entropy\"===\nA weekend-long lease-breaking party devolves into disarray as Meatball Mulligan entertains a revolving door of cronies, servicemen, and jazz musicians while, in a hothouse room, Callisto and his lover Aubade ponder the everpresent condition of enclosed systems creating disorder while trying to nurse a baby bird back to health. The temperature outside remains 37 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day, fueling apocalyptic paranoia in Callisto, who pontificates on the discoveries of the [[Laws of Thermodynamics]], the [[Clausius theorem]], and [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)#Gibbs Entropy Formula|Gibbs]] and [[Boltzmann]], finally deciding that [[entropy]] is an adequate metaphor to apply to American consumerist society, \"a similar tendency from the least to the most probable, from differentiation to sameness, from ordered individuality to a kind of chaos.\"  \nMeanwhile, Meatball juggles his attention between conversations about communication theory and personal relationships, keeping the musicians from smoking marijuana in his place, and the unexpected entrances of three coed philosophy majors lugging gallons of Chianti and, later, five sailors searching for a whorehouse.  As the musicians discuss music theory, the girls and sailors chant drunken songs together, and childish chicanery break out all over, Meatball debates whether to hide in a closet until the party subsides its second wind or try to calm everyone down, one by one.  He decides on the latter, patching up each out-of-control situation until the party tapers down to a din.  Callisto's bird fails to improve under the unchanging conditions, which causes Aubade to smash out a window of the hothouse with her bare hands, displacing the constant temperature of inside and outside and leaving the story in a state of hovering uncertainty of where the next moment will lead.\n\n=== \"Under the Rose\" ===\nTwo English spies, named Porpentine and Goodfellow, are sitting in a cafe in Upper [[Egypt]]. Their mission is to find out what their nemesis, Moldweorp, is up to in the area. Porpentine theorizes his plan is to assassinate the Consul-General, and so they travel to [[Cairo]] to intercept him, along with Goodfellow's new girlfriend, named Victoria Wren, her family, and a man named Bongo-Shaftsbury. During the trip, Bongo-Shaftsbury attempts to attack Victoria's younger sister Mildred, but Porpentine stops him. He then realizes that the man is a spy working for Moldweorp, and Bongo-Shaftsbury is put under guard. Upon reaching Cairo, the two men check into their hotels. The next morning, they head to the opera house where the Consul-General is a guest. Upon reaching their destination, they realize their hunch was correct, and Moldweorp and his spies are swarming the place. After Porpentine foils the assassination attempt, a chase across the streets of Cairo ensues. They reach the [[Sphinx]], and exit their cabs, running across the desert. Porpentine and Goodfellow catch Moldweorp, and they talk a moment. Porpentine tells Goodfellow to return to the cab. He does, and a shot rings out. Turning around, he sees his companion face-down in the hot desert sand, as Moldweorp walks away. Sixteen years later, Goodfellow surveys a motorcade containing [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], upon hearing rumors of a possible assassination. He's joined by his new girlfriend, a barmaid this time, who thinks of him as just a simple-minded Englishman, no good in bed but liberal with his money.\n\n=== \"The Secret Integration\" ===\nGrover Snodd and his friends Tim Santora, Carl Barrington, [[ETAOIN SHRDLU|Etienne Cherdlu]], and Hogan Slothrop, neighborhood kids from Mingeborough, New York, meet up at Grover's house one Saturday afternoon to discuss activities for the weekend.  Their \"Inner [[Military junta|Junta]]\" talk about planning elaborate practical jokes, collecting milk money from schoolkids.  The meeting adjourns and the five of them depart, through a lush section of forest they dub King Yjro's Woods, then down a stream aboard a refurbished flat-bottomed boat they christened the ''S.S. Leak'', to an abandoned manor known as \"The Big House\".\n\nHere they solidify plans to infiltrate and disrupt a [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meeting with smoke bombs and sodium/water explosions when Hogan, an 8-year-old [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] member, gets a call to sit with another member who is alone and afraid.  He and Tim abandon the group and go to the hotel where Mr. Carl McAfee, a Negro musician from Mississippi, was staying.\n\nMr. McAfee eyes the situation with the kids and, chalking it up to a bad joke, sends them away and calls room service for a fifth of whiskey.  Hogan steadfastly claims his seriousness and the kids stay to keep him company.  After failing to shoo them away, Grover calls the hotel and asks to show up with Etienne.  McAfee can't afford to pay for the bottle of whiskey, much less the room he's staying in, and breaks down into screaming and crying in his bed, passing out in-between fits. The police are called in to escort Mr. McAfee out as a vagrant, despite protests from the kids and Hogan's insistence that the man is sick, not a criminal.  The timeline gets flipped here and, after the Junta had successfully completed a few of their practical jokes, talk about Carl Barrington's family moving into the neighborhood had taken over the parents.\n\nIn response to the word \"integration\" being thrown around, Grover, the boy genius, offers the calculus definition.  Later it is realized that the parents were discussing the other meaning for \"integration\", white and black kids in the same schools, was what was really meant.  Carl's family, who is Negro, is a sort of trigger for the gentrification of the area, an easy target, an explanation for the racist remarks made by Tim's mother and reflected around the neighborhood, and gives light to the mockery of Hogan's dispatch to Mr. McAfee's aid.\n\nCarl, although accepted by the boys as a legitimate member of the Junta, could only be related to by grownups as an \"imaginary playmate\", someone who is talked about and reflected through safe White suburban eyes, then left to harmlessly evaporate at day's end.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[Baedeker]]'s guide to Egypt for 1899\n*[[John Buchan#Fiction|John Buchan's spy fiction]]\n*Edmund Wilson's ''[[To the Finland Station]]''\n*Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince]]''\n*[[John le Carr\u00e9]]\n*[[Surrealism]]\n*Regional guide to [[The Berkshire Hills]] (1939), [[American Guide Series]], [[Federal Writers' Project]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://thomaspynchon.com/pynchon-cover-art/slow-learner/ ''Slow Learner'' Cover Art Over Time at ThomasPynchon.com]\n\n{{Thomas Pynchon}}\n\n[[Category:1984 short story collections]]\n[[Category:Short story collections by Thomas Pynchon]]\n[[Category:Little, Brown and Company books]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the 2015 film|Slow Learners}}\n{{for|[[Developmental disorder]]|Learning disability}}\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name         = Slow Learner\n| image        = Image:SlowLearner1stEdition.JPG\n| caption      = First edition\n| author       = [[Thomas Pynchon]]\n| country      = United States\n| language     = English\n| genre        = [[Short stories]]\n| publisher    = [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]]\n| release_date = 1984\n| media_type   = Print\n| isbn         = 0-316-72442-4\n| dewey        = 813/.54 19\n| congress     = PS3566.Y55 S5 1984\n| oclc         = 10348691\n| preceded_by  = [[Gravity's Rainbow]]\n| followed_by  = [[Vineland]]\n}}\n'''''Slow Learner''''' is the 1984 published collection of five early [[short story|short stories]] by the American novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]], originally published in various sources between 1959 and 1964.\n\nThe book is also notable for its introduction, written by Pynchon.

He then realizes that the man is a spy working for Moldweorp, and Bongo-Shaftsbury is put under guard. Upon reaching Cairo, the two men check into their hotels. The next morning, they head to the opera house where the Consul-General is a guest. Upon reaching their destination, they realize their hunch was correct, and Moldweorp and his spies are swarming the place. After Porpentine foils the assassination attempt, a chase across the streets of Cairo ensues. They reach the [[Sphinx]], and exit their cabs, running across the desert. Porpentine and Goodfellow catch Moldweorp, and they talk a moment. Porpentine tells Goodfellow to return to the cab. He does, and a shot rings out. Turning around, he sees his companion face-down in the hot desert sand, as Moldweorp walks away. Sixteen years later, Goodfellow surveys a motorcade containing [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], upon hearing rumors of a possible assassination. He's joined by his new girlfriend, a barmaid this time, who thinks of him as just a simple-minded Englishman, no good in bed but liberal with his money.\n\n=== \"The Secret Integration\" ===\nGrover Snodd and his friends Tim Santora, Carl Barrington, [[ETAOIN SHRDLU|Etienne Cherdlu]], and Hogan Slothrop, neighborhood kids from Mingeborough, New York, meet up at Grover's house one Saturday afternoon to discuss activities for the weekend.  Their \"Inner [[Military junta|Junta]]\" talk about planning elaborate practical jokes, collecting milk money from schoolkids.  The meeting adjourns and the five of them depart, through a lush section of forest they dub King Yjro's Woods, then down a stream aboard a refurbished flat-bottomed boat they christened the ''S.S. Leak'', to an abandoned manor known as \"The Big House\".\n\nHere they solidify plans to infiltrate and disrupt a [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meeting with smoke bombs and sodium/water explosions when Hogan, an 8-year-old [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] member, gets a call to sit with another member who is alone and afraid.  He and Tim abandon the group and go to the hotel where Mr. Carl McAfee, a Negro musician from Mississippi, was staying.\n\nMr. McAfee eyes the situation with the kids and, chalking it up to a bad joke, sends them away and calls room service for a fifth of whiskey.  Hogan steadfastly claims his seriousness and the kids stay to keep him company.  After failing to shoo them away, Grover calls the hotel and asks to show up with Etienne.  McAfee can't afford to pay for the bottle of whiskey, much less the room he's staying in, and breaks down into screaming and crying in his bed, passing out in-between fits. The police are called in to escort Mr. McAfee out as a vagrant, despite protests from the kids and Hogan's insistence that the man is sick, not a criminal.  The timeline gets flipped here and, after the Junta had successfully completed a few of their practical jokes, talk about Carl Barrington's family moving into the neighborhood had taken over the parents.\n\nIn response to the word \"integration\" being thrown around, Grover, the boy genius, offers the calculus definition.  Later it is realized that the parents were discussing the other meaning for \"integration\", white and black kids in the same schools, was what was really meant.  Carl's family, who is Negro, is a sort of trigger for the gentrification of the area, an easy target, an explanation for the racist remarks made by Tim's mother and reflected around the neighborhood, and gives light to the mockery of Hogan's dispatch to Mr. McAfee's aid.\n\nCarl, although accepted by the boys as a legitimate member of the Junta, could only be related to by grownups as an \"imaginary playmate\", someone who is talked about and reflected through safe White suburban eyes, then left to harmlessly evaporate at day's end.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n*[[Baedeker]]'s guide to Egypt for 1899\n*[[John Buchan#Fiction|John Buchan's spy fiction]]\n*Edmund Wilson's ''[[To the Finland Station]]''\n*Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince]]''\n*[[John le Carr\u00e9]]\n*[[Surrealism]]\n*Regional guide to [[The Berkshire Hills]] (1939), [[American Guide Series]], [[Federal Writers' Project]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://thomaspynchon.com/pynchon-cover-art/slow-learner/ ''Slow Learner'' Cover Art Over Time at ThomasPynchon.com]\n\n{{Thomas Pynchon}}\n\n[[Category:1984 short story collections]]\n[[Category:Short story collections by Thomas Pynchon]]\n[[Category:Little, Brown and Company books]]\n", "name_user": "106.222.203.167", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I don't know after observations)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Learner"}

It was produced by [[James Keach]], [[Stacy Keach]] and [[Tim Zinnemann]] and featured an original soundtrack by [[Ry Cooder]]. Cooder won the ''Best Music'' award in 1980 from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for this soundtrack. The film was entered into the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1835/year/1980.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Long Riders |accessdate=2009-05-28|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the years following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], banks and trains become the targets of the [[James-Younger gang]], outlaws who terrorize the [[Midwestern United States]]. The band of robbers is led by [[Jesse James]] and [[Cole Younger]], along with several of their brothers.\n\nA detective, Mr. Rixley from the [[Pinkerton's]] agency, is assigned to capture the outlaws. Leading his own large team of men, Rixley doggedly remains on their trail, killing several innocent relatives of the gang in the process. By the time, at Clell Miller's suggestion, the James-Younger Gang rides far north in September 1876 to rob a bank belonging to \"squareheads\" in [[Northfield, Minnesota]], word is out about them and the town has been warned by the Pinkertons.\n\nThe holdup goes wrong in every way. The bank's vault has been set on a timer and cannot be opened. A cashier and another citizen are shot and killed. While trying to escape, the gang is fired upon by the townspeople, who, setting a trap, have barricaded both ends of the main street. Two outlaws, both recently recruited by Jesse, are killed, Clell is fatally gutshot, Frank is hit in the arm, and all of the Youngers are badly wounded.\n\nFinally escaping Northfield, the surviving gang members temporarily make camp in some woods. Clell Miller is dying. Jim Younger, sporting more than several wounds, cannot speak due to a bullet piercing his cheek. Bob Younger, flat on his back, moans pitifully, shot multiple times. Cole Younger, seeming the most mobile of his siblings, has (as later reported by a physician) been hit by no less than eleven bullets. Frank James has only one minor injury. Jesse James appears to have escaped unscathed.\n\nHard decisions have to be made. A posse will be soon coming for the outlaws. Miller is on his last breaths. The three Younger brothers are so injured that they are unable to continue. Only Jesse and Frank James are in any condition to ride further. Even though it is his gang, and they follow his commands, Jesse elects to leave all the badly wounded behind. Frank reluctantly agrees. Cole objects, implying that it is disloyal to abandon them, but Jesse ignores him, while Frank declares that he has to abide by his brother's decision.\n\nThe James brothers return home to Missouri. An attempt is made by Pinkerton Rixley to make the Youngers, now in a prison hospital, reveal where the Jameses can be found. Rixley states that the Youngers will face life in prison (the state of Minnesota does not have the death penalty), but he offers them a more lenient sentence if they betray the James brothers. The Youngers, despite their abandonment, refuse to inform on the Jameses.\n\nJesse, not terribly affected by the disastrous Northfield raid, chooses to recruit a new gang. Bob and Charlie Ford, previously spurned in their efforts to join Jesse's outfit, are now invited to Jesse's home for dinner. The expectation is that Jesse will ask the two brothers to join him in further robberies. However, having made a prior deal with Rixley for a lucrative reward, Bob and Charlie shoot an unsuspecting Jesse James in the back while he straightens a picture frame.\n\nUpon learning of his brother's assassination, Frank James surrenders his gun and turns himself in to Rixley, but only on the condition that he can first attend his brother's funeral. Rixley suggests that he might not agree to such terms, whereupon Frank declares that he will kill him if he refuses.\n\nA train transports a wooden coffin bearing the body of Jesse James. Frank James, handcuffed to Rixley, stands at the railcar door, looking out, noting the people beside the tracks, paying their final respects to his brother, as the train passes by.\n\n==Cast==\n''The Long Riders'' is a notable film in part due to the decision to cast four sets of actor brothers as the real-life sets of brothers:\n\n*The Keaches: [[Jesse James]] ([[James Keach]]) and [[Frank James]] ([[Stacy Keach]])\n*[[Carradine family|The Carradines]]: [[Cole Younger]] ([[David Carradine]]), [[Jim Younger]] ([[Keith Carradine]]) and [[Bob Younger]] ([[Robert Carradine]])\n*The Quaids: [[Edward T.

Additionally James Keach's son, Kalen Keach, is cast as Jesse James's son [[Jesse E. James]]. [[Savannah Smith Boucher]] played Jesse James' wife, [[Zerelda Mimms|Zee]].\n\n*[[James Whitmore Jr.]] as Mr. Rixley\n*[[Kevin Brophy]] as [[John Younger]]\n*[[Harry Carey Jr.]] as George Arthur\n*[[Shelby Leverington]] as Annie Ralston\n*[[Felice Orlandi]] as Mr. Reddick\n*[[Pamela Reed]] as [[Belle Starr]]\n*[[Lin Shaye]] as Kate\n*[[James Remar]] as [[Sam Starr]]\n\n==Development==\n===Theatre Origins===\nIn 1971 James and Stacy Keach played the [[Wright brothers]] in a [[television film]] called ''[[The Wright Brothers (film)|The Wright Brothers]]'' (1971). This gave James the idea they should portray Jesse and Frank James in a film together. James started off by writing a play about the James brothers which Stacy financed and produced. They staged it at the [[Bucks County Playhouse]] and then toured it through schools in New Jersey.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nThe play was then adapted into a country musical, ''The Bandit Kings'', and performed off-Broadway at the Bowery Lane Theatre. James Keach produced (for $10,000), directed and starred as Jesse. The Keaches then decided to turn the musical into a feature film screenplay in which both could star.<ref name=\"times\"/><ref name=\"globe\">{{cite news|title=Keach's grit is grease for film's wheels |newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=17 Aug 1979|page=13}}</ref> The brothers rewrote the material into screenplay form and combined it with the work of Bill Bryden, who had his own Jesse James script. Stacy Keach says another writer called Steven Smith \"came in to pull all the threads together\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Keach p 133</ref>\n\n===Film Development===\nIn 1974 James Keach was acting opposite [[Robert Carradine]] in the television film ''[[The Hatfields and the McCoys (film)|The Hatfields and the McCoys]]'' and mentioned the project to him; Carradine suggested that he and his brothers play the Younger brothers. David Carradine said:\n<blockquote>Bobby and Jim came to me and said, 'Do you want to do this picture?' You know, I just thought it was the kids talkin\u2019 , but then they said, \u2019Well, Stacy said he\u2019ll do it.\u2019 And I said, 'Well, if Stacy said he'll do it. I'll do it.' Then they went to Stacy and said, 'Well, David said he\u2019ll do it\u2019, and Stacy said, \"Well, if he\u2019ll do it, I'll do it\u2019. Then we worked on Keith, who was a hard sell, but he couldn't very well turn it down if the rest of us were doing it.<ref name=\"david\">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Psychotronic_Video_05/page/n24?q=%22long+riders%22+%22walter+hill%22|magazine=Psychtronic Video|page=22|first=Tom|last=Rainone|title=Drunk as Hell with David Carradine|issue=5|date=Spring 1990}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe idea that all the brothers in the story would be played by real-life brothers expanded, and [[Randy Quaid|Randy]] and [[Dennis Quaid]] also became attached to the project to play the Miller brothers.<ref name=\"la\"/>\n\nJames Keach later recalled, \"Everyone told me, 'You can't get all these guys together; family devotion is one thing, but this is Hollywood.' We decided to prove how serious we were by having a group picture taken. We did it at midnight in a recording studio where Keith was cutting some numbers. We sent limousines for everyone; it was quite a production.\"<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nThe photograph helped convince NBC to finance ''Long Riders'' as a six-hour mini-series. But then [[Fred Silverman]] became president of NBC and cancelled all mini-series ordered by his predecessors.<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\n\"It was all happening while I was on Bora Bora making ''[[The Hurricane (1979 film)|The Hurricane]]'' (1979),\" said James. \"I spent a lot of time fishing with [[Tim Zinnemann]], who was producing the picture. We became good friends and I told him about ''The Long Riders''.\" Zinnemann took the project to [[United Artists]], who were interested in funding the film if a suitable director could be found.<ref name=\"globe\"/> Stacey Keach said the gimmick of the brothers playing brothers got the film over the line.<ref name=\"boston\">WHY THEY'RE SLOW ON THE DRAW Michael Blowen Boston Globe 29 June 1980: 1.</ref>\n\n===Walter Hill===\nStacy Keach says [[George Roy Hill]] \"scoffed at the notion\" of the brothers casting.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Zinnemann showed the script to [[Walter Hill]] who agreed to direct. Hill had been working on another film which had fallen through and, as he later said, \"I'd been dying to do a Western for years. I just like 'em. There's a kind of an idyllic quality that surrounds the shooting of them, it seems like a more fundamental film process, more to me what movies are about than clearing crowds off a city street.\"<ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/05/25/hollywoods-hill-a-long-ride-up/40c362ef-23c6-428c-a39a-75381883eb43/?noredirect=on|title=Hollywood's Hill -- A Long Ride Up|first=Kenneth|last= Turan|date=May 25, 1980}}</ref>\n\nHill called the film a \"strange piece\";\n<blockquote>Instead of the logical conclusion being at Northfield, it then goes on to another phase of a spiral downward, and ends with Jesse's death. It's very hard material to give the proper dramatic curve to. It doesn't lay out in a classic three-act structure. It's almost a four-act piece with Northfield and the aftermath being the culmination of the third act. The fourth act is almost epilogue: How They Went Down... There's a line from a Jean-Luc Godard film: \"The jokes are funny but the bullets are real.\" That's really what this movie is about. These were big, reckless, high-spirited guys that were unaware of the ripples they caused.<ref name=\"mike\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Ford brothers were going to be played by [[Beau Bridges|Beau]] and [[Jeff Bridges]] but by this time they had become unavailable.  Jeff Bridges later said, \"I couldn't do it because of a schedule conflict. And when I first read the script, I thought it was another case of where the material didn't match up with the gimmick. But then I saw the end result and I thought it was pretty good and I figured we would have had a good time doing it because we know all those other guys. Walter Hill is an extraordinary filmmaker and I think he added a specialness to it that the script lacked.\"<ref>INTERVIEW: JEFF BRIDGES BALTAKE, JOE.

Los Angeles Times 8 May 1980: h1.</ref>\n\nWalter Hill later argued that the best film that had been made about the Younger-James brothers prior to this was ''[[The Return of Frank James]]''. \"In the historical sense it was also the least accurate, but it had a real sense of character truth,\" he said.<ref name=\"mike\">{{cite magazine|title=Hard Riding|last=Greco|first= Mike|magazine=Film Comment|volume= 16|issue=3|date=May\u2013June 1980|page= 13\u201319,80}}</ref>\n\n==Filming==\nSome of the film, especially the Northfield scene, was shot in [[Parrott, Georgia]].<ref name=\"yanks\">At the Movies: 'Yanks' stirs memories for its makers.\nBuckley, Tom. New York Times  28 Sep 1979: C14.</ref>\n\n\"The company originally wanted to shoot in Missouri, but they found that urban sprawl just blew that out of the tub,\" said a publicist. \"Parrott was chosen because it's almost as if time stood still there. The ravages of the years have not touched the buildings and it closely resembles Northfield, Minn., in 1876.\"<ref>James gang dies into Parrott, Ga.\nThe Globe and Mail 29 Aug 1979: P.12. </ref>\n\nHill says the most difficult sequence was the one where horses jumped through glass. \"We trained them for three weeks, making them do the jump without the glass. Once we conditioned them to that, we put the glass in. It's a big surprise to the horses, and they'll only do it once. We had to use a different set of horses for the second jump.\"<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nStacey Keach says the brothers would bond by playing music together every night during the shoot. He says the Guest brothers would sit apart from the others because they were playing villains.<ref>Keach p 135</ref>\n\nHill shot the sequence in slow motion, a technique associated with the Westerns of [[Sam Peckinpah]]. Hill believes \"the way Sam used slow motion was almost directly opposite to mine. What Sam was doing was making individual moments more real by extending them, kind of underlining the horrible moment of being shot. ''The Long Riders'' is meant to be almost dream-like to have the reality of a nightmare, where everything is going wrong but there's no focus to it, you don't know where you are or how you got there.\"<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nJames Keach said the film \"was very authentic, not a traditional Western with sagebursh and desert. Ours has more of a midwestern feel to it. We've high hopes for it but I just wish we had more time.\"<ref>WATCHING BLATTY WILL A WINNER\nLos Angeles Times 11 Mar 1980: g6. </ref>\n\nWhen the film went over its original $7.5 million budget, the Keaches forfeited their executive producer fees. \"''The Long Riders'' has been made on faith and idealism,\" said Keach.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nStacy Keach wrote in his memoirs that Hill \"did a great job imposing his vision on our script without undermining its essence\" but says \"none of us had the clout\" to stop the studio from cutting several scenes involving Keach and Randy Quaid. \"They just wanted to keep the story moving and focus on the action and not the personal relationships.\"<ref>Keach p 136</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music for the film was composed, arranged, and performed by [[Ry Cooder]]. Other performers on the soundtrack were multi-instrumentalist [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]] and percussionist [[Milt Holland]].<ref>The Long Riders, DVD, Metro-Goldwin-Mayer Studios Inc. 2001, credits</ref>  Some of the songs were released as an album, [[The Long Riders (album)|The Long Riders]].

It was produced by [[James Keach]], [[Stacy Keach]] and [[Tim Zinnemann]] and featured an original soundtrack by [[Ry Cooder]]. Cooder won the ''Best Music'' award in 1980 from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for this soundtrack. The film was entered into the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1835/year/1980.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Long Riders |accessdate=2009-05-28|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the years following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], banks and trains become the targets of the [[James-Younger gang]], outlaws who terrorize the [[Midwestern United States]]. The band of robbers is led by [[Jesse James]] and [[Cole Younger]], along with several of their brothers.\n\nA detective, Mr. Rixley from the [[Pinkerton's]] agency, is assigned to capture the outlaws. Leading his own large team of men, Rixley doggedly remains on their trail, killing several innocent relatives of the gang in the process. By the time, at Clell Miller's suggestion, the James-Younger Gang rides far north in September 1876 to rob a bank belonging to \"squareheads\" in [[Northfield, Minnesota]], word is out about them and the town has been warned by the Pinkertons.\n\nThe holdup goes wrong in every way. The bank's vault has been set on a timer and cannot be opened. A cashier and another citizen are shot and killed. While trying to escape, the gang is fired upon by the townspeople, who, setting a trap, have barricaded both ends of the main street. Two outlaws, both recently recruited by Jesse, are killed, Clell is fatally gutshot, Frank is hit in the arm, and all of the Youngers are badly wounded.\n\nFinally escaping Northfield, the surviving gang members temporarily make camp in some woods. Clell Miller is dying. Jim Younger, sporting more than several wounds, cannot speak due to a bullet piercing his cheek. Bob Younger, flat on his back, moans pitifully, shot multiple times. Cole Younger, seeming the most mobile of his siblings, has (as later reported by a physician) been hit by no less than eleven bullets. Frank James has only one minor injury. Jesse James appears to have escaped unscathed.\n\nHard decisions have to be made. A posse will be soon coming for the outlaws. Miller is on his last breaths. The three Younger brothers are so injured that they are unable to continue. Only Jesse and Frank James are in any condition to ride further. Even though it is his gang, and they follow his commands, Jesse elects to leave all the badly wounded behind. Frank reluctantly agrees. Cole objects, implying that it is disloyal to abandon them, but Jesse ignores him, while Frank declares that he has to abide by his brother's decision.\n\nThe James brothers return home to Missouri. An attempt is made by Pinkerton Rixley to make the Youngers, now in a prison hospital, reveal where the Jameses can be found. Rixley states that the Youngers will face life in prison (the state of Minnesota does not have the death penalty), but he offers them a more lenient sentence if they betray the James brothers. The Youngers, despite their abandonment, refuse to inform on the Jameses.\n\nJesse, not terribly affected by the disastrous Northfield raid, chooses to recruit a new gang. Bob and Charlie Ford, previously spurned in their efforts to join Jesse's outfit, are now invited to Jesse's home for dinner. The expectation is that Jesse will ask the two brothers to join him in further robberies. However, having made a prior deal with Rixley for a lucrative reward, Bob and Charlie shoot an unsuspecting Jesse James in the back while he straightens a picture frame.\n\nUpon learning of his brother's assassination, Frank James surrenders his gun and turns himself in to Rixley, but only on the condition that he can first attend his brother's funeral. Rixley suggests that he might not agree to such terms, whereupon Frank declares that he will kill him if he refuses.\n\nA train transports a wooden coffin bearing the body of Jesse James. Frank James, handcuffed to Rixley, stands at the railcar door, looking out, noting the people beside the tracks, paying their final respects to his brother, as the train passes by.\n\n==Cast==\n''The Long Riders'' is a notable film in part due to the decision to cast four sets of actor brothers as the real-life sets of brothers:\n\n*The Keaches: [[Jesse James]] ([[James Keach]]) and [[Frank James]] ([[Stacy Keach]])\n*[[Carradine family|The Carradines]]: [[Cole Younger]] ([[David Carradine]]), [[Jim Younger]] ([[Keith Carradine]]) and [[Bob Younger]] ([[Robert Carradine]])\n*The Quaids: [[Edward T. Miller (outlaw)|Ed Miller]] ([[Dennis Quaid]]) and [[Clell Miller]] ([[Randy Quaid]])\n*The Guests: [[Charles Ford (outlaw)|Charley Ford]] ([[Christopher Guest]]) and [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert Ford]] ([[Nicholas Guest]])\n\nIt also features an uncredited appearance by [[Ever Carradine]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} daughter of Robert Carradine and niece to David and Keith Carradine. Additionally James Keach's son, Kalen Keach, is cast as Jesse James's son [[Jesse E. James]]. [[Savannah Smith Boucher]] played Jesse James' wife, [[Zerelda Mimms|Zee]].\n\n*[[James Whitmore Jr.]] as Mr. Rixley\n*[[Kevin Brophy]] as [[John Younger]]\n*[[Harry Carey Jr.]] as George Arthur\n*[[Shelby Leverington]] as Annie Ralston\n*[[Felice Orlandi]] as Mr. Reddick\n*[[Pamela Reed]] as [[Belle Starr]]\n*[[Lin Shaye]] as Kate\n*[[James Remar]] as [[Sam Starr]]\n\n==Production==\n===Theatre Origins===\nIn 1971 James and Stacy Keach played the [[Wright brothers]] in a [[television film]] called ''[[The Wright Brothers (film)|The Wright Brothers]]'' (1971). This gave James the idea they should portray Jesse and Frank James in a film together. James started off by writing a play about the James brothers which Stacy financed and produced. They staged it at the [[Bucks County Playhouse]] and then toured it through schools in New Jersey.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nThe play was then adapted into a country musical, ''The Bandit Kings'', and performed off-Broadway at the Bowery Lane Theatre. James Keach produced (for $10,000), directed and starred as Jesse. The Keaches then decided to turn the musical into a feature film screenplay in which both could star.<ref name=\"times\"/><ref name=\"globe\">{{cite news|title=Keach's grit is grease for film's wheels |newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=17 Aug 1979|page=13}}</ref> The brothers rewrote the material into screenplay form and combined it with the work of Bill Bryden, who had his own Jesse James script. Stacy Keach says another writer called Steven Smith \"came in to pull all the threads together\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Keach p 133</ref>\n\n===Film Development===\nIn 1974 James Keach was acting opposite [[Robert Carradine]] in the television film ''[[The Hatfields and the McCoys (film)|The Hatfields and the McCoys]]'' and mentioned the project to him; Carradine suggested that he and his brothers play the Younger brothers. David Carradine said:\n<blockquote>Bobby and Jim came to me and said, 'Do you want to do this picture?' You know, I just thought it was the kids talkin\u2019 , but then they said, \u2019Well, Stacy said he\u2019ll do it.\u2019 And I said, 'Well, if Stacy said he'll do it. I'll do it.' Then they went to Stacy and said, 'Well, David said he\u2019ll do it\u2019, and Stacy said, \"Well, if he\u2019ll do it, I'll do it\u2019. Then we worked on Keith, who was a hard sell, but he couldn't very well turn it down if the rest of us were doing it.<ref name=\"david\">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Psychotronic_Video_05/page/n24?q=%22long+riders%22+%22walter+hill%22|magazine=Psychtronic Video|page=22|first=Tom|last=Rainone|title=Drunk as Hell with David Carradine|issue=5|date=Spring 1990}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe idea that all the brothers in the story would be played by real-life brothers expanded, and [[Randy Quaid|Randy]] and [[Dennis Quaid]] also became attached to the project to play the Miller brothers.<ref name=\"la\"/>\n\nJames Keach later recalled, \"Everyone told me, 'You can't get all these guys together; family devotion is one thing, but this is Hollywood.' We decided to prove how serious we were by having a group picture taken. We did it at midnight in a recording studio where Keith was cutting some numbers. We sent limousines for everyone; it was quite a production.\"<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nThe photograph helped convince NBC to finance ''Long Riders'' as a six-hour mini-series. But then [[Fred Silverman]] became president of NBC and cancelled all mini-series ordered by his predecessors.<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\n\"It was all happening while I was on Bora Bora making ''[[The Hurricane (1979 film)|The Hurricane]]'' (1979),\" said James. \"I spent a lot of time fishing with [[Tim Zinnemann]], who was producing the picture. We became good friends and I told him about ''The Long Riders''.\" Zinnemann took the project to [[United Artists]], who were interested in funding the film if a suitable director could be found.<ref name=\"globe\"/> Stacey Keach said the gimmick of the brothers playing brothers got the film over the line.<ref name=\"boston\">WHY THEY'RE SLOW ON THE DRAW Michael Blowen Boston Globe 29 June 1980: 1.</ref>\n\n===Walter Hill===\nStacy Keach says [[George Roy Hill]] \"scoffed at the notion\" of the brothers casting.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Zinnemann showed the script to [[Walter Hill]] who agreed to direct. Hill had been working on another film which had fallen through and, as he later said, \"I'd been dying to do a Western for years. I just like 'em. There's a kind of an idyllic quality that surrounds the shooting of them, it seems like a more fundamental film process, more to me what movies are about than clearing crowds off a city street.\"<ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/05/25/hollywoods-hill-a-long-ride-up/40c362ef-23c6-428c-a39a-75381883eb43/?noredirect=on|title=Hollywood's Hill -- A Long Ride Up|first=Kenneth|last= Turan|date=May 25, 1980}}</ref>\n\nHill called the film a \"strange piece\";\n<blockquote>Instead of the logical conclusion being at Northfield, it then goes on to another phase of a spiral downward, and ends with Jesse's death. It's very hard material to give the proper dramatic curve to. It doesn't lay out in a classic three-act structure. It's almost a four-act piece with Northfield and the aftermath being the culmination of the third act. The fourth act is almost epilogue: How They Went Down... There's a line from a Jean-Luc Godard film: \"The jokes are funny but the bullets are real.\" That's really what this movie is about. These were big, reckless, high-spirited guys that were unaware of the ripples they caused.<ref name=\"mike\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Ford brothers were going to be played by [[Beau Bridges|Beau]] and [[Jeff Bridges]] but by this time they had become unavailable.  Jeff Bridges later said, \"I couldn't do it because of a schedule conflict. And when I first read the script, I thought it was another case of where the material didn't match up with the gimmick. But then I saw the end result and I thought it was pretty good and I figured we would have had a good time doing it because we know all those other guys. Walter Hill is an extraordinary filmmaker and I think he added a specialness to it that the script lacked.\"<ref>INTERVIEW: JEFF BRIDGES BALTAKE, JOE.

Los Angeles Times 8 May 1980: h1.</ref>\n\nWalter Hill later argued that the best film that had been made about the Younger-James brothers prior to this was ''[[The Return of Frank James]]''. \"In the historical sense it was also the least accurate, but it had a real sense of character truth,\" he said.<ref name=\"mike\">{{cite magazine|title=Hard Riding|last=Greco|first= Mike|magazine=Film Comment|volume= 16|issue=3|date=May\u2013June 1980|page= 13\u201319,80}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nSome of the film, especially the Northfield scene, was shot in [[Parrott, Georgia]].<ref name=\"yanks\">At the Movies: 'Yanks' stirs memories for its makers.\nBuckley, Tom. New York Times  28 Sep 1979: C14.</ref>\n\n\"The company originally wanted to shoot in Missouri, but they found that urban sprawl just blew that out of the tub,\" said a publicist. \"Parrott was chosen because it's almost as if time stood still there. The ravages of the years have not touched the buildings and it closely resembles Northfield, Minn., in 1876.\"<ref>James gang dies into Parrott, Ga.\nThe Globe and Mail 29 Aug 1979: P.12. </ref>\n\nHill says the most difficult sequence was the one where horses jumped through glass. \"We trained them for three weeks, making them do the jump without the glass. Once we conditioned them to that, we put the glass in. It's a big surprise to the horses, and they'll only do it once. We had to use a different set of horses for the second jump.\"<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nStacey Keach says the brothers would bond by playing music together every night during the shoot. He says the Guest brothers would sit apart from the others because they were playing villains.<ref>Keach p 135</ref>\n\nHill shot the sequence in slow motion, a technique associated with the Westerns of [[Sam Peckinpah]]. Hill believes \"the way Sam used slow motion was almost directly opposite to mine. What Sam was doing was making individual moments more real by extending them, kind of underlining the horrible moment of being shot. ''The Long Riders'' is meant to be almost dream-like to have the reality of a nightmare, where everything is going wrong but there's no focus to it, you don't know where you are or how you got there.\"<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nJames Keach said the film \"was very authentic, not a traditional Western with sagebursh and desert. Ours has more of a midwestern feel to it. We've high hopes for it but I just wish we had more time.\"<ref>WATCHING BLATTY WILL A WINNER\nLos Angeles Times 11 Mar 1980: g6. </ref>\n\nWhen the film went over its original $7.5 million budget, the Keaches forfeited their executive producer fees. \"''The Long Riders'' has been made on faith and idealism,\" said Keach.<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nStacy Keach wrote in his memoirs that Hill \"did a great job imposing his vision on our script without undermining its essence\" but says \"none of us had the clout\" to stop the studio from cutting several scenes involving Keach and Randy Quaid. \"They just wanted to keep the story moving and focus on the action and not the personal relationships.\"<ref>Keach p 136</ref>\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music for the film was composed, arranged, and performed by [[Ry Cooder]]. Other performers on the soundtrack were multi-instrumentalist [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]] and percussionist [[Milt Holland]].<ref>The Long Riders, DVD, Metro-Goldwin-Mayer Studios Inc. 2001, credits</ref>  Some of the songs were released as an album, [[The Long Riders (album)|The Long Riders]].
