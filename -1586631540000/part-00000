TransLink is part of the [[Department of Transport and Main Roads]] and was first introduced by the [[Queensland Government]] in June 2003 to orchestrate bus, ferry, rail and [[G:Link|light rail]] services. TransLink works with [[Airtrain Citylink|Brisbane Airtrain]] (Airport services), [[Brisbane Transport]], [[Transdev Brisbane Ferries|Transdev]] (Ferry services), [[Queensland Rail]] and [[#Operators|other operators]] to provide services. TransLink operates an [[integrated ticketing]] system and the [[go card]] [[smartcard]] system to allow the use of one ticket on multiple services.\n\nIn July 2008 TransLink devolved from being a division of Queensland Transport to the more autonomous TransLink Transit Authority, before returning to management from the [[Department of Transport and Main Roads]] in November 2012. <ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-02/qld-parliament-approves-dissolving-translink/4348906 Qld Parliament approves dissolving Translink] ''ABC News'' 2 November 2012</ref> Combining the former Authority and [[qConnect]], TransLink is now responsible for providing public transport services across the whole of Queensland.\n\n==History==\nTransInfo was a phone inquiry and timetable service established in August 1993 by Queensland Transport.

With a $21.4 million budget, TransLink was tasked to introduce common fares, zones and ticket types irrespective of transit mode, and from mid-2004 a smartcard system.

The breed was developed by the landed gentry in order to get a dog suitable for fox hunting. Besides the Black and Tan, there are the [[Walker Hound|Walker]], [[Calhoun Hound|Calhoun]], [[Penn-Marydel Hound|Penn-Marydel]], [[Goodman Hound|Goodman]], [[July Hound|July]], and [[Trigg Hound|Trigg]], which all developed from similar crosses. The Black and Tan is believed to descend form hunting dogs imported to America by [[Robert Brooke, Sr.|Robert Brooke]] in 1650. These hunting dogs were the ancestors of several varieties of American hounds and stayed with the Brooke family for more than 300 years. Afterwards, [[French Foxhound]]s were bred in after [[George Washington]] received them as gifts from the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].

Mulford]], who wrote a series of [[short stories]] and novels based on the character.\n\n==Origin==\nIn his early writings, Mulford portrayed the character as rude, dangerous, and rough-talking. He had a wooden leg which caused him to walk with a little \"hop\", hence the nickname. The character was played by movie actor [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] starting in 1935. The Cassidy character in films was adapted from Mulford's books and  transformed into a clean-cut, [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]]-drinking hero. Sixty-six popular films appeared, only a few of which were loosely based on Mulford's stories.\n\n==Film history==\n{{see also|List of Hopalong Cassidy films}}\n[[File:Poster - Eagle's Brood, The 01.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1935 Hopalong Cassidy film ''[[The Eagle's Brood]]'']]\nAs portrayed on the screen, white-haired Bill \"Hopalong\" Cassidy was usually clad strikingly in black (including his hat, an exception to the Western film stereotype that only villains wore black hats). He was reserved and well spoken, with a sense of fair play. He was often called upon to intercede when dishonest characters took advantage of honest citizens. \"Hoppy\" and his white horse, Topper, usually traveled through the West with two companions&mdash;one young and trouble-prone with a weakness for damsels in distress, the other older, comically awkward and outspoken.<ref>[http://www.b-westerns.com/hoppy1.htm \"William Boyd & Hopalong Cassidy\"], B-Westerns</ref>\n\nThe juvenile lead was successively played by [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]], [[Russell Hayden]], [[George Reeves]], [[Rand Brooks]], and Jimmy Rogers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> [[George \"Gabby\" Hayes|George Hayes]] (later to become known as \"Gabby\" Hayes) originally played Cassidy's grizzled sidekick, Windy Halliday. After Hayes left the series because of a salary dispute with producer Harry Sherman, he was replaced by the comedian Britt Wood as Speedy McGinnis and finally by the veteran movie comedian [[Andy Clyde]] as California Carlson. Clyde, the most durable of the sidekicks, remained with the series until it ended. A few actors of future prominence appeared in Cassidy films, notably [[Robert Mitchum]], who appeared in seven films at the beginning of his career.\n\nThe 66 Hopalong Cassidy pictures were filmed by independent producers who released the films through the studios. The first \"Hoppies\", as the films were known, were distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] to favorable returns, and United Artists was the distributor after Paramount. They were noted for fast action and outdoor photography (usually by [[Russell Harlan]]). [[Harry Sherman]] wanted to make more ambitious movies and tried to cancel the Cassidy series, but popular demand forced Sherman back into production, this time for [[United Artists]]. Sherman gave up the series in 1944, but William Boyd wanted to keep it going. To do this, he gambled his future on Hopalong Cassidy, mortgaging most of what he owned to buy the character rights from Mulford and the backlog of movies from Sherman.\n\nIn the first film, Hopalong Cassidy (then spelled \"Hop-along\") got his name after being shot in the leg. Hopalong's \"drink of choice\" was the nonalcoholic [[sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]].\n\n==Television and radio==\n[[File:Hopalong Cassidy (TV series).png|thumb|Title card for Hopalong Cassidy (TV series), 1949]]\nBoyd resumed production<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> in 1946, on lower budgets, and continued through 1948, when \"B\" westerns were being phased out. Boyd thought Hopalong Cassidy might have a future in television, spent $350,000 to obtain the rights to his old films,<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> and approached the fledgling [[NBC]] network. The initial broadcasts were so successful that NBC could not wait for a television series to be produced and edited the feature films to broadcast length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629201827/http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2012|title=TV ACRES: Broadcast Firsts > Western Series|publisher=Tvacres.com|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> On June 24, 1949, ''Hopalong Cassidy'' became the first network [[westerns on television|Western television series]].\n\nThe success of the television series made Boyd a star.<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> The [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] began broadcasting [[Hopalong Cassidy (radio program)|a radio version]], with [[Andy Clyde]] (later George MacMichael on [[Walter Brennan]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Real McCoys]]'') as the sidekick (except for episodes 28 to 53 of the 105 episode series, when, for reasons unknown, he was replaced by several different radio actors), in January 1950. At the end of September, the show moved to [[CBS Radio]], where it ran until 1952.<ref>[http://www.audio-classics.com/lhopalongcassidy.html Radio Broadcast Log Of: Hopalong Cassidy] part of ''Audio Classics Archive''. Retrieved 2006-12-09.</ref>\n\nThe series and character were so popular that Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the cover of national magazines such as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]], [[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> Boyd earned millions as Hopalong ($800,000 in 1950 alone),<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> mostly from merchandise licensing and endorsement deals. In 1950, Hopalong Cassidy was featured on the first [[lunchbox]] to bear an image, causing sales of Aladdin Industries lunch boxes to jump from 50,000 units to 600,000 units per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hopalong Cassidy|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/hopalong-cassidy|website=Archive of American Television|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> In 1950, more than 100 companies manufactured $70 million of Hopalong Cassidy products,<ref name=\"kiddies\">\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813849,00.html?internalid=ACA Kiddies in the Old Corral]\" ''Time'', 27 November 1950.</ref> including children's dinnerware, pillows, roller skates, soap, wristwatches (made by Timex), and jackknives.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/westerns/westerns.htm Westerns] \u2013 Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>\n\nThere was a new demand for Hopalong Cassidy features in movie theaters, and Boyd licensed reissue distributor Film Classics to make new film prints and advertising accessories. Another 1950 enterprise saw the home-movie company [[Castle Films]] manufacturing condensed versions of the Paramount films for [[16&nbsp;mm]] and [[8&nbsp;mm film]] projectors; they were sold through 1966.

Mulford]], who wrote a series of [[short stories]] and novels based on the character.\n\n==Origin==\nIn his early writings, Mulford portrayed the character as rude, dangerous, and rough-talking. He had a wooden leg which caused him to walk with a little \"hop\", hence the nickname. The character was played by movie actor [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] starting in 1935. The Cassidy character in films was adapted from Mulford's books and  transformed into a clean-cut, [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]]-drinking hero. Sixty-six popular films appeared, only a few of which were loosely based on Mulford's stories.\n\n==Film history==\n{{see also|List of Hopalong Cassidy films}}\n[[File:Poster - Eagle's Brood, The 01.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1935 Hopalong Cassidy film ''[[The Eagle's Brood]]'']]\nAs portrayed on the screen, white-haired Bill \"Hopalong\" Cassidy was usually clad strikingly in black (including his hat, an exception to the Western film stereotype that only villains wore black hats). He was reserved and well spoken, with a sense of fair play. He was often called upon to intercede when dishonest characters took advantage of honest citizens. \"Hoppy\" and his white horse, Topper, usually traveled through the West with two companions&mdash;one young and trouble-prone with a weakness for damsels in distress, the other older, comically awkward and outspoken.<ref>[http://www.b-westerns.com/hoppy1.htm \"William Boyd & Hopalong Cassidy\"], B-Westerns</ref>\n\nThe juvenile lead was successively played by [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]], [[Russell Hayden]], [[George Reeves]], [[Rand Brooks]], and Jimmy Rogers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> [[George \"Gabby\" Hayes|George Hayes]] (later to become known as \"Gabby\" Hayes) originally played Cassidy's grizzled sidekick, Windy Halliday. After Hayes left the series because of a salary dispute with producer Harry Sherman, he was replaced by the comedian Britt Wood as Speedy McGinnis and finally by the veteran movie comedian [[Andy Clyde]] as California Carlson. Clyde, the most durable of the sidekicks, remained with the series until it ended. A few actors of future prominence appeared in Cassidy films, notably [[Robert Mitchum]], who appeared in seven films at the beginning of his career.\n\nThe 66 Hopalong Cassidy pictures were filmed by independent producers who released the films through the studios. The first \"Hoppies\", as the films were known, were distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] to favorable returns, and United Artists was the distributor after Paramount. They were noted for fast action and outdoor photography (usually by [[Russell Harlan]]). [[Harry Sherman]] wanted to make more ambitious movies and tried to cancel the Cassidy series, but popular demand forced Sherman back into production, this time for [[United Artists]]. Sherman gave up the series in 1944, but William Boyd wanted to keep it going. To do this, he gambled his future on Hopalong Cassidy, mortgaging most of what he owned to buy the character rights from Mulford and the backlog of movies from Sherman.\n\nIn the first film, Hopalong Cassidy (then spelled \"Hop-along\") got his name after being shot in the leg. Hopalong's \"drink of choice\" was the nonalcoholic [[sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]].\n\n==Television and radio==\n[[File:Hopalong Cassidy (TV series).png|thumb|Title card for Hopalong Cassidy (TV series), 1949]]\nBoyd resumed production<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> in 1946, on lower budgets, and continued through 1948, when \"B\" westerns were being phased out. Boyd thought Hopalong Cassidy might have a future in television, spent $350,000 to obtain the rights to his old films,<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> and approached the fledgling [[NBC]] network. The initial broadcasts were so successful that NBC could not wait for a television series to be produced and edited the feature films to broadcast length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629201827/http://www.tvacres.com/broad_western.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2012|title=TV ACRES: Broadcast Firsts > Western Series|publisher=Tvacres.com|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> On June 24, 1949, ''Hopalong Cassidy'' became the first network [[westerns on television|Western television series]].\n\nThe success of the television series made Boyd a star.<ref name=\"kiddies\"/> The [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] began broadcasting [[Hopalong Cassidy (radio program)|a radio version]], with [[Andy Clyde]] (later George MacMichael on [[Walter Brennan]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Real McCoys]]'') as the sidekick (except for episodes 28 to 53 of the 105 episode series, when, for reasons unknown, he was replaced by several different radio actors), in January 1950. At the end of September, the show moved to [[CBS Radio]], where it ran until 1952.<ref>[http://www.audio-classics.com/lhopalongcassidy.html Radio Broadcast Log Of: Hopalong Cassidy] part of ''Audio Classics Archive''.

Originally a major boys' [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], it is now co-educational, enrolling pupils at 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board.\n\n== History ==\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed but re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. It was designed by former pupil [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'' this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold-War austerity.

Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield. The [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] Theatre functions as a modern auditorium with a fully equipped stage and back-stage. In 1997 the college chapel [[Pipe organ|organ]] was re-built by [[Klais Orgelbau|Klais]].\n\n==Sport==\nHaileybury is traditionally strong in [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] and retains honours boards with every rugby and cricket first team since 1863. Sports for girls include hockey, netball, lacrosse, tennis and cricket, with newly developed teams in football and rugby union. In addition to rugby and cricket, boys play hockey, football and tennis. Boys and girls represent the school in athletics, squash, swimming, [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]], cross country, badminton, biathlon, basketball, rowing and sailing.\n\n==Related schools==\n=== Haileybury Almaty ===\n{{main|Haileybury Almaty}}\nIn 2006/2007, Haileybury advised on the building of a Haileybury in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] where all English GCSEs are taught and the curriculum is taught similarly under the guidance of Haileybury.

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame  Stanley's \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/7 7]}}</ref> Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is [[miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to a famous baseball player. He is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility which is ironically located in the middle of a desert; the lake dried up decades ago. The inmates are assigned to dig one hole each day, five feet wide and five feet deep, which the Warden claims \"builds their character\". The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines.\n\n=== Elya Yelnats ===\nStanley's [[Latvia]]n great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, falls in love with a fifteen-year-old girl named Myra. However, her father would rather she married the much older pig farmer Igor, who can offer him his fattest pig. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner, she gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry it up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed.\n\nElya follows her directions\u2014-except the direction to do the routine for a final time on Myra\u2019s birthday\u2014-and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor\u2019s. After realizing Myra does not care whether she marries him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and instead moves to America. He forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love and marries, he becomes beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants.\nHe\u2019s Stanley\u2019s no great great pig stealing grandfather\n\n=== Kissin' Kate  ===\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \"rescued\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again.\n\nThree days later, Katherine kills the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], in revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \"Kissin' Kate Barlow\". Among her victims are Stanley's great-grandfather. He was left abandoned in the desert, but survived. Later on, she is tracked down by a now-destitute Charles Walker and his wife. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a venomous lizard and dies. She taunts them with her last words: \"Start digging!\"\n\n=== Camp Green Lake ===\nThe Warden allows the inmates the rest of their day off if they find anything \"interesting\". Stanley begins to suspect the Warden is looking for something. During one dig, he finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes. He gives it to X-Ray, the ringleader of his group, who pretends to find it the next day. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to enlarge X-Ray's hole. Stanley befriends Zero, a [[street child]] and a descendant of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches Zero to read in return for Zero digging part of Stanley's holes. This leads to an argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their record of him and let him die in the desert.\n\nA few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \"Sploosh\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]] sign, and recalls his grandfather claimed to find \"refuge on God\u2019s thumb\". They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero.\n\nThey return to camp and dig in the hole Stanley found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Zero (it is implied onions deter them). The Warden is revealed to be Walker's granddaughter. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Zero reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Zero if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Zero can come along. The attorney asks for Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Zero is also released.\n\nThe suitcase contains financial documents that are worth not much less than a million dollars. Stanley's family buy a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions and named \"Sploosh\" by Zero{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.\n*'''Mrs. Yelnats''': Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.\n*'''Barf Bag (Louis)''': An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.\n\n==Setting==\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/n10 1]}}</ref> The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Fairy tales ===\nThe themes typical of a folk or [[fairy tale]] are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Elizabeth G.|date=2001|title=Holes: Folklore Redux|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v28n2/mascia.html|journal=The ALAN Review|volume=28| issue =  2|pages=51|via=|doi=10.21061/alan.v28i2.a.11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pinsent|first=Pat|date=2002-09-01|title=Fate and Fortune in a Modern Fairy Tale: Louis Sachar's Holes|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1023/A:1019682032315|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse.

Each of these elements in ''Holes'' mirror elements frequently found in fairy tales.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Names ===\nThroughout the novel, [[name]]s act as a theme that allows the characters to [[Dissociation (psychology)|disassociate]] their lives at Camp Green Lake from their lives back in the real world. Names also demonstrate [[irony]]\u2014Camp Green Lake is not actually a camp, it's located in a desert, and there is no lake. The \"campers\" all label themselves differently and identify with names such as Armpit and X-Ray and the guards are referred to as counselors.

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame  Stanley's \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/7 7]}}</ref> Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is [[miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to a famous baseball player. He is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility which is ironically located in the middle of a desert; the lake dried up decades ago. The inmates are assigned to dig one hole each day, five feet wide and five feet deep, which the Warden claims \"builds their character\". The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines.\n\n=== Elya Yelnats ===\nStanley's [[Latvia]]n great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, falls in love with a fifteen-year-old girl named Myra. However, her father would rather she married the much older pig farmer Igor, who can offer him his fattest pig. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner, she gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry it up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed.\n\nElya follows her directions\u2014-except the direction to do the routine for a final time on Myra\u2019s birthday\u2014-and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor\u2019s. After realizing Myra does not care whether she marries him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and instead moves to America. He forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love and marries, he becomes beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants.\n\n=== Kissin' Kate  ===\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \"rescued\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again.\n\nThree days later, Katherine kills the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], in revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \"Kissin' Kate Barlow\". Among her victims are Stanley's great-grandfather. He was left abandoned in the desert, but survived. Later on, she is tracked down by a now-destitute Charles Walker and his wife. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a venomous lizard and dies. She taunts them with her last words: \"Start digging!\"\n\n=== Camp Green Lake ===\nThe Warden allows the inmates the rest of their day off if they find anything \"interesting\". Stanley begins to suspect the Warden is looking for something. During one dig, he finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes. He gives it to X-Ray, the ringleader of his group, who pretends to find it the next day. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to enlarge X-Ray's hole. Stanley befriends Zero, a [[street child]] and a descendant of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches Zero to read in return for Zero digging part of Stanley's holes. This leads to an argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their record of him and let him die in the desert.\n\nA few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \"Sploosh\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]] sign, and recalls his grandfather claimed to find \"refuge on God\u2019s thumb\". They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero.\n\nThey return to camp and dig in the hole Stanley found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Zero (it is implied onions deter them). The Warden is revealed to be Walker's granddaughter. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Zero reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Zero if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Zero can come along. The attorney asks for Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Zero is also released.\n\nThe suitcase contains financial documents that are worth not much less than a million dollars. Stanley's family buy a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions and named \"Sploosh\" by Zero{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad.

The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Fairy tales ===\nThe themes typical of a folk or [[fairy tale]] are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Elizabeth G.|date=2001|title=Holes: Folklore Redux|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v28n2/mascia.html|journal=The ALAN Review|volume=28| issue =  2|pages=51|via=|doi=10.21061/alan.v28i2.a.11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pinsent|first=Pat|date=2002-09-01|title=Fate and Fortune in a Modern Fairy Tale: Louis Sachar's Holes|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1023/A:1019682032315|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse. Stanley's bad luck is blamed on the curse left on his great-great-grandfather and the Yelnats family easily believes in the power of this curse.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both Stanley and Elya are similar to fairy tale characters and are morally good, heroic protagonists who must overcome the challenges predestined for them.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both story lines are accompanied by a magic that is seen in the mountain stream, Madame Zeroni's song, and the healing power of the onions.
