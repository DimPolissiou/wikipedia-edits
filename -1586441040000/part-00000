Results of the campaign were published on 3 November 2017.<ref name=\"Radar news\"/>\n\nThe asteroid remained too faint to be recovered with automated [[astronomical survey]]s until early September,<ref name=possible/> but a more targeted observation with the [[Very Large Telescope]] recovered it on 27 July 2017 at [[apparent magnitude]] 26.8, while the asteroid was {{convert|0.4|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth, making it one of the dimmest asteroid recoveries ever. As such, {{mp|2012 TC|4}} has become the first known asteroid ever to be observed passing less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar distance]] from Earth twice in a row.<ref name=MPEC2017-P26/> At the time of recovery the asteroid was about 100 million times fainter than what can be seen with the [[naked eye]]<ref>[[Apparent magnitude#Calculations|Math]]: <math>(\\sqrt[5]{100})^{26.8-6.5}\\approx 131800000</math></ref> and 500 times fainter than when it was discovered in 2012. As a result of the 2017 recovery observations, it was known that on 12 October 2017 at 5:42 UT, the asteroid would pass {{convert|0.0003352|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth.<ref name=\"jpldata-CAD\" /> Then at 19:19 UT, the asteroid would pass {{convert|0.001856|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the Moon.<ref name=\"jpldata-CAD\" /> {{mp|2012 TC|4}} peaked at about apparent magnitude 12.9,<ref name=\"NEODyS20171012\" /> and was too faint to be seen without a telescope. The Earth approach of 2017 increased the asteroid's orbital period from 1.67 years to 2.06 years.<ref name=umd/>\n\n{{mp|2012 TC|4}} reached a maximum apparent magnitude of 12.9 just prior to its closest approach, soon after which it came too close to the Sun to be seen with telescopes.<ref name=\"NEODyS20171012\" /> It was last seen from [[Mauna Kea Observatories]] on 21 October 2017 at an apparent magnitude of 24,<ref name=\"MPC-object\"/> when the asteroid was 57\u00b0 from the Sun.<ref name=NEODyS/>\n\n== Physical properties ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:2012 TC4 size reference.png|500px]]<br />size reference of {{mp|2012 TC|4}}, based on radar observations.\n|}\n\n=== Fast rotator and tumbler ===\nStudies of the asteroid's [[light curve]] in October 2012, found it to have a [[rotation period]] of 0.2038 hours (or 12 minutes and 14 seconds) with a brightness variation of 0.93 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3-]]}}), which is indicative for a non-spherical shape.<ref name=\"lcdb\" />{{efn|name=lightcurve-plot}} {{mp|2012 TC|4}} is a [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], which is rather typical for its small size.

It is located on the River [[Emmer River|Emmer]], about 10&nbsp;km west of the [[Weser]]. Bad Pyrmont is a popular [[destination spa|spa]] resort that gained its reputation as a fashionable place for princely vacations in the 17th and 18th centuries. The town is also the center of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) in Germany.\n\n==History==\nFormerly called '''Pyrmont''', it was the seat of a small county during much of the Middle Ages. The county gained its independence from the [[County of Schwalenberg]] in 1194. Independence was maintained until the extinction of the comital line in 1494, when the county was inherited by the [[County of Spiegelberg]]. In 1557, the county was inherited by [[County of Lippe|Lippe]], then by the [[County of Gleichen]] in 1583.\n\nIn 1625, the county became part of the much larger County of [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck]] through inheritance. In 1668, the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' ruled against the [[Bishopric of Paderborn]]'s claims that Pyrmont had been [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] in a loan, confirming the Count of Waldeck's rights over Pyrmont, who ceded the ''Amt'' of [[L\u00fcgde]] \u2014 previously the county's capital \u2014 to the bishopric in compensation. In January 1712, the Count of Waldeck and Pyrmont was elevated to hereditary prince by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], the count having combined the two titles the previous year.\n\nFor a brief period, from 1805 to 1812, Pyrmont was again a separate principality as a result of inheritance and partition after the death of the previous prince, but the two parts were united again in 1812. The principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont retained its status after the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 and became a member of the [[German Confederation]]. In 1813, the inhabitants of Pyrmont began to protest at their lack of autonomy within Waldeck\u2013Pyrmont and the separate constitutional nature of the two territories was confirmed the following year, until a formal union was established in 1849.\n\nFrom 1868 onward, the principality was administered by Prussia, but retained its legislative sovereignty. Prussian administration served to reduce administrative costs for the small state and was based on a ten-year contract that was repeatedly renewed. In 1871 it became a constituent state of the new [[German Empire]]. At the end of [[World War I]], during the [[German Revolution]] the prince abdicated and Waldeck\u2013Pyrmont became a [[free state (government)|free state]] within the [[Weimar Republic]]. On 30 November 1921, following a local plebiscite, the town and district of Pyrmont were detached and incorporated into the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]], with Waldeck following into the Prussian [[province of Hesse-Nassau]] in 1929.\n\n==Economy==\nAs a spa town, Bad Pyrmont's economy is heavily geared towards tourism.\n\nBad Pyrmonter mineral water is bottled in Bad Pyrmont.\n\n==Attractions==\nBad Pyrmont features a large ''Kurpark'', with a sizeable outdoor [[palm tree|palm]] garden.  The [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] castle (1706\u201310) is part of a substantial complex of fortifications dating from the 16th century. The castle now houses the Museum of Municipal and Spa History. Unique in Europe is the ''vapor cave'', where therapeutic [[carbon dioxide]] vapors emerge from the earth.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Sons and daughters of the town==\n* [[Ferdinand

At eighteen, Casiopea works as a servant for her grandfather, dreaming of escape.\n\nIn a forbidden chest in her grandfather\u2019s bedroom, she discovers the bones of the Mayan death god Hun-Kam\u00e9, one of the [[Maya Hero Twins]]. A shard of bone pierces her thumb, restoring Hun-Kam\u00e9 to a semblance of life. Bound to Casiopea, the god enlists her in his quest to regain his missing body parts, which his twin brother and rival Vucub-Kam\u00e9 has scattered throughout Mexico and left in the keeping of sorcerers, demons, and other supernatural entities. Once he is whole, he hopes to retake rulership of [[Xibalba]], the Mayan underworld, from which he has been deposed by his brother. \n\nTheir journey takes them throughout Mexico, from Yucat\u00e1n to [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico City]], [[El Paso]], and [[Baja California]]. Their parasitic relationship powers their quest, as Casiopea sacrifices more and more of her vitality to Hun-Kam\u00e9 , and he in turn takes on more and more of the attributes of mortality. Throughout, they must deal with the machinations of the god\u2019s brother and his inhuman and human allies, particularly Casiopea\u2019s cousin Mart\u00edn, who serves Vucub-Kam\u00e9 much as she does Hun-Kam\u00e9.\n\nThe root of the gods\u2019 rivalry lies in Vucub-Kam\u00e9\u2019s lust to restore the bloody sacrifices and glories of Mayan and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] times, which Hun-Kam\u00e9 is content to leave in the past. Their rivalry ends with both their mortal proxies consigned to Xibalba for a deceptively simple contest; walking the Black Road to the Jade Palace, with the lives of the twin death gods and the fate of the world as the stakes. The one who reaches the palace first wins, but to stray from the road means suffering ''k\u2019up kaal'', the ritual beheading to slake the blood-thirst of the underworld pantheon.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a starred review, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' states the author \"crafts a magical novel of duality, tradition, and change ...

Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, love of coffee and lasagne, disdain of Mondays and diets. Garfield is also shown to manipulate people to get whatever he wants. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring minor characters appearing as well.

In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.\n\nPart of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of [[social commentary|social]] or [[political commentary#Political cartoons|political]] commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his \"grasp of politics isn't strong\", joking that, for many years, he thought \"[[OPEC]] was a [[dental bonding|denture adhesive]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283648,00.html|title=Tales of the Kitty|first=Beth|last=Johnson|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=August 4, 2008|date=June 19, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/11/5/movies/12462084&sec=movies|title=Everybody loves Garfield|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|access-date=August 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn August 6, 2019, New York City-based [[ViacomCBS]] announced that it would acquire [[Paws, Inc.]], including the rights to the ''Garfield'' franchise (the comics, merchandise and animated cartoons).

Ryan's ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]'', Jim Davis created the comic strip ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', which ran only in the ''Pendleton Times'' of [[Pendleton, Indiana]] from 1972 to 1975 and met with little success. One editor famously said \"[Davis'] art was good, his gags were great, [but] nobody can identify with bugs.\"<ref name=\"Twenty\"/>\n\nDavis decided to take a long, hard look at current comic strips to determine what species of animal star characters might be more popular. He felt that dogs were doing well, but noticed no prominent cats. Davis figured he could create a cat star, having grown up on a farm with twenty-five cats. Thus was created the character of Garfield.<ref name=\"Twenty\">Davis. ''20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. p. 14.</ref>\n\nGarfield, the star, was based on the cats Davis grew up around; he took his name and personality from Davis' grandfather, James A.

He is known for saying \"breathing is exercise\".\n\nThough Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and in one Christmas he says, \"they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end.\"\nHowever, in the feature film ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\n\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904152923/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 4, 2014|title=Garfield|date=August 15, 2009|publisher=Gocomics.com|access-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> However, in the feature film [[Garfield Gets Real]] and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans.

The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (June 19, 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics|title=Garfield Comics|date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Jon Arbuckle===\n'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Here's my sixth-grade report card.

Arbuckle)]] is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy [[geek]] who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested\", attitude, and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808190758/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2005|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210333/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that \"two hundred moths committed suicide\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2002/ga020110.gif|title=Garfield|date=January 10, 2002|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> in another, the \"geek police\" ordered Jon to \"throw out his tie\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890811.gif|title=Garfield|date=August 11, 1989|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with \"[[polka]] [[ninja]]s\". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a [[pop-up book]] in one strip).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1990/ga900324.gif|title=Garfield|date=March 24, 1990|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nJon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks, \"Woo-ha! Ain't science something?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga841127.gif|title=Garfield|date=November 27, 1984|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was portrayed as a [[cartoonist]] in the first strip<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1978/06/19|title=Garfield by Jim Davis for June 19, 1978 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Davis|first=Jim|date=1978-06-19|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> and occasional others in the early years; Davis stated his intent had been to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist. Ultimately, Jon's job has been referenced far more frequently in Garfield animated series than in the strip.\n\n===Odie===\n'''First appearance: August 8, 1978'''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|work=Garfield.com|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780808.gif|date=August 8, 1978|access-date=August 7, 2006}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' I think I'm having some kind of identity crisis.\n\n''Garfield, walking past Odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer:'' He thinks '''he's''' having an identity crisis ...

He was originally owned by Jon's friend [[List of characters in Garfield#Lyman|Lyman]], though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book ''Garfield: His 9 Lives'' (1984) [[retcons]] Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as na\u00efve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading ''[[War and Peace]]'' and watching ''An Evening With Mozart'' on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890427.gif|title=Garfield|date=April 27, 1989|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's [[sudoku]] puzzle.\n\n===Dr. Liz Wilson===\n'''First appearance: June 26, 1979'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before? A rice paddy in Hong Kong?\n\n''Liz:'' Look, jerk. I'll be the vet for your cat, but I won't play [[fall guy]] for your stupid lines. Understood?\n\n''Jon, shocked:'' Uh-huh.

She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss, and have been a couple ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|title=Garfield's Comic Strip Archives at Garfield.com \u2013 The Official Web Site of Garfield & Friends|publisher=Garfield.com|date=|access-date=2012-09-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072545/http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|archive-date=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring subjects and themes==\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to [[Abu Dhabi]], or simply throwing him ''through'' the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of [[raisin]]s and [[spinach]]), Garfield is particularly fond of [[lasagna]]; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960614.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 14, 1996|access-date=August 5, 2008}}</ref> When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\n\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his [[tractor]] (which he [[double parking|double-parked]]) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.<ref name=\"The Garfield Vault Strip\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2007/ga070819.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=August 19, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> Frequently, the characters break the [[fourth wall]], mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1992/ga920125.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=January 25, 1992|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting that his thoughts are stuffed up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga781127.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=November 27, 1978|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref>\n\n===Short storylines===\nOne particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\n\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).\n\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's Believe it, or DON'T|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+Believe+it%2C+or+DON%27T%21|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712032111/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+Believe+it,+or+DON'T!|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Davis (cartoonist)|date=January 20, 1986}}</ref> \"Garfield's Law\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's law|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+law|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710084143/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+law|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=November 8, 1982}}</ref> \"Garfield's History of Dogs\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield Comic Strips September 1980|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708094750/http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=September 1, 1980}}</ref> and \"Garfield's History of Cats\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's history of cats garfield.nfshost.com :: search garfield|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+history+of+cats|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709072827/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+history+of+cats|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|date=August 6, 1979}}</ref> which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is \"National Fat Week\", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and \"kicking Odie into next week\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840629.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 29, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> Soon, Garfield realizes that \"Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food\" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840630.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 30, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a \"nagging feeling I'm forgetting something\", with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840702.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=July 2, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\n\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\n\n[[File:Garfield 1989-10-27 right panel.png|frame|Right panel of October 27, 1989 strip.]]\n\nOne storyline, which ran the week before [[Halloween]] in 1989, is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-not-just-you-garfield-is-not-meant-to-be-funny-6199556/|title=It's Not Just You: Garfield Is Not Meant to Be Funny|date=20 March 2013|access-date=29 April 2018|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine|last=Eveleth|first=Rose}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}</ref> It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's ''Twentieth Anniversary Collection'', in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n\n{{quote|During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'}}\n\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off \u2013 and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, [[monkey]]s, a [[Pinniped|seal]], a snake, a [[kangaroo]] and [[joey (marsupial)|joey]], and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\n\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (December 3\u201323, 1984). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special ''[[Garfield on the Town]]''.\n\n===Paws, Inc.===\nPaws, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020045311/http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 20, 2004|title=Running Paws, Inc. \u2013 The Evolution of Dog Walking Reaches 100th Client \u2013 Business News from Send2Press Newswire 10/12/04|publisher=Send2press.com|date=2004-10-12|access-date=2010-01-10|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was founded in 1981 by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing.

Ryan's ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]'', Jim Davis created the comic strip ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', which ran only in the ''Pendleton Times'' of [[Pendleton, Indiana]] from 1972 to 1975 and met with little success. One editor famously said \"[Davis'] art was good, his gags were great, [but] nobody can identify with bugs.\"<ref name=\"Twenty\"/>\n\nDavis decided to take a long, hard look at current comic strips to determine what species of animal star characters might be more popular. He felt that dogs were doing well, but noticed no prominent cats. Davis figured he could create a cat star, having grown up on a farm with twenty-five cats. Thus was created the character of Garfield.<ref name=\"Twenty\">Davis. ''20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. p. 14.</ref>\n\nGarfield, the star, was based on the cats Davis grew up around; he took his name and personality from Davis' grandfather, James A.

He is known for saying \"breathing is exercise\".\n\nThough Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and in one Christmas he says, \"they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end.\"\nHowever, in the feature film ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\n\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904152923/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 4, 2014|title=Garfield|date=August 15, 2009|publisher=Gocomics.com|access-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> However, in the feature film [[Garfield Gets Real]] and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans.

The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (June 19, 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics|title=Garfield Comics|date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Jon Arbuckle===\n'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Here's my sixth-grade report card.

Arbuckle)]] is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy [[geek]] who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested\", attitude, and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808190758/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2005|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210333/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats.

He was originally owned by Jon's friend [[List of characters in Garfield#Lyman|Lyman]], though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book ''Garfield: His 9 Lives'' (1984) [[retcons]] Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as na\u00efve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading ''[[War and Peace]]'' and watching ''An Evening With Mozart'' on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890427.gif|title=Garfield|date=April 27, 1989|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Odie has only talked once.

She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss, and have been a couple ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|title=Garfield's Comic Strip Archives at Garfield.com \u2013 The Official Web Site of Garfield & Friends|publisher=Garfield.com|date=|access-date=2012-09-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072545/http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|archive-date=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring subjects and themes==\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to [[Abu Dhabi]], or simply throwing him ''through'' the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of [[raisin]]s and [[spinach]]), Garfield is particularly fond of [[lasagna]]; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960614.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 14, 1996|access-date=August 5, 2008}}</ref> When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\n\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his [[tractor]] (which he [[double parking|double-parked]]) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.<ref name=\"The Garfield Vault Strip\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2007/ga070819.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=August 19, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> Frequently, the characters break the [[fourth wall]], mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1992/ga920125.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=January 25, 1992|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting that his thoughts are stuffed up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga781127.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=November 27, 1978|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref>\n\n===Short storylines===\nOne particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\n\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).\n\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's Believe it, or DON'T|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+Believe+it%2C+or+DON%27T%21|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712032111/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+Believe+it,+or+DON'T!|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Davis (cartoonist)|date=January 20, 1986}}</ref> \"Garfield's Law\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's law|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+law|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710084143/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+law|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=November 8, 1982}}</ref> \"Garfield's History of Dogs\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield Comic Strips September 1980|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708094750/http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=September 1, 1980}}</ref> and \"Garfield's History of Cats\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's history of cats garfield.nfshost.com :: search garfield|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+history+of+cats|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709072827/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+history+of+cats|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|date=August 6, 1979}}</ref> which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is \"National Fat Week\", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and \"kicking Odie into next week\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840629.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 29, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> Soon, Garfield realizes that \"Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food\" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840630.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 30, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a \"nagging feeling I'm forgetting something\", with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840702.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=July 2, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\n\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\n\n[[File:Garfield 1989-10-27 right panel.png|frame|Right panel of October 27, 1989 strip.]]\n\nOne storyline, which ran the week before [[Halloween]] in 1989, is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-not-just-you-garfield-is-not-meant-to-be-funny-6199556/|title=It's Not Just You: Garfield Is Not Meant to Be Funny|date=20 March 2013|access-date=29 April 2018|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine|last=Eveleth|first=Rose}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}</ref> It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's ''Twentieth Anniversary Collection'', in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n\n{{quote|During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'}}\n\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off \u2013 and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, [[monkey]]s, a [[Pinniped|seal]], a snake, a [[kangaroo]] and [[joey (marsupial)|joey]], and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\n\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (December 3\u201323, 1984). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special ''[[Garfield on the Town]]''.\n\n===Paws, Inc.===\nPaws, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020045311/http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 20, 2004|title=Running Paws, Inc. \u2013 The Evolution of Dog Walking Reaches 100th Client \u2013 Business News from Send2Press Newswire 10/12/04|publisher=Send2press.com|date=2004-10-12|access-date=2010-01-10|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was founded in 1981 by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing.

In the strip, a spider who is about to be squashed by Garfield boasts that if he is squished, he will get a holiday in his remembrance.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million.

Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely [[sepoy|Indian troops]] and trained them along European lines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerald Bryant |year=1978 |title=Officers of the East India Company's army in the days of Clive and Hastings |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203\u2013227 |doi=10.1080/03086537808582508}}</ref> The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed into a private corporate armed force used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion instead of its original purpose as a guard force. Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The growth of tensions between the EIC and the local religious and cultural groups grew in the 19th century as the Protestant revival grew in Great Britain.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" /> The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] also tried to take a share.<ref>{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P & O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}</ref> A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the [[Hanwell#Healthcare|Royal India Asylum]], at [[Hanwell]], Middlesex.<ref>Farrington 1976, pp. 125\u2013132.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Diane K. |last1=Bolton |first2=Patricia E.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This is still used in Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts today in civil law. Hastings also annexed lands and kingdoms and enriched himself in the process.

Cornwallis distrusted Indians and replaced Indians with Englishmen. He introduced a system of personal land ownership for Indians.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships.

The battles of [[Battle of Plassey|Plassey]] and [[Battle of Buxar|Buxar]], in which the British defeated the Bengali powers, left the company in control of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] with the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}</ref> and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the extent of the territories under its control, controlling the majority of the Indian subcontinent either directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force by its [[Presidency armies]], much of which were composed of native Indian [[sepoy]]s.\n\nBy 1803, at the height of its rule in India, the British East India company had a private army of about 260,000\u2014twice the size of the [[British Army]], with Indian revenues of \u00a313,464,561 (equivalent to \u00a3{{Inflation|US|13.464561|1803|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) and expenses of \u00a314,017,473 (equivalent to \u00a3{{Inflation|US|14.017473|1803|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|UK}}).<ref name=\"eic\">{{cite news|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|title=The East India Company: The original corporate raiders|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders|accessdate=2017-06-08|work=The Guardian|date=4 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/workingPapers/economicHistory/home.aspx|title=The finances of the East India Company in India, c. 1766-1859|first=John F.|last=Richards|date=19 August 2011|website=www2.lse.ac.uk}}</ref> The company eventually came to rule large areas of India with [[Presidency armies|its private armies]], exercising military power and seizing administrative functions.<ref>This is the argument of Robins (2006).</ref> [[Company rule in India]] effectively began in 1757 and lasted until 1858, when, following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the [[Government of India Act 1858]] led to the [[British Crown]]'s assuming direct control of the Indian subcontinent in the form of the new [[British Raj]].\n\nThe company\u2019s army played a notorious role in the unsuccessful Indian Uprising (also called the Indian Mutiny) of 1857\u201358, in which Indian soldiers in the company\u2019s employ led an armed revolt against their British officers that quickly gained popular support as a war for Indian independence<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/story/5-fast-facts-about-the-east-india-company|title=5 Fast Facts About the East India Company|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da \u00cdndia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] - Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&nbsp;ships.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed ''Interlopers'' by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.<ref name=\"victorianweb.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://victorianweb.org/history/empire/india/eic.html|title=The British East India Company \u2014 the Company that Owned a Nation (or Two)|website=victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years.

The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new ''United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies'' being awarded by the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t0TAAAAQAAJ|title=Charters Relating to the East India Company from 1600 to 1761: Reprinted from a Former Collection with Some Additions and a Preface for the Government of Madras|last=Company|first=East India|last2=Shaw|first2=John|date=1887|publisher=R.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" /> The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] also tried to take a share.<ref>{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P & O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}</ref> A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York p. 385.</ref> His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a [[Council of Four from India|Council of Four]] appointed by the Crown.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the [[Hanwell#Healthcare|Royal India Asylum]], at [[Hanwell]], Middlesex.<ref>Farrington 1976, pp. 125\u2013132.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Diane K. |last1=Bolton |first2=Patricia E.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This is still used in Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts today in civil law. Hastings also annexed lands and kingdoms and enriched himself in the process.

Cornwallis distrusted Indians and replaced Indians with Englishmen. He introduced a system of personal land ownership for Indians.

With the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the canton was changed to the new [[Evolution of UK Flag|Union Flag]]\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's cross]]\u2014representing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1800]] that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]].\n\nThere has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''.

{"title_page": "Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority", "text_new": "{{Politics of Palestine}}\nThe '''prime minister of the Palestinian National Authority''' was the position of the official [[head of government]] of the [[Palestinian government#Executive organs|Palestinian Authority government]], which operated between 2003 and January 2013, when it was officially transformed into the [[State of Palestine]]. Some still refer to the position of the prime minister of the Gaza Strip as the prime minister of the [[Palestinian National Authority]].\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office was created in 2003 to manage day-to-day activities of the [[Palestinian Authority|Palestinian]] government, which had previously been performed by [[Yasser Arafat]]. The position was created because both Israel and the United States refused to negotiate directly with Arafat. The executive structure of the government however lay under the [[president of the Palestinian National Authority]].\n\n== History ==\nThe first prime minister of the Palestinian National Authority was [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. He was nominated on 19 March 2003 by President Arafat. On 29 April, the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] approved the appointment and [[Palestinian Authority Government of April 2003|his government]].<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/06/palestinian.pm/ ''Arafat chooses Palestinian prime minister''].

MidEastweb, 29 April 2003</ref> Abbas's short term was marked by a power struggle with Arafat over control of the [[Palestinian Security Services]], with Arafat refusing to relinquish control to Abbas. The issue was critical because the [[Roadmap for peace]] plan required the Palestinian side to stop violent attacks by various Palestinian militant groups, which Arafat refused to do. Abbas resigned as Prime Minister on 6 September 2003, citing lack of support from Israel and the United States as well as \"internal incitement\" against his government.<ref name=ap_060903>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/06/israel1 ''Profile: Mahmoud Abbas''].

CNN. 6 September 2003</ref>\n\nAbbas was followed in the office by [[Ahmed Qurei]], who as Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council became acting prime minister. Arafat nominated Qurei for the post of Prime Minister, who agreed to form an \"emergency government\" on 10 September.<ref>[http://news.sky.com/story/208841/us-warning-as-qurei-accepts-pms-role ''US Warning As Qurei Accepts PM's Role''].

The Fatah dominated PLC refused to a vote of confidence in the government. Arafat and Qurei were in a standoff over the division between them of security powers, essentially the issue of control of the Palestinian Security Services, which was the same issue that led to Abbas's resignation. Another issue was Arafat's opposition to Qurie's nomination of General Nasser Yousef as [[Interior Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Interior Minister]] who would control the security forces.<ref name=chinadaily/> On 4 November, as the term of the emergency government was about to expire, they agreed for Qurei to stay on on a caretaker basis.<ref name=chinadaily>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/05/content_278561.htm ''Palestinian PM misses deadline for new cabinet'']. Agencies/China Daily, 5 November 2003</ref> On 12 November 2003, the caretaker government was replaced by [[Palestinian Authority Government of November 2003|Qurei's 2003 government]], which was confirmed by the PLC. [[Hakam Balawi]], described as an Arafat \u201cloyalist\u201d, was appointed Interior Minister, with control of the security forces. After Arafat's death in November 2004 and Mahmoud Abbas' subsequent victory in the [[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential election in January 2005]], which was boycotted by [[Hamas]], Qurei was asked to continue in his post and form a new government, which took place on 24 February 2005. On 15 December 2005, Qurei resigned, and [[Nabil Shaath]], the Deputy Prime Minister, became Acting Prime Minister. However, Shaath lost that position nine days later when Qurei returned to office.\n\nHamas decisively won the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|PLC election held on 25 January 2006]]. Qurei resigned, but at the request of President Abbas remained as interim prime minister until 19 February 2006. [[Ismail Haniyeh]] of Hamas was nominated Prime Minister on 16 February 2006 and the new government was formally presented to Abbas on 20 February and the [[Palestinian Authority Government of March 2006|government led by Haniyeh]] was sworn in on 29 March 2006. However, the struggle for power between President Abbas and the new government emerged over the [[Palestinian Security Services|security services]]. Abbas made Fatah-affiliated Rashid Abu Shbak head of the three branches of the [[Palestinian Security Services]], with authority to hire and fire officers in the three security branches, bypassing the authority of the Hamas Interior Minister [[Said Seyam]]. Abbas also ordered all diplomatic statements and dealings be coordinated with the Fatah-dominated [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], and not the Hamas Foreign Minister [[Mahmoud Zahar]].<ref name=nyt_myriad_problems>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/world/middleeast/06cnd-hamas.html ''Palestinians' Hamas Leader Faces Myriad of Problems''].

JMCC, 22 July 2007</ref> On 22 July 2007, Prime Minister Fayyad presented his government for PLC approval. As the quorum requirement could not be met, as Hamas members were boycotting the PLC, the approval was given in \u201cextraordinary\u201d session.\n\nMeanwhile, Haniyeh and Hamas refused to accept the dismissal, and claimed to still be the legitimate government of the Palestinian Authority. The basis of the challenge was that under the Basic Law, the president may dismiss a sitting prime minister, but may not appoint a replacement without the approval of the PLC (which was controlled by Hamas), and that until a new prime minister is properly appointed, the outgoing prime minister heads a caretaker government.\n\n==Term==\nThe prime minister is appointed by the [[president of the Palestinian National Authority]] and not directly elected by the Palestinian Legislative Council or Palestinian voters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The president can dismiss the prime minister at any time. However, the Basic Law requires that a new prime minister and his government is presented to the Palestinian Legislative Council for approval or confirmation. In the event of a vacancy in the office, the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council becomes acting prime minister. If an emergency government is formed by presidential decree, it is only valid for thirty days.<ref name=chinadaily/> The president can nominate a caretaker prime minister, pending the formation of a new government.<ref name=chinadaily/> Prime ministers appointed on an acting, caretaker or emergency basis do not need to obtain approval or confirmation of the PLC.\n\nUnlike the prime minister's office in many other nations, the Palestinian prime minister is not required to be a member of the [[legislature]] while in office. Instead, the nomination is made independently by the president, taking into account the political situation at the time. However, following the international sanctions against the government led by [[Hamas]], which is designated a terrorist organisation by several key countries, between 2006 and 2007, President Abbas instead appointed experts as Prime Minister since 2007 who were considered rather independent from party interests by observers.\n\n==List of prime ministers (2003\u20132013)==\n{{See also|Prime Minister of the State of Palestine}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! {{Abbr|No.|Number}}\n!

The position was created because both Israel and the United States refused to negotiate directly with Arafat. The executive structure of the government however lay under the [[president of the Palestinian National Authority]].\n\n== History ==\nThe first prime minister of the Palestinian National Authority was [[Mahmoud Abbas]].

MidEastweb, 29 April 2003</ref> Abbas's short term was marked by a power struggle with Arafat over control of the [[Palestinian Security Services]], with Arafat refusing to relinquish control to Abbas. The issue was critical because the [[Roadmap for peace]] plan required the Palestinian side to stop violent attacks by various Palestinian militant groups, which Arafat refused to do. Abbas resigned as Prime Minister on 6 September 2003, citing lack of support from Israel and the United States as well as \"internal incitement\" against his government.<ref name=ap_060903>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/06/israel1 ''Profile: Mahmoud Abbas''].

The Fatah dominated PLC refused to a vote of confidence in the government. Arafat and Qurei were in a standoff over the division between them of security powers, essentially the issue of control of the Palestinian Security Services, which was the same issue that led to Abbas's resignation. Another issue was Arafat's opposition to Qurie's nomination of General Nasser Yousef as [[Interior Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Interior Minister]] who would control the security forces.<ref name=chinadaily/> On 4 November, as the term of the emergency government was about to expire, they agreed for Qurei to stay on on a caretaker basis.<ref name=chinadaily>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/05/content_278561.htm ''Palestinian PM misses deadline for new cabinet''].

[[Hakam Balawi]], described as an Arafat \u201cloyalist\u201d, was appointed Interior Minister, with control of the security forces. After Arafat's death in November 2004 and Mahmoud Abbas' subsequent victory in the [[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential election in January 2005]], which was boycotted by [[Hamas]], Qurei was asked to continue in his post and form a new government, which took place on 24 February 2005. On 15 December 2005, Qurei resigned, and [[Nabil Shaath]], the Deputy Prime Minister, became Acting Prime Minister. However, Shaath lost that position nine days later when Qurei returned to office.\n\nHamas decisively won the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|PLC election held on 25 January 2006]]. Qurei resigned, but at the request of President Abbas remained as interim prime minister until 19 February 2006. [[Ismail Haniyeh]] of Hamas was nominated Prime Minister on 16 February 2006 and the new government was formally presented to Abbas on 20 February and the [[Palestinian Authority Government of March 2006|government led by Haniyeh]] was sworn in on 29 March 2006. However, the struggle for power between President Abbas and the new government emerged over the [[Palestinian Security Services|security services]]. Abbas made Fatah-affiliated [[Rashid Abu Shbak]] head of the three branches of the [[Palestinian Security Services]], with authority to hire and fire officers in the three security branches, bypassing the authority of the Hamas Interior Minister [[Said Seyam]].

As the quorum requirement could not be met, as Hamas members were boycotting the PLC, the approval was given in \u201cextraordinary\u201d session.\n\nMeanwhile, Haniyeh and Hamas refused to accept the dismissal, and claimed to still be the legitimate government of the Palestinian Authority. The basis of the challenge was that under the Basic Law, the president may dismiss a sitting prime minister, but may not appoint a replacement without the approval of the PLC (which was controlled by Hamas), and that until a new prime minister is properly appointed, the outgoing prime minister heads a caretaker government.\n\n==Term==\nThe prime minister is appointed by the [[president of the Palestinian National Authority]] and not directly elected by the Palestinian Legislative Council or Palestinian voters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The president can dismiss the prime minister at any time. However, the Basic Law requires that a new prime minister and his government is presented to the Palestinian Legislative Council for approval or confirmation. In the event of a vacancy in the office, the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council becomes acting prime minister. If an emergency government is formed by presidential decree, it is only valid for thirty days.<ref name=chinadaily/> The president can nominate a caretaker prime minister, pending the formation of a new government.<ref name=chinadaily/> Prime ministers appointed on an acting, caretaker or emergency basis do not need to obtain approval or confirmation of the PLC.\n\nUnlike the prime minister's office in many other nations, the Palestinian prime minister is not required to be a member of the [[legislature]] while in office. Instead, the nomination is made independently by the president, taking into account the political situation at the time. However, following the international sanctions against the government led by [[Hamas]], which is designated a terrorist organisation by several key countries, between 2006 and 2007, President Abbas instead appointed experts as Prime Minister since 2007 who were considered rather independent from party interests by observers.\n\n==List of prime ministers (2003\u20132013)==\n{{See also|Prime Minister of the State of Palestine}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! {{Abbr|No.|Number}}\n!

Lucas, an art collector and agent for American patrons, was born in Baltimore in 1824 as the seventh son of [[Fielding Lucas Jr.]], who owned a publishing and stationery company. He attended [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point and after graduating in 1845, began working as a civil engineer on railroads in New Jersey. Lucas moved to New York in 1853 and began buying works for his Baltimore friends.<ref name=\"research.frick\">{{cite web |url=http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&-recid=6947 |title=Lucas, George A., 1824-1909 |publisher=[[Frick Collection]] |date=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\nFollowing the death of his father and older brother, Lucas returned to Baltimore in 1856, only to move to Paris a year later. He lived there on an annuity from his father's estate and worked as an agent for art collectors and dealers in the United States such as [[Samuel Putnam Avery]], [[John Taylor Johnston]], Cyrus Lawrence, [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], and [[Henry Field (art collector)|Henry Field]].  He is perhaps most recognized for helping to build the collection of [[William Thompson Walters]], for whom he purchased pieces by [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]], [[L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Antoine-Louis Barye]], [[Th\u00e9odore Rousseau]], and [[Paul Delaroche]].   Lucas' responsibilities as an art dealer for these American business men also included overseeing commissions on their behalf, shipping out food packages, acting as a Parisian tour guide, and hosting dinner parties.<ref name=\"research.frick\"/>\n\nWhile Lucas had a rapport with many French artists, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and Lucas shared a personal as well as professional relationship.  Lucas helped arrange numerous exhibits of Whistler's work in Paris, and Whistler painted Lucas' portrait in 1886, which was  given to [[Henry Walters]] in 1908.  Frequently, Lucas stayed at his friend's country estate house, and the two men regularly corresponded from 1862 to 1886. The friendship came to an end in 1886 when Whistler left [[Maud Franklin]] for Beatrix Godwin, whom he married in 1888. Lucas took the side of Franklin and helped her settle in Paris.<ref name=\"research.frick\"/>\n\n==Life in Paris==\nUnlike most of his clients, Lucas had a modest lifestyle.  He also paid for the apartment of his long-term mistress Josephine Marchand and her servants; however, their relationship was discreet according to the expert Lilian Randall, who translated and decoded Lucas' diary. Until the 1906 visit of his niece Bertha, Lucas had not seen any member of his family since becoming an expatriate, yet he  remained in touch with his family and friends in America through correspondence. As he aged, he became more nostalgic about Baltimore, where he ultimately bequeathed his collection.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\">{{cite news |title=Lucas' will The fight over George A.

At his death, he owned 19,000 prints, 300 paintings, and 170 bronze sculptures.   Two months before his death, Lucas bequeathed his art to Henry Walters with the understanding that it would ultimately go to the [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts (MICA)]], which had been destroyed in the [[Great Baltimore Fire of 1904]].<ref name=\"research.frick\" /> In 1933, most of the art was transferred to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] on indefinite loan and now forms part of the permanent collections of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] and the [[Walters Art Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start%E2%80%94Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |title=1905-1960: A fresh Start-Rise of Mount Royal Campus |publisher=[[Maryland Institute College of Art]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810154517/http://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start%E2%80%94Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |archivedate=2012-08-10 }}</ref> Thus, an uproar erupted within the Baltimore art community in 1995 when MICA threatened to sell their portion of Lucas' collection for resources to better fit their mission.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\" /> Many scholars, who especially appreciate Lucas' prints because they offer a comprehensive view of nineteenth-century graphic art, had enjoyed the convenience of the entire collection being housed in a single city.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*''The Diary of George A.

In 1859, Whistler moved to London, abandoned Realism, and developed his own tonalist style of painting that used muted colors and reflected the influences of Japanese art and of the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599-1660).\n| birth_name    = George Aloysius Lucas\n| birth_date    = 1824\n| birth_place   = Baltimore \n| death_date    = 1909\n| death_place   = \n| nationality   = American\n| other_names   = \n| occupation    = Art dealer\n| years_active  = \n| known_for     = \n| notable_works = \n}}\n\n'''George Aloysius Lucas''' (1824\u20131909) was an American-born art dealer living in Paris in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\n==Early years==\nGeorge A. Lucas, an art collector and agent for American patrons, was born in Baltimore in 1824 as the seventh son of [[Fielding Lucas Jr.]], who owned a publishing and stationary company. He attended [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point and after graduating in 1845, began working as a civil engineer on railroads in New Jersey. Lucas moved to New York in 1853 and began buying works for his Baltimore friends.<ref name=\"research.frick\">{{cite web |url=http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&-recid=6947 |title=Lucas, George A., 1824-1909 |publisher=[[Frick Collection]] |date=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\nFollowing the death of his father and older brother, Lucas returned to Baltimore in 1856, only to move to Paris a year later. He lived there on an annuity from his father's estate and worked as an agent for art collectors and dealers in the United States such as [[Samuel Putnam Avery]], [[John Taylor Johnston]], Cyrus Lawrence, [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], and [[Henry Field (art collector)|Henry Field]].  He is perhaps most recognized for helping to build the collection of [[William Thompson Walters]], for whom he purchased pieces by [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]], [[L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[Antoine-Louis Barye]], [[Th\u00e9odore Rousseau]], and [[Paul Delaroche]].   Lucas' responsibilities as an art dealer for these American business men also included overseeing commissions on their behalf, shipping out food packages, acting as a Parisian tour guide, and hosting dinner parties.<ref name=\"research.frick\"/>\n\nWhile Lucas had a rapport with many French artists, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and Lucas shared a personal as well as professional relationship.  Lucas helped arrange numerous exhibits of Whistler's work in Paris, and Whistler painted Lucas' portrait in 1886, which was  given to [[Henry Walters]] in 1908.  Frequently, Lucas stayed at his friend's country estate house, and the two men regularly corresponded from 1862 to 1886. The friendship came to an end in 1886 when Whistler left [[Maud Franklin]] for Beatrix Godwin, whom he married in 1888. Lucas took the side of Franklin and helped her settle in Paris.<ref name=\"research.frick\"/>\n\n==Life in Paris==\nUnlike most of his clients, Lucas had a modest lifestyle.  He also paid for the apartment of his long-term mistress Josephine Marchand and her servants; however, their relationship was discreet according to the expert Lilian Randall, who translated and decoded Lucas' diary. Until the 1906 visit of his niece Bertha, Lucas had not seen any member of his family since becoming an expatriate, yet he  remained in touch with his family and friends in America through correspondence. As he aged, he became more nostalgic about Baltimore, where he ultimately bequeathed his collection.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\">{{cite news |title=Lucas' will The fight over George A.

At his death, he owned 19,000 prints, 300 paintings, and 170 bronze sculptures.   Two months before his death, Lucas bequeathed his art to Henry Walters with the understanding that it would ultimately go to the [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts (MICA)]], which had been destroyed in the [[Great Baltimore Fire of 1904]].<ref name=\"research.frick\" /> In 1933, most of the art was transferred to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] on indefinite loan and now forms part of the permanent collections of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] and the [[Walters Art Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start%E2%80%94Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |title=1905-1960: A fresh Start-Rise of Mount Royal Campus |publisher=[[Maryland Institute College of Art]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810154517/http://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Facts_and_History/Historical_Timeline/1905-1960_A_Fresh_Start%E2%80%94Rise_of_Mount_Royal_Campus.html |archivedate=2012-08-10 }}</ref> Thus, an uproar erupted within the Baltimore art community in 1995 when MICA threatened to sell their portion of Lucas' collection for resources to better fit their mission.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\" /> Many scholars, who especially appreciate Lucas' prints because they offer a comprehensive view of nineteenth-century graphic art, had enjoyed the convenience of the entire collection being housed in a single city.<ref name=\"articles.baltimoresun\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*''The Diary of George A.

So convinced was the Communist Party in Zyuganov's prospects, that before his campaign even began they had already begun discussing who would be appointed in his presidential administration. Zyuganov argued that the results of the 1995 election showed that \"anticommunist\" sentiments were not prominent amongst the electorate.<ref name=polar/>\n\nEarly on, Zyuganov benefited from a portion of the Russian electorate perceiving him to be a more favorable alternative to other opposition candidates, such as [[Alexander Lebed]] and [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]].<ref name=TheRussianPresidency>{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=Thomas S. |date=1999 |title=The Russian Presidency, Society and Politics in the Second Russian Republic |url= |location= |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nOne of the advantages that Zyuganov enjoyed was the fact that his candidacy was backed by a genuine political party structure. Following their disappointing showing in the [[1993 Russian legislative election|1993 legislative election]], the Communist Party had spent put an immense effort into rebuilding their party's national grassroots organization. The strength of that effort had been demonstrated with the party's success in the [[1995 Russian legislative election|1995 legislative election]].<ref name=polar/>\n\nIn rebuilding the party, the party had reactivated its youth wing ([[Komsomol]]), strengthened relations with trade unions and women's groups sympathetic to the communist cause, and had begun to court business figures who they hoped could be convinced would benefit from a \"stable future\" under a CPRF leadership.<ref name=polar/>\n\nThe party had also figured out means of circumventing the obstacles presented by their limited campaign funds. Instead of being used for official parliamentary business, the party's parliamentary resources (including phones, faxes, office space and personnel) were utilized for campaign-related purposes.<ref name=polar/> Additionally, Zyguyanov and other members of the party used the travel privileges they were granted in their capacity as deputies in the Duma in order to make trips to Russia's various regions (often by train). They utilized government trips as unofficial campaign visits.<ref name=polar/>\n\nIn January 1996, Zyuganov took steps to better situate himself for the presidential election.<ref name=harvard2/> To improve the image of the communists, his party elected [[Gennadiy Seleznyov]] as Chairman of the State Duma on January 17.<ref name=harvard2/><ref name=\"ResearchPaper96/70\">http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP96-70/RP96-70.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> Seleznyov was considered a charismatic politician. Zyuganov himself traveled on a tour of western nations in an attempt to reassure the international community that a Communist victory would not threaten foreign investment in Russia.<ref name=harvard2/>\n\n===Securing the Communist Party nomination===\nFollowing the legislative election, an internal poll revealed that nearly 20% of the Communist Party's members would prefer a \"more charismatic\" candidate for president.<ref name=la1220>http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-20/news/mn-16033_1_communist-party{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> It was suggested that [[Anatoly Lukyanov]], [[Aman Tuleyev]] or Pyotr Romanov might challenge Zyuganov for the party's nomination.<ref name=polar/><ref name=la1220/>\n\nIn order to assure that his potential challengers within the party would have no time to organize campaign efforts, Zyuganov convened a party assembly one month after the legislative election where the nominee was voted upon.<ref name=polar/><ref name=la1220/>\n\n===Preventing \"spoiler\" candidates===\nAfter securing his party's nomination, Zyuganov made an effort to prevent [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]] candidates from arising. He worked to receive the endorsements of other political parties and movements. He first looked to solidify his support from the left.<ref name=polar/> He moved to secure his position as the leading candidate of the left-wing by seeking assurance from a number of potential left-wing candidates that they would not run for president and would instead lend their support to his candidacy.<ref name=brookingsoccasional/>  As a result of the Communist Party's performance in the legislative election, Zyuganov was easily able to unite the majority of opposition parties and movements behind his candidacy. He received and early endorsement from the [[Union of Communist Parties \u2013 Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Union of Communist Parties]], as well as a reluctant one from the [[Russian Communist Workers Party]].<ref name name=polar/>\n\nBy the end of February, Zyuganov had secured the backing of the three largest leftist political organizations that had failed to win any seats in the 1995 legislative elections. These were the [[Labour Russia]], [[Agrarian Party of Russia]] and Power to the People.<ref name=harvard2/> The far-left<ref name=brookingsoccasional/> Labour Russia's leader, [[Viktor Anpilov]], had originally stated that he would seek-out a candidate that promised to liquidate the office of the presidency, restore Soviet power, and reverse all privatization. Zyuganov had not publicly promised to pursue any of Anpilov's stated criteria. Nonetheless, in early January, Anpilov reversed his stance at the 5th Party Congress of the Communist Labor Russia party, announcing that his party would support Zyuganov's candidacy.<ref name=harvard2/> The Agrarian Party's leader, [[Mikhail Lapshin]], announced in the final week of January that his party was also going to back Zyuganov.<ref name=harvard2/> Power to the People's head, [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]] (who had been Yeltsin's main opponent in the [[1991 Russian presidential election|1991 election]]), announced his party's support of Zyuganov in early February.<ref name=harvard2/><ref name=brookingsoccasional/>\n\nAt the start of the election campaign, Zyuganov had the strongest base of support of any candidate.<ref name=\"ResearchPaper96/70\"/> By securing such broad support so early in the campaign, Zyuganov helped to solidify his position as a frontrunner and as the leading opposition candidate.<ref name=polar/><ref name=brookingsoccasional/>\n\n===Campaign strategy===\nZyuganov and his political advisors were convinced that all Russian voters existed somewhere on a venn-diagram of political ideologies consisting of democrats, communists or nationalists. They believed that the three ideologies were about equal in their membership.<ref name=polar/> Thus, Zyuganov and his advisors were convinced that by securing the support of the latter two groups, he would be able to win the election.<ref name=polar/> Heading into the 1996 election season, the prospects of such as strategy seemed rather strong. If Zyuganov could rely on the support of the twenty-one million voters that had voted CPRF and Russia's two other communist parties in the 1995 parliamentary election, as well as the eight million voters who had voted for Russia's various nationalist parties (not including Zhirinovsky's LDPR), he would be able to win the first round of the election and secure himself as the frontrunner to win the second round.<ref name=cdn/>\n\nZyuganov benefited, overall, from the weak field of candidates in the election. The incumbent Boris Yeltsin held single-digit approval ratings at the start of the campaign.<ref name=polar/> Polling showed that most Russians believed that they had been better off when they were under communist control than they were now under Yeltsin's leadership.<ref name=polar/> While both Alexander Lebed and [[Grigory Yavlinsky]] defeated Zyuganov in hypothetical polling for the second-round, neither of their campaigns had reasonable odds of making it beyond the first round.<ref name=polar/> Zyuganov was so strongly viewed as a front runner that when he attended the February 1996 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], Western leaders lined up to meet him, viewing him to be the likely be the next president of Russia.<ref name=RPFGTP/><ref name=wpjul7>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/07/07/yeltsin-campaign-rose-from-tears-to-triumph/99aebeb5-87ca-4555-be86-b352e8e8bced/ |title=Yeltsin Campaign Rose from Tears to Triump |last1=Hockstader |first1=Lee |last2=Hoffman |first2=David |date=July 7, 1996 |website=www.washingtonpost.com |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=September 11, 2017 }}</ref> Zyuganov's campaign believed it was even possible to win the election outright in the first round of voting.<ref name=polar/>\n\nZyuganov's campaign aimed to make the election a referendum on the tenure of Yeltsin.<ref name=polar/> Zyuganov positioned his campaign as being against what he considered to be the failed centrism of Boris Yeltsin's presidency.

To do so, he spoke to them using language that made him sound more like a [[Social democracy|social democrat]] than a soviet communist.<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/07/22/the-war-for-the-kremlin{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, Zyuganov had become the first candidate officially certified to be placed on the ballot.<ref>http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~gusev/russian/gzbio.html{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\nHaving already secured his left-wing base, Zguyanov now desired to strengthen his support from nationalist groups.<ref name=polar/> He began gesturing towards the nationalist opposition, meeting with most key figures and groups of Russia's nationalist opposition, with the exception of [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]]<ref name=polar/> Before, and early into, the campaign, Zyuganov persuaded nationalist figures such as former vice-president [[Alexander Rutskoy]] (a leading [[Peronism|Peronist]] amongst nationalists), [[Sergei Baburin]] (an important nationalist figure in the Russian legislature, and leader of the [[Russian All-People's Union]]) and [[Stanislav Govorukhin]] to support his candidacy,<ref name=polar/><ref name=brookingsoccasional/><ref name=f&p40396>{{cite web |url=http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/news/omri/1996/05/960405I.html(opt,mozilla,unix,english,,new) |title=No. 68, Part I, 5 April 1996 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=April 4, 1996 |website=www.friends-parners.org |publisher=Friends&Parners |access-date=February 22, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> convincing them that no patriotic alternative to his candidacy was available and that without partnership with the communists, it would be impossible for nationalists to have a candidate they supported win the presidential election.<ref name=polar/> Zyuganov partnered with Ryzhkov to form the ''Bloc of National and Patriotic Forces'' (sometimes referred to as the \"popular-patriotic bloc\"), a coalition of nationalist and communist organizations.<ref name=polar/><ref name=f&p40396/> More than 70 separate organizations had joined by early April,<ref name=f&p40396/> and by the end of the election more than 136 organizations had joined.<ref name=polar/>\n\nAt his campaign stops, Zyuganov was mindful to emphasize that he considered himself to be, not the candidate of the Communist Party, but the candidate of a bloc of nationalist and socialist associations.<ref name=mythmaking/>\n\n===The tide turns===\nZyuganov had originally benefited from the fact that the Communists' role in the legislature was far more moderate than many feared it would be.<ref name=TheRussianPresidency/> However, on March 15 the Communist Party acted in the [[State Duma]] to pass a largely symbolic non-binding resolution denouncing the [[Belavezha Accords]].<ref name=wpjul7/> This was intended to be a purely symbolic measure, meaningless except to remind Russians of the assertion that Yeltsin had overridden the will of the people in breaking-up the Soviet Union.<ref name=brookingsoccasional/> Soon after the resolution passed, Yeltsin attacked the communists, insinuating that, by declaring the Belavezha Accords to be illegal, the Communists were declaring Russia itself to be an illegitimate state.<ref name=wpjul7/> Yeltsin condemned the resolution as being both scandalous and unconstitutional.

Yeltsin's aides had allegedly laid the groundwork for the vote to succeed by giving nationalists in the Duma the go-ahead to vote with the Communists and by coordinating the proceedings so that only Yeltsin's least persuasive allies in parliament spoke out against the resolution.<ref name=wpjul7/> It became clear that what had originally been meant as an inconsequential and purely symbolic resolution had acquired some very real ramifications. The resolution positioned Zyuganov as an extremist per the perception of the Russian Public.<ref name=wpjul7/> Soon after the resolution passed, polling showed it to be highly unpopular, with less than a third of Russians approving of it.<ref name=harvard4/> The Communist Party failed to effectively respond to the backlash.<ref name=wpjul7/> In fact, during the campaign, the deputy chairman of the Communist Party might have worsened the damage by declaring, \"The death of communism never happened...the Soviet Union never collapsed, people still think of themselves as Soviets.\"<ref name=polar/>\n\nIn spite of this development, Zyuganov persisted in campaigning as he had before, traveling the country delivering many of long, often pessimistic, stump speeches.

So convinced was the Communist Party in Zyuganov's prospects, that before his campaign even began they had already begun discussing who would be appointed in his presidential administration. Zyuganov argued that the results of the 1995 election showed that \"anticommunist\" sentiments were not prominent amongst the electorate.<ref name=polar/>\n\nEarly on, Zyuganov benefited from a portion of the Russian electorate perceiving him to be a more favorable alternative to other opposition candidates, such as [[Alexander Lebed]] and [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]].<ref name=TheRussianPresidency>{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=Thomas S. |date=1999 |title=The Russian Presidency, Society and Politics in the Second Russian Republic |url= |location= |publisher=St. Martin\u2019s Press |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nOne of the advantages that Zyuganov enjoyed was the fact that his candidacy was backed by a genuine political party structure. Following their disappointing showing in the [[1993 Russian legislative election|1993 legislative election]], the Communist Party had spent put an immense effort into rebuilding their party's national grassroots organization. The strength of that effort had been demonstrated with the party's success in the [[1995 Russian legislative election|1995 legislative election]].<ref name=polar/>\n\nIn rebuilding the party, the party had reactivated its youth wing ([[Komsomol]]), strengthened relations with trade unions and women's groups sympathetic to the communist cause, and had begun to court business figures who they hoped could be convinced would benefit from a \"stable future\" under a CPRF leadership.<ref name=polar/>\n\nThe party had also figured out means of circumventing the obstacles presented by their limited campaign funds. Instead of being used for official parliamentary business, the party's parliamentary resources (including phones, faxes, office space and personnel) were utilized for campaign-related purposes.<ref name=polar/> Additionally, Zyguyanov and other members of the party used the travel privileges they were granted in their capacity as deputies in the Duma in order to make trips to Russia's various regions (often by train). They utilized government trips as unofficial campaign visits.<ref name=polar/>\n\nIn January 1996, Zyuganov took steps to better situate himself for the presidential election.<ref name=harvard2/> To improve the image of the communists, his party elected [[Gennadiy Seleznyov]] as Chairman of the State Duma on January 17.<ref name=harvard2/><ref name=\"ResearchPaper96/70\">http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP96-70/RP96-70.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> Seleznyov was considered a charismatic politician. Zyuganov himself traveled on a tour of western nations in an attempt to reassure the international community that a Communist victory would not threaten foreign investment in Russia.<ref name=harvard2/>\n\n===Securing the Communist Party nomination===\nFollowing the legislative election, an internal poll revealed that nearly 20% of the Communist Party's members would prefer a \"more charismatic\" candidate for president.<ref name=la1220>http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-20/news/mn-16033_1_communist-party{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> It was suggested that [[Anatoly Lukyanov]], [[Aman Tuleyev]] or Pyotr Romanov might challenge Zyuganov for the party's nomination.<ref name=polar/><ref name=la1220/>\n\nIn order to assure that his potential challengers within the party would have no time to organize campaign efforts, Zyuganov convened a party assembly one month after the legislative election where the nominee was voted upon.<ref name=polar/><ref name=la1220/>\n\n===Preventing \"spoiler\" candidates===\nAfter securing his party's nomination, Zyuganov made an effort to prevent [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]] candidates from arising. He worked to receive the endorsements of other political parties and movements. He first looked to solidify his support from the left.<ref name=polar/> He moved to secure his position as the leading candidate of the left-wing by seeking assurance from a number of potential left-wing candidates that they would not run for president and would instead lend their support to his candidacy.<ref name=brookingsoccasional/>  As a result of the Communist Party's performance in the legislative election, Zyuganov was easily able to unite the majority of opposition parties and movements behind his candidacy. He received and early endorsement from the [[Union of Communist Parties \u2013 Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Union of Communist Parties]], as well as a reluctant one from the [[Russian Communist Workers Party]].<ref name name=polar/>\n\nBy the end of February, Zyuganov had secured the backing of the three largest leftist political organizations that had failed to win any seats in the 1995 legislative elections. These were the [[Labour Russia]], [[Agrarian Party of Russia]] and Power to the People.<ref name=harvard2/> The far-left<ref name=brookingsoccasional/> Labour Russia's leader, [[Viktor Anpilov]], had originally stated that he would seek-out a candidate that promised to liquidate the office of the presidency, restore Soviet power, and reverse all privatization. Zyuganov had not publicly promised to pursue any of Anpilov's stated criteria. Nonetheless, in early January, Anpilov reversed his stance at the 5th Party Congress of the Communist Labor Russia party, announcing that his party would support Zyuganov's candidacy.<ref name=harvard2/> The Agrarian Party's leader, [[Mikhail Lapshin]], announced in the final week of January that his party was also going to back Zyuganov.<ref name=harvard2/> Power to the People's head, [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]] (who had been Yeltsin's main opponent in the [[1991 Russian presidential election|1991 election]]), announced his party's support of Zyuganov in early February.<ref name=harvard2/><ref name=brookingsoccasional/>\n\nAt the start of the election campaign, Zyuganov had the strongest base of support of any candidate.<ref name=\"ResearchPaper96/70\"/> By securing such broad support so early in the campaign, Zyuganov helped to solidify his position as a frontrunner and as the leading opposition candidate.<ref name=polar/><ref name=brookingsoccasional/>\n\n===Campaign strategy===\nZyuganov and his political advisors were convinced that all Russian voters existed somewhere on a venn-diagram of political ideologies consisting of democrats, communists or nationalists. They believed that the three ideologies were about equal in their membership.<ref name=polar/> Thus, Zyuganov and his advisors were convinced that by securing the support of the latter two groups, he would be able to win the election.<ref name=polar/> Heading into the 1996 election season, the prospects of such as strategy seemed rather strong. If Zyuganov could rely on the support of the twenty-one million voters that had voted CPRF and Russia's two other communist parties in the 1995 parliamentary election, as well as the eight million voters who had voted for Russia's various nationalist parties (not including Zhirinovsky's LDPR), he would be able to win the first round of the election and secure himself as the frontrunner to win the second round.<ref name=cdn/>\n\nZyuganov benefited, overall, from the weak field of candidates in the election. The incumbent Boris Yeltsin held single-digit approval ratings at the start of the campaign.<ref name=polar/> Polling showed that most Russians believed that they had been better off when they were under communist control than they were now under Yeltsin's leadership.<ref name=polar/> While both Alexander Lebed and [[Grigory Yavlinsky]] defeated Zyuganov in hypothetical polling for the second-round, neither of their campaigns had reasonable odds of making it beyond the first round.<ref name=polar/> Zyuganov was so strongly viewed as a front runner that when he attended the February 1996 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], Western leaders lined up to meet him, viewing him to be the likely be the next president of Russia.<ref name=RPFGTP/><ref name=wpjul7>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/07/07/yeltsin-campaign-rose-from-tears-to-triumph/99aebeb5-87ca-4555-be86-b352e8e8bced/ |title=Yeltsin Campaign Rose from Tears to Triump |last1=Hockstader |first1=Lee |last2=Hoffman |first2=David |date=July 7, 1996 |website=www.washingtonpost.com |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=September 11, 2017 }}</ref> Zyuganov's campaign believed it was even possible to win the election outright in the first round of voting.<ref name=polar/>\n\nZyuganov's campaign aimed to make the election a referendum on the tenure of Yeltsin.<ref name=polar/> Zyuganov positioned his campaign as being against what he considered to be the failed centrism of Boris Yeltsin's presidency.

Yeltsin's aides had allegedly laid the groundwork for the vote to succeed by giving nationalists in the Duma the go-ahead to vote with the Communists and by coordinating the proceedings so that only Yeltsin's least persuasive allies in parliament spoke out against the resolution.<ref name=wpjul7/> It became clear that what had originally been meant as an inconsequential and purely symbolic resolution had acquired some very real ramifications. The resolution positioned Zyuganov as an extremist per the perception of the Russian Public.<ref name=wpjul7/> Soon after the resolution passed, polling showed it to be highly unpopular, with less than a third of Russians approving of it.<ref name=harvard4/> The Communist Party failed to effectively respond to the backlash.<ref name=wpjul7/> In fact, during the campaign, the deputy chairman of the Communist Party might have worsened the damage by declaring, \"The death of communism never happened...the Soviet Union never collapsed, people still think of themselves as Soviets.\"<ref name=polar/>\n\nIn spite of this development, Zyuganov persisted in campaigning as he had before, traveling the country delivering many of long, often pessimistic, stump speeches.
