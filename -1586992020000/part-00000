Along with the local ethnic [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and the [[Bugis]], domination by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], the [[Arabs]], and the [[United Kingdom|British]] at different times has been a part of Bintan's rich history. Many local internal feuds between the Malays and Bugis, and battles in the sea, with and between foreign invasion forces, have been part of Bintan's history and its straits. From mid-16th century, the Sultan of Johor-Riau kingdom had moved their kingdom between [[Johor]], [[Riau]] and [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]].<ref name=Gossling/><ref name=Sri/>\n\nThe earliest history of Bintan is linked to the history of Nagoya Hills, which is integral with Batam, near Bintan island and other islands of the Riau archipelago. The Chinese chronicles have mentioned that Batam was inhabited by 231 AD when Singapore island was still called [[Pulau Ujung]] ([[Ujung Island]]). Bintan came under the control of the [[Malacca]] kingdom from the 13th century. Later, the Sultan of [[Johor]] ruled from here and his reign lasted till the 18th century.<ref name=Time/><ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nRiau Islands were central to the greater [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay kingdoms]] or Sultanates, known as the 'Malay World', which had its control from eastern [[Sumatra]] to [[Borneo]]. For centuries, Riau was the home of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Orang Laut]] people. They had settled in Bintan. These two communities were the backbone of most Malay kingdoms from the time of [[Srivijaya]] to the Sultanate of Johor. They had full control of trade routes going through the straits. Migrants from China and Indo-China, though came here later, settled in large area of Asia.<ref name=Time/><ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"History\"/> After the fall of [[Melaka]] in 1511, Riau islands became the centre of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor \u2013 Riau, based on Bintan island. They were considered the centre of Malay culture.<ref name=History/>\n\nFrom the 12th to 13th centuries, the [[Srivijaya Empire]] of Sumatra held sway over Bintan island. Sri Tri Buana, a member of the royal family of [[Palembang]] had visited Riau Islands in 1290. The Queen of Bintan met him and made a strategic alliance. They moved with a \"flotilla of 800 vessels to Bintan\" where Sri Tri Buana became the king. However, Bintan and its straits got the reputation as a pirate island due to the Malay pirates who seized many ships by forcing them to the port to trade and or loot the cargo carried by them. Hundreds of ships of Malays forced Chinese ships returning from the [[Indian Ocean]] to their ports in Bintan. Those who resisted were attacked. Large quantities of [[Chinese ceramics]] were recovered on Bintan, some traced to the early [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131127). The [[Arab]]ian chronicler, [[Ibn Battuta]], writing on the Riau islands in the 13th century states: \"Here there are little islands, from which armed black pirates with poised arrows emerged, possessing armed warships; they plunder people but do not enslave them.\" Log records of Chinese ships testify these incidents in the 12th century. Even after several centuries, Bintan is still referred by many by the epithet \"Pirate Island\".<ref name=Hawk/>\n \nAccording to historical records, Sri Tri Bhuvana occupied Singapore and then declared himself as the King of Singapore. Before that he renamed [[Temasek]], the island he had occupied, as Singapore. Another explanation mooted to the naming of Singapore is that the king spotted an animal, which he presumed to be a lion, and hence called Temasek as Singapore (Lion City).<ref name=History/><ref name=\"History\"/> The reign of Srivijaya empire lasted till the 16th century.<ref name=History/><ref name=Hawk/>\n\nIn the year 1521, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] who were on [[Black pepper|pepper]] hunt, had the intention of building strongholds in the form of forts during their sea voyages in the East, on [[Sunda Island]] in [[Java]] after they had received instructions from their King to destroy four forts in India, [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Sumatra]]. However, they initially failed to capture Bentan, the stronghold of the former [[Malacca Sultanate|Sultan of Malaca]] on the south east of the [[Singapore Strait]] and [[Atjeh]] (the capital of a new Sultanate, which was emerging in [[North Sumatra]]). At this time, they were successful in establishing a fort at [[Pasai]] though were unsuccessful in establishing a fortress at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in China and suffered defeat at the hands of the Chinese. In 1524, Malays of Bintan attacked Malacca, which was under the control of the Portuguese.<ref name=Cambridge>{{Cite book|title= The New Cambridge modern history|pages=671\u2013672|accessdate=2010-06-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9QSQv6VimgC&pg=PA672&dq=History+of+Bintan&hl=en&ei=zb8LTOOSEseyrAfzsrSBDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-34536-7}}</ref>\n\nBintan first became politically important when [[Mahmud Shah (Sultan of Malacca)|Sultan Mahmud]] of the fallen [[Sultanate of Malacca]] fled to Bintan and created a resistance base there after Malacca was taken by the Portuguese forces in 1511. The Portuguese eventually destroyed the stronghold in 1526, and after a few years the Sultanate founded a new capital back on the [[Malay Peninsula]] and developed from there.<ref name=History/>\n\n[[File:Bintan Agro Resort.jpg|thumb|right|Bintan agro beach resort]]\nAt the beginning of 18th century the Sultanate of Johor entered into political turmoil and the capital moved back to Bintan as the [[Bugis]] took control of the Sultanate. At the hands of the Bugis, Bintan became a powerful trading port, attracting regional, Western, Indian and Chinese traders as well as migrants including Chinese much in the same way Malacca had developed into a regional power three centuries earlier.<ref name=History/>\n[[File:Pulau Penyengat.jpg|right|thumb|[[Penyengat Island]] in Bintan]]\nEuropean powers wanted to take control of the port, which had a flourishing trade. During this period the [[United Kingdom|British]], who controlled [[Penang]], were aggressively looking towards expanding their control to the south of the [[Straits of Malacca]], as they wished to contain the Dutch expansions. They considered Bintan as a possible location. During this period the Dutch had defeated the Bintan rulers and taken control of the island by the end of the 18th century; this had brought to an end the local trading supremacy. This also resulted in checkmating the British ambition to occupy the area. However, an internal power struggle within the Sultanate of Riau-Johor ensued. The British seized this opportunity and occupied the island of Singapore.<ref name=History/> With this, the importance of Bintan island as a trading port also declined. A new cultural centre developed on [[Penyengat Island]] and it got established as the stronghold of Malay and [[Islamic culture]].<ref name=History/>\n\nHowever the history changed the fate of Riau as a political, cultural or economic centre when European powers took control of the regional trade routes by taking advantage of political weaknesses within the Sultanate. [[Singapore Island]], that had been for centuries part of the same greater Malay kingdoms and sultanates, and under direct control of [[Sultan of Johor]], came under British control. The creation of a European-controlled territory in Johor-Riau heart broke the sultanate into two parts, destroying the cultural and political unity that had existed for centuries.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] of 1824 consolidated this separation, with the British controlling all territories north of the Singapore Strait and Dutch controlling territories from Riau to Java.<ref name=History/> Till the independence of [[Indonesia]] in 1945, Bintan was under the control of the Netherlands East Indies.<ref name=Gossling/> However, the Riau Archipelago remained a fairly borderless territory till recently. During the [[World War II]] [[Japan]]ese had occupied the Malay world and Singapore was their headquarters. During this period, many Malays including the upper strata of society had to join the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]]. After the war, from 1950 the Archipelago was a duty-free zone till the revolution ''Konfrontasi'' in 1963. During this period, the Straight [[dollar]] of [[British Malaya]] was the principal currency.

As the Dutch ruled over the islands for a long period, their influence is distinctly discerned in the island. Population of Bintan Island is about 400,000 with the citizens mostly belonging to the Malay, Bugis, Chinese and the Orang Laut ethnicity. An observation made on the distribution of different ethnic groups in Bintan is that Indonesians have migrated in large numbers to the island and as result Malays, the original settlers of the region, are now a minority in Riau Archipelago as a whole. This is attributed to the fact that the island is close to Malaysia and Singapore in particular and Indonesians flock to the place to get a foothold to go to Singapore. In the capital city of Tanjung Pinang, the urban population had jumped from 98,871 in 1998 to 134,940 in 2004, and by 2014 had reached 226,716.<ref name= Nordholt>{{Cite book|last= Nordholt|first= Henk Schulte|author2=Geert Arend van Klinken |author3=Gerry Van Klinken |title= Renegotiating boundaries: local politics in post-Suharto Indonesia|page=443|accessdate=2010-06-16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeP-LBnI_LMC&pg=PA445&dq=tanjung+pinang+kota&hl=en&ei=HcgLTPGjGNS_rAeCkbz9DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= KITLV Press|year=2007|isbn=90-6718-283-4}}</ref>\n\n==Economy and development==\n[[File:Bintan Agro Beach Resort4.jpg|thumb|right|Bintan Agro Beach Resort]]\nIn 1824, the Treaty of London finally settled that the islands south of Singapore are Dutch Territories. Bintan was again under the control of the Dutch. Bintan's power and central role disappeared with the regional political changes and the island's past fortune was now overshadowed by neighbouring [[Batam]] and Singapore. Following its founding by the British in 1819, Singapore became a new regional trading centre. Due to its limited size, Singapore initiated the [[Sijori Growth Triangle]] in 1980 and 1990s, and signed agreements with the Indonesian government to invest in Batam and Bintan.<ref name=History/><ref name=\"Peachey, p.9,14,17\">Peachey, pp.9, 14, 17</ref>\n\nThe economy of Bintan island is centred on tourism, given its close proximity to Singapore. In the year 1990, according to a Presidential Decree (25 July 1990), a coordinating team was set up for the Riao Province Development with the mandate to plan and develop development projects within the framework of Indonesia-Singapore cooperation. Investment plans, similar to that of Batam, were evolved with basic intention to provide leisure space to Singaporeans on the white beaches of Bintan and this approach also conformed to the Indonesian Policy of declaring the 1990s as the \"decade of Visit Indonesia\". In 1991, Bintan Management Resort for establishing a resort with intent to develop resorts, industrial parks and water projects was planned. In December 1994, partial opening of Bintan Resort Development was agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding signed by trade ministers of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.<ref name=\"Peachey, p.9,14,17\"/> As per the Master Plan prepared for Bintan, the emphasis was on tourism, industrial projects and agricultural products, all under private-sector initiative, involving formation of a consortium of the Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation, Wah Chang International (whose specialisation is development of resorts), the Keppel group and the local banks.<ref name=Murray>{{Cite book|last=Murray|first=Geoffrey|author2=Audrey Perera|title=Singapore: the global city-state|page=47|accessdate=2010-06-16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRKc_XSHKa4C&pg=PA47&dq=Bintan&hl=en&ei=lrgLTJCuM46CrAe-lNC1DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Bintan&f=false|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year=1996|isbn=0-312-12959-9}}</ref> Thus, the once wild and deserted Bintan island has now become an industrial \"hinterland\" for Singapore and a special investment zone for world industrial companies, also attracting thousands of workers from the entire country.

The Bintan industrial estate has been allotted {{convert|4000|ha|acre}} and is designed as a \"One-stop investment centre\" providing all services essential for the investing companies to devote exclusively towards production.

Since the island was approachable only by ferrying, priority was given to develop the Ferry terminal at Bandar Bentan Telani. There are now three Ferry Terminals (Sea Ports) and two Cargo Sea Ports with capacity of 10,000 to 12000 gross weight ton. Bintan now has an airport known as [[Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport]].<ref name=Province/><ref name=\"Gossling, p.271\">Gossling, p.271</ref>  [[Garuda Indonesia]] has plans to build a new airport hub on the island as a stop gap measure for [[Jakarta]], and to compete with [[Lion Air]]'s new hub at [[Hang Nadim Airport]] on neighboring [[Batam]].  One issue however is the region is saturated with airport capacity while land is scarce, as Singapore [[Changi Airport]] and Johor Bahru [[Senai Airport]] are nearby.\n\nRoad within the island was also started and the first stretch of the {{convert|12.5|km|mi}}, the  east west arterial road was completed (out of the {{convert|35|km|mi}} stretch planned in the ultimate stage). Branch roads were also built to land parcels allotted for resort development. Within each land area allocated, the resort agencies constructed their own internal road network. Drinking water facilities were also created by constructing a reservoir of 5 million litres and a service reservoir of 1.5 million litres for supply to a water treatment plant. From this plant, potable water supply system has been created to all the resort areas. Electricity supply is also ensured through a Power generating plant of 18 MW plant with capacity to upgrade to 24 MW. Within each resort area water and power supply connections to the resorts are done by the resort agencies. The potable water that is supplied meets the [[WHO]] standards. Sewage Treatment is done in all the resorts through modular Sewage treatment plants. The recycled effluent is put to use for irrigation. Another important civic amenity attended is the disposal of solid waste. The solid waste is collected from the resorts. It is systematically disposed in a centralized sanitary landfill site.<ref name=\"Gossling, p.271\">Gossling, p.271</ref> There are 15 banks, 7 hotels and 6 golf courses. Telecommunication Service facility available is the International Net Work.<ref name=Province/>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n\n===Flora===\nIn Bintan, the primary forest cover was in a limited area on the hills. There was extensive deforestation done mostly  for the cultivation of [[Uncaria|gambier]] (''Uncaria gembieri''). The plantation size of each gambier plantation was {{convert|30|ha|acre}}. For processing of gambier leaves firewood was essential. This requirement was met by cutting forests of as much as the {{convert|30|ha|acre}} sized gambier plantations. With this amount of [[forest degradation]], the gambier processing could be sustained for 12 years only. Forest was not available for use for the processing, and production of gambier was discontinued, while efforts continued to find new stocks of firewood. Inevitably, Gambier was totally abandoned. In the 20th century rubber plantation replaced gambier. Even the rubber plantations were abandoned due to water logging problems. Now, on the higher reaches of the hills secondary forests have developed in those areas where water logging is not prevalent. The abandoned land is also now put to other uses.<ref name=Gossling/> In the rain forests of the island on the trek to the Gunung Bintan peak, now vegetation consists of {{convert|40|m|ft}} tall trees of [[dipterocarp]] (which bears two winged fruits) and many other plants.<ref name=asia/><ref name=Sri/>\n\n===Fauna===\n[[File:Stavenn Trachypithecus cristatus 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[silvery lutung|Silver leaf monkeys]]]]\nVarious species of sea animals and plants are found underwater.

Now, the nests are not found as frequently as in the past. Turtle tracks, nests, eggs, and egg shells have been recorded during patrol surveys conducted during specified periods, not only in Bintan but also in the Pasir Pasan beach. In the Bintan Resort's nestling beaches  [[hawksbill turtle]] (''Eretmochelys imbricata'') and [[green turtles]] (''Chelonia mydas'') have been recorded. Research and Development Department and Environmental & Health Division of Bintan Resort are encouraged by their patrolling efforts and they are confident that sea turtle nests would be protected on Bintan and also conserved in local villages.<ref name=turtle/>\n\n==Historical places==\nAt Bintan and in its close vicinity of its capital city of Tanjung Pinang, there are a number of historical monuments linked to its ancient history and modern developments. Its closeness to Singapore has resulted in development of beaches as popular resorts with hotels and other paraphernalia to attract tourists. Some of the well-known sites of attractions are the Penyengat, Tanjung Pinang city, Raja Ali Haji Monument, the Colonial Graveyard, Chinese Pagodas, Banyan Tree Temple, and its many beaches and resorts.

The Malay and the Bugis, to attain peace in the region, had cemented their relationship by establishing marital ties. Raja Ali Haji, who was the Bugis commander of Bintan and acclaimed as the hero of his people, married his daughter to Sultan Mahmud Shah of Malacca. The island was gifted to his daughter, Raja Hamidah. This union established peace between the Malay and the [[Bugis]]. Following this, a grand mosque (see infobox) called the Masjid Raya was built on the island (over 170 years old), which can be seen from Tanjung Pinang. A monument by the seaside that commemorates Raja Ali Haji, who sacrificed his life for his people against the Dutch, is also seen on the beach.

Many local internal feuds between the Malays and Bugis, and battles in the sea, with and between foreign invasion forces, have been part of Bintan's history and its straits. From mid-16th century, the Sultan of Johor-Riau kingdom had moved their kingdom between [[Johor]], [[Riau]] and [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]].<ref name=Gossling/><ref name=Sri/>\n\nThe earliest history of Bintan is linked to the history of Nagoya Hills, which is integral with Batam, near Bintan island and other islands of the Riau archipelago. The Chinese chronicles have mentioned that Batam was inhabited by 231 AD when Singapore island was still called [[Pulau Ujung]] ([[Ujung Island]]). Bintan came under the control of the [[Malacca]] kingdom from the 13th century. Later, the Sultan of [[Johor]] ruled from here and his reign lasted till the 18th century.<ref name=Time/><ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nRiau Islands were central to the greater [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay kingdoms]] or Sultanates, known as the 'Malay World', which had its control from eastern [[Sumatra]] to [[Borneo]]. For centuries, Riau was the home of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Orang Laut]] people. They had settled in Bintan. These two communities were the backbone of most Malay kingdoms from the time of [[Srivijaya]] to the Sultanate of Johor. They had full control of trade routes going through the straits. Migrants from China and Indo-China, though came here later, settled in large area of Asia.<ref name=Time/><ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"History\"/> After the fall of [[Melaka]] in 1511, Riau islands became the centre of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor \u2013 Riau, based on Bintan island. They were considered the centre of Malay culture.<ref name=History/>\n\nFrom the 12th to 13th centuries, the [[Srivijaya Empire]] of Sumatra held sway over Bintan island. Sri Tri Buana, a member of the royal family of [[Palembang]] had visited Riau Islands in 1290. The Queen of Bintan met him and made a strategic alliance. They moved with a \"flotilla of 800 vessels to Bintan\" where Sri Tri Buana became the king. However, Bintan and its straits got the reputation as a pirate island due to the Malay pirates who seized many ships by forcing them to the port to trade and or loot the cargo carried by them. Hundreds of ships of Malays forced Chinese ships returning from the [[Indian Ocean]] to their ports in Bintan. Those who resisted were attacked. Large quantities of [[Chinese ceramics]] were recovered on Bintan, some traced to the early [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131127). The [[Arab]]ian chronicler, [[Ibn Battuta]], writing on the Riau islands in the 13th century states: \"Here there are little islands, from which armed black pirates with poised arrows emerged, possessing armed warships; they plunder people but do not enslave them.\" Log records of Chinese ships testify these incidents in the 12th century. Even after several centuries, Bintan is still referred by many by the epithet \"Pirate Island\".<ref name=Hawk/>\n \nAccording to historical records, Sri Tri Bhuvana occupied Singapore and then declared himself as the King of Singapore. Before that he renamed [[Temasek]], the island he had occupied, as Singapore. Another explanation mooted to the naming of Singapore is that the king spotted an animal, which he presumed to be a lion, and hence called Temasek as Singapore (Lion City).<ref name=History/><ref name=\"History\"/> The reign of Srivijaya empire lasted till the 16th century.<ref name=History/><ref name=Hawk/>\n\nIn the year 1521, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] who were on [[Black pepper|pepper]] hunt, had the intention of building strongholds in the form of forts during their sea voyages in the East, on [[Sunda Island]] in [[Java]] after they had received instructions from their King to destroy four forts in India, [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Sumatra]]. However, they initially failed to capture Bentan, the stronghold of the former [[Malacca Sultanate|Sultan of Malaca]] on the south east of the [[Singapore Strait]] and [[Atjeh]] (the capital of a new Sultanate, which was emerging in [[North Sumatra]]). At this time, they were successful in establishing a fort at [[Pasai]] though were unsuccessful in establishing a fortress at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in China and suffered defeat at the hands of the Chinese. In 1524, Malays of Bintan attacked Malacca, which was under the control of the Portuguese.<ref name=Cambridge>{{Cite book|title= The New Cambridge modern history|pages=671\u2013672|accessdate=2010-06-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9QSQv6VimgC&pg=PA672&dq=History+of+Bintan&hl=en&ei=zb8LTOOSEseyrAfzsrSBDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-34536-7}}</ref>\n\nBintan first became politically important when [[Mahmud Shah (Sultan of Malacca)|Sultan Mahmud]] of the fallen [[Sultanate of Malacca]] fled to Bintan and created a resistance base there after Malacca was taken by the Portuguese forces in 1511. The Portuguese eventually destroyed the stronghold in 1526, and after a few years the Sultanate founded a new capital back on the [[Malay Peninsula]] and developed from there.<ref name=History/>\n\n[[File:Bintan Agro Resort.jpg|thumb|right|Bintan agro beach resort]]\nAt the beginning of 18th century the Sultanate of Johor entered into political turmoil and the capital moved back to Bintan as the [[Bugis]] took control of the Sultanate. At the hands of the Bugis, Bintan became a powerful trading port, attracting regional, Western, Indian and Chinese traders as well as migrants including Chinese much in the same way Malacca had developed into a regional power three centuries earlier.<ref name=History/>\n[[File:Pulau Penyengat.jpg|right|thumb|[[Penyengat Island]] in Bintan]]\nEuropean powers wanted to take control of the port, which had a flourishing trade. During this period the [[United Kingdom|British]], who controlled [[Penang]], were aggressively looking towards expanding their control to the south of the [[Straits of Malacca]], as they wished to contain the Dutch expansions. They considered Bintan as a possible location. During this period the Dutch had defeated the Bintan rulers and taken control of the island by the end of the 18th century; this had brought to an end the local trading supremacy. This also resulted in checkmating the British ambition to occupy the area. However, an internal power struggle within the Sultanate of Riau-Johor ensued. The British seized this opportunity and occupied the island of Singapore.<ref name=History/> With this, the importance of Bintan island as a trading port also declined. A new cultural centre developed on [[Penyengat Island]] and it got established as the stronghold of Malay and [[Islamic culture]].<ref name=History/>\n\nHowever the history changed the fate of Riau as a political, cultural or economic centre when European powers took control of the regional trade routes by taking advantage of political weaknesses within the Sultanate. [[Singapore Island]], that had been for centuries part of the same greater Malay kingdoms and sultanates, and under direct control of [[Sultan of Johor]], came under British control. The creation of a European-controlled territory in Johor-Riau heart broke the sultanate into two parts, destroying the cultural and political unity that had existed for centuries.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] of 1824 consolidated this separation, with the British controlling all territories north of the Singapore Strait and Dutch controlling territories from Riau to Java.<ref name=History/> Till the independence of [[Indonesia]] in 1945, Bintan was under the control of the Netherlands East Indies.<ref name=Gossling/> However, the Riau Archipelago remained a fairly borderless territory till recently. During the [[World War II]] [[Japan]]ese had occupied the Malay world and Singapore was their headquarters. During this period, many Malays including the upper strata of society had to join the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]]. After the war, from 1950 the Archipelago was a duty-free zone till the revolution ''Konfrontasi'' in 1963. During this period, the Straight [[dollar]] of [[British Malaya]] was the principal currency. Visa free movement of people, which existed then is now no more prevalent.<ref name= \"Nordholt, p.447-448\">Nordholt, pp. 447\u2013448</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MapBintan-medium.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Bintancoast.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: Bintan Island Map.

Above these mud flat reaches, narrow piers or ''pelantars'' were built at higher elevations and the old city of Tanjung expanded with a maze of streets and alleys. The old pier with the name Pelantar II thrives as the fish market. The town has a large population of the Chinese, whose presence is seen around three [[Buddhist]] [[Pagodas]] with the 'Citiya Bodhi Sasana' overlooking the ocean at the end of Pelantar II pier.\n\nThe Indonesian sea route through the Bintan straits has been considered very safe for sailing of small freighters.<ref name=Hawk/> The island has developed over the centuries in two distinct zones, namely, the southern and the northern zones, which are clearly differentiated from the prevalent life styles of people living there.<ref name=asia/>\n\nThe highest hill on the island is [[Bintan Besar]], which is {{convert|360|m|ft}} in height and has thick forest cover.

As the Dutch ruled over the islands for a long period, their influence is distinctly discerned in the island. Population of Bintan Island is about 400,000 with the citizens mostly belonging to the Malay, Bugis, Chinese and the Orang Laut ethnicity. An observation made on the distribution of different ethnic groups in Bintan is that Indonesians have migrated in large numbers to the island and as result Malays, the original settlers of the region, are now a minority in Riau Archipelago as a whole. This is attributed to the fact that the island is close to Malaysia and Singapore in particular and Indonesians flock to the place to get a foothold to go to Singapore. In the capital city of Tanjung Pinang, the urban population had jumped from 98,871 in 1998 to 134,940 in 2004, and by 2014 had reached 226,716.<ref name= Nordholt>{{Cite book|last= Nordholt|first= Henk Schulte|author2=Geert Arend van Klinken |author3=Gerry Van Klinken |title= Renegotiating boundaries: local politics in post-Suharto Indonesia|page=443|accessdate=2010-06-16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeP-LBnI_LMC&pg=PA445&dq=tanjung+pinang+kota&hl=en&ei=HcgLTPGjGNS_rAeCkbz9DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= KITLV Press|year=2007|isbn=90-6718-283-4}}</ref>\n\n==Economy and development==\n[[File:Bintan Agro Beach Resort4.jpg|thumb|right|Bintan Agro Beach Resort]]\nIn 1824, the Treaty of London finally settled that the islands south of Singapore are Dutch Territories. Bintan was again under the control of the Dutch. Bintan's power and central role disappeared with the regional political changes and the island's past fortune was now overshadowed by neighbouring [[Batam]] and Singapore. Following its founding by the British in 1819, Singapore became a new regional trading centre. Due to its limited size, Singapore initiated the [[Sijori Growth Triangle]] in 1980 and 1990s, and signed agreements with the Indonesian government to invest in Batam and Bintan.<ref name=History/><ref name=\"Peachey, p.9,14,17\">Peachey, pp.9, 14, 17</ref>\n\nThe economy of Bintan island is centred on tourism, given its close proximity to Singapore. In the year 1990, according to a Presidential Decree (25 July 1990), a coordinating team was set up for the Riao Province Development with the mandate to plan and develop development projects within the framework of Indonesia-Singapore cooperation. Investment plans, similar to that of Batam, were evolved with basic intention to provide leisure space to Singaporeans on the white beaches of Bintan and this approach also conformed to the Indonesian Policy of declaring the 1990s as the \"decade of Visit Indonesia\". In 1991, Bintan Management Resort for establishing a resort with intent to develop resorts, industrial parks and water projects was planned. In December 1994, partial opening of Bintan Resort Development was agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding signed by trade ministers of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.<ref name=\"Peachey, p.9,14,17\"/> As per the Master Plan prepared for Bintan, the emphasis was on tourism, industrial projects and agricultural products, all under private-sector initiative, involving formation of a consortium of the Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation, Wah Chang International (whose specialisation is development of resorts), the Keppel group and the local banks.<ref name=Murray>{{Cite book|last=Murray|first=Geoffrey|author2=Audrey Perera|title=Singapore: the global city-state|page=47|accessdate=2010-06-16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRKc_XSHKa4C&pg=PA47&dq=Bintan&hl=en&ei=lrgLTJCuM46CrAe-lNC1DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Bintan&f=false|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year=1996|isbn=0-312-12959-9}}</ref> Thus, the once wild and deserted Bintan island has now become an industrial \"hinterland\" for Singapore and a special investment zone for world industrial companies, also attracting thousands of workers from the entire country. This industrial estate agreement is in partnership with Batamlndo Industrial Park. The Bintan industrial estate has been allotted {{convert|4000|ha|acre}} and is designed as a \"One-stop investment centre\" providing all services essential for the investing companies to devote exclusively towards production. It targets industries such as textiles, garments and wood processing, unlike the Batam industrial estates.

Branch roads were also built to land parcels allotted for resort development. Within each land area allocated, the resort agencies constructed their own internal road network. Drinking water facilities were also created by constructing a reservoir of 5 million litres and a service reservoir of 1.5 million litres for supply to a water treatment plant. From this plant, potable water supply system has been created to all the resort areas. Electricity supply is also ensured through a Power generating plant of 18 MW plant with capacity to upgrade to 24 MW. Within each resort area water and power supply connections to the resorts are done by the resort agencies. The potable water that is supplied meets the [[WHO]] standards. Sewage Treatment is done in all the resorts through modular Sewage treatment plants. The recycled effluent is put to use for irrigation.

There was extensive deforestation done mostly  for the cultivation of [[Uncaria|gambier]] (''Uncaria gembieri''). The plantation size of each gambier plantation was {{convert|30|ha|acre}}. For processing of gambier leaves firewood was essential. This requirement was met by cutting forests of as much as the {{convert|30|ha|acre}} sized gambier plantations. With this amount of [[forest degradation]], the gambier processing could be sustained for 12 years only. Forest was not available for use for the processing, and production of gambier was discontinued, while efforts continued to find new stocks of firewood. Inevitably, Gambier was totally abandoned. In the 20th century rubber plantation replaced gambier. Even the rubber plantations were abandoned due to water logging problems. Now, on the higher reaches of the hills secondary forests have developed in those areas where water logging is not prevalent.

Now, the nests are not found as frequently as in the past. Turtle tracks, nests, eggs, and egg shells have been recorded during patrol surveys conducted during specified periods, not only in Bintan but also in the Pasir Pasan beach. In the Bintan Resort's nestling beaches  [[hawksbill turtle]] (''Eretmochelys imbricata'') and [[green turtles]] (''Chelonia mydas'') have been recorded. Research and Development Department and Environmental & Health Division of Bintan Resort are encouraged by their patrolling efforts and they are confident that sea turtle nests would be protected on Bintan and also conserved in local villages.<ref name=turtle/>\n\n==Historical places==\nAt Bintan and in its close vicinity of its capital city of Tanjung Pinang, there are a number of historical monuments linked to its ancient history and modern developments. Its closeness to Singapore has resulted in development of beaches as popular resorts with hotels and other paraphernalia to attract tourists. Some of the well-known sites of attractions are the Penyengat, Tanjung Pinang city, Raja Ali Haji Monument, the Colonial Graveyard, Chinese Pagodas, Banyan Tree Temple, and its many beaches and resorts. Natural Maritime Culture is also part of the historical nature's heritage of [[mangroves]], many species of animals and birds and the rich and exotic maritime nature of the sea life.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Penyengat===\nPenyengat is a historical small island (about {{convert|2.5|km2|mi2}} in area) located about {{convert|6|km|mi}} offshore of Tanjung Pinang, which was a religious, cultural and administrative centre of the region in the 19th century of the Riao-Johor sultanate.

The Malay and the Bugis, to attain peace in the region, had cemented their relationship by establishing marital ties. Raja Ali Haji, who was the Bugis commander of Bintan and acclaimed as the hero of his people, married his daughter to Sultan Mahmud Shah of Malacca. The island was gifted to his daughter, Raja Hamidah. This union established peace between the Malay and the [[Bugis]]. Following this, a grand mosque (see infobox) called the Masjid Raya was built on the island (over 170 years old), which can be seen from Tanjung Pinang. A monument by the seaside that commemorates Raja Ali Haji, who sacrificed his life for his people against the Dutch, is also seen on the beach.

Crosby was considered as the first multimedia star having appeared in film, radio and recording and in general musically set the benchmark of the intimate ''Easy Listening'' style genre that influenced future male artists including [[Perry Como]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dick Haymes]] and [[Dean Martin]]<ref>Gibbins, Gary \"Bing Crosby: A Pocket Full of Dreams\" published by Little, Brown</ref>. He first started recording in 1927 with [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra, he released his first album containing compilations in 1939, and his first studio album ''[[Ballad for Americans (Bing Crosby album)|Ballad for Americans]]'', (which contained no re-issued singles) in 1940. His final album ''[[Beautiful Memories (album)|Beautiful Memories]]'' was released in 1976, however material recorded before his death was issued posthumously, as the album ''[[Seasons (Bing Crosby album)|Seasons]]'' in 1977. Crosby also recorded with numerous other artists, including [[Al Jolson]], his fellow film star's [[Judy Garland]] and [[Bob Hope]] and most especially [[The Andrews Sisters]].\n\n==Albums==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Album\n!

He and a partner built the first [[ski lift]] and lodge in the remote [[Colorado]] mountain town. Others would continue their work after the war.\n\n==Early life==\nFiske was born in Chicago in 1911, the son of Beulah and William Fiske, a New England banking magnate.<ref name=\"Find a Grave\"/> He attended school in Chicago, and then went to school in France in 1924, where he discovered the sport of bobsled at the age of 16. Fiske attended [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in 1928 where he studied Economics and History.\n\nIn 1936 Ted Ryan, an heir of [[Thomas Fortune Ryan]], brought some photographs of mountains near [[Aspen, Colorado]], to Fiske. They had been given to Ryan by a man trying to interest him in investing in a mining claim. Fiske and Ryan, however, saw in them ideal terrain for [[downhill skiing]], and the [[ski resort]] the pair had been talking about establishing in the United States, similar to those in the Alps where Fiske had competed in the Olympics.<ref name=\"Skiing Heritage Journal article\">Lund, Morten and Mary Hayes.

Many of the abandoned properties around town were available for very low prices. Fiske bought an option on one, and he and Ryan had blueprints drawn up for a [[ski lodge]]. For the next season, they hired guides, including Swiss ski champion [[Andr\u00e9 Roch]], then studying at [[Reed College]] in Oregon. The lodge opened at the end of 1937, and a few weeks later the [[Ski Lift No. 1|Boat Tow]], an early [[ski lift]], opened. These events are considered the beginning of skiing in Aspen.<ref name=\"Skiing Heritage Journal article\" />\n\nFiske then worked at the London office of Dillon, Reed & Co, the New York bankers.

The town's name was first mentioned as \"Byllundt\" in 1454 and as \"Billund\" in 1510.\n\nIn 1880, the town's first windmill was built on the road between [[Vejle]] and [[Varde]]. In 1895, the mill burned to the ground but was rebuilt in 1897, this time in the style of Dutch windmills. That same year, a railway was built from Vejle to Billund, and the route was later extended to [[Grindsted]] in 1914.\n\nIn 1916, [[Ole Kirk Christiansen]], who later founded [[The Lego Group]], bought a Billund furniture company that was founded in 1895. He invested in the town, creating a new dairy and the Skjoldbjerg church a few miles south of town. In 1930, Kirk Christiansen began producing utility items such as ironing boards, stepladders and miniature toys. His first toys were created from scraps from the production of his other goods but his true toy production started in 1932. In 1934, the toy factory was named \"Lego.\"\n\nIn the late 1930s Billund experienced growth due to the factories and began to build waterworks, a gymnasium, and the town hall, though the local power station was closed and relocated.\n\nIn 1942, during the [[Denmark in World War II|Nazi occupation]] in [[World War II]], the old Lego factory was destroyed by fire, but a new one was immediately erected. In 1946, the railway track from Grindsted was extended to the Lego factory. Plastic Lego Bricks were first released from the factory in 1949.\n\nThe 1950s brought a recession to Billund with the closing of the railroad. In response to the growing poverty, the Billund Housing Association was founded and created affordable housing as well as a retirement home. Lego created a large park north of town with a playground, outdoor scene, toboggan hill and a man-made lake in 1959. In 1964 the [[Billund Airport]] was inaugurated, first as the Lego Group's private airport, and was later opened for other uses. Legoland opened in 1968, and Billund again began to experience growth.\n\n== Geography ==\nBillund is located approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) from Grindsted, 56 kilometers (35 miles) from [[Esbjerg]], and 27 kilometers (17 miles) from The Regional Capital of Vejle.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 2012 the town had 6,146 residents. In the beginning of the 1930s Billund was still a small village with only 300 residents. In the 1950s the village reached 500 residents and after this time that number increased rapidly. After only 20 years, in 1970 this number quadrupled to 2,065 residents. Population growth exploded because of Lego's rapid expansion in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe town's demographics are characterized by many families with children; approximately 27.3% of the households in the town consist of couples with children. This is somewhat above the average for the region.
