Commonly regarded as one of his most significant works, ''Station to Station'' was the vehicle for his performance persona, [[the Thin White Duke]]. The album was recorded after he completed shooting [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', and the [[cover art]]work featured a still from the film. During the sessions, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially [[cocaine]], and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\">Buckley (2000): pp. 259, 264.</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nMusically, ''Station to Station'' was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the [[funk]] and [[soul music]] of his previous release, ''[[Young Americans]]'', while presenting a new direction influenced by German [[electronic music|electronic]] bands such as [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work with the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\", recorded with [[Brian Eno]] in 1977\u201379. Bowie himself said that ''Station to Station'' was \"a plea to come back to Europe for me\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> The album's lyrics reflected his preoccupations with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Aleister Crowley]], mythology and religion.\n\nDrawing on funk and [[krautrock]], romantic balladry and [[occultism]], ''Station to Station'' has been described as \"simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Preceded by the single \"[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\", it made the top five in both the UK and US charts. In 2012, the album was ranked No. 324 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based Bowie, fuelled by an \"astronomic\" cocaine habit and subsisting on a diet of [[Capsicum|peppers]] and milk, spent much of 1975\u201376 \"in a state of psychic terror\".<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\"/> Stories\u2014mostly from one interview, pieces of which found their way into ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''Rolling Stone''\u2014circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his [[semen]] stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from [[the Rolling Stones]], and living in morbid fear of fellow [[Aleister Crowley]] aficionado [[Jimmy Page]].<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">Pegg (2004): pp. 297\u2013300.</ref> Bowie would later say of Los Angeles, \"The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the earth\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite journal |last=McKinnon |first=Angus |title=The Future Isn't What It Used to Be |journal=[[NME]] |date=13 September 1980 |pages=32\u201335}}</ref>\n\nIt was on the set of his first major film, ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'', that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called ''The Return of the Thin White Duke''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=So Far Away.. |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=55}}</ref> He was also composing music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]] would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.)<ref>Phillips (1986): p. 290.</ref> Director [[Nicolas Roeg]] warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 260\u2013263.</ref>\n\nThe Thin White Duke became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often during the next six months, for Bowie himself. Impeccably dressed in white shirt, black trousers and waistcoat, the Duke was a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity, yet felt nothing\u2014\"ice masquerading as fire\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 78\u201380.</ref> The persona has been described as \"a mad aristocrat\",<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"an amoral zombie\",<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 258.</ref> and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".<ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Station to Station'' was recorded in late 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]], Los Angeles. In 1981, ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] surmised that it was cut\u2014\"in 10 days of feverish activity\"\u2014when Bowie decided that there was no hope of his producing a soundtrack for ''The Man Who Fell to Earth''.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> More recent scholarship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months\u2014with the sessions beginning in late September<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Kevin Cann (2010).

[[Tony Visconti]], who after a three-year absence had recently returned to the Bowie fold mixing ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and co-producing ''[[David Live]]'' and ''Young Americans'', was not involved due to competing schedules.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 269\u2013270.</ref> However, the recording did cement the band line-up that would see Bowie through the rest of the decade, with bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]] joining ''Young Americans'' drummer [[Dennis Davis]] and rhythm guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nThe recording process developed with this team set the pattern for Bowie's albums up to and including ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' in 1980: backing tracks laid down by Murray, Davis and Alomar; saxophone, keyboard and lead guitar overdubs (here by Bowie, [[Roy Bittan]] and [[Earl Slick]], respectively); lead vocals; and finally various production tricks to complete the song.<ref name=\"Buckley p.270\">Buckley (2000): p. 270.</ref> According to Bowie, \"I got some quite extraordinary things out of Earl Slick.

We experimented so much on it\".<ref name=\"Buckley p.270\"/> Maslin added, \"I loved those sessions because we were totally open and experimental in our approach\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nBowie himself remembered almost nothing of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, \"I know it was in LA because I've read it was\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> The singer was not alone in his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, \"if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke&nbsp;... the coke use is driven by the inspiration.\" Like Bowie, Earl Slick had somewhat vague memories of the recording: \"That album's a little fuzzy\u2014for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts\u2014a lot of hours, a lot of late nights.\"<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nThe sleeve front cover used a black-and-white still from ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'', in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, steps into the space capsule that will return him to his home planet.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssGT7x-jCTYC&pg=PA135 |title=Trajectories of the fantastic: selected essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts |author=Michael A.

[[Nicholas Pegg]], author of ''The Complete David Bowie'', called it a \"precise halfway point on the journey from ''[[Young Americans]]'' to ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it \"effectively divides the '70s for David Bowie. It ties off the era of [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with ''Low''.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> In terms of Bowie's own output, ''Station to Station'''s Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like \"[[Aladdin Sane (song)|Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)]]\" and \"[[Time (David Bowie song)|Time]]\" (1973), while its [[funk]] and [[disco]] elements were a development of the [[soul music|soul]] sound of ''Young Americans'' (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to soak up the influence of  [[krautrock]] and [[electronic music]] by bands like [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. Thematically the album revisited concepts dealt with in songs such as \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" from ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971): [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] '[[\u00dcbermensch|Overman']], the [[occult]]ism of [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Nazism|Nazi]] fascination with [[Holy Grail|Grail]] mythology, and the [[Kabbalah]].<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/><ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Pegg considered the album's theme to be a clash of \"occultism and Christianity\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nWriter David Sheppard described the music of ''Station to Station'' as \"glacial, synthesized [[funk-rock]].\"<ref name=\"she\">{{cite book|last1=Sheppard|first1=David|title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno|date=2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=237}}</ref> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that, \"at its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an [[avant-garde]] [[art-rock]] album\", which includes \"everything from epic [[ballad]]s and [[disco]] to synthesized avant pop\" while extending \"the detached plastic soul of ''Young Americans'' to an elegant, robotic extreme.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=Station to Station \u2013 David Bowie|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=23 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> According to [[Robert Christgau]], Bowie's experimentation with African-American music styles had matured by the time ''Station to Station'' was recorded, as the record appropriated them \"in a decidedly spacy and abrasive context\";<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=5 April 1976|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/bowie-76.php|title=David Bowie Discovers Rock and Roll|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=13 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416193606/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/bowie-76.php|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> he said it added soul to the \"mechanical, fragmented, rather secondhand elegance\" explored on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]''.<ref name=\"CG81\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s Laura Snapes described the record's sound as \"a hybrid of electronic [[rhythm & blues|R&B]],\"<ref name=\"pitch\">{{cite web|last1=Snapes|first1=Laura|title=David Bowie \u2013 Low: Review|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21478-low/|website=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124024605/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21478-low/|archive-date=24 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> while Erlewine considered it \"eerie [[avant-pop]].\"<ref name=\"ab\">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-bowie-mn0000531986/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220160339/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-bowie-mn0000531986/biography|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe musical style of \"Golden Years\", the first track recorded for the album, built on the funk and soul of ''Young Americans'' but with a harsher, grinding edge. It has been described as carrying with it \"an air of regret for missed opportunities and past pleasures\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Bowie said that it was written for\u2014and rejected by\u2014[[Elvis Presley]], while Bowie's wife at the time [[Angela Bowie|Angie]] claimed it was penned for her.<ref name=\"Buckley p.272\u2013273\">Buckley (2000): pp. 272\u2013273.</ref> Though a top ten single on both sides of the Atlantic, it was rarely performed live on the subsequent [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|Isolar Tour]].<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie pp.82\u201383\">Pegg (2004): pp. 82\u201383.</ref> \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" was another riff-driven funk piece, \"recorded very much in our cocaine frenzy\", according to Alomar.<ref name=\"Buckley p.272\u2013273\"/> Its lyrics have been variously interpreted as reflecting on \"the uncertainty of sexual conquest\",<ref name=\"Buckley p.272\u2013273\"/> and as an example of \"the Duke's spurious romanticism\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nThe Christian element of the album was most obvious in the hymn-like \"Word on a Wing\", though for some commentators religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to \"test his numbness\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Bowie himself has claimed that in this song, at least, \"the passion is genuine\".<ref name=\"NME\"/> When performing it live in 1999, the singer described it as coming from \"the darkest days of my life&nbsp;...

I was so furious, I'd put ''so'' much work into it.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Notwithstanding, Harry Maslin argued that Bowie was \"burned out\" and could not complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, \"There were pieces of me laying all over the floor\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into \"[[Subterraneans]]\" on his next studio album, ''Low''.<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\n[[File:David Bowie 1976.jpg|thumb|260px|Bowie, as his persona of [[the Thin White Duke]], on stage during the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|Isolar Tour]] in Toronto.]]\nAfter abandoning the soundtrack album, Bowie went [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|on tour in support of ''Station to Station'']], commencing 2 February 1976 and completing on 18 May 1976.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> [[Kraftwerk]]'s \"[[Radioactivity (song)|Radioactivity]]\" was employed as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'s [[Surrealism|surrealist]] film ''[[Un chien andalou|Un Chien Andalou]]''.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination pp.281\u2013286\">Buckley (2000): pp. 281\u2013286.</ref> The staging featured Bowie, dressed in the Duke's habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of [[Gitanes]] placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among \"curtains of white light\",<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> an effect that spawned the nickname 'the White Light Tour'.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination pp.281\u2013286\"/> In 1989 Bowie reflected, \"I wanted to go back to a kind of [[German Expressionism|Expressionist German-film]] look&nbsp;... and the lighting of, say, [[Fritz Lang]] or [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst|Pabst]]. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity that was sort of aggressive. I think for me, personally, theatrically, that was the most successful tour I've ever done.\"<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\"/> The Isolar Tour was the source of one of the artist's best-known [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]], culled from an [[FM broadcasting|FM radio broadcast]] of his 23 March 1976 concert at [[Nassau Coliseum]].<ref name=\"Strange Fascination pp.281\u2013286\"/> [[Live Nassau Coliseum '76|A live album]] was officially released years later.\n\nBowie drew criticism during the tour for his alleged pro-fascist views.

He staged a country\",<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\">Buckley (2000): pp. 289\u2013291.</ref> but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Isolar Tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of [[Nazism|Nazi]] memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in [[Stockholm]] as saying that \"Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader\".<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 11.</ref> The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called '[[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in ''[[NME]]''. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave,<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie 2\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=The Controversial Homecoming |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=64}}</ref> a contention backed by a young [[Gary Numan]] who was among the crowd that day: \"Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines \"To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading\" from ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''' opening track \"[[It's No Game]]\", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Station to Station'' was a milestone in Bowie's transition to his late 1970s '[[Berlin Trilogy]]'. Bowie himself has said of the album, \"As far as the music goes, ''Low'' and its siblings were a direct follow-on from the title track\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie pp.205\u2013206\"/> while [[Brian Eno]] opined that ''Low'' was \"very much a continuation from ''Station to Station''\".<ref name=\"Low\">Wilcken (2005): p. 4.</ref> It has also been described as \"enormously influential on [[post-punk]]\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\"/> [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote in 1981, \"If ''Low'' was [[Gary Numan]]'s Bowie album, then ''Station to Station'' was [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> However, ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' declared in 2004 that \"just as few had anticipated Bowie's approach, few copied it&nbsp;... for the most part this is an orphaned, abandoned style\".<ref name=\"Stylus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |title=On Second Thought: David Bowie&nbsp;\u2013 Station to Station |author=Mathers, Ian |date=13 April 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66jBYukxy?url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |archive-date=6 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Rob Sheffield]] deemed it a \"[[space rock]] masterpiece\" in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004), writing that Bowie had recorded \"the most intense music of his life\".<ref name=\"RS2004\"/> Jem Aswad of [[NPR]] described the album as \"pioneering ice-funk\" that \"paved the way not only for thousands of artists who were influenced by it, but also for the brilliant wave of experimentation that followed over the next five years: ''Low'', ''Heroes'', ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' and ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aswad|first1=Jem|title=Who Can I Be Now?

Both re-releases used a colour version of the cover art, wherein the photograph occupies the entirety of the front cover apart from the red \"STATIONTOSTATIONDAVIDBOWIE\" text on the top. This modified artwork would be standard for CD issues of the album until 2007, when EMI Japan reused the original black-and-white artwork on a mini-LP release.

The Deluxe Edition included stereo and surround sound remixes of the album by coproducer Harry Maslin.\n\nThe album was remastered again in 2016, for inclusion in the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set, with an individual CD release made available the following year. The box set includes both the original 1976 mix and the 2010 stereo remix of ''Station to Station'', individually packaged in mini LP sleeves.

by English musician [[David Bowie]], released by [[RCA Records]] in 1976. Commonly regarded as one of his most significant works, ''Station to Station'' was the vehicle for his performance persona, [[the Thin White Duke]]. The album was recorded after he completed shooting [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', and the [[cover art]]work featured a still from the film. During the sessions, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially [[cocaine]], and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\">Buckley (2000): pp. 259, 264.</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nMusically, ''Station to Station'' was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the [[funk]] and [[soul music]] of his previous release, ''[[Young Americans]]'', while presenting a new direction influenced by German [[electronic music|electronic]] bands such as [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. This trend would culminate in some of his most acclaimed work with the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\", recorded with [[Brian Eno]] in 1977\u201379. Bowie himself said that ''Station to Station'' was \"a plea to come back to Europe for me\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> The album's lyrics reflected his preoccupations with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Aleister Crowley]], mythology and religion.\n\nDrawing on funk and [[krautrock]], romantic balladry and [[occultism]], ''Station to Station'' has been described as \"simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Preceded by the single \"[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\", it made the top five in both the UK and US charts. In 2012, the album was ranked No. 324 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]]. The album has since been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based Bowie, fuelled by an \"astronomic\" cocaine habit and subsisting on a diet of [[Capsicum|peppers]] and milk, spent much of 1975\u201376 \"in a state of psychic terror\".<ref name=\"Buckley 259,264\"/> Stories\u2014mostly from one interview, pieces of which found their way into ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''Rolling Stone''\u2014circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his [[semen]] stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from [[the Rolling Stones]], and living in morbid fear of fellow [[Aleister Crowley]] aficionado [[Jimmy Page]].<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">Pegg (2004): pp. 297\u2013300.</ref> Bowie would later say of Los Angeles, \"The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the earth\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite journal |last=McKinnon |first=Angus |title=The Future Isn't What It Used to Be |journal=[[NME]] |date=13 September 1980 |pages=32\u201335}}</ref>\n\nIt was on the set of his first major film, ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'', that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called ''The Return of the Thin White Duke''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=So Far Away.. |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=55}}</ref> He was also composing music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of the [[Mamas and the Papas]] would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.)<ref>Phillips (1986): p. 290.</ref> Director [[Nicolas Roeg]] warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 260\u2013263.</ref>\n\nThe Thin White Duke became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often during the next six months, for Bowie himself. Impeccably dressed in white shirt, black trousers and waistcoat, the Duke was a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity, yet felt nothing\u2014\"ice masquerading as fire\".<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">Carr & Murray (1981): pp. 78\u201380.</ref> The persona has been described as \"a mad aristocrat\",<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"an amoral zombie\",<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 258.</ref> and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".<ref>Wilcken (2005): p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Station to Station'' was recorded in late 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]], Los Angeles. In 1981, ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] surmised that it was cut\u2014\"in 10 days of feverish activity\"\u2014when Bowie decided that there was no hope of his producing a soundtrack for ''The Man Who Fell to Earth''.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> More recent scholarship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months\u2014with the sessions beginning in late September<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Kevin Cann (2010).

[[Tony Visconti]], who after a three-year absence had recently returned to the Bowie fold mixing ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' and co-producing ''[[David Live]]'' and ''Young Americans'', was not involved due to competing schedules.<ref>Buckley (2000): pp. 269\u2013270.</ref> However, the recording did cement the band line-up that would see Bowie through the rest of the decade, with bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]] joining ''Young Americans'' drummer [[Dennis Davis]] and rhythm guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]].<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/>\n\nThe recording process developed with this team set the pattern for Bowie's albums up to and including ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' in 1980: backing tracks laid down by Murray, Davis and Alomar; saxophone, keyboard and lead guitar overdubs (here by Bowie, [[Roy Bittan]] and [[Earl Slick]], respectively); lead vocals; and finally various production tricks to complete the song.<ref name=\"Buckley p.270\">Buckley (2000): p. 270.</ref> According to Bowie, \"I got some quite extraordinary things out of Earl Slick.

[[Nicholas Pegg]], author of ''The Complete David Bowie'', called it a \"precise halfway point on the journey from ''[[Young Americans]]'' to ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it \"effectively divides the '70s for David Bowie. It ties off the era of [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with ''Low''.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> In terms of Bowie's own output, ''Station to Station'''s Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like \"[[Aladdin Sane (song)|Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)]]\" and \"[[Time (David Bowie song)|Time]]\" (1973), while its [[funk]] and [[disco]] elements were a development of the [[soul music|soul]] sound of ''Young Americans'' (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to soak up the influence of  [[krautrock]] and [[electronic music]] by bands like [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. Thematically the album revisited concepts dealt with in songs such as \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" from ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971): [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] '[[\u00dcbermensch|Overman']], the [[occult]]ism of [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Nazism|Nazi]] fascination with [[Holy Grail|Grail]] mythology, and the [[Kabbalah]].<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/><ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> Pegg considered the album's theme to be a clash of \"occultism and Christianity\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\nWriter David Sheppard described the music of ''Station to Station'' as \"glacial, synthesized [[funk-rock]].\"<ref name=\"she\">{{cite book|last1=Sheppard|first1=David|title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno|date=2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=237}}</ref> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that, \"at its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an [[avant-garde]] [[art-rock]] album\", which includes \"everything from epic [[ballad]]s and [[disco]] to synthesized avant pop\" while extending \"the detached plastic soul of ''Young Americans'' to an elegant, robotic extreme.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=Station to Station \u2013 David Bowie|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=23 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> According to [[Robert Christgau]], Bowie's experimentation with African-American music styles had matured by the time ''Station to Station'' was recorded, as the record appropriated them \"in a decidedly spacy and abrasive context\";<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=5 April 1976|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/bowie-76.php|title=David Bowie Discovers Rock and Roll|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=13 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416193606/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/bowie-76.php|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> he said it added soul to the \"mechanical, fragmented, rather secondhand elegance\" explored on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]''.<ref name=\"CG81\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s Laura Snapes described the record's sound as \"a hybrid of electronic [[rhythm & blues|R&B]],\"<ref name=\"pitch\">{{cite web|last1=Snapes|first1=Laura|title=David Bowie \u2013 Low: Review|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21478-low/|website=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124024605/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21478-low/|archive-date=24 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> while Erlewine considered it \"eerie [[avant-pop]].\"<ref name=\"ab\">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-bowie-mn0000531986/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220160339/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-bowie-mn0000531986/biography|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe musical style of \"Golden Years\", the first track recorded for the album, built on the funk and soul of ''Young Americans'' but with a harsher, grinding edge.

I was so furious, I'd put ''so'' much work into it.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/> Notwithstanding, Harry Maslin argued that Bowie was \"burned out\" and could not complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, \"There were pieces of me laying all over the floor\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into \"[[Subterraneans]]\" on his next studio album, ''Low''.<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\n[[File:David Bowie 1976.jpg|thumb|260px|Bowie, as his persona of [[the Thin White Duke]], on stage during the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|Isolar Tour]] in Toronto.]]\nAfter abandoning the soundtrack album, Bowie went [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|on tour in support of ''Station to Station'']], commencing 2 February 1976 and completing on 18 May 1976.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> [[Kraftwerk]]'s \"[[Radioactivity (song)|Radioactivity]]\" was employed as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'s [[Surrealism|surrealist]] film ''[[Un chien andalou|Un Chien Andalou]]''.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination pp.281\u2013286\">Buckley (2000): pp. 281\u2013286.</ref> The staging featured Bowie, dressed in the Duke's habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of [[Gitanes]] placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among \"curtains of white light\",<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> an effect that spawned the nickname 'the White Light Tour'.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination pp.281\u2013286\"/> In 1989 Bowie reflected, \"I wanted to go back to a kind of [[German Expressionism|Expressionist German-film]] look&nbsp;... and the lighting of, say, [[Fritz Lang]] or [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst|Pabst]]. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity that was sort of aggressive. I think for me, personally, theatrically, that was the most successful tour I've ever done.\"<ref name=\"Sound + Vision\"/> The Isolar Tour was the source of one of the artist's best-known [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]], culled from an [[FM broadcasting|FM radio broadcast]] of his 23 March 1976 concert at [[Nassau Coliseum]].<ref name=\"Strange Fascination pp.281\u2013286\"/> [[Live Nassau Coliseum '76|A live album]] was officially released years later.\n\nBowie drew criticism during the tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, \"[[Adolf Hitler]] was one of the first rock stars&nbsp;... quite as good as [[Mick Jagger|Jagger]]&nbsp;... He staged a country\",<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\">Buckley (2000): pp. 289\u2013291.</ref> but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Isolar Tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of [[Nazism|Nazi]] memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in [[Stockholm]] as saying that \"Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader\".<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 11.</ref> The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called '[[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in ''[[NME]]''. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave,<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie 2\">{{cite journal |last=Paytress |first=Mark |year=2007 |title=The Controversial Homecoming |journal=Mojo Classic |issue=60 Years of Bowie |page=64}}</ref> a contention backed by a young [[Gary Numan]] who was among the crowd that day: \"Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Buckley pp.289\u2013291\"/> The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines \"To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading\" from ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''' opening track \"[[It's No Game]]\", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.<ref>Carr & Murray (1981): p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Station to Station'' was a milestone in Bowie's transition to his late 1970s '[[Berlin Trilogy]]'. Bowie himself has said of the album, \"As far as the music goes, ''Low'' and its siblings were a direct follow-on from the title track\",<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie pp.205\u2013206\"/> while [[Brian Eno]] opined that ''Low'' was \"very much a continuation from ''Station to Station''\".<ref name=\"Low\">Wilcken (2005): p. 4.</ref> It has also been described as \"enormously influential on [[post-punk]]\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\"/> [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote in 1981, \"If ''Low'' was [[Gary Numan]]'s Bowie album, then ''Station to Station'' was [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s.\"<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> However, ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' declared in 2004 that \"just as few had anticipated Bowie's approach, few copied it&nbsp;... for the most part this is an orphaned, abandoned style\".<ref name=\"Stylus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |title=On Second Thought: David Bowie&nbsp;\u2013 Station to Station |author=Mathers, Ian |date=13 April 2004 |accessdate=2 November 2008 |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66jBYukxy?url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/david-bowie-station-to-station.htm |archive-date=6 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Rob Sheffield]] deemed it a \"[[space rock]] masterpiece\" in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004), writing that Bowie had recorded \"the most intense music of his life\".<ref name=\"RS2004\"/> Jem Aswad of [[NPR]] described the album as \"pioneering ice-funk\" that \"paved the way not only for thousands of artists who were influenced by it, but also for the brilliant wave of experimentation that followed over the next five years: ''Low'', ''Heroes'', ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' and ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aswad|first1=Jem|title=Who Can I Be Now?

The album was released again in 1991 by [[Rykodisc]], with two, live bonus tracks;  a 1999 rerelease by [[EMI]] featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound, but lacks bonus tracks.  Both re-releases used a colour version of the cover art, wherein the photograph occupies the entirety of the front cover apart from the red \"STATIONTOSTATIONDAVIDBOWIE\" text on the top. This modified artwork would be standard for CD issues of the album until 2007, when EMI Japan reused the original black-and-white artwork on a mini-LP release. The album was re-released by EMI in Special and Deluxe Editions in 2010, both of which presented the album in a mini-LP replica sleeve, within a larger box.  The Deluxe Edition included stereo and surround sound remixes of the album by coproducer Harry Maslin.\n\nThe album was remastered again in 2016, for inclusion in the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' box set, with an individual CD release made available the following year. The box set includes both the original 1976 mix and the 2010 stereo remix of ''Station to Station'', individually packaged in mini LP sleeves. The 1976 mix uses the original cover art, while the 2010 mix uses a color-corrected version of the 1991 front cover art; the back cover of the 2010 mix's sleeve is a variant of the 1976 back cover, with burgundy text in place of bright red.

{"title_page": "The Forest of Time", "text_new": "\"'''The Forest of Time'''\" is an [[alternate history]] [[novella]] by [[science-fiction]] writer [[Michael Flynn (writer)|Michael Flynn]]. It was originally published in the June 1987 issue of [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']] magazine. In 1988, the story was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]].  It was reprinted in the anthologies ''[[The Year's Best Science Fiction: Fifth Annual Collection]]'' (1988) and ''[[Roads Not Taken: Tales of Alternate History]]'' (1998), as well as Flynn's short story collection ''[[The Forest of Time and Other Stories]]'' (1997).\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in an alternative world wherein the [[Thirteen Colonies]], after gaining independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], did not succeed in creating the [[United States]], but instead developed into separate and mutually hostile nation-states which often fight bitter wars with each other.\n\nIn the novella, the citizens of [[Pennsylvania]] speak a language they call \"Pennsylvanisch\", which a character describes as \"[a] [[German language|German]] dialect mainly derived from [[Swabian German|Swabian]] and with many [[English language|English]] [[loan word]]s, which a speaker of [[High German]] would find it difficult to follow\".\n\nThis language has a rich literary tradition of which the Pennsylvanians are proud; and they feel suspicious of, and threatened by the hostile English-speaking nations of [[New York (state)|New York]] to their north, and [[Virginia]] to their south.\n\nIn that Pennsylvania, only the [[Quaker]] communities still speak English as their native language, and they are therefore recruited by the Pennsylvanian Intelligence Service as spies to infiltrate the territories of neighboring nations.\n\nThe story's main conflict comes when a Pennsylvanisch officer encounters a man who claims to be from the United States as we, the readers, know it. The officer first regards the man as either truly mad, or feigning madness to cover his mission of espionage for an enemy such as New York, but soon becomes enamored and full of longing for the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] described by the captive.\n\nIn a brief part of the story, the time traveler's journal reveals that he has visited other worlds, including one with an [[Axis victory in World War II]].\n\n==Historical background: A different outcome of the Pennamite\u2013Yankee War==\n\nThe [[Alternate History]] timeline of the story hinges on the historical event known as the [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee Wars]]. In actual history, [[Pennsilvania]] and [[Connecticut]] both laid claim to the [[Wyoming Valley]], both colonies having been granted that territory by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]  back in the 17th Century though only a century later did European settlers overcome [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] resistance and embarked on settling it. Rival settlers from  Pennsilvania (Pennamites) and Connecticut (Yankees) came into violent conflict, both just before and just after the American War of Independence - though very few people were actually killed, so that the term \"war\" for this conflict is rather exaggerated. Eventually, the conflict was settled peaceably: Pennsilvania's possession of the disputed area was confirmed, but the Yankees settled in it were accepted as full-fledged citizens of Pennsilvania,  their main town of [[Wilkes-Barre]] becoming one more Pennsilvanian town (eventually, city). By the early 19th Century the whole issue receded into the past. \n\nHowever, in the Alternate history of Flynn's book, in the 1780's [[George Washington]] took a personal interest in the Pennamite\u2013Yankee War and in a fatally misguided step placed a unit of the Virginia Militia, commanded by himself, as a neutral buffer between Pennamites and Yankees. This culminated with the Virginians being trapped and decimated in a crossfire, Washington himself being among those killed. When the news of  Washington's death reached Philadelphia, where the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was just convening, [[Benjamin Franklin]] suffered a stroke and died, too. The convention broke up in consternation, and the [[Constitution of the United States]] was never adopted and a Federal Government never created. The loose structure of the [[Continental Congress]] eventually disintegrated, with the Thirteen Colonies going each its own way as full-fledged nation states - except that the Yankees of [[New England]] did create their own more narrow confederation.\n\nIn this situation, Yankee settlers - backed by the rest of New England - held on to much of the Wyoming Valley, their conflict with Pennsilvania further escalating. Eventually, two mutually hostile nation states emerged, possessing fully equipped regular armies - hereditary enemies which habitually and repeatedly go to war with each other. To Pennsilvanians, [[Wilkes-Barre]] became a deeply hated enemy capital, created on stolen land which was rightfully Pennsilvania's (reminiscent of the historical conflict between France and Germany over [[Alsace-Lorraine]]). With Pennsilvania adopting the German language while the Yankees remained English-speaking, the political enmity was exacerbated by increasing linguistic and cultural differences. At the same time, Pennsilvania also has marked cultural and political differences from the Prussian-dominated Germany in Europe. Pennsilvanians speak a different kind of German, and pride themselves on having much more free society and political institutions, a difference especially owing to many Pennsilvanians being descended from Liberal political refugees who fled Germany.   \n\nIn the 19th Century, the British helped Chiefs [[Tecumseh]] and [[Sequoyah]] create [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] states which - though thinly populated - were able to stand up to the former Thirteen Colonies - disunited, acting at cross-purposes and often going to war with each other. Eventually, the idea of further westward expansion was abandoned, the European settlement of North America never reached much further than it was at the end of the Eighteenth Century. By 1970 when the story takes place, technology has only reached a lever roughly similar to our history late 19th or early 20th Century. [[Thomas Edison]] did live in this history, but made only a few inventions. [[Henry Ford]] either did not exist at all, or he never built his factory; automobiles are few, hand-made and very expensive, and a case when two of them ''nearly'' collided is remembered as a special occasion. Radio does not yet exist, and the question if it is feasible is hotly debated. \n\nAbout twenty years before, Pennsilvania was involved in a major war, the \"[[Piney (Pine Barrens resident)|The Piney War]]\". Its foes, [[New York (state)|New York State]] and [[Virginia]], sought to partition [[New Jersey]] between themselves and deny Pennsilvania access to the sea; however, the Pennsilvanians proved the victors, trashing their opponents and securing the bulk of New Jersey. The story's Pennsilvanian protagonist had a major role in that war's decisive battle. (Though not explicitly mentioned, for Virginia to be in a position to try conquering parts of New Jersey, Virginia must have swallowed [[Maryland]] at some earlier stage.)       \n  \nAt the time of the story, the Virginians and the New York \"[[Knickerbocker|Knicks]]\", seeking revenge, had forged an alliance with Pennsilvania's hereditary Yankee enemies as well as with the [[Iroquois]] to the west, creating a ring of enemies all around Pennsilvania. Should all of them attack simultaneously from all directions, Pennsilvania would be in a dire situation. The Pennsilvanians' best strategy would be to play for time and seek to create divisions among its enemies - who had often fought each other, even in the recent past - and hope for the anti-Pennsilvanian alliance to fall apart.  \n      \nThe full political and military details are not provided, and only glimpses are given in passing. In this history's nation state of New York, [[New York City]] is far smaller than in our reality and of much less account; decision-making in New York is still to a considerable degree in the hands of [[patroon]]s, Dutch-descended landowners of the [[Hudson Valley]]. In Virginia, effective political power is in the hands of \"The Lee Brothers\", presumably members of the [[Lee family]] which was already prominent in Colonial Virginia; but the story does not tell what is the The Lee Brothers' official and legal position in Virginian politics, or even how many brothers are there. North America is balkanized into many nations and there are passing references to some of them, which are too distant to take direct part in the conflict: The Kingdom of the Carolinas to the south, French-speaking [[Quebec]] to the north, Spanish-speaking [[Aztlan]] far to the west...  \n\nThe story's plot all takes place at a Pennsilvanian ''festung'' ([[star fortress]]) overlooking the no-man's-land of the Wyomoing Valley, whose garrison is tensely expecting the storm to burst. It is into this tense situation that the visitor from another reality is suddenly flung.\n\n==Analysis==\nIn actual US history, a large part of Pennsylvania's population in the 18th century were indeed German-speakers, though the elites in the colony and later state were English-speaking. The numbers of German speakers dwindled in later periods, though the language still survives, especially among the [[Amish]]. It is known as \"[[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania Dutch]]\" (i.e., ''Deutsch'', meaning \"German\" rather than referring to the [[Netherlands]]) and sometimes also called \"Pennsylvanisch\" by its own speakers.\n\nFlynn assumes that in a situation where Pennsylvania became an independent nation-state, distinct from and often fighting with its neighbors, Pennsylvanisch would have had a chance to become the official and dominant language, which later immigrants would learn upon arrival.\n\n==See also==\n* {{slink|GURPS Infinite Worlds|Gallatin}}\n* [[Russian Amerika]]\n* [[The Disunited States of America]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{isfdb title |id=58044}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forest Of Time, The}}\n[[Category:Novelettes]]\n[[Category:German-American history]]\n[[Category:Alternate history novellas]]\n[[Category:Pennsylvania German language]]\n[[Category:1987 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2020}}\n\"'''The Forest of Time'''\" is an [[alternate history]] [[novella]] by [[science-fiction]] writer [[Michael Flynn (writer)|Michael Flynn]].
