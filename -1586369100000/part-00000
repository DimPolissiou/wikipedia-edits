The land-based version was replaced in Soviet service by the [[AZP S-60]] during the 1950s. Guns of this type were successfully used throughout the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against dive bombers and other low- and medium-altitude targets. It also had some usefulness against lightly armoured ground targets. Crews of the 37&nbsp;mm AD guns shot down 14,657 Axis planes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Shunkov V. N. - ''The Weapons of the Red Army''</ref> The mean quantity of 37&nbsp;mm ammunition to shoot down one enemy plane was 905 rounds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Development==\nThe Soviet Navy purchased a number of [[Bofors]] [[Bofors 25 mm M/32|25&nbsp;mm Model 1933]] guns in 1935, trials of the weapon were successful and it was decided to develop a 45&nbsp;mm version of the weapon designated the 49-K. The development under the guidance of leading Soviet designers [[Loginov Mikhail Nikolaevich|M. N. Loginov]], [[I. A. Lyamin]] and [[L. V. Lyuliev]] was successful, but the army thought that the 45&nbsp;mm calibre was a little too large for an automatic field weapon. In January 1938 the [[Kalinin Machine-Building Plant|Artillery Factory Number 8]] in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] was ordered to develop a 37&nbsp;mm weapon based on the same design. The task was fulfilled by the chief designer of the factory, [[Mikhail Loginov]], and his assistant [[Lev Loktev]]. Firing trials of the new 61-K were conducted in October 1938.\n\nCompetitive firing trials were conducted in 1940 between the 61-K and the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm/56]]. There were no substantial differences found between them.\n\n[[File:Armata plot wz39=37mm RB.jpg|right|thumb|61-K in Poznan citadel, Poland]]\n\n===Land version===\nThe weapon was initially installed as a single-barrel weapon on a four-wheeled ZU-7 carriage, and was soon ready for service. An initial order for 900 units was placed. The gun was operated by a crew of eight men. A total of 200 rounds of ammunition were carried which were fed into the gun in five-round clips. Total Soviet production was around 20,000 units, ending in 1945. However, it has also been produced in Poland, China and North Korea.\n\nArmour penetration of the armour-piercing (AP) rounds is reported as 37 millimetres of [[rolled homogeneous armour]] (RHA) at 60\u00b0at 500 metres range and 28 millimetres of RHA at 90\u00b0 at 1,500 metres range.\n\n===Naval version===\nThe naval mounting was produced as the 70K, and had entered service before the German invasion of the Soviet Union replacing the semi-automatic [[45 mm anti-aircraft gun (21-K)|45&nbsp;mm/46 21-K]] on many ships. It was fitted in large numbers to Soviet ships during the Second World War, including the T301 class minesweeper. The V70K was produced until 1955, with a total of 3,113 built.\n\n[[File:V-11 memorial.JPG|thumb|right|V-11 as a memorial to the defenders of [[Seraya Loshad]] fort]]\nOne drawback was that the 70K required a barrel change after every 100 rounds fired. To improve on this, a twin-barrel water cooled mount, the V-11 (called \"W-11\" in East Germany and Poland because of different Cyrillic transliteration), entered service in 1946, and was in production until 1957. A total of 1,872 V-11 mounts were built.\n\nAfter this an 85-[[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|calibre]] {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mounts long version, the 45&nbsp;mm/85, was developed and accepted into service in 1954, it was deployed in twin and quad turrets on a number of classes of vessels, including the ''[[Neustrashimyy]]'', ''[[Kildin class destroyer|Kildin]]'' and [[Kotlin class destroyer|''Kotlin'' class]] [[destroyer]]s. However it was later replaced with the ZIF-31 twin 57&nbsp;mm mounting.\n\nThe 37&nbsp;mm twin mounting was exported to China where it was manufactured and used extensively, as the \"Type 65\". A turret based version was produced from the late 1980s called the \"Type 76\" or H/PJA 76.\n\n===ZSU-37===\nThe [[ZSU-37]] was developed late in the Second World War, it was a single 37&nbsp;mm gun mounted in a large open turret on the chassis of the [[SU-76]] self-propelled gun .\n\n==Specifications==\n{|class=wikitable\n!| Designation || M1939 || 70K <br>(naval) || V-11-M <br>(naval) || 45&nbsp;mm <br>(naval)\n|-\n| '''Barrels''' || 1 || 1 || 2 || 4 or 2\n|-\n| '''Calibre'''\n|colspan=3| 37&nbsp;mm <br>(1.45&nbsp;in)\n|-\n\n| '''Barrel length''' || 2.73 m <br>(9&nbsp;ft) || 2.3 m <br>(7.54&nbsp;ft) || 2.3 m <br>(7.54&nbsp;ft) || 3.8 m <br>(12.46&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n| '''Muzzle velocity'''\n|colspan=3| 880&nbsp;m/s <br>(2,887&nbsp;ft/s)\n|| 900&nbsp;m/s <br>(2,953&nbsp;ft/s)\n|-\n| '''Weight''' || 2,100&nbsp;kg <br>(4,630&nbsp;lbs) || 1,750&nbsp;kg <br>(3,858&nbsp;lbs) || 3,450&nbsp;kg <br>(7,606&nbsp;lbs) || ?\n|-\n| '''Length''' || 5.5 m <br>(18&nbsp;ft) || 3.8 m <br>(12.46&nbsp;ft) || 3.8 m <br>(12.46&nbsp;ft) || 6 m <br>(19.68&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n| '''Width''' || 1.79 m <br>(5.87&nbsp;ft)|| 2.2 m <br>(7.21&nbsp;ft) || 2.75 m <br>(9&nbsp;ft)||\n|-\n| '''Height''' || 2.11 m <br>(7&nbsp;ft) || 2.2 m <br>(7.21&nbsp;ft)|| 1.8 m <br>(6&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n| '''Elevation''' || +85 to <br> \u22125 degrees || +85 to <br> \u221210 degrees || +85 to <br> \u221210 degrees || +90 to <br> 0 degrees\n|-\n| '''Elevation speed''' || ? || 15 degrees / sec || 13 degrees / sec ||  ?\n|-\n| '''Traverse speed''' || ? || 20 degrees / sec || 17 degrees / sec || ?\n|-\n|colspan=4|'''Rate of fire per barrel'''\n|-\n| <br>(cyclic)  || 160 to 170 rpm || 160 to 170 rpm || 160 to 170 rpm\n|-\n| <br>(practical)\n|colspan=3| 80 rpm\n| 100 rpm\n|-\n| '''Maximum range <br>(surface) '''\n|colspan=3| 9,500 m <br>(5.90&nbsp;mi)\n| ?\n|-\n| '''Practical range <br>(surface)'''\n|colspan=3| 4,000 m <br>(2.48&nbsp;mi)\n| 9,000 m\n|-\n| '''Maximum range <br>(air)'''\n|colspan=3| 6,700 m <br>(21,981&nbsp;ft)\n| ?\n|-\n| '''Practical range <br>(air)'''\n|colspan=3| 3,000 m <br>(9,842&nbsp;ft)\n| 6,000 m\n|-\n| '''Crew''' || 8 || 6 || 3 || 4\n|}\n* Recoil length: 150 to 175&nbsp;mm\n\n==Ammunition==\n[[File:Soldiers from 9th Engineer Battalion, place C-4 explosives onto 37mm anti-aircraft rounds to be destroyed near the city of Bayji, June 20, 2004.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from Alpha Company, 9th Engineer Battalion, place C-4 explosives onto 37mm anti-aircraft rounds to be destroyed near the city of Bayji, Iraq, on June 20, 2004.]] \nThe cannon fires 37\u00d7252SR shells.

The land-based version was replaced in Soviet service by the [[AZP S-60]] during the 1950s. Guns of this type were successfully used throughout the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against dive bombers and other low- and medium-altitude targets. It also had some usefulness against lightly armoured ground targets. Crews of the 37&nbsp;mm AD guns shot down 14,657 Axis planes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Shunkov V. N. - ''The Weapons of the Red Army''</ref> The mean quantity of 37&nbsp;mm ammunition to shoot down one enemy plane was 905 rounds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Development==\nThe Soviet Navy purchased a number of [[Bofors]] [[Bofors 25 mm M/32|25&nbsp;mm Model 1933]] guns in 1935, trials of the weapon were successful and it was decided to develop a 45&nbsp;mm version of the weapon designated the 49-K. The development under the guidance of leading Soviet designers [[Loginov Mikhail Nikolaevich|M. N. Loginov]], [[I. A. Lyamin]] and [[L. V. Lyuliev]] was successful, but the army thought that the 45&nbsp;mm calibre was a little too large for an automatic field weapon. In January 1938 the [[Kalinin Machine-Building Plant|Artillery Factory Number 8]] in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] was ordered to develop a 37&nbsp;mm weapon based on the same design. The task was fulfilled by the chief designer of the factory, [[Mikhail Loginov]], and his assistant [[Lev Loktev]]. Firing trials of the new 61-K were conducted in October 1938.\n\nCompetitive firing trials were conducted in 1940 between the 61-K and the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm/56]]. There were no substantial differences found between them.\n\n[[File:Armata plot wz39=37mm RB.jpg|right|thumb|61-K in Poznan citadel, Poland]]\n\n===Land version===\nThe weapon was initially installed as a single-barrel weapon on a four-wheeled ZU-7 carriage, and was soon ready for service. An initial order for 900 units was placed. The gun was operated by a crew of eight men. A total of 200 rounds of ammunition were carried which were fed into the gun in five-round clips. Total Soviet production was around 20,000 units, ending in 1945. However, it has also been produced in Poland, China and North Korea.\n\nArmour penetration of the armour-piercing (AP) rounds is reported as 37 millimetres of [[rolled homogeneous armour]] (RHA) at 60\u00b0at 500 metres range and 28 millimetres of RHA at 90\u00b0 at 1,500 metres range.\n\n===Naval version===\nThe naval mounting was produced as the 70K, and had entered service before the German invasion of the Soviet Union replacing the semi-automatic [[45 mm anti-aircraft gun (21-K)|45&nbsp;mm/46 21-K]] on many ships. It was fitted in large numbers to Soviet ships during the Second World War, including the T301 class minesweeper. The V70K was produced until 1955, with a total of 3,113 built.\n\n[[File:V-11 memorial.JPG|thumb|right|V-11 as a memorial to the defenders of [[Seraya Loshad]] fort]]\nOne drawback was that the 70K required a barrel change after every 100 rounds fired. To improve on this, a twin-barrel water cooled mount, the V-11 (called \"W-11\" in East Germany and Poland because of different Cyrillic transliteration), entered service in 1946, and was in production until 1957. A total of 1,872 V-11 mounts were built.\n\nAfter this an 85-[[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|calibre]] {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mounts long version, the 45&nbsp;mm/85, was developed and accepted into service in 1954, it was deployed in twin and quad turrets on a number of classes of vessels, including the ''[[Neustrashimyy]]'', ''[[Kildin class destroyer|Kildin]]'' and [[Kotlin class destroyer|''Kotlin'' class]] [[destroyer]]s. However it was later replaced with the ZIF-31 twin 57&nbsp;mm mounting.\n\nThe 37&nbsp;mm twin mounting was exported to China where it was manufactured and used extensively, as the \"Type 65\". A turret based version was produced from the late 1980s called the \"Type 76\" or H/PJA 76.\n\n===ZSU-37===\nThe [[ZSU-37]] was developed late in the Second World War, it was a single 37&nbsp;mm gun mounted in a large open turret on the chassis of the [[SU-76]] self-propelled gun .\n\n==Specifications==\n{|class=wikitable\n!| Designation || M1939 || 70K <br>(naval) || V-11-M <br>(naval) || 45&nbsp;mm <br>(naval)\n|-\n| '''Barrels''' || 1 || 1 || 2 || 4 or 2\n|-\n| '''Calibre'''\n|colspan=3| 37&nbsp;mm <br>(1.45&nbsp;in)\n|-\n\n| '''Barrel length''' || 2.73 m <br>(9&nbsp;ft) || 2.3 m <br>(7.54&nbsp;ft) || 2.3 m <br>(7.54&nbsp;ft) || 3.8 m <br>(12.46&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n| '''Muzzle velocity'''\n|colspan=3| 880&nbsp;m/s <br>(2,887&nbsp;ft/s)\n|| 900&nbsp;m/s <br>(2,953&nbsp;ft/s)\n|-\n| '''Weight''' || 2,100&nbsp;kg <br>(4,630&nbsp;lbs) || 1,750&nbsp;kg <br>(3,858&nbsp;lbs) || 3,450&nbsp;kg <br>(7,606&nbsp;lbs) || ?\n|-\n| '''Length''' || 5.5 m <br>(18&nbsp;ft) || 3.8 m <br>(12.46&nbsp;ft) || 3.8 m <br>(12.46&nbsp;ft) || 6 m <br>(19.68&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n| '''Width''' || 1.79 m <br>(5.87&nbsp;ft)|| 2.2 m <br>(7.21&nbsp;ft) || 2.75 m <br>(9&nbsp;ft)||\n|-\n| '''Height''' || 2.11 m <br>(7&nbsp;ft) || 2.2 m <br>(7.21&nbsp;ft)|| 1.8 m <br>(6&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n| '''Elevation''' || +85 to <br> \u22125 degrees || +85 to <br> \u221210 degrees || +85 to <br> \u221210 degrees || +90 to <br> 0 degrees\n|-\n| '''Elevation speed''' || ? || 15 degrees / sec || 13 degrees / sec ||  ?\n|-\n| '''Traverse speed''' || ? || 20 degrees / sec || 17 degrees / sec || ?\n|-\n|colspan=4|'''Rate of fire per barrel'''\n|-\n| <br>(cyclic)  || 160 to 170 rpm || 160 to 170 rpm || 160 to 170 rpm\n|-\n| <br>(practical)\n|colspan=3| 80 rpm\n| 100 rpm\n|-\n| '''Maximum range <br>(surface) '''\n|colspan=3| 9,500 m <br>(5.90&nbsp;mi)\n| ?\n|-\n| '''Practical range <br>(surface)'''\n|colspan=3| 4,000 m <br>(2.48&nbsp;mi)\n| 9,000 m\n|-\n| '''Maximum range <br>(air)'''\n|colspan=3| 6,700 m <br>(21,981&nbsp;ft)\n| ?\n|-\n| '''Practical range <br>(air)'''\n|colspan=3| 3,000 m <br>(9,842&nbsp;ft)\n| 6,000 m\n|-\n| '''Crew''' || 8 || 6 || 3 || 4\n|}\n* Recoil length: 150 to 175&nbsp;mm\n\n==Ammunition==\n[[File:Soldiers from 9th Engineer Battalion, place C-4 explosives onto 37mm anti-aircraft rounds to be destroyed near the city of Bayji, June 20, 2004.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from Alpha Company, 9th Engineer Battalion, place C-4 explosives onto 37mm anti-aircraft rounds to be destroyed near the city of Bayji, Iraq, on June 20, 2004.]] \nThe cannon fires 37\u00d7252SR shells.

Church, Hampstead, external fa\u00e7ade]]\n\n==History==\nSt Mary's was the first Catholic church to be built in Hampstead after the [[English Reformation]] of the 16th century. The Abb\u00e9 Jean-Jacques Morel, a refugee from the [[French Revolution]], was its first pastor. The little chapel was completed in less than a year and opened its doors to worshippers for the first time in August 1816.\n\nBy this time with the final defeat of Napoleon, the majority of French refugees in Hampstead had returned to France and the congregation numbered about a hundred on a regular basis although these numbers were increased in the summer months by itinerant Irish hay-makers who worked in the fields around the village. Education was a priority for the Abb\u00e9 Morel and he undertook the religious education of both boys and young women at several private Catholic schools in Hampstead.  Sometime after the building of the chapel in Holly Place, two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, were set up next to the presbytery and was supported by subscriptions from wealthier parishioners.\n\nSt Mary's Church is located near the top of the hill at 4 Holly Place on Holly Walk, nestled in a row of Georgian houses between Church Row and Mount Vernon. No taller than houses numbered 4 and 5 to either side, the church's distinctive fa\u00e7ade with bell tower and statue of Virgin and Child was designed by architect [[William Wardell]] as the first addition to the original building at the time the law was changed to allow bells to be rung from Catholic churches in 1852.\n\nThe sanctuary is decorated with tile mosaics and the painting of the Assumption of Our Lady was a gift from one of the founders of the chapel, George Armstrong, on behalf of his only daughter Frances Hall. This painting can be seen in the earliest photograph of the interior dating from 1878.\n\nIn the 19th-century a school was built behind the church but demolished in 1907, the land being used to build the present day sanctuary and side chapels. Considerable repairs were made to the presbytery (rectory) in 1978 so that the upstairs now houses the pastor and downstairs a parish centre. The church was closed during 1990 for major building repairs removing the ceiling to reveal the roof timbers that adorn the church today.\n\n[http://www.st.dorothys.talktalk.net St Dorothy's Convent] is nearby at 99 Frognal.
