Costs are paid through funding from federal and provincial general tax revenues which include income taxes, sales taxes and corporate taxes. In British Columbia, taxation-based funding was (until January 1, 2020) supplemented by a fixed monthly premium which is waived or reduced for those on low incomes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp/bc-residents/msp-premium-elimination-jan-1-2020|title=Ministry of Health - Redirect|website=gov.bc.ca}}</ref> In Ontario, there is an income tax identified as a health premium on taxable income above $20,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/health-premium |title=Health Premium |publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario |access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to funding through the tax system, hospitals and medical research are funded in part by charitable contributions.

While viewing studies done in the cities of Quebec as well as Ontario a few interesting facts were seen. For example, studies in Quebec showed that there was a strong relation among dental services and the socioeconomic factors of income and education whereas in Ontario older adults heavily relied on dental insurance with visits to the dentist. \"According to the National Public Health Service in 1996/1997, it showed a whopping difference of people who were in different classes. About half of Canadians aged 15 or older (53%) reported having dental insurance (Table 1). Coverage tended to be highest among middle-aged people. At older ages, the rate dropped, and only one-fifth of the 65-or-older age group (21%) was covered.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/1999001/article/4646-eng.pdf |title=Dental Insurance and use of Dental Services |website=Statcan.gc.ca |access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref> Attributes that can contribute to these outcomes is household income, employment, as well as education.

Because Canada's public policies come from the federal government as well as the provincial governments, these two need to work together in order to create a healthcare plan that is beneficial. There are quite a few plans in which one, 65 years of age or older, can apply for in order to ensure they are covered. These include: [[Old Age Security]] (OAS), [[Guaranteed Income Supplement]] (GIS), Allowance and, [[Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP). The OAS is one in which citizens who have lived in Canada for 10 or more years and are of age 65 or older can apply for. Those who have received the benefit of OAS and have a low income can then apply for the GIS. If a person has received the GIS, their spouse between the ages of 60\u201364 can apply for Allowance. Moving along, those who are in the workforce tend to put money aside for the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) by the time they reach age 65. The CPP is essentially a social insurance program preparing individuals for retirement. To those who obtain the CPP, they receive the benefit of the plan paying for things such as retirement, disability, children's benefits, and more. \"You must apply for OAS, GIS, the Allowance, CPP and other federal programs. You will not receive them automatically.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/seniors/forum/government-income-benefits.html |title=What every older Canadian should know about: Income and benefits from government programs - Canada.ca |date=October 3, 2016 |website=Canada.ca |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref> Although there are these beneficial plans, the need for a better plan of action for seniors is in effect.

For starters, having a shorter wait time for these seniors. As individuals grow older the more care is needed in order to ensure a healthy body and lifestyle and wait times can put a damper on this. Next, having specialized physicians who are knowledgeable with handling seniors in a gentle and well-equipped way. \"Restrictions on government funding has limited access to care\u2014wait-lists are routine, and Canadians are increasingly having difficulties accessing the services of family physicians.

Authors Ruth Lowndes and James Struthers in their dissertation say that there has been an intensification of job precarity, inadequate staffing levels as well as increasingly complex needs including different types of routinized, assembly-lines types of work, and cost-cutting on equipment and supplies. They also point out that within increasing elder [[Population of Canada|population]], the supply of workers is not meeting the demand required to provide adequate care.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lowndes |first=Ruth |last2=Struthers |first2=James |date=Spring 2016 |title=Changes and Continuities in the Workplace of Long-Term Residential Care in Canada, 1970\u20132015 |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=368\u2013395 |doi=10.3138/jcs.50.2.368}}</ref> This idea couples with another study that as we enter the 2020s and 30s, the equipment and processes that nurses undergo will become progressively composite.

However, the Act did give the provinces responsibility for regulating hospitals, and the provinces claimed that their general responsibility for local and private matters encompassed healthcare. The federal government felt that the health of the population fell under the \"[[Peace, order, and good government]]\" part of its responsibilities. This led to several decades of debate over jurisdiction that were not resolved until the 1930s. Eventually, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] decided that the administration and delivery of healthcare was a provincial concern, but that the federal government also had the responsibility of protecting the health and well-being of the population.\n\nBy far the largest government health program is Medicare, which is actually ten provincial programs, such as [[OHIP]] in [[Ontario]], that are required to meet the general guidelines laid out in the federal ''Canada Health Act''. Almost all government health spending goes through Medicare, but there are several smaller programs. The federal government directly administers health to groups such as the military, and inmates of federal prisons. They also provide some care to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and veterans, but these groups mostly use the public system. Prior to 1966, [[Veterans Affairs Canada]] had a large healthcare network, but this was merged into the general system with the creation of Medicare. The largest group the federal government is directly responsible for is [[First Nations]]. Native peoples are a federal responsibility and the federal government guarantees complete coverage of their health needs. For the last twenty years and despite health care being a guaranteed right for First Nations due to the many treaties the government of Canada signed for access to First Nations lands and resources, the amount of coverage provided by the Federal government's [[Non-Insured Health Benefits]] program has diminished drastically for optometry, dentistry, and medicines. Status First Nations individuals qualify for a set number of visits to the optometrist and dentist, with a limited amount of coverage for glasses, eye exams, fillings, root canals, etc. For the most part, First Nations people use normal hospitals and the federal government then fully compensates the provincial government for the expense. The federal government also covers any user fees the province charges. The federal government maintains a network of clinics and health centres on [[Indian reserve|Native Reserves]]. At the provincial level, there are also several much smaller health programs alongside Medicare. The largest of these is the health care costs paid by the [[workers' compensation]] system. Regardless of federal efforts, healthcare for First Nations has generally not been considered effective.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Silversides |first=Ann |date=October 23, 2007 |title=The North \"like Darfur\" |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/9/1013 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=177 |issue=9 |pages=1013\u20134 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.071359 |pmc=2025628 |pmid=17954876}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gao |first=Song |displayauthors=etal |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Access to health care among status Aboriginal people with chronic kidney disease |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/1007 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=1007\u201312 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080063 |pmc=2572655 |pmid=18981441}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Peiris |first=David |last2=Alex Brown |last3=BMed MPH |last4=Alan Cass |last5=MBBS PhD |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Addressing inequities in access to quality health care for indigenous people |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/985 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=985\u20136 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.081445 |pmc=2572646 |pmid=18981431}}</ref>\n\nDespite being a provincial responsibility, the large health costs have long been partially funded by the federal government. The cost-sharing agreement created by the ''[[Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act]]'' and extended by the ''Medical Care Act'' was discontinued in 1977 and replaced by [[Established Programs Financing]]. This gave a bloc transfer to the provinces, giving them more flexibility but also reducing the federal influence on the health system. In 1996, when faced with a large budget shortfall, the Liberal federal government merged the health transfers with the transfers for other social programs into the [[Canada Health and Social Transfer]], and overall funding levels were cut. This placed considerable pressure on the provinces and combined with [[population aging]] and the generally high rate of [[inflation]] in health costs, has caused problems with the system.\n\n==Physicians and medical organization==\nCanada, like its North American neighbour the United States, has a ratio of practising physicians to a population that is below the OECD average<ref name=\"numberofdocs\">[https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm Health resources - Doctors].

Of the approximately 5% of publicly financed care that remains, most has focused on socially marginalized groups (e.g., low-income children and adults), and is supported by different levels of government depending on the group insured [9].\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Qui\u00f1onez, Carlos |last2=Grootendorst, Paul |year=2011 |title=Equity in dental care among Canadian households |journal=International Journal for Equity in Health |volume=10 |pages=14 |doi=10.1186/1475-9276-10-14 |pmc=3097153 |pmid=21496297}}</ref> It is true that compared to primary care checkups, dental care checkups are highly relied on the ability of people being able to pay those fees. While viewing studies done in the cities of Quebec as well as Ontario a few interesting facts were seen. For example, studies in Quebec showed that there was a strong relation among dental services and the socioeconomic factors of income and education whereas in Ontario older adults heavily relied on dental insurance with visits to the dentist. \"According to the National Public Health Service in 1996/1997, it showed a whopping difference of people who were in different classes. About half of Canadians aged 15 or older (53%) reported having dental insurance (Table 1). Coverage tended to be highest among middle-aged people. At older ages, the rate dropped, and only one-fifth of the 65-or-older age group (21%) was covered.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/1999001/article/4646-eng.pdf |title=Dental Insurance and use of Dental Services |website=Statcan.gc.ca |access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref> Attributes that can contribute to these outcomes is household income, employment, as well as education.

To be eligible for coverage for physiotherapy in Ontario, the insured individual has to have been discharged as an inpatient of a hospital after an overnight stay and require physiotherapy for the condition, illness or injury for which he or she was hospitalized, or be age 19 or younger or age 65 or older.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-physiotherapy |title=Get physiotherapy: Get government-funded physiotherapy |website=ontario.ca |publisher=Queen\u2019s Printer for Ontario |access-date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Other coverage limitations===\nCoverage varies for care related to the feet.

Because Canada's public policies come from the federal government as well as the provincial governments, these two need to work together in order to create a healthcare plan that is beneficial. There are quite a few plans in which one, 65 years of age or older, can apply for in order to ensure they are covered. These include: [[Old Age Security]] (OAS), [[Guaranteed Income Supplement]] (GIS), Allowance and, [[Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP). The OAS is one in which citizens who have lived in Canada for 10 or more years and are of age 65 or older can apply for. Those who have received the benefit of OAS and have a low income can then apply for the GIS. If a person has received the GIS, their spouse between the ages of 60\u201364 can apply for Allowance. Moving along, those who are in the workforce tend to put money aside for the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) by the time they reach age 65. The CPP is essentially a social insurance program preparing individuals for retirement. To those who obtain the CPP, they receive the benefit of the plan paying for things such as retirement, disability, children's benefits, and more. \"You must apply for OAS, GIS, the Allowance, CPP and other federal programs. You will not receive them automatically.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/seniors/forum/government-income-benefits.html |title=What every older Canadian should know about: Income and benefits from government programs - Canada.ca |date=October 3, 2016 |website=Canada.ca |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref> Although there are these beneficial plans, the need for a better plan of action for seniors is in effect. Out of the approximately 39 million people in Canada, roughly 6{{nbsp}}million of these people consist of seniors. \"Given these challenges, it is not surprising that nine in ten (90%) Canadians agree that Canada requires a national seniors strategy to address needs along the full continuum of care.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cma.ca/En/Lists/Medias/the-state-of-seniors-health-care-in-canada-september-2016.pdf |title=The State of Seniors Healthcare in Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213191639/https://www.cma.ca/En/Lists/Medias/the-state-of-seniors-health-care-in-canada-september-2016.pdf |archive-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref> In order to ensure maximum coverage of the elderly a few things need to be in order. For starters, having a shorter wait time for these seniors. As individuals grow older the more care is needed in order to ensure a healthy body and lifestyle and wait times can put a damper on this. Next, having specialized physicians who are knowledgeable with handling seniors in a gentle and well-equipped way. \"Restrictions on government funding has limited access to care\u2014wait-lists are routine, and Canadians are increasingly having difficulties accessing the services of family physicians.

And lastly, having continual care for these elders is essential in ensuring the finest [[health care]] available for those in need.

Authors Ruth Lowndes and James Struthers in their dissertation say that there has been an intensification of job precarity, inadequate staffing levels as well as increasingly complex needs including different types of routinized, assembly-lines types of work, and cost-cutting on equipment and supplies. They also point out that within increasing elder [[Population of Canada|population]], the supply of workers is not meeting the demand required to provide adequate care.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lowndes |first=Ruth |last2=Struthers |first2=James |date=Spring 2016 |title=Changes and Continuities in the Workplace of Long-Term Residential Care in Canada, 1970\u20132015 |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=368\u2013395 |doi=10.3138/jcs.50.2.368}}</ref> This idea couples with another study that as we enter the 2020s and 30s, the equipment and processes that nurses undergo will become progressively composite.

However, the Act did give the provinces responsibility for regulating hospitals, and the provinces claimed that their general responsibility for local and private matters encompassed healthcare. The federal government felt that the health of the population fell under the \"[[Peace, order, and good government]]\" part of its responsibilities. This led to several decades of debate over jurisdiction that were not resolved until the 1930s. Eventually, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] decided that the administration and delivery of healthcare was a provincial concern, but that the federal government also had the responsibility of protecting the health and well-being of the population.\n\nBy far the largest government health program is Medicare, which is actually ten provincial programs, such as [[OHIP]] in [[Ontario]], that are required to meet the general guidelines laid out in the federal ''Canada Health Act''. Almost all government health spending goes through Medicare, but there are several smaller programs. The federal government directly administers health to groups such as the military, and inmates of federal prisons. They also provide some care to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and veterans, but these groups mostly use the public system. Prior to 1966, [[Veterans Affairs Canada]] had a large healthcare network, but this was merged into the general system with the creation of Medicare. The largest group the federal government is directly responsible for is [[First Nations]]. Native peoples are a federal responsibility and the federal government guarantees complete coverage of their health needs. For the last twenty years and despite health care being a guaranteed right for First Nations due to the many treaties the government of Canada signed for access to First Nations lands and resources, the amount of coverage provided by the Federal government's [[Non-Insured Health Benefits]] program has diminished drastically for optometry, dentistry, and medicines. Status First Nations individuals qualify for a set number of visits to the optometrist and dentist, with a limited amount of coverage for glasses, eye exams, fillings, root canals, etc. For the most part, First Nations people use normal hospitals and the federal government then fully compensates the provincial government for the expense. The federal government also covers any user fees the province charges. The federal government maintains a network of clinics and health centres on [[Indian reserve|Native Reserves]]. At the provincial level, there are also several much smaller health programs alongside Medicare. The largest of these is the health care costs paid by the [[workers' compensation]] system. Regardless of federal efforts, healthcare for First Nations has generally not been considered effective.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Silversides |first=Ann |date=October 23, 2007 |title=The North \"like Darfur\" |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/9/1013 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=177 |issue=9 |pages=1013\u20134 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.071359 |pmc=2025628 |pmid=17954876}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gao |first=Song |displayauthors=etal |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Access to health care among status Aboriginal people with chronic kidney disease |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/1007 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=1007\u201312 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080063 |pmc=2572655 |pmid=18981441}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Peiris |first=David |last2=Alex Brown |last3=BMed MPH |last4=Alan Cass |last5=MBBS PhD |date=November 4, 2008 |title=Addressing inequities in access to quality health care for indigenous people |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/179/10/985 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=179 |issue=10 |pages=985\u20136 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.081445 |pmc=2572646 |pmid=18981431}}</ref>\n\nDespite being a provincial responsibility, the large health costs have long been partially funded by the federal government. The cost-sharing agreement created by the ''[[Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act]]'' and extended by the ''Medical Care Act'' was discontinued in 1977 and replaced by [[Established Programs Financing]]. This gave a bloc transfer to the provinces, giving them more flexibility but also reducing the federal influence on the health system. In 1996, when faced with a large budget shortfall, the Liberal federal government merged the health transfers with the transfers for other social programs into the [[Canada Health and Social Transfer]], and overall funding levels were cut.

In contrast, Denmark has had a 2-month wait time guarantee for elective surgery (although this may not always have been met, and does not itself show the rates of surgery performed), while in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland (all with near-universal coverage) the majority of patients contacted reported waiting less than 1{{nbsp}}month for elective surgery (an average of 5{{nbsp}}weeks for hip and knee replacements in the Netherlands).\n\nSurveys on waiting times for elective surgery show that the percentage of patients who reported waiting a long time for elective surgery increased greatly in the 1990s, suggesting that waiting times were much shorter before then. Anecdotal (and therefore weak) evidence suggests that waiting times were not perceived as a major problem by the public before cutbacks in the 1990s at a time of greatly increased demand for health care.

It was founded in 2004 with a focus on filmmakers under the age of 35. The  festival presents feature films, shorts, documentaries, and animated films. All programs, screenings, conferences, and exhibitions are free to attend<ref>{{cite web|title=Jameson CineFest |url=https://festagent.com/en/festivals/jameson_fest |website=festagent.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CineFest Miskolc |url=http://cicae.org/en/cicae-art-cinema-awards/festivals-jury-application/cinefest-miskolc |website=cicae.org |date= |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n==History==\n===Miskolc film tradition===\nThe first Hungarian film festival was held in Miskolc in 1938. Using the [[Venice Film Festival]] as an inspiration, the rooms of the Palace Hotel hosted numerous Hungarian stars and directors during the Lillaf\u00fcred National Film Days. For decades since the 1960s, the most important Hungarian documentary and television festivals were also held in Miskolc. In addition to this, Miskolc and its surroundings play a role in the history of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] cinema: [[William Fox (producer)]], founder of [[Fox Film]], which went on to become [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]], was born in the nearby village of [[Tolcsva]]<ref>{{cite web|title=A 20th Century Foxot is magyar alap\u00edtotta |url=http://www.nol.hu/kult/a_20th_century_foxot_is_magyar_alapitotta |website=nol.hu |date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404071833/http://www.nol.hu/kult/a_20th_century_foxot_is_magyar_alapitotta |accessdate=26 March 2020 |archive-date=2010-04-04 |language=hu |trans-title=20th Century Fox was also founded by a Hungarian}}</ref>, while [[Adolph Zukor]], founder of  [[Paramount Pictures]], was born in [[Ricse]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html |website=nytimes.com |date=11 June 1976 |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n===CineFest===\nThe festival was founded in 2004 with the idea of providing young filmmakers a platform to showcase their creations. The event grew with each year, increasing the number of submissions and films screened, and the number of awards grew as well. This was accompanied by film-related programs and workshops, conferences, concerts, and parties.\n\nIn 2010, the  '''CineClassics'''  category was established, drawing attention to Hungarian filmmakers with global renown but little prominence in their home country, such as William Fox and Adolph Zukor. The first to be featured was [[Emeric Pressburger]], the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning British screenwriter-director, born in Miskolc, and best known for his film collaboration with [[Michael Powell]] in the multiple award-winning partnership known as [[Powell and Pressburger|The Archers]].

It was founded in 2004 with a focus on filmmakers under the age of 35. The  festival presents feature films, shorts, documentaries, and animated films. All programs, screenings, conferences, and exhibitions are free to attend<ref>{{cite web|title=Jameson CineFest |url=https://festagent.com/en/festivals/jameson_fest |website=festagent.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CineFest Miskolc |url=http://cicae.org/en/cicae-art-cinema-awards/festivals-jury-application/cinefest-miskolc |website=cicae.org |date= |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n==History==\n===Miskolc film tradition===\nThe first Hungarian film festival was held in Miskolc in 1938. Using the [[Venice Film Festival]] as an inspiration, the rooms of the Palace Hotel hosted numerous Hungarian stars and directors during the Lillaf\u00fcred National Film Days. For decades since the 1960s, the most important Hungarian documentary and television festivals were also held in Miskolc. In addition to this, Miskolc and its surroundings play a role in the history of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] cinema: [[William Fox (producer)]], founder of [[Fox Film]], which went on to become [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]], was born in the nearby village of [[Tolcsva]]<ref>{{cite web|title=A 20th Century Foxot is magyar alap\u00edtotta |url=http://www.nol.hu/kult/a_20th_century_foxot_is_magyar_alapitotta |website=nol.hu |date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404071833/http://www.nol.hu/kult/a_20th_century_foxot_is_magyar_alapitotta |accessdate=26 March 2020 |archive-date=2010-04-04 |language=hu |trans-title=20th Century Fox was also founded by a Hungarian}}</ref>, while [[Adolph Zukor]], founder of  [[Paramount Pictures]], was born in [[Ricse]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html |website=nytimes.com |date=11 June 1976 |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n===CineFest===\nThe festival was founded in 2004 with the idea of providing young filmmakers a platform to showcase their creations. The event grew with each year, increasing the number of submissions and films screened, and the number of awards grew as well. This was accompanied by film-related programs and workshops, conferences, concerts, and parties.\n\nIn 2010, the  '''CineClassics'''  category was established, drawing attention to Hungarian filmmakers with global renown but little prominence in their home country, such as William Fox and Adolph Zukor. The first to be featured was [[Emeric Pressburger]], the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning British screenwriter-director, born in Miskolc, and best known for his film collaboration with [[Michael Powell]] in the multiple award-winning partnership known as [[Powell and Pressburger|The Archers]]. Since 2010, the '''Emeric Pressburger Prize''' has been the highest honour conferred by the festival.\n\nSince 2017, thanks to the festival\u2019s partnership agreement with the [[Shanghai International Film Festival]], works of Chinese cinema have been screened at Miskolc<ref>{{cite web|title=\"SIFF Presents\" at Jameson CineFest Miskolc International Film Festival \u2013 First Stop of the Belt and Road |url=http://www.siff.com/a/2018-09-28/3041.html |website=siff.com |date=28 September 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>.
