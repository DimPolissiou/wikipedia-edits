The massacres were perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists (specifically, the [[OUN]]), German death squads, and local crowds from 30 June to 2 July, and from 25 to 29 July, during the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Thousands of Jews were killed both in the pogroms and in the [[Einsatzgruppen]] killings.\n\nUkrainian nationalists targeted Jews in the first pogrom on the pretext of them being purportedly responsible for the [[NKVD prisoner massacre]] in Lviv, which left behind thousands of corpses in three Lviv prisons. The subsequent massacres were directed by the Germans in the context of [[the Holocaust]] in Eastern Europe. The pogroms were ignored or obfuscated in Ukrainian historical memory, starting with OUN's actions to purge or whitewash its own record of anti-Jewish violence. In 2016, a memorial was erected commemorating the victims of the pogrom on the site of the former [[Golden Rose Synagogue]].<ref>https://www.timesofisrael.com/controversy-as-lviv-opens-jewish-memorial-on-site-of-historic-synagogue</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Lviv]] (Polish: Lw\u00f3w) was a multicultural city just before World War&nbsp;II, with a population of 312,231. The city's 157,490 ethnic Poles constituted just over 50 per cent, with Jews at 32 per cent (99,595) and Ukrainians at 16 per cent (49,747).{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=210}} On 28 September 1939, after the joint Soviet-German invasion, the USSR and Germany signed the [[German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty]], which assigned about 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (77,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of Polish territory inhabited by 13.5&nbsp;million people of all nationalities to the Soviet Union. Lviv was then [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|annexed to the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gross|2002 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XKtOr4EXOWwC&pg=PA17 17, 28\u201330]}}\n\nAccording to Soviet Secret Police ([[NKVD]]) records, nearly 9,000 prisoners were murdered in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] in the [[NKVD prisoner massacres]], after the German invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Berkhoff|2004|page=14}} Due to the confusion during the rapid Soviet retreat and incomplete records, the NKVD number is most likely an undercounting. According to estimates by contemporary historians, the number of victims in [[Western Ukraine]] was probably between 10,000 and 40,000.{{sfn|Kiebuzinski|Motyl|2017|pp=30\u201331}} By ethnicity, Ukrainians comprised roughly 70 per cent of victims, with Poles at 20 per cent.{{sfn|Kiebuzinski|Motyl|2017|p=41}}\n\nPrior to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian nationalists, specifically the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN), had been working with the Germans for some time. The Lviv faction of OUN was under the control of [[Stepan Bandera]]. One of his lieutenants was [[Yaroslav Stetsko]], a virulent antisemite. In 1939, he published an article in which he claimed that Jews were \"nomads and parasites\", a nation of \"swindlers\" and \"egotists\" whose aim was to \"corrupt the heroic culture of warrior nations\". Stetsko also railed against the supposed conspiracy between Jewish capitalists and Jewish Communists.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\n==Pogroms and mass killings==\n===First pogrom===\nAt the time of the German attack on the Soviet Union, about 160,000 Jews lived in the city;{{sfn|Beorn|2018|p=136}} the number had swelled by tens of thousands due to the arrival of Jewish refugees from German-occupied Poland in late 1939.{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}} OUN's preparations for the anticipated German invasion included May 1941 instructions for ethnic cleansing to its planned militia units; the instructions specified that \"Russians, Poles, Jews\" were hostile to the Ukrainian nation and were to be \"destroyed in battle\".{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=224}} Flyers distributed by OUN in the first days of the German invasion instructed the population: \"Don't throw away your weapons yet. Take them up. Destroy the enemy. ... Moscow, the Hungarians, the Jews\u2014these are your enemies. Destroy them.\"{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nLviv was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] in the early hours of 30 June 1941; German forces consisted of the [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain Division]] and the [[Abwehr]]-subordinated [[Nachtigall Battalion]] staffed by ethnic Ukrainians. That day, Jews were press-ganged by the Germans to remove bodies of NKVD's victims from the prisons and to perform other tasks, such as clearing bomb damage and cleaning buildings. Some Jews were abused by the Germans and even murdered, according to survivors. During the afternoon of the same day, the German military reported that the Lviv population was taking out its anger about the prison murders \"on the Jews ... who had always collaborated with the Bolsheviks\".{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=211}} \n<!-- [[File:Ukrainian People's Militia card Nr 53.jpg|thumb|[[Ukrainian People's Militia]] card of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]] member Ivan Kovalyshyn, identified by [[John-Paul Himka]] as one of the pogromists{{sfn|Himka|2015}}]] -->\nDuring the morning of 30 June, an ''ad hoc'' [[Ukrainian People's Militia]] was being formed in the city.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=227}} It included OUN activists who had moved in from [[Krakow]] with the Germans, OUN members who lived in Lviv, and former Soviet policemen\u2014who had either decided to switch sides or who were OUN members that had infiltrated the Soviet police. The OUN encouraged violence against Jews, which began in the afternoon of 30 June, with active participation from the Ukrainian militia who could be identified by armbands in national colours: yellow and blue. Former Soviet policemen wore their blue Soviet uniforms, but with a Ukrainian trident instead of a red star on their hats.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=229}}\n\nDuring the evening of 30 June, Ukrainian nationalists proclaimed an independent Ukrainian state. Signed by Stetsko, the proclamation (\"[[Act of restoration of the Ukrainian state]]\") declared OUN's affinity and future collaboration with Nazi Germany which, according to OUN, was \"helping the Ukrainian people liberate themselves from Muscovite occupation\".{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=223}} At the same time, the news was spreading around the city about the discovery of thousands of corpses in three city prisons in the aftermath of the NKVD massacres.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\nA full-blown [[pogrom]] began on the next day, 1 July. Jews were taken from their apartments, made to clean streets on their hands and knees, or perform rituals that identified them with Communism. Gentile residents assembled in the streets to watch.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=211\u2013212}} Jewish women were singled out for humiliation: they were stripped naked, beaten, and abused. On one such occasion, a German [[Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops|military propaganda company]] filmed the scene. Rapes were also reported.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=213}} Jews continued to be brought to the three prisons, first to exhume the bodies and then to be killed.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=218}} At least two members of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists#Split in the OUN|OUN-B]], Ivan Kovalyshyn and Mykhaylo Pechars\u02b9kyy, have been identified by the historian [[John Paul Himka]] from photographs of the pogrom.{{sfn|Himka|2015}}\n\nAlthough Jews were not considered by the OUN to be their primary enemies (this role was reserved for Poles and Russians), they likely targeted Lviv Jews in an attempt to curry favour with the Germans, in the hopes of being allowed to establish a puppet Ukrainian state. The antisemitism of OUN's leaders, especially Stetsko's, was also a contributing factor.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=234}}\n\n===Einsatzgruppen killings===\nSub-units of [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe C]] arrived on 2 July, at which point violence escalated further. More Jews were brought to the prisons where they were shot and buried in freshly dug pits.{{sfn|Beorn|2018|p=137}} It was also at this point that the Ukrainian militia was subordinated to the SS.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=220\u2013221}} In addition to participation in the pogrom, Einsatzgruppe&nbsp;C conducted a series of mass-murder operations which continued for the next few days. Unlike the \"prison actions\", these shootings were marked by the absence of crowd participation. With assistance from Ukrainian militia, Jews were herded into a stadium, from where they were taken on trucks to the shooting site.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\nThe Ukrainian militia received assistance from the organisational structures of OUN, unorganized ethnic nationalists, as well as from ordinary crowds and underage youth.{{sfn|Breitman|2010|p=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_SpMVUEXINRQC/page/n73 75]: \"In Lw\u00f3w, a leaflet warned Jews that, 'You welcomed Stalin with flowers. We will lay your heads at Hitler's feet.' At a 6 July 1941 meeting in Lw\u00f3w, Bandera loyalists determined: 'We must finish them off...'\"}} German military personnel were frequently on the scene as both onlookers and perpetrators, apparently approving of the anti-Jewish violence and humiliation. During the afternoon of 2 July, the Germans stopped the rioting, confirming that the situation was ultimately under their control from the beginning.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=228}}\n\n===\"Petliura Days\"===\nA second pogrom took place in the last days of July 1941 and was called \"Petliura Days\" (''Aktion Petliura'') after the assassinated Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]].{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}} The killings were organized with German encouragement, while Ukrainian militants from outside the city joined the fray with farm tools. <!---Sheptytsky became disillusioned with Nazi Germany only in mid-1942 after his National Council was banned, with thousands of Ukrainians sent to slave labour.<ref name=\"Paldiel2000\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAgPQaHiMA4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Petlura%20Days&f=false | title=Saving the Jews: Men and Women who Defied the Final Solution | publisher=Taylor Trade Publications | isbn=1589797345 | date=2000 | accessdate=16 March 2015 | author=Mordecai Paldiel | pages=362\u2013364}}</ref><ref name=\"Cymet\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fUJ9pK8aeYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Petliura%20Days&f=false | title=History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church | publisher=Lexington Books | isbn=978-0739132951 | date=2012 | accessdate=16 March 2015 | author=David Cymet | page=232}}</ref>---> In the morning of 25 July, militants began to assemble at the city's police stations. Accompanied by the Ukrainian auxiliary police, they assaulted Jews on the streets with clubs, axes and knives. In the afternoon, arrests and looting began. Consulting prepared lists, policemen arrested Jews in their homes, while civilians participated in acts of violence against Jews in the streets. Many were killed out of sight. According to [[Yad Vashem]], about 2,000 people were murdered in approximately three days.<ref name=\"YadVashem18\">{{Cite web |author=Yad Vashem |year=2005 |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/chronology/1939-1941/1941/chronology_1941_18.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20050311225417/http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/chronology/1939-1941/1941/chronology_1941_18.html%23top |archive-date=11 March 2005 |title=July 25: Pogrom in Lw\u00f3w |work=Chronology of the Holocaust |publisher=Yad Vashem |url-status=dead |author-link=Yad Vashem }}</ref>\n\n==Number of victims==\nThe estimates for the total number of victims vary. A subsequent account by the Lviv [[Judenrat]] estimated that 2,000 Jews disappeared or were killed in the first days of July. A German security report of 16 July stated that 7,000 Jews were \"captured and shot\". The former is possibly an undercounting, while the German numbers are likely exaggerated, in order to impress higher command.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=221}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933\u20131945]]'', the first pogrom resulted in 2,000 to 5,000 Jewish victims. An additional 2,500 to 3,000 Jews were shot in the [[Einsatzgruppen]] killings that immediately followed. During the so-called \"Petliura Days\" massacre of late July, more than 1,000 Jews were killed.{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}} According to the historian [[Peter Longerich]], the first pogrom cost at least 4,000 lives. It was followed by the additional 2,500 to 3,000 arrests and executions in subsequent Einsatzgruppen killings, with \"Petliura Days\" resulting in more than 2,000 victims.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=194}}\n\nThe historian {{Interlanguage link|Dieter Pohl (historian)|lt=Dieter Pohl|de|Dieter Pohl (Historiker)}} estimates that 4,000 of Lviv's Jews were killed in the pogroms between 1 and 25 July.{{sfn|Lower|2012|p=204}} According to the historian [[Richard Breitman]], 5,000 Jews died as a result of the pogroms. In addition, some 3,000 mostly Jews were executed in the municipal stadium by the Germans.{{sfn|Breitman|1991|pp=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nGerman propaganda passed off all victims of the NKVD killings in Lviv as Ukrainians, although about one-third of the names on the Soviet prisoner lists were distinctly Polish or Jewish. Over the next two years both German and pro-Nazi Ukrainian press\u2014including ''Ukrains'ki shchodenni visti'' and ''[[Krakivs'ki visti]]''\u2014went on to describe horrific acts of ''chekist'' ([[Cheka|Soviet secret police]]) torture, real or imagined.{{sfn|Himka|2014}} German propaganda newsreels implicated Soviet Jews in the killing of Ukrainians, and were broadcast across occupied Europe.{{sfn|Himka|2014}}\n\nIn declaring the Ukrainian state, the OUN leadership hoped that the Nazi authorities would accept a fascist Ukraine as a puppet state. These hopes had been fueled by the circle around [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who was subsequently appointed as head of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] and within [[Abwehr]]. Hitler, however, was adamantly opposed to Ukrainian statehood, having set his sights on the ruthless economic exploitation of the newly acquired colonial territories. Bandera was arrested on 5 July and placed under house arrest in Berlin. On 15 September, he was again arrested and spent the next three years as a privileged political prisoner in Germany. He was released in October 1944 to resume his cooperation with the Germans.{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nThe [[Nachtigall Battalion]] was not directly implicated in the Lviv pogrom as an organised formation. Survivors observed Ukrainians in Wehrmacht uniforms participating in the pogroms, but it remains unclear what role the battalion played. The Ukrainian speakers may have been translators attached to other units. Nevertheless, records show that the Nachtigall Battalion subsequently took part in the mass shootings of Jews near [[Vinnytsia]] in July 1941.{{sfn|Rudling|2011|p=9}}\n\nThe [[Lw\u00f3w Ghetto]] was established in November 1941 on the orders of [[Fritz Katzmann]], the [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] (SSPF) of Lemberg.<ref name=\"Koonz\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmchs/documents/KoonzHilbergLecture_002.pdf | title=SS Man Katzmann's \"Solution of the Jewish Question in the District of Galicia\" | publisher=University of Vermont | journal=The Raul Hilberg Lecture | date=2 November 2005 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Claudia Koonz | pages=2, 11, 16\u201318 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205021305/http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmchs/documents/KoonzHilbergLecture_002.pdf | archive-date=5 February 2015 | url-status=dead}}</ref> At its peak, the ghetto held some 120,000 Jews, most of whom were deported to the [[Belzec extermination camp]] or killed locally during the next two years. Following the 1941 pogroms and Einsatzgruppe killings, harsh conditions in the ghetto and deportations to Belzec and the [[Janowska concentration camp]] had resulted in the almost complete annihilation of the Jewish population. By the time Soviet forces reached Lviv on 21 July 1944, less than 1 per cent of Lviv's Jews had survived the occupation.{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}}\n\nFor decades after the war, the pogroms in [[Western Ukraine]] received limited academic attention and were mostly discussed in the context of the series of photographs taken during the Lviv pogrom.<ref name=\"Pohl\"/> The photographs have been variously described by historians as \"infamous\",<ref name=\"Pohl\">{{cite book |last1=Pohl |first1=Dieter| author-link=Dieter Pohl (historian) |date=2008|title=Shared History, Divided Memory |publisher=Leipziger Universit\u00e4tsverlag |isbn=978-3865832405 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_BbvQbiaqAEC&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=%22infamous+photograph+series%22+lviv#v=onepage&q=%22infamous%20photograph%20series%22%20lviv&f=false |accessdate=6 January 2020}}</ref> \"horrific\",{{sfn|Beorn|2018|p=136}} and \"almost iconic\".<ref name=\"Snyder\">{{cite book |last1=Snyder (ed.)|first1=Tymothy |title=Stalin and Europe: Imitation and Domination, 1928\u20131953 |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199945580 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fZBtAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=%22almost+iconic%22+lviv#v=onepage&q=%22almost%20iconic%22%20lviv&f=false |accessdate=6 January 2020}}</ref> Some of the footage and photographs of the first pogrom were misinterpreted as showing NKVD's victims. In fact, these images showed Jewish victims killed after they had exhumed the bodies. They can be identified by white shirts and suspenders, which would have been prohibited in prisons, along with the haphazard body positions. In contrast, NKVD's victims were laid out neatly in rows and had dull-grey clothes.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=217}}\n\n==Manipulation of historical memory==\nOUN's denials of its role in the Holocaust began in 1943 after it became obvious that Germany would lose the war. In October 1943, OUN issued instructions for preparation of materials that would suggest that Germans and Poles bore responsibility for anti-Jewish violence. Further, OUN wanted to spread disinformation that Lviv's Jewish council blamed Ukrainians for the pogroms only because it was under pressure from Germans to do so. The tone of OUN's leaflets and proclamations also changed, omitting the explicit anti-semitic references which they had previously contained.{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Kopstein|Wittenberg|2018|p=92}}\n\nThe whitewashing continued after the war, with OUN's propaganda describing its legacy as a \"heroic Ukrainian resistance against the Nazis and the Communists\".{{sfn|Rudling|2011|p=16}} This was accompanied by a flood of memoirs from veterans of OUN, [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA, which became dominated by OUN members) and [[SS Division Galicia]]. OUN closely guarded its archives, limiting access to information and retyping, back-dating, and censoring its documents before releasing them to scholars. OUN also developed ties to Ukrainian diaspora across the Atlantic, including academics of Ukrainian descent, such as OUN veteran and historian [[Taras Hunczak]] and UPA veteran and historian [[Lev Shankovsky]]. These academics, in turn, produced accounts sympathetic to OUN. After the opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s, it became possible to compare OUN's version of history to authentic documents.{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nModern Lviv is 90 per cent Ukrainian.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=3}} In [[Soviet Ukraine]], as elsewhere in the [[Soviet Union]], Jews, the primary targets of the Nazi genocide, were subsumed into undifferentiated Soviet civilian victims of the war.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=1}} In post-Soviet Ukraine, the new commemorative practices focused primarily on Lviv's Ukrainian past, while the lost Jewish and Polish populations were largely ignored. Some of these practices have been problematic. For example, the site of the [[Prison on \u0141\u0105cki Street]], one of the several locations of the \"prison action\" in July 1941, is now a museum. Its permanent exhibition (as of 2014) did not mention the pogrom.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=3}} No memorial to the Jewish victims of the pogrom existed in the same timeframe.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=10}}\n\nIn 2008, the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU) released documents which it stated indicated that the OUN may have been involved to a lesser degree than originally thought. According to scholars [[John-Paul Himka]], [[Per Anders Rudling]], and Marco Carynnyk, this collection of documents, titled \"For the Beginning: Book of Facts\" (''Do pochatku knyha faktiv''), was an attempt at manipulating and falsifying of World War&nbsp;II history. For example, one of the documents released was an allegedly contemporaneous chronicle of OUN's activities in 1941. In fact, it was clear from the document itself that it was a post-war production. According to Himka, all that this document proved was that OUN wanted to dissociate itself from anti-Jewish violence to aid in its goals of establishing a relationship with the West. The SBU also relied on the \"memoirs\" of a [[Stella Krenzbach]], who was purportedly a Ukrainian Jew fighting in the ranks of the UPA. The memoirs and the figure of Krenzbach herself were likely post-war fabrications by the nationalist Ukrainian diaspora.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/103895/print/|title=Falsifying World War II history in Ukraine|date=8 May 2011|work=Kyiv Post|accessdate=28 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921034823/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/103895/print/|archive-date=21 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://society.lb.ua/life/2009/11/05/13147_Marko_TSarinnik_Istorichna_napivp.html|title=\u0406\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0456\u0432\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u0433\u0456\u0440\u0448\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0443 \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043d\u044e|date=5 November 2009|publisher=LB.ua|accessdate=28 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102223955/http://society.lb.ua/life/2009/11/05/13147_marko_tsarinnik_istorichna_napivp.html|archive-date=2 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Rudling|2011|p=X}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the Jews in Poland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ukraine]]\n* [[Jedwabne pogrom]]\n* [[Kaunas pogrom]]\n* [[\u017bydokomuna]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n*[[Baranovskiy, Mikhail|Baranovsky, Mikhail]] (2020).

The massacres were perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists (specifically, the [[OUN]]), German death squads, and local crowds from 30 June to 2 July, and from 25 to 29 July, during the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Thousands of Jews were killed both in the pogroms and in the [[Einsatzgruppen]] killings.\n\nUkrainian nationalists targeted Jews in the first pogrom on the pretext of them being purportedly responsible for the [[NKVD prisoner massacre]] in Lviv, which left behind thousands of corpses in three Lviv prisons. The subsequent massacres were directed by the Germans in the context of [[the Holocaust]] in Eastern Europe. The pogroms were ignored or obfuscated in Ukrainian historical memory, starting with OUN's actions to purge or whitewash its own record of anti-Jewish violence. In 2016, a memorial was erected commemorating the victims of the pogrom on the site of the former [[Golden Rose Synagogue]].<ref>https://www.timesofisrael.com/controversy-as-lviv-opens-jewish-memorial-on-site-of-historic-synagogue</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Lviv]] (Polish: Lw\u00f3w) was a multicultural city just before World War&nbsp;II, with a population of 312,231. The city's 157,490 ethnic Poles constituted just over 50 per cent, with Jews at 32 per cent (99,595) and Ukrainians at 16 per cent (49,747).{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=210}} On 28 September 1939, after the joint Soviet-German invasion, the USSR and Germany signed the [[German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty]], which assigned about 200,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (77,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of Polish territory inhabited by 13.5&nbsp;million people of all nationalities to the Soviet Union. Lviv was then [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|annexed to the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gross|2002 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XKtOr4EXOWwC&pg=PA17 17, 28\u201330]}}\n\nAccording to Soviet Secret Police ([[NKVD]]) records, nearly 9,000 prisoners were murdered in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] in the [[NKVD prisoner massacres]], after the German invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Berkhoff|2004|page=14}} Due to the confusion during the rapid Soviet retreat and incomplete records, the NKVD number is most likely an undercounting. According to estimates by contemporary historians, the number of victims in [[Western Ukraine]] was probably between 10,000 and 40,000.{{sfn|Kiebuzinski|Motyl|2017|pp=30\u201331}} By ethnicity, Ukrainians comprised roughly 70 per cent of victims, with Poles at 20 per cent.{{sfn|Kiebuzinski|Motyl|2017|p=41}}\n\nPrior to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian nationalists, specifically the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN), had been working with the Germans for some time. The Lviv faction of OUN was under the control of [[Stepan Bandera]]. One of his lieutenants was [[Yaroslav Stetsko]], a virulent antisemite. In 1939, he published an article in which he claimed that Jews were \"nomads and parasites\", a nation of \"swindlers\" and \"egotists\" whose aim was to \"corrupt the heroic culture of warrior nations\". Stetsko also railed against the supposed conspiracy between Jewish capitalists and Jewish Communists.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\n==Pogroms and mass killings==\n===First pogrom===\nAt the time of the German attack on the Soviet Union, about 160,000 Jews lived in the city;{{sfn|Beorn|2018|p=136}} the number had swelled by tens of thousands due to the arrival of Jewish refugees from German-occupied Poland in late 1939.{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}} OUN's preparations for the anticipated German invasion included May 1941 instructions for ethnic cleansing to its planned militia units; the instructions specified that \"Russians, Poles, Jews\" were hostile to the Ukrainian nation and were to be \"destroyed in battle\".{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=224}} Flyers distributed by OUN in the first days of the German invasion instructed the population: \"Don't throw away your weapons yet. Take them up. Destroy the enemy. ... Moscow, the Hungarians, the Jews\u2014these are your enemies. Destroy them.\"{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nLviv was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] in the early hours of 30 June 1941; German forces consisted of the [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain Division]] and the [[Abwehr]]-subordinated [[Nachtigall Battalion]] staffed by ethnic Ukrainians. That day, Jews were press-ganged by the Germans to remove bodies of NKVD's victims from the prisons and to perform other tasks, such as clearing bomb damage and cleaning buildings. Some Jews were abused by the Germans and even murdered, according to survivors. During the afternoon of the same day, the German military reported that the Lviv population was taking out its anger about the prison murders \"on the Jews ... who had always collaborated with the Bolsheviks\".{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=211}} \n<!-- [[File:Ukrainian People's Militia card Nr 53.jpg|thumb|[[Ukrainian People's Militia]] card of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]] member Ivan Kovalyshyn, identified by [[John-Paul Himka]] as one of the pogromists{{sfn|Himka|2015}}]] -->\nDuring the morning of 30 June, an ''ad hoc'' [[Ukrainian People's Militia]] was being formed in the city.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=227}} It included OUN activists who had moved in from [[Krakow]] with the Germans, OUN members who lived in Lviv, and former Soviet policemen\u2014who had either decided to switch sides or who were OUN members that had infiltrated the Soviet police. The OUN encouraged violence against Jews, which began in the afternoon of 30 June, with active participation from the Ukrainian militia who could be identified by armbands in national colours: yellow and blue. Former Soviet policemen wore their blue Soviet uniforms, but with a Ukrainian trident instead of a red star on their hats.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=229}}\n\nDuring the evening of 30 June, Ukrainian nationalists proclaimed an independent Ukrainian state. Signed by Stetsko, the proclamation (\"[[Act of restoration of the Ukrainian state]]\") declared OUN's affinity and future collaboration with Nazi Germany which, according to OUN, was \"helping the Ukrainian people liberate themselves from Muscovite occupation\".{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=223}} At the same time, the news was spreading around the city about the discovery of thousands of corpses in three city prisons in the aftermath of the NKVD massacres.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\nA full-blown [[pogrom]] began on the next day, 1 July. Jews were taken from their apartments, made to clean streets on their hands and knees, or perform rituals that identified them with Communism. Gentile residents assembled in the streets to watch.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=211\u2013212}} Jewish women were singled out for humiliation: they were stripped naked, beaten, and abused. On one such occasion, a German [[Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops|military propaganda company]] filmed the scene. Rapes were also reported.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=213}} Jews continued to be brought to the three prisons, first to exhume the bodies and then to be killed.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=218}} At least two members of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists#Split in the OUN|OUN-B]], Ivan Kovalyshyn and Mykhaylo Pechars\u02b9kyy, have been identified by the historian [[John Paul Himka]] from photographs of the pogrom.{{sfn|Himka|2015}}\n\nAlthough Jews were not considered by the OUN to be their primary enemies (this role was reserved for Poles and Russians), they likely targeted Lviv Jews in an attempt to curry favour with the Germans, in the hopes of being allowed to establish a puppet Ukrainian state. The antisemitism of OUN's leaders, especially Stetsko's, was also a contributing factor.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=234}}\n\n===Einsatzgruppen killings===\nSub-units of [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe C]] arrived on 2 July, at which point violence escalated further. More Jews were brought to the prisons where they were shot and buried in freshly dug pits.{{sfn|Beorn|2018|p=137}} It was also at this point that the Ukrainian militia was subordinated to the SS.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=220\u2013221}} In addition to participation in the pogrom, Einsatzgruppe&nbsp;C conducted a series of mass-murder operations which continued for the next few days. Unlike the \"prison actions\", these shootings were marked by the absence of crowd participation. With assistance from Ukrainian militia, Jews were herded into a stadium, from where they were taken on trucks to the shooting site.{{sfn|Himka|2011|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\nThe Ukrainian militia received assistance from the organisational structures of OUN, unorganized ethnic nationalists, as well as from ordinary crowds and underage youth.{{sfn|Breitman|2010|p=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_SpMVUEXINRQC/page/n73 75]: \"In Lw\u00f3w, a leaflet warned Jews that, 'You welcomed Stalin with flowers. We will lay your heads at Hitler's feet.' At a 6 July 1941 meeting in Lw\u00f3w, Bandera loyalists determined: 'We must finish them off...'\"}} German military personnel were frequently on the scene as both onlookers and perpetrators, apparently approving of the anti-Jewish violence and humiliation. During the afternoon of 2 July, the Germans stopped the rioting, confirming that the situation was ultimately under their control from the beginning.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=228}}\n\n===\"Petliura Days\"===\nA second pogrom took place in the last days of July 1941 and was called \"Petliura Days\" (''Aktion Petliura'') after the assassinated Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]].{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}} The killings were organized with German encouragement, while Ukrainian militants from outside the city joined the fray with farm tools. <!---Sheptytsky became disillusioned with Nazi Germany only in mid-1942 after his National Council was banned, with thousands of Ukrainians sent to slave labour.<ref name=\"Paldiel2000\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAgPQaHiMA4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Petlura%20Days&f=false | title=Saving the Jews: Men and Women who Defied the Final Solution | publisher=Taylor Trade Publications | isbn=1589797345 | date=2000 | accessdate=16 March 2015 | author=Mordecai Paldiel | pages=362\u2013364}}</ref><ref name=\"Cymet\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fUJ9pK8aeYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Petliura%20Days&f=false | title=History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church | publisher=Lexington Books | isbn=978-0739132951 | date=2012 | accessdate=16 March 2015 | author=David Cymet | page=232}}</ref>---> In the morning of 25 July, militants began to assemble at the city's police stations. Accompanied by the Ukrainian auxiliary police, they assaulted Jews on the streets with clubs, axes and knives. In the afternoon, arrests and looting began. Consulting prepared lists, policemen arrested Jews in their homes, while civilians participated in acts of violence against Jews in the streets. Many were killed out of sight. According to [[Yad Vashem]], about 2,000 people were murdered in approximately three days.<ref name=\"YadVashem18\">{{Cite web |author=Yad Vashem |year=2005 |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/chronology/1939-1941/1941/chronology_1941_18.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20050311225417/http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/chronology/1939-1941/1941/chronology_1941_18.html%23top |archive-date=11 March 2005 |title=July 25: Pogrom in Lw\u00f3w |work=Chronology of the Holocaust |publisher=Yad Vashem |url-status=dead |author-link=Yad Vashem }}</ref>\n\n==Number of victims==\nThe estimates for the total number of victims vary. A subsequent account by the Lviv [[Judenrat]] estimated that 2,000 Jews disappeared or were killed in the first days of July. A German security report of 16 July stated that 7,000 Jews were \"captured and shot\". The former is possibly an undercounting, while the German numbers are likely exaggerated, in order to impress higher command.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=221}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933\u20131945]]'', the first pogrom resulted in 2,000 to 5,000 Jewish victims. An additional 2,500 to 3,000 Jews were shot in the [[Einsatzgruppen]] killings that immediately followed. During the so-called \"Petliura Days\" massacre of late July, more than 1,000 Jews were killed.{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}} According to the historian [[Peter Longerich]], the first pogrom cost at least 4,000 lives. It was followed by the additional 2,500 to 3,000 arrests and executions in subsequent Einsatzgruppen killings, with \"Petliura Days\" resulting in more than 2,000 victims.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=194}}\n\nThe historian {{Interlanguage link|Dieter Pohl (historian)|lt=Dieter Pohl|de|Dieter Pohl (Historiker)}} estimates that 4,000 of Lviv's Jews were killed in the pogroms between 1 and 25 July.{{sfn|Lower|2012|p=204}} According to the historian [[Richard Breitman]], 5,000 Jews died as a result of the pogroms. In addition, some 3,000 mostly Jews were executed in the municipal stadium by the Germans.{{sfn|Breitman|1991|pp=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nGerman propaganda passed off all victims of the NKVD killings in Lviv as Ukrainians, although about one-third of the names on the Soviet prisoner lists were distinctly Polish or Jewish. Over the next two years both German and pro-Nazi Ukrainian press\u2014including ''Ukrains'ki shchodenni visti'' and ''[[Krakivs'ki visti]]''\u2014went on to describe horrific acts of ''chekist'' ([[Cheka|Soviet secret police]]) torture, real or imagined.{{sfn|Himka|2014}} German propaganda newsreels implicated Soviet Jews in the killing of Ukrainians, and were broadcast across occupied Europe.{{sfn|Himka|2014}}\n\nIn declaring the Ukrainian state, the OUN leadership hoped that the Nazi authorities would accept a fascist Ukraine as a puppet state. These hopes had been fueled by the circle around [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who was subsequently appointed as head of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] and within [[Abwehr]]. Hitler, however, was adamantly opposed to Ukrainian statehood, having set his sights on the ruthless economic exploitation of the newly acquired colonial territories. Bandera was arrested on 5 July and placed under house arrest in Berlin. On 15 September, he was again arrested and spent the next three years as a privileged political prisoner in Germany. He was released in October 1944 to resume his cooperation with the Germans.{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nThe [[Nachtigall Battalion]] was not directly implicated in the Lviv pogrom as an organised formation. Survivors observed Ukrainians in Wehrmacht uniforms participating in the pogroms, but it remains unclear what role the battalion played. The Ukrainian speakers may have been translators attached to other units.

Following the 1941 pogroms and Einsatzgruppe killings, harsh conditions in the ghetto and deportations to Belzec and the [[Janowska concentration camp]] had resulted in the almost complete annihilation of the Jewish population. By the time Soviet forces reached Lviv on 21 July 1944, less than 1 per cent of Lviv's Jews had survived the occupation.{{sfn|Kulke|2012|p=802}}\n\nFor decades after the war, the pogroms in [[Western Ukraine]] received limited academic attention and were mostly discussed in the context of the series of photographs taken during the Lviv pogrom.<ref name=\"Pohl\"/> The photographs have been variously described by historians as \"infamous\",<ref name=\"Pohl\">{{cite book |last1=Pohl |first1=Dieter| author-link=Dieter Pohl (historian) |date=2008|title=Shared History, Divided Memory |publisher=Leipziger Universit\u00e4tsverlag |isbn=978-3865832405 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_BbvQbiaqAEC&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=%22infamous+photograph+series%22+lviv#v=onepage&q=%22infamous%20photograph%20series%22%20lviv&f=false |accessdate=6 January 2020}}</ref> \"horrific\",{{sfn|Beorn|2018|p=136}} and \"almost iconic\".<ref name=\"Snyder\">{{cite book |last1=Snyder (ed.)|first1=Tymothy |title=Stalin and Europe: Imitation and Domination, 1928\u20131953 |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199945580 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fZBtAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=%22almost+iconic%22+lviv#v=onepage&q=%22almost%20iconic%22%20lviv&f=false |accessdate=6 January 2020}}</ref> Some of the footage and photographs of the first pogrom were misinterpreted as showing NKVD's victims. In fact, these images showed Jewish victims killed after they had exhumed the bodies. They can be identified by white shirts and suspenders, which would have been prohibited in prisons, along with the haphazard body positions. In contrast, NKVD's victims were laid out neatly in rows and had dull-grey clothes.{{sfn|Himka|2011|p=217}}\n\n==Manipulation of historical memory==\nOUN's denials of its role in the Holocaust began in 1943 after it became obvious that Germany would lose the war. In October 1943, OUN issued instructions for preparation of materials that would suggest that Germans and Poles bore responsibility for anti-Jewish violence. Further, OUN wanted to spread disinformation that Lviv's Jewish council blamed Ukrainians for the pogroms only because it was under pressure from Germans to do so. The tone of OUN's leaflets and proclamations also changed, omitting the explicit anti-semitic references which they had previously contained.{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Kopstein|Wittenberg|2018|p=92}}\n\nThe whitewashing continued after the war, with OUN's propaganda describing its legacy as a \"heroic Ukrainian resistance against the Nazis and the Communists\".{{sfn|Rudling|2011|p=16}} This was accompanied by a flood of memoirs from veterans of OUN, [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA, which became dominated by OUN members) and [[SS Division Galicia]]. OUN closely guarded its archives, limiting access to information and retyping, back-dating, and censoring its documents before releasing them to scholars. OUN also developed ties to Ukrainian diaspora across the Atlantic, including academics of Ukrainian descent, such as OUN veteran and historian [[Taras Hunczak]] and UPA veteran and historian [[Lev Shankovsky]]. These academics, in turn, produced accounts sympathetic to OUN. After the opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s, it became possible to compare OUN's version of history to authentic documents.{{sfn|Rudling|2011|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nModern Lviv is 90 per cent Ukrainian.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=3}} In [[Soviet Ukraine]], as elsewhere in the [[Soviet Union]], Jews, the primary targets of the Nazi genocide, were subsumed into undifferentiated Soviet civilian victims of the war.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=1}} In post-Soviet Ukraine, the new commemorative practices focused primarily on Lviv's Ukrainian past, while the lost Jewish and Polish populations were largely ignored. Some of these practices have been problematic. For example, the site of the [[Prison on \u0141\u0105cki Street]], one of the several locations of the \"prison action\" in July 1941, is now a museum. Its permanent exhibition (as of 2014) did not mention the pogrom.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=3}} No memorial to the Jewish victims of the pogrom existed in the same timeframe.{{sfn|Blacker|2014|p=10}}\n\nIn 2008, the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU) released documents which it stated indicated that the OUN may have been involved to a lesser degree than originally thought. According to scholars [[John-Paul Himka]], [[Per Anders Rudling]], and Marco Carynnyk, this collection of documents, titled \"For the Beginning: Book of Facts\" (''Do pochatku knyha faktiv''), was an attempt at manipulating and falsifying of World War&nbsp;II history. For example, one of the documents released was an allegedly contemporaneous chronicle of OUN's activities in 1941. In fact, it was clear from the document itself that it was a post-war production. According to Himka, all that this document proved was that OUN wanted to dissociate itself from anti-Jewish violence to aid in its goals of establishing a relationship with the West. The SBU also relied on the \"memoirs\" of a [[Stella Krenzbach]], who was purportedly a Ukrainian Jew fighting in the ranks of the UPA. The memoirs and the figure of Krenzbach herself were likely post-war fabrications by the nationalist Ukrainian diaspora.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/103895/print/|title=Falsifying World War II history in Ukraine|date=8 May 2011|work=Kyiv Post|accessdate=28 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921034823/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/103895/print/|archive-date=21 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://society.lb.ua/life/2009/11/05/13147_Marko_TSarinnik_Istorichna_napivp.html|title=\u0406\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0456\u0432\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u0433\u0456\u0440\u0448\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0443 \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043d\u044e|date=5 November 2009|publisher=LB.ua|accessdate=28 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102223955/http://society.lb.ua/life/2009/11/05/13147_marko_tsarinnik_istorichna_napivp.html|archive-date=2 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Rudling|2011|p=X}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the Jews in Poland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ukraine]]\n* [[Jedwabne pogrom]]\n* [[Kaunas pogrom]]\n* [[\u017bydokomuna]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n*[[Baranovskiy, Mikhail|Baranovsky, Mikhail]] (2020).

The need for power was great and [[steam power]] had not yet become established. It is estimated that at this time there were well in excess of ten thousand [[watermill]]s in the country.  Most of these were [[wheat|corn]] mills (to grind [[flour]]), but almost any industrial process needing motive power, beyond that available from the muscles of men or animals, used a [[water wheel]], unless a [[windmill]] was preferred.\n\nToday only a fraction of these mills survive. Many are used as private residences, or have been converted into offices or flats.

The need for power was great and [[steam power]] had not yet become established. It is estimated that at this time there were well in excess of ten thousand [[watermill]]s in the country.  Most of these were [[wheat|corn]] mills (to grind [[flour]]), but almost any industrial process needing motive power, beyond that available from the muscles of men or animals, used a [[water wheel]], unless a [[windmill]] was preferred.\n\nToday only a fraction of these mills survive. Many are used as private residences, or have been converted into offices or flats. A small number have been preserved or restored as museums where the public can see the mill in operation.\n[[Image:Kingsbury Water Mill 20031012-007.jpg|thumb|Kingsbury Watermill Museum, St Albans]]\n\nThis is a list of some of the surviving and demolished '''[[watermill]]s and [[tide mill]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]'''.\n{{quote box\n| title = The Lesson of the Water Mill\n| quote =&nbsp;<br>\nListen to the water mill<br>\nThrough the livelong day;<br>\nHow the clicking of the wheel<br>\nWears the hours away.<br>\nLanguidly the autumn wind<br>\nStirs the withered leaves;<br>\nOn the field the reapers sing<br>\nBinding up the sheaves;<br>\nAnd a proverb haunts my mind<br>\nAnd as a spell is cast,<br>\n\"The mill will never grind<br>\nWith the water that has passed.\"<br>\n&nbsp;\n| source = [[Sarah Doudney]],\n| align = right\n| width = 210px\n| fontsize = \n| bgcolor = aliceblue\n| style =\n| title_bg =\n| title_fnt =\n| tstyle = text-align: centre;\n| qalign = right\n| qstyle = text-align: left;\n| quoted = yes\n| salign = right\n| sstyle = text-align: right;}}\n\n== England ==\n\n===Bedfordshire===\n[[File:Stotfold Mill, Mill Lane -

The capital of Gedrosia was Pura, which is probably identical to modern Bamp\u00fbr, forty kilometers west of [[Iranshahr County|Ir\u00e2nshahr]].\n\nGedrosia became famous in Europe when the Macedonian king [[Alexander the Great]] tried to cross the Gedrosian desert and lost one third of his men.\n\nSeveral scholars have argued that the Persian satrapy [[Maka (satrapy)|Maka]] is identical to Gedrosia (which is a Greek name). One argument is the similarity of the name [[Maka (satrapy)|Maka]] to the modern name Makran, a part of [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] that is situated a bit more to the east. However, it is more likely that Maka is to be sought in modern Oman, which was called Maketa in Antiquity.<ref>[https://www.livius.org/ga-gh/gedrosia/gedrosia.html Gedrosia]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Paratan (satrapy)]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Achaemenid Provinces}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gedrosia (Satrapy)}}\n[[Category:Achaemenid satrapies]]\n\n{{MEast-hist-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Bender235", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedrosia_(satrapy)"}

In 1999, he resigned from office over the allegations of certificate forgery. He was later convicted of certificate forgery and sentenced to two years in prison with an option of fine. He paid the fine and was later pardoned by President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].\n\n==Political Career==\nBuhari had been a businessman before his political career. In 1999, Buhari was the speaker of the [[House of Representatives (Nigeria)|Nigeria House of Representatives]], which placed him in the 4th highest office in Nigeria. However, this only lasted for six weeks before his [[University of Toronto]] scandal and the beginning of what was known as the University of Toronto Saga. The scandal ultimately led to his resignation and prosecution.\n\n==Controversies==\nThe news of his age and certificate forgery first broke out on 16 February 1999 by an investigative news publication, [[TheNews magazine]]. Their investigation concluded that Buhari was born in 1970 and not 1963 as he claimed, and also that he did not graduate from the University of Toronto. The article published about the speaker dispelled that the speaker did not attended the university, not to talk of graduating. Section 65(1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria disqualifies anyone below the age of 30 from running for membership of the House of Representatives.\n\nBuhari had also claimed that he completed his '''[[National Youth Service Corps|National Youth Service]]''' at Standard Construction in [[Kano]] which was also not true, as his name could not be found in any record in the list of those who completed the scheme. When Buhari was confronted with multiple allegations about his declaration and falsification, he promptly responded accusing the publications as an attack on him and proclaims his innocence and threatened to file a lawsuit against the publisher for libel. His confidence and response to the allegations were very assertive in nature and quite convincing that he was a victim of a witch-hunt. The magazine had written to the University of Toronto, requesting confirmation that Buhari was an alumnus. In response, Carlo Villanueva, an official of the Institution wrote, \u201c''Regarding your request for confirmation of degree for Mr Ibrahim Salisu Buhari.

It was approved by the [[Cortes Generales|General Court]] on December 13, 1999. This law was developed based on Article 18 of the [[Spanish Constitution|Spanish Constitution of 1978]], the familiar and personal [[right to privacy]], and the secrecy of communications.\n\nIts main objective was to regulate the treatment of data and files, of a personal nature, regardless of the support in which they are treated, the rights of citizens over them and the obligations of those who create or treat them. This law affected all data that referred to registered humans on any support, computer or otherwise. Excluded from this regulation are those data collected for domestic use, classified materials of the state and those files that collected data on Terrorism and other forms of [[organized crime]] (not simple delinquency).\n\nBased on this law, the Spanish Agency for Data Protection was created, at the state level, which ensures compliance with this Law.\n\nThis act was repealed by the passage of a new data protection act, the Organic Law 3/2018 of December 5, about protection of personal data and guarantees of digital rights, to conform the Spanish legislation with the [[General Data Protection Regulation]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673 |title=Ley Org\u00e1nica 3/2018, de 5 de diciembre, de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos Personales y garant\u00eda de los derechos digitales |language=es |access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== Regulatory development ==\n* The Royal Decree 994/1999 on Security Measures for automated files that containing personal data of June 11, 1999 (RMS): It is a regulation that develops the Organic Law 5/1992, of October 29, of Regulation of the Automated Treatment of Personal Data (LORTAD), regulates the technical and organizational measures that must be applied to the information systems in which personal data are processed in an automated way.

These sanctions depend on the violation committed.

Its headquarters are located in Madrid, although the Autonomous Communities of Madrid, the Basque Country and Catalonia have created their own autonomous Agencies.\n\n== Inspection and guardianship of Rights Procedures ==\n\n=== Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD) ===\n\n==== [https://web.archive.org/web/20140318220750/http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/revista_prensa/revista_prensa/2013/notas_prensa/common/octubre/132910_NP_Memoria_2012.pdf Year 2012] ====\nIn 2012 complaints filed with the [[Agency for data protection|AEPD]], increased by 12%. The activity of the Agency has grown significantly in 2012, with an increase of 15% in the files registered and almost 40% in the resolutions issued. The allegations of identity theft, especially in the supply and commercialization of energy and water (222%) and in telecommunications (92%), have experienced a substantial increase. Of the 863 infringement decisions declared to private managers, more than 34% concluded in a warning, without imposing a penalty. On the other hand, most of the sanctions affect the telecommunications sector, which represents 73% of the total. Three of the main operators accumulate 70.94% of the total amount of fines.\n\n==== [https://web.archive.org/web/20140320185731/http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/canaldocumentacion/memorias/memoria_2011/common/Memoria_2011.pdf Year 2011] ====\nIn 2011, reported complaints were 51.6% higher than those filed in 2010. This increase is also reflected in the increase in declaratory resolutions of infringement of 37.7%. However, the application of the figure of the warning has determined a decrease of 14.5% in the declared economic sanctions. The sector where sanctions have increased most (64%) and have been declared to a greater extent (25.5%) and amount, (63%) is that of telecommunications. The amount of sanctions has grown by 12% compared to 2010.\n\n==== Year 2009 ====\nIn 2009 they increased by more than 75% of the complaints received, which reached the figure of 4,136, and the number of requests for protection of rights, by 58%. 709 sanctioning procedures were resolved, of which 621 ended with sanction with a total amount of 24.8 million euros.\n\nSource: Memory of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD) for the years 2007, 2008, 2009.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable col1cen col3cen\"\n|-\n|+'''Number of claims'''\n!Place||Sector of economic activity || Procedures resolved\n|-\n|1||[[Telecommunications]]||908\n|-\n|2||[[Financial sector]]||768\n|-\n|3||[[Closed circuit television|Videovigilance]]||721\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable col1cen col3cen\"\n|-\n|+'''\nNumber of sanctions by sector '''\n!Place||Sector of economic activity || Procedures resolved\n|-\n|1||Telecommunications||170\n|-\n|2||Videovigilance||117\n|-\n|3||Financial sector||89\n|-\n|5||[[Information and communication technologies|Electronic communications]] and [[Spamming|spam]]||39\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable col1cen col3cen\"\n|-\n|+'''Distribution of sanctions due to their seriousness '''\n!Place||Type of sanction||Percentage\n|-\n|1||Serious||74%\n|-\n|2||Minor||21,3%\n|-\n|3||Very Serious||4,6%\n|}\n\n==== Year 2008 ====\nIn 2008 the number of facts reported to the AEPD (together with officio investigations initiated) increased by more than 45%, reaching the value of 2362.

In addition to contributing to that more than 150 million Latin American citizens currently have, along with the traditional protection of [[habeas data]], rules that allow to effectively guarantee the use of their personal information and specialized authorities with powers to protect said guarantee.\n\nIn [[Latin America]] policies are being developed for the protection of personal data. In 2012 two new laws were approved. In [[Nicaragua]], Law No. 787 of Protection of Personal Data, of March 29, 2012 and Statutory Law No. 1581 of October 17, 2012, by which general provisions for the Protection of Personal Data are issued.\n\nIn [[Chile]], also Law 19.628, of August 28, 1999, on Protection of Private Life, is currently in the process of reviewing part of its articles.\n\nThe [[National Assembly of Venezuela]] is processing the bill for the Protection of Personal Data of Habeas Data. And in [[Costa Rica]] there is already a Data Protection Agency of the Republic of Costa Rica, in compliance with the law approved in 2011.\n\n== Information Duty ==\n\nPersonal data are classified according to their greater or lesser degree of sensitivity, being the legal requirements and computer security measures more stringent in terms of this greater degree of sensitivity, being mandatory on the other hand, in any case the declaration of the data protection files to the \"Spanish Agency for Data Protection\".\n\nInterested parties to which personal data are requested must be previously informed in an express, precise and unambiguous way:\n\n1. The existence of a file or treatment of personal data, the purpose of the collection of these and the recipients of the information.\n\n2. Of the obligatory or optional character of his answer to the questions that are posed to them.\n\n3. The consequences of obtaining the data or the refusal to supply them.\n\n4. Of the possibility of exercising rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition.\n\n5. The identity and address of the person responsible for the treatment or, if applicable, his representative.\n\nHowever, the processing of personal data without having been collected directly from the affected party or interested party is permitted, although it is not exempted from the obligation to report expressly, accurately and unequivocally, by the person responsible for the file or its representative, within of the three months following the start of data processing.\n\nException: Communication in three months of such information will not be necessary if the data has been collected from \"sources accessible to the public\",<ref>defined as those \"files whose consultation can be carried out, by any person, not prevented by a rule limitative or without further requirement that, where appropriate, the payment of a consideration \"and\" are considered as sources of public access, exclusively, the promotional census, telephone directories (...) and lists of persons belonging to groups of professionals (...)

In this case the communication will only be legitimate as long as it is limited to the purpose that justifies it.\n# When the communication to be made is addressed to the Ombudsman, the Public Prosecutor or the Judges or Courts or the Court of Accounts, in the exercise of the functions assigned to it. Neither will consent be required when the communication is addressed to autonomous institutions with analogous functions to the Ombudsman or the Court of Auditors.\n# When the transfer occurs between Public Administrations and has as its objective the subsequent processing of the data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.\n# When the transfer of personal data related to health is necessary to solve an emergency that requires access to a file or to perform epidemiological studies in the terms established in the legislation on state or regional health.\n\nThe consent for the communication of personal data to a third party will be void when the information provided to the interested party does not allow him to know the purpose to which the data will be destined whose communication is authorized or the type of activity of the person to whom it is sent. They intend to communicate.\n\nThe consent for the communication of personal data also has a revocable nature.\n\nThe one to whom the personal data are communicated is obliged, by the mere fact of the communication, to observe the provisions of this Law.\n\nIf the communication is made prior to the dissociation procedure, the provisions of the previous sections will not apply.\n\n== Access to the data by third parties ==\n# The access of a third party to the data will not be considered as data communication when said access is necessary for the provision of a service to the data controller.\n# The performance of treatments on behalf of third parties must be regulated in a contract that must be recorded in writing or in some other form that allows proof of its conclusion and content, establishing expressly that the processor will only process the data according to the instructions of the person in charge of the treatment, which will not apply them or use them for purposes other than those stated in said contract, nor will they communicate them, even for their preservation, to other persons. <br> The contract will stipulate, in addition, the security measures to which refers to article 9 of this Law that the person in charge of the treatment is obliged to implement.\n# Once the contractual provision has been fulfilled, the personal data must be destroyed or returned to the data controller, as well as any support or documents that contain any personal data object of the treatment.\n# In the event that the person in charge of the treatment allocates the data for another purpose, communicates them or uses them in breach of the stipulations of the contract, it will also be considered responsible for the treatment, responding to the infractions that would have been incurred personally.\n\n== Criticisms and main problems ==\nCertain aspects of the law were declared unconstitutional in November 2000 and deleted from the current text.\n\nIt is considered that the increase in the creation of files and processing of personal data affects the right to protection of citizens' data; This concern was picked up by the European bodies that even ordered that January 28 be held annually on \"[[European Data Protection Day]]\". The celebration dates back to 2006, when the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe established the annual celebration of the Data Protection Day in Europe on January 28, commemorating the anniversary of the signing of [[Convention 108 of the Council of Europe for the protection of persons with regard to the automated processing of personal data]].\n\nA very strict compliance with the regulation on data protection could slow down the normal work of a File Manager for the documentary accreditation of the information and consent principles of the LOPD; also in the opposite direction, a mere fulfillment of formal obligations, would leave the law senseless and the citizens unprotected and go against the \"spirit\" of the LOPD.\n\nThe possibility that companies can collect data without the consent of the affected has been criticized.\n\nCertain resolutions of the AEPD <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.agpd.es/portalweb/resoluciones/procedimientos_sancionadores/index-ides-idphp.php |title=Some resolutions of the AEPD on its website |access-date=2018-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210205918/https://www.agpd.es/portalweb/resoluciones/procedimientos_sancionadores/index-ides-idphp.php |archive-date=2009-12-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> have been reason for controversy:\n\n* In October 2008, the [[Spanish Agency for Data Protection]] sanctioned the Popular Party ([[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]), then in opposition, with a fine of 60&nbsp;101.21 euros for a serious infringement of the [[Organic Law of Protection of Personal Data]] consisting of the inclusion, without their consent, of four [[O Grove]] neighbors as \"false volunteers\" of the election lists of [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] of May 2007.<ref>[http://www.farodevigo.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2008100100_17_262785__Arousa-Proteccion-Datos-multa-falsos-voluntarios-listas-vascas Data Protection fine to the PP for the 'voluntary volunteers' of the Basque lists]</ref><ref>[http://www.lavozdegalicia.com/galicia/2008/10/01/0003_7186065.htm Data Protection fine to the PP for the \"false volunteers\" from the Basque lists]</ref>\n* The possibility offered by some websites to \"send a friend\" certain information, or \"recommend this page to a friend\" have also been sanctioned in strict application of the LOPD <ref>[http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/485871/04/08/Ojo-al-enviar-datos-a-un-amigo-Proteccion-de-Datos-considera-que-es-sancionable.html Beware of sending data \"to a friend!
