ISIL followed up on its success by attacking the YPG and the FSA in Koban\u00ee Canton in March and fighting its way to the gates of the city of Koban\u00ee in September.\nThe actual [[Siege of Koban\u00ee]] approximately coincided with an escalation in the [[American-led intervention in Syria]].

The US gave intense [[close air support]] to the YPG, and in doing so, started military cooperation with one of the factions.

His great abilities, enthusiasm, and use of practical demonstrations for instruction, made him a successful and highly popular teacher, attracting large classes. At the same time he also maintained a medical practice. In 1747, Cullen was awarded Britain's first independent lectureship in Chemistry and was elected President of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. In 1748 while in Glasgow, Cullen invented the basis for modern refrigeration, although is not credited with a usable application. In 1751 he was appointed [[Regius Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, Glasgow|Professor of the Practice of Medicine]], although he continued to lecture on chemistry.\n\n==Edinburgh==\nIn 1755 he was enticed by [[Lord Kames]] to become Professor of Chemistry and Medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. It was in Edinburgh, in 1756, that he gave the first documented public demonstration of artificial [[refrigeration]].<ref>William Cullen, ''Of the Cold Produced by Evaporating Fluids and of Some Other Means of Producing Cold,'' '''in''' Essays and Observations Physical and Literary Read Before a Society in Edinburgh and Published by Them, II, (Edinburgh 1756)</ref> Cullen used a pump to create a partial [[vacuum]] over a container of [[diethyl ether]], which then [[boiling point|boiled]], absorbing [[Heat of vaporization|heat]] from the surroundings. This created a small amount of ice, but the process found no commercial application.\n\nFrom 1757 he delivered lectures on [[clinical medicine]] in the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. On the death of [[Charles Alston (professor)|Charles Alston]] in 1760, Cullen at the request of the students undertook to finish his course of lectures on ''materia medica''; he delivered an entirely new course, notes of which were published in an unauthorised edition in 1771, but which he re-wrote and issued as ''A Treatise on Materia Medica'' in 1789.\n\nOn the death of [[Robert Whytt]], the professor of the institutes of medicine, Cullen accepted the chair, at the same time resigning that of chemistry. In the same year, he had been an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of the practice of physic (medicine), but subsequently an arrangement was made between him and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]], the successful candidate, by which they both agreed to deliver alternate courses on the theory and practice of medicine. This arrangement continued until the sudden death of Gregory in 1773. Cullen was then appointed sole professor of the practice of physic, and he continued in this office until a few months before his death.\n\nIn 1783 Cullen (together with his sons) was a co-founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"royalsoced.org.uk\"/>\n\nHe died on 5 February 1790 at his home Ormiston Hill<ref>Williamson's Street Directory 1784</ref> in [[Kirknewton, West Lothian]], and is buried in the churchyard there. His son [[Robert Cullen, Lord Cullen|Robert]] lies with him.\n\n==Influence==\n\nCullen taught many students who would go on to influential careers in British science.  Indeed, a large number of the doctors who taught in Edinburgh's medical school from the 1790s to 1810s had studied with him, including the chemist Joseph Black, the anatomist Alexander Monro Secundus, and the naturalist [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]]. Cullen's emphasis on the practical benefits of chemistry made his ideas popular amongst farmers, industrialists, naturalists and doctors alike.  His influence on these fields was felt through the writings of his students, particularly in the books of John Anderson, the 'Aberdeen Agricola',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='The Aberdeen Agricola: Chemical Principles and Practice in James Anderson's Georgics and Geology |journal=In Lawrence Principe (Ed.), New Narratives in Eighteenth-Century Chemistry|volume=18|date=Springer: 2007|pages=139\u2013156|url=https://www.academia.edu/3667295|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6278-0_7|isbn=978-1-4020-6273-5|series=Archimedes}}</ref> and the lectures given by Joseph Black and John Walker from the 1770s to 1790s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750\u20131800|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014}}</ref>\n\nBy studying the symptoms of diseases, Cullen classified diseases into different classes. One class of diseases was called \"neuroses.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-27205-6|location=Cambridge|pages=15\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Medical practice ==\nIn the 18th century, there were three primary professions in medicine: physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, although the barriers among them were starting to become blurred. William Cullen practiced as all three.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=William Cullen and the eighteenth century medical world : a bicentenary exhibition and symposium arranged by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1990|last=Milne|first=I.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-7486-0302-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=110\u2013160}}</ref> Because medical practitioners were not as established as they are now, patients generally took advice from a myriad of sources, including personal experience, books, and several consultations. Furthermore, because the diagnostic tools were not as advanced, patient history was the primary and most important information for the physicians to diagnose their patients.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were no strict government regulations in place for physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> As a result, to become successful in the medical marketplace depended more on social skills than on medical expertise, similar to other forms of businesses.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cullen was one of the more successful physicians because of his shrewdness in handling difficult patients.<ref name=\":0\" /> Teaching at the University and seeing patients at the Edinburgh Infirmary as charity also helped Cullen become more famous.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany of Cullen's consultations were done through written letters sent by patients from Scottish cities and towns.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cullen managed his consultations with great efficiency; he usually read the letters early in the morning and his secretary-amanuensis would record and mail back his responses.<ref name=\":0\" /> He then went around Edinburgh to visit patients. This form of epistolary consultations was often limited by the literacy and socioeconomic status of the patients. Patients who would write letters to Cullen were usually in the upper and middle class. Besides letters from patients, he also consulted physicians, often students he had taught.<ref name=\":0\" /> Based on how his letters were written, Cullen was most likely a \"tactful and compassionate practitioner.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Like many physicians in his time, Cullen would often prescribe therapeutics \"to support the patient's endangered constitution and assist the body's natural healing tendencies.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> This is because medical practitioners at the time mostly believed that diseases and illnesses were unique to different patients depending on their constitutions.\n\n== Medical teaching ==\nAccording to Rocca, Cullen was known for systemizing and promoting medical knowledge rather than producing original research.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Brain, Mind and Medicine: Essays in Eighteenth-Century Neuroscience - Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-70967-3|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-387-70966-6|last1 = Whitaker|first1 = Harry|last2=Smith|first2=C.U.M|last3=Finger|first3=Stanley}}</ref> Despite the lack of original work, some believed that Cullen's attempt to organize existing knowledge was actually a sign of his \"practical sagacity\" as a practitioner.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=William Cullen and the eighteenth century medical world : a bicentenary exhibition and symposium arranged by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1990|last=Milne|first=I.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-7486-0302-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=110\u2013160}}</ref> He was a lecturer for more than forty years.<ref name=\":02\" /> In order to understand Cullen's medical teaching at the time, it is important to understand Cullen's conception of \"system\" as he taught it in his classes. Cullen described a system as \"an organised body of opinions on particular topics in the medical curriculum.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> He also referred to system as the principles in his book ''First Lines of the Practice of Physic.''<ref name=\":02\" /> There were many possible reasons behind Cullen's emphasis of the system of medicine. In the 18th century, a period of Scottish Enlightenment, there were competing theories about the mechanisms of the human body and the causes of diseases proposed by different professors, who competed for students' teaching fees.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thus, having an underlying system of medical knowledge was a practical way to organize the knowledge coherently for the students.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nLike many prominent medical figures in the 18th century, William Cullen took a great interest in the nervous system. He defined the nervous system as an \"animated machine\" whose main function is to \"perform a variety of motions,\" communicate and interact with \"external bodies.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Cullen believed that the nervous system was composed of four elements: the medullary substance, consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, the membranous nerves, the sensory nerves, and the muscular fibers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCullen's understanding of the nervous system was also influenced by his contemporaries, one of whom was [[Albrecht von Haller]] (1708\u20131777).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fe84e265-d9e0-4c7c-a22d-8983fc63ab0a@sessionmgr4010&vid=0&hid=4213&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=101560475&db=hia|title=Cullen, a Cautionary Tale: EBSCOhost|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> Haller proposed that tissues, including muscles, were characterized by \"irritability\" (or contractility), while nerves were characterized by \"sensibility\" (or feeling).<ref name=\":1\" /> Using Haller's characterization, Cullen defined disease \"as an excess or deficiency of sensibility.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> However, Cullen interpreted sensibility as \"muscle mobility and vigour\" and diseases were caused by the imbalance of irritability and sensibility.<ref name=\":1\" /> Based on this definition of disease, his therapeutics \"either stimulated or sedated the nervous system.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> He categorized diseases into four main classes: pyrexiae, neuroses, cachexiae, and locales. Within the classes were nineteen orders and 132 genera.<ref name=\":1\" /> The four orders of neuroses were comata, adynamiae, spasmi and vesaniae.<ref name=\":1\" /> Comata was defined as \"a diminution of voluntary motion, with sleep, or a deprivation of the senses.\" Adynamiae is defined as \"a diminution of the involuntary motions, whether vital or natural.\" Spasmi was defined as \"irregular motions of the muscles or muscular fibers.\" Vesaniae was defined as \"disorders of the judgement without any pyrexia or coma.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCullen's emphasis on the importance of the nervous system was driven by the understanding that the nervous system controls the human body and therefore, \"all diseases may, in some sense, be called affections of the nervous system, because, in almost every disease, the nerves are more or less hurt.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Although Cullen's nosology did not last very long, Cullen's influential teachings on medical knowledge and his attempt to systematize and generalize medical knowledge were integral parts of 18th century Scottish Enlightenment.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Family==\n\nIn 1741 he married Anne (or Anna) Johnstone (d.1786).\n\nHe was father to the judge [[Robert Cullen, Lord Cullen]] and to the physician [[Henry Cullen]]. Cullen's eldest son Robert became a Scottish judge in 1796 under the title of Lord Cullen later Baron Cullen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=as&grp=1095%3BScottish+sitters+and+artists&lDate=&LinkID=mp55787&rNo=0&role=sit |title=NPG D2239; Robert Cullen, Baron Cullen |publisher=Npg.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref> and was known for his powers of [[impressionist (entertainment)|mimicry]].\n\n==Publications==\nBecause of the wide popularity of Cullen's work, many of his publications were translated into a multitude of languages across Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=W.F.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-27205-6|location=New York|pages=11|quote=|via=}}</ref> Cullen's most popular and successful work was his medical textbook ''First Lines of the Practice of Physic'', published in two volumes in 1777 and expanded with each edition until it reached four volumes in its final edition (1784).\n\nHis first book-length publication was ''Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae'' (1769), Cullen's very influential nosology, or classification of diseases. His next publication was also a medical textbook, and it dealt with the Institutions of medicine, i.e. medical theory. Its full title was ''Institutions of Medicine. Part I. Physiology'' (1772) because it focused on physiology, which was traditionally only one part of the Institutions (pathology and therapeutics were also essential parts of medical theory). It went through two more editions (1777 & 1785).\n\nWork on his magnum opus, ''First Lines of Practice of Physic'', occupied much of his time in the 1770s and 1780s, but he did manage one final publication. This was his two volume ''A Treatise of the Materia Medica'' (1789), which was highly valued by other medical practitioners throughout Europe.\n\nThus, the following works, with their dates of publication (including multiple editions), comprise the majority of Cullen's ''oevre'':\n\n*''Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae'' (1769; 1771; 1780; 1785)\n* ''Lectures on the Materia medica''. 2nd Ed.

He began his medical training as apprentice to John Paisley, a [[Glasgow]] apothecary surgeon, then spent 1729 as surgeon on a merchant vessel trading between London and the [[West Indies]]. After two years as assistant apothecary to Mr Murray of Henrietta Street, London, he returned to Scotland in 1732 to establish himself in general medical practice in the parish of [[Shotts]], Lanarkshire. From 1734 to 1736 he studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he became interested in chemistry, and was one of the founders of the [[Royal Medical Society]] in his first year of study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cullenproject.ac.uk/about/|title=About the Cullen Project|last=|first=|date=|website=The Cullen Project|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1736 he began medical practice in Hamilton, where he rapidly acquired a high reputation. He also continued his study of the [[natural science]]s, especially of [[chemistry]]. From 1737 to 1740 [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]] was his resident pupil, and at one time they proposed to enter into partnership. In 1740 Cullen was awarded the degree of MD from [[Glasgow University]]. In 1741, he married and started his family. He became ordinary medical attendant to James Douglas, 5th [[Duke of Hamilton]] (1703\u201343), his family, and his livestock. In 1744, following the Duke's death, the Cullens moved to [[Glasgow]].\n\nIn Glasgow he gave extramural lectures for the University, on physiology, botany, materia medica, and chemistry. His great abilities, enthusiasm, and use of practical demonstrations for instruction, made him a successful and highly popular teacher, attracting large classes. At the same time he also maintained a medical practice. In 1747, Cullen was awarded Britain's first independent lectureship in Chemistry and was elected President of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. In 1748 while in Glasgow, Cullen invented the basis for modern refrigeration, although is not credited with a usable application. In 1751 he was appointed [[Regius Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, Glasgow|Professor of the Practice of Medicine]], although he continued to lecture on chemistry.\n\n==Edinburgh==\nIn 1755 he was enticed by [[Lord Kames]] to become Professor of Chemistry and Medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. It was in Edinburgh, in 1756, that he gave the first documented public demonstration of artificial [[refrigeration]].<ref>William Cullen, ''Of the Cold Produced by Evaporating Fluids and of Some Other Means of Producing Cold,'' '''in''' Essays and Observations Physical and Literary Read Before a Society in Edinburgh and Published by Them, II, (Edinburgh 1756)</ref> Cullen used a pump to create a partial [[vacuum]] over a container of [[diethyl ether]], which then [[boiling point|boiled]], absorbing [[Heat of vaporization|heat]] from the surroundings. This created a small amount of ice, but the process found no commercial application.\n\nFrom 1757 he delivered lectures on [[clinical medicine]] in the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. On the death of [[Charles Alston (professor)|Charles Alston]] in 1760, Cullen at the request of the students undertook to finish his course of lectures on ''materia medica''; he delivered an entirely new course, notes of which were published in an unauthorised edition in 1771, but which he re-wrote and issued as ''A Treatise on Materia Medica'' in 1789.\n\nOn the death of [[Robert Whytt]], the professor of the institutes of medicine, Cullen accepted the chair, at the same time resigning that of chemistry. In the same year he had been an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of the practice of physic (medicine), but subsequently an arrangement was made between him and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]], the successful candidate, by which they both agreed to deliver alternate courses on the theory and practice of medicine. This arrangement continued until the sudden death of Gregory in 1773. Cullen was then appointed sole professor of the practice of physic, and he continued in this office until a few months before his death.\n\nIn 1783 Cullen (together with his sons) was a co-founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"royalsoced.org.uk\"/>\n\nHe died on 5 February 1790 at his home Ormiston Hill<ref>Williamson's Street Directory 1784</ref> in [[Kirknewton, West Lothian]], and is buried in the churchyard there. His son [[Robert Cullen, Lord Cullen|Robert]] lies with him.\n\n==Influence==\n\nCullen taught many students who would go on to influential careers in British science.  Indeed, a large number of the doctors who taught in Edinburgh's medical school from the 1790s to 1810s had studied with him, including the chemist Joseph Black, the anatomist Alexander Monro Secundus, and the naturalist [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]]. Cullen's emphasis on the practical benefits of chemistry made his ideas popular amongst farmers, industrialists, naturalists and doctors alike.  His influence on these fields was felt though the writings of his students, particularly in the books of John Anderson, the 'Aberdeen Agricola',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='The Aberdeen Agricola: Chemical Principles and Practice in James Anderson's Georgics and Geology |journal=In Lawrence Principe (Ed.), New Narratives in Eighteenth-Century Chemistry|volume=18|date=Springer: 2007|pages=139\u2013156|url=https://www.academia.edu/3667295|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6278-0_7|isbn=978-1-4020-6273-5|series=Archimedes}}</ref> and the lectures given by Joseph Black and John Walker from the 1770s to 1790s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750\u20131800|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014}}</ref>\n\nBy studying the symptoms of diseases, Cullen classified diseases into different classes. One class of diseases was called \"neuroses.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-27205-6|location=Cambridge|pages=15\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Medical practice ==\nIn the 18th century, there were three primary professions in medicine: physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, although the barriers among them were starting to become blurred. William Cullen practiced as all three.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=William Cullen and the eighteenth century medical world : a bicentenary exhibition and symposium arranged by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1990|last=Milne|first=I.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-7486-0302-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=110\u2013160}}</ref> Because medical practitioners were not as established as they are now, patients generally took advice from a myriad of sources, including personal experience, books, and several consultations. Furthermore, because the diagnostic tools were not as advanced, patient history was the primary and most important information for the physicians to diagnose their patients.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were no strict government regulations in place for physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> As a result, to become successful in the medical marketplace depended more on social skills than on medical expertise, similar to other forms of businesses.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cullen was one of the more successful physicians because of his shrewdness in handling difficult patients.<ref name=\":0\" /> Teaching at the University and seeing patients at the Edinburgh Infirmary as charity also helped Cullen become more famous.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany of Cullen's consultations were done through written letters sent by patients from Scottish cities and towns.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cullen managed his consultations with great efficiency; he usually read the letters early in the morning and his secretary-amanuensis would record and mail back his responses.<ref name=\":0\" /> He then went around Edinburgh to visit patients. This form of epistolary consultations was often limited by the literacy and socioeconomic status of the patients. Patients who would write letters to Cullen were usually in the upper and middle class. Besides letters from patients, he also consulted physicians, often students he had taught.<ref name=\":0\" /> Based on how his letters were written, Cullen was most likely a \"tactful and compassionate practitioner.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Like many physicians in his time, Cullen would often prescribe therapeutics \"to support the patient's endangered constitution and assist the body's natural healing tendencies.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> This is because medical practitioners at the time mostly believed that diseases and illnesses were unique to different patients depending on their constitutions.\n\n== Medical teaching ==\nAccording to Rocca, Cullen was known for systemizing and promoting medical knowledge rather than producing original research.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Brain, Mind and Medicine: Essays in Eighteenth-Century Neuroscience - Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-70967-3|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-387-70966-6|last1 = Whitaker|first1 = Harry|last2=Smith|first2=C.U.M|last3=Finger|first3=Stanley}}</ref> Despite the lack of original work, some believed that Cullen's attempt to organize existing knowledge was actually a sign of his \"practical sagacity\" as a practitioner.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=William Cullen and the eighteenth century medical world : a bicentenary exhibition and symposium arranged by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1990|last=Milne|first=I.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-7486-0302-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=110\u2013160}}</ref> He was a lecturer for more than forty years.<ref name=\":02\" /> In order to understand Cullen's medical teaching at the time, it is important to understand Cullen's conception of \"system\" as he taught it in his classes. Cullen described a system as \"an organised body of opinions on particular topics in the medical curriculum.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> He also referred to system as the principles in his book ''First Lines of the Practice of Physic.''<ref name=\":02\" /> There were many possible reasons behind Cullen's emphasis of the system of medicine. In the 18th century, a period of Scottish Enlightenment, there were competing theories about the mechanisms of the human body and the causes of diseases proposed by different professors, who competed for students' teaching fees.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thus, having an underlying system of medical knowledge was a practical way to organize the knowledge coherently for the students.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nLike many prominent medical figures in the 18th century, William Cullen took a great interest in the nervous system. He defined the nervous system as an \"animated machine\" whose main function is to \"perform a variety of motions,\" communicate and interact with \"external bodies.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Cullen believed that the nervous system was composed of four elements: the medullary substance, consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, the membranous nerves, the sensory nerves, and the muscular fibers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCullen's understanding of the nervous system was also influenced by his contemporaries, one of whom was [[Albrecht von Haller]] (1708\u20131777).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fe84e265-d9e0-4c7c-a22d-8983fc63ab0a@sessionmgr4010&vid=0&hid=4213&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=101560475&db=hia|title=Cullen, a Cautionary Tale: EBSCOhost|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> Haller proposed that tissues, including muscles, were characterized by \"irritability\" (or contractility), while nerves were characterized by \"sensibility\" (or feeling).<ref name=\":1\" /> Using Haller's characterization, Cullen defined disease \"as an excess or deficiency of sensibility.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> However, Cullen interpreted sensibility as \"muscle mobility and vigour\" and diseases were caused by the imbalance of irritability and sensibility.<ref name=\":1\" /> Based on this definition of disease, his therapeutics \"either stimulated or sedated the nervous system.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> He categorized diseases into four main classes: pyrexiae, neuroses, cachexiae, and locales. Within the classes were nineteen orders and 132 genera.<ref name=\":1\" /> The four orders of neuroses were comata, adynamiae, spasmi and vesaniae.<ref name=\":1\" /> Comata was defined as \"a diminution of voluntary motion, with sleep, or a deprivation of the senses.\" Adynamiae is defined as \"a diminution of the involuntary motions, whether vital or natural.\" Spasmi was defined as \"irregular motions of the muscles or muscular fibers.\" Vesaniae was defined as \"disorders of the judgement without any pyrexia or coma.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCullen's emphasis on the importance of the nervous system was driven by the understanding that the nervous system controls the human body and therefore, \"all diseases may, in some sense, be called affections of the nervous system, because, in almost every disease, the nerves are more or less hurt.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Although Cullen's nosology did not last very long, Cullen's influential teachings on medical knowledge and his attempt to systematize and generalize medical knowledge were integral parts of 18th century Scottish Enlightenment.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Family==\n\nIn 1741 he married Anne (or Anna) Johnstone (d.1786).\n\nHe was father to the judge [[Robert Cullen, Lord Cullen]] and to the physician [[Henry Cullen]]. Cullen's eldest son Robert became a Scottish judge in 1796 under the title of Lord Cullen later Baron Cullen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=as&grp=1095%3BScottish+sitters+and+artists&lDate=&LinkID=mp55787&rNo=0&role=sit |title=NPG D2239; Robert Cullen, Baron Cullen |publisher=Npg.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref> and was known for his powers of [[impressionist (entertainment)|mimicry]].\n\n==Publications==\nBecause of the wide popularity of Cullen's work, many of his publications were translated into a multitude of languages across Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=W.F.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-27205-6|location=New York|pages=11|quote=|via=}}</ref> Cullen's most popular and successful work was his medical textbook ''First Lines of the Practice of Physic'', published in two volumes in 1777 and expanded with each edition until it reached four volumes in its final edition (1784).\n\nHis first book-length publication was ''Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae'' (1769), Cullen's very influential nosology, or classification of diseases. His next publication was also a medical textbook, and it dealt with the Institutions of medicine, i.e. medical theory. Its full title was ''Institutions of Medicine. Part I. Physiology'' (1772) because it focused on physiology, which was traditionally only one part of the Institutions (pathology and therapeutics were also essential parts of medical theory). It went through two more editions (1777 & 1785).\n\nWork on his magnum opus, ''First Lines of Practice of Physic'', occupied much of his time in the 1770s and 1780s, but he did manage one final publication. This was his two volume ''A Treatise of the Materia Medica'' (1789), which was highly valued by other medical practitioners throughout Europe.\n\nThus, the following works, with their dates of publication (including multiple editions), comprise the majority of Cullen's ''oevre'':\n\n*''Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae'' (1769; 1771; 1780; 1785)\n* ''Lectures on the Materia medica''. 2nd Ed.

{"title_page": "Evolution of fish", "text_new": "{{short description|The origin and diversification of fish through geologic time}}\n<!-- This article uses British English -->\n[[File:Devonianfishes ntm 1905 smit 1929.gif|thumb|300px| The [[Devonian]] period 419\u2013359 [[mya (unit)|Ma]] ''(Age of Fishes)'' saw the development of early sharks, armoured [[placoderm]]s and various [[lobe-finned fish]]es including the [[Rhipidistia|tetrapod transitional species]]]]\n\nThe '''evolution of fish''' can be reconstructed starting about 530 million years ago during the [[Cambrian explosion]]. The earliest finds of eel-like jawless fish called the [[conodont]]s appear during the [[Cambrian Stage 2]] (also referred as Tommotian). It was during the Cambrium that the early [[chordate]]s developed the [[skull]] and the [[vertebral column]], leading to the first [[craniate]]s and [[vertebrate]]s. The first [[fish]] lineages belong to the [[Agnatha]], or jawless fish. Early examples include ''[[Haikouichthys]]''. During the late [[Cambrian]], small mostly armoured fish known as [[ostracoderm]]s, first appeared. Most jawless fish are now extinct; but the extant [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. Lampreys belong to the [[Cyclostomata]], which includes the extant [[hagfish]], and this group may have split early on from other agnathans.\n\nThe earliest [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]] probably developed during the late [[Ordovician]] period. They are first represented in the [[fossil record]] from the [[Silurian]] by two groups of fish: the armoured fish known as [[Placodermi|placoderms]], which evolved from the ostracoderms; and the [[Acanthodii]] (or spiny sharks). The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared during the late Silurian: the [[Chondrichthyes]] (or cartilaginous fish) and the [[Osteichthyes]] (or bony fish). The bony fish evolved into two separate groups: the [[Actinopterygii]] (or ray-finned fish) and [[Sarcopterygii]] (which includes the lobe-finned fish).\n\nDuring the [[Devonian]] period a great increase in fish variety occurred, especially among the ostracoderms and placoderms, and also among the lobe-finned fish and early sharks. This has led to the Devonian being known as the ''age of fishes''. It was from the lobe-finned fish that the [[tetrapod]]s evolved, the four-limbed vertebrates, represented today by [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[mammal]]s, and [[bird]]s. [[Tetrapodomorpha|Transitional tetrapods]] first appeared during the early Devonian, and by the late Devonian the first tetrapods appeared. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed [[mouth]]; but it is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors. Fish do not represent a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group, but a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] one, as they exclude the [[tetrapod]]s.{{sfn|Lecointre|Le Guyader|2007|ps=}}\n\nFish, like many other organisms, have been greatly affected by [[extinction event]]s throughout natural history. The earliest ones, the [[Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events]], led to the loss of many species. The [[late Devonian extinction]] led to the extinction of the ostracoderms and placoderms by the end of the Devonian, as well as other fish. The spiny sharks became extinct at the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]]; the conodonts became extinct at the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]]. The [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]], and the present day [[Holocene extinction]], have also affected fish variety and [[fish stock]]s.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Overview==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 360\n | header            = Vertebrate classes\n | header_align      = \n | header_background = \n | footer            = \n | footer_align      = \n | footer_background = \n | background color  = \n | image1    = Fish evolution.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Spindle diagram for the evolution of fish and other vertebrate classes.

''Pikaia'' had a primitive [[notochord]], a structure that could have developed into a [[vertebral column]] later. Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian, these groups had the basic vertebrate [[body plan]]: a [[notochord]], rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail.{{r|Waggoner2011}} All of these early vertebrates lacked [[jaw]]s in the common sense and relied on filter feeding close to the seabed.{{sfn|Haines|Chambers|2005}}\n\nThese were followed by indisputable fossil vertebrates in the form of heavily armoured fishes discovered in rocks from the [[Ordovician]] Period 500\u2013430 [[mya (unit)|Ma]].\n\nThe first [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]] appeared in the late [[Ordovician]] and became common in the [[Devonian]], often known as the \"Age of Fishes\".{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1954|p=107}} The two groups of  [[bony fishes]], the [[actinopterygii]] and [[sarcopterygii]], evolved and became common.{{sfn|Berg|2004|p=599}} The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all jawless fishes, save for lampreys and hagfish, as well as the [[Placodermi]], a group of armoured fish that dominated much of the late [[Silurian]]. The Devonian also saw the rise of the first [[Labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]], which was a transitional between fishes and [[amphibians]].\n\nThe colonisation of new [[Ecological niche|niche]]s resulted in diversification of body plans and sometimes an increase in size. The [[Devonian]] Period (395 to 345 Ma) brought in such giants as the [[placoderm]] ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'', which could grow up to seven meters long, and early air-breathing fish that could remain on land for extended periods. Among this latter group were ancestral [[amphibian]]s.\n\nThe [[reptiles]] appeared from labyrinthodonts in the subsequent [[Carboniferous]] period. The [[anapsid]] and [[synapsid]] reptiles were common during the late [[Paleozoic]], while the [[diapsid]]s became dominant during the [[Mesozoic]]. In the sea, the [[bony fishes]] became dominant.\n\nThe later radiations, such as those of fish in the Silurian and Devonian periods, involved fewer taxa, mainly with very similar body plans.

The term does not often appear in classifications today because it is [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]], and has no phylogenetic meaning.{{sfn|Benton|1999|p=44}} However, the term is still used informally to group together the armoured jawless fishes.\n\nThe ostracoderm armour consisted of 3\u20135&nbsp;mm polygonal plates that shielded the head and gills, and then overlapped further down the body like scales. The eyes were particularly shielded. Earlier [[chordates]] used their [[gill]]s for both respiration and feeding, whereas ostracoderms used their gills for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] only. They had up to eight separate pharyngeal gill pouches along the side of the head, which were permanently open with no protective [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]]. Unlike [[invertebrate]]s that use [[Cilium|cilia]]ted motion to move food, ostracoderms used their muscular pharynx to create a suction that pulled small and slow moving [[prey]] into their mouths.\n\nThe first fossil fishes that were discovered were ostracoderms. The [[Swiss]] anatomist [[Louis Agassiz]] received some fossils of bony armored fish from [[Scotland]] in the 1830s. He had a hard time classifying them as they did not resemble any living creature. He compared them at first with extant armored fish such as [[catfish]] and [[sturgeon]]s but later realizing that they had no movable jaws, classified them in 1844 into a new group \"ostracoderms\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Discovering Fossil Fishes |url=https://archive.org/details/discoveringfossi0000mais |url-access=registration |last=Maisey |first=John G. |year=1996 |publisher=Henry Holt & Company|location=New York |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/discoveringfossi0000mais/page/37 37] |edition=illustrated}}</ref>\n\nOstracoderms existed in two major groups, the more primitive [[Heterostraci|heterostracans]] and the [[cephalaspidomorphi|cephalaspids]].

The two most anterior [[pharyngeal arch]]es are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch, respectively. The hyoid system suspends the jaw from the braincase of the skull, permitting great mobility of the jaws. Already long assumed to be a paraphyletic assemblage leading to more derived gnathostomes, the discovery of ''[[Entelognathus]]'' suggests that placoderms are directly ancestral to modern bony fish.\n\nAs in most [[vertebrate]]s, fish jaws are [[bone|bony]] or [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] and oppose vertically, comprising an ''upper jaw'' and a ''lower jaw''. The jaw is derived from the most anterior two [[pharyngeal arch]]es supporting the gills, and usually bears numerous [[teeth]]. The skull of the last common ancestor of today's jawed vertebrates is assumed to have resembled sharks.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://sciencelife.uchospitals.edu/2012/06/13/where-we-split-from-sharks/|title=Acanthodes and shark-like conditions in the last common ancestor of modern gnathostomes|first1=S.|last1=Davis|first2=J.|last2=Finarelli|first3=M.|last3=Coates|date=25 March 2019|journal=Nature|volume=486|issue=7402|pages=247\u2013250|access-date=25 March 2019|doi=10.1038/nature11080|pmid=22699617}}</ref>\n\nIt is thought that the original selective advantages offered by the jaw were not related to feeding, but to increases in respiration efficiency. The jaws were used in the [[buccal pump]] (observable in modern fish and [[amphibians]]) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians. Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws (to humans) in feeding was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates. Many [[Teleostei|teleost]] fish have substantially modified their jaws for [[suction feeding]] and [[jaw protrusion]], resulting in highly complex jaws with dozens of bones involved.\n\nJawed vertebrates and jawed fish evolved from earlier jawless fish, and the [[cladogram]] below for jawed vertebrates is a continuation of the cladogram in the section above. <small>(\u2020 = group is extinct)</small>\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:70%\n|label1='''[[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]]'''\n |1={{clade\n   |1=\u2020[[Placodermi]] (armoured fishes)[[File:Dunkleosteus intermedius.jpg|70 px]]\n   |label2= <span style=\"color:white;\">unnamed</span>\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Acanthodians]] and [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)[[File:Acanthodes BW.jpg|70px]][[File:Carcharodon carcharias drawing.jpg|70 px]]\n      |label2=[[Osteichthyes|Bony fishes]]\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned fishes) <dominant class of fish today [[File:Cyprinus carpio3.jpg|70 px]]\n            |label2=[[Sarcopterygii|Lobe-finned fishes]]\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=?\u2020[[Onychodontiformes]] (lobe-finned)[[File:OnychodusDB15 flipped.jpg|70 px]]\n               |2=[[Actinistia]] (coelacanths)[[File:Coelacanth flipped.png|70 px]]\n               |label3= <span style=\"color:white;\">unnamed</span>\n               |3={{clade\n                  |1=\u2020[[Porolepiformes]] (lobe-finned)[[File:Reconstruction of Porolepis sp flipped.jpg|70 px]]\n                  |2=[[Dipnoi]] (lungfishes)[[File:Protopterus dolloi Boulenger.jpg|70 px]]\n                  }}\n                |label4= <span style=\"color:white;\">unnamed</span>\n                |4={{clade\n                   |1=\u2020[[Rhizodontidae|Rhizodontimorpha]] (predatory lobe-finned)[[File:Gooloogongia loomesi reconstruction.jpg|70 px]]\n                   |2={{clade\n                      |1=\u2020[[Tristichopteridae]] ([[tetrapodomorph]]s)[[File:Elginerpeton BW.jpg|70 px]]\n                      |2='''[[Tetrapoda|Tetrapods]]''' (four-legged animals)[[File:Deutschlands Amphibien und Reptilien (Salamandra salamdra).jpg|70 px]]\n                      }}\n                   }}\n                }}\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===<sup>\u2020</sup>Placoderms===\n[[File:Evolution of placoderms.png|thumb|260px|right|Evolution of the (now extinct) [[placoderms]].

The [[Pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[pelvic fin]]s are articulated in ways resembling the tetrapod limbs they were the precursors to. The fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates, [[amphibian]]s. They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of [[ray-finned fish]]. The braincase of lobe-finned fishes primitively has a hinge line, but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish. Many early lobe-finned fishes have a symmetrical tail. All lobe-finned fishes possess teeth covered with true [[tooth enamel|enamel]].\n\nLobe-finned fishes, such as [[coelacanth]]s and [[lungfish]], were the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Taxonomists who subscribe to the cladistic approach include the grouping [[Tetrapoda]] within the Sarcopterygii, and the tetrapods in turn include all species of four-limbed vertebrates.{{sfn|Nelson|2006}} The fin-limbs of lobe-finned fishes such as the coelacanths show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. The lobe-finned fish apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses, the [[Rhipidistia]] (including the lungfish, and the [[Tetrapodomorpha]], which include the Tetrapoda) and the [[Actinistia]] (coelacanths). The first lobe-finned fishes, found in the uppermost [[Silurian]] (ca 418 Ma), closely resembled [[spiny shark]]s, which became extinct at the end of the Paleozoic. In the early\u2013middle [[Devonian]] (416 - 385 Ma), while the predatory [[placoderms]] dominated the seas, some lobe-finned fishes came into [[freshwater]] habitats.\n\n[[File:Coelacanth-bgiu.png|thumb|right|The [[coelacanth]] is another lobe-finned fish that is a living fossil. It is thought to have evolved into roughly its current form about 408 million years ago, during the early Devonian,{{r|Johanson2006}} and has not essentially evolved further from its ancient form.{{sfn|Forey|1998}}]]\n\nIn the Early Devonian (416-397 Ma), the lobe-finned fishes split into two main lineages \u2014 the [[coelacanth]]s and the [[rhipidistian]]s. The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the [[Late Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]], from 385 to 299 Ma, as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic; coelacanths still live today in the [[ocean]]s (genus ''[[Latimeria]]''). The Rhipidistians, whose ancestors probably lived in [[estuaries]], migrated into freshwater habitats. They in turn split into two major groups: the [[lungfish]] and the [[tetrapodomorph]]s. The lungfish's greatest diversity was in the [[Triassic]] period; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left. The lungfish evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs, developing the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian (397-385 Ma). The first tetrapodomorphs, which included the gigantic rhizodonts, had the same general anatomy as the lungfish, who were their closest kin, but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch (385 - 359 Ma), with the appearance of [[tetrapods]] (four-legged vertebrates). Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs that survived after the Devonian. Lobe-finned fishes continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era, suffering heavy losses during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] (251 Ma).\n\n====Ray-finned fishes====\n[[File:Evolution of ray-finned fish.png|thumb|500px|right]]\n\n[[Ray-finned fishes]], class Actinopterygii, differ from lobe-finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin supported by spines (\"rays\") made of bone or horn.

It had a pair of large head tentacles and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. ''Pikaia'' shows the essential prerequisites for [[vertebrates]]. The flattened body is divided into pairs of [[myomere|segmented muscle block]]s, seen as faint vertical lines.

By the start of the Early Devonian 419 mya, [[jawed fish]]es had divided into four distinct clades: the [[placoderm]]s and [[spiny shark]]s, both of which are now extinct, and the [[Cartilaginous fish|cartilaginous]] and [[bony fish]]es, both of which are still extant. The modern bony fishes, class [[Osteichthyes]], appeared in the late [[Silurian]] or early Devonian, about 416 million years ago. Both the cartilaginous and bony fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks. A subclass of bony fishes, the [[ray-finned fish]]es (Actinopterygii), have become the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant group]] in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.\n\nSea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas were dominated by [[bryozoa]], diverse and abundant [[brachiopoda|brachiopods]], the enigmatic [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[coral]]s. Lily-like [[crinoids]] were abundant, and [[trilobite]]s were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jawless armoured fish ([[ostracoderms]]) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and [[fresh water]]. Armoured [[placoderms]] were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period but became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Osteichthyes]]) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark,  ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time have led to the Devonian being given the name \"The Age of Fish\" in popular culture.\n\nThe first [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned]] and [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned]] [[bony fish]] appeared in the Devonian, while the [[placoderms]] began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. However, another subclass of Osteichthyes, the [[Sarcopterygii]], including lobe-finned fishes including [[coelacanth]]s and [[lungfish]]) and [[tetrapods]], was the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Sarcopterygians are basally characterized by internal nostrils, lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton, and [[cosmoid scale]]s.\n\nDuring the Middle Devonian 393\u2013383 Ma, the armoured jawless [[ostracoderm]] fishes were declining in diversity; the jawed fish were thriving and increasing in diversity in both the oceans and freshwater. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop essential characteristics such as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time. Cartilaginous fishes, class [[Chondrichthyes]], consisting of [[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]] and [[chimaera]]s, appeared by about 395 million years ago, in the middle [[Devonian]]\n\nDuring the Late Devonian the first forests were taking shape on land. The first tetrapods appear in the fossil record over a period, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian 359 mya. The ancestors of all [[tetrapod]]s began adapting to walking on land, their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs (see ''[[Tiktaalik]]'').{{r|BBC2010}} In the oceans, primitive [[shark]]s became more numerous than in the [[Silurian]] and the [[late Ordovician]]. The first [[ammonite]] [[mollusk]]s appeared. [[Trilobite]]s, the mollusk-like [[brachiopod]]s and the great [[coral reef]]s, were still common.\n\nThe [[Late Devonian extinction]] occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage, (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about {{Period start|Famennian}} Ma. Many fossil [[agnathan]] fishes, save for the [[psammosteid]] [[heterostracan]]s, make their last appearance shortly before this event. The Late Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems.\n\nA second extinction pulse, the [[Hangenberg event]] closed the Devonian period and had a dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas. Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event, as did most members of other groups including lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats, leaving only a handful of survivors. This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as euxinia and anoxia in the seas.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear: both; margin-left: 5em\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ddf8f8;\"| [[Devonian]] (419\u2013359 mya): The start of Devonian saw the first appearance of [[lobe-finned fish]], precursors to the [[tetrapod]]s (animals with four limbs).

They evolved from lobe-finned fish of the clade [[Sarcopterygii]], appearing in coastal water in the middle Devonian, and giving rise to the first [[amphibians]].{{r|Nied\u017awiedzki2010}}\n\nThe group of lobe-finned fishes that were the ancestors of the tetrapod are grouped together as the [[Rhipidistia]],{{r|Gordon2004}} and the first tetrapods evolved from these fish over the relatively short timespan 385\u2013360 Ma. The early tetrapod groups themselves are grouped as [[Labyrinthodontia]]. They retained aquatic, fry-like [[tadpole]]s, a system still seen in [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]]. From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly so they could go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However, in 1987, nearly complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363|Ma|Devonian}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had legs and both lungs and gills, but could never have survived on land: its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water<!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush -->. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.{{r|Clack2005}}\n\n[[File:Ancestors of the land vertebrates cropped.png|thumb|250px|left|Until the 1980s early transitional lobe-finned fishes, such as the ''[[Eusthenopteron]]'' shown here, were depicted as emerging onto land.

He believed limbs and lungs may have evolved from the necessity of having to find new bodies of water as old waterholes dried up.{{r|science22011}}\n\nThe second hypothesis is the \"inter-tidal hypothesis\" put forward in 2010 by a team of Polish paleontologists led by Grzegorz Nied\u017awiedzki. They argued that sarcopterygians may have first emerged unto land from [[intertidal zone]]s rather than inland bodies of water. Their hypothesis is based on the discovery of the 395 million-year-old Zache\u0142mie tracks in [[Zache\u0142mie, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship|Zache\u0142mie]], Poland, the oldest ever discovered fossil evidence of tetrapods.{{r|Nied\u017awiedzki2010}}{{r|newscientist2010}}\n\nThe third hypothesis, the \"woodland hypothesis\", was proposed by the American paleontologist Gregory J. Retallack in 2011. He argues that limbs may have developed in shallow bodies of water in woodlands as a means of navigating in environments filled with roots and vegetation. He based his conclusions on the evidence that transitional tetrapod fossils are consistently found in habitats that were formerly humid and wooded [[floodplain]]s.{{r|Retallack2011}}\n\nResearch by [[Jennifer A. Clack]] and her colleagues showed that the very earliest tetrapods, animals similar to ''[[Acanthostega]]'', were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land. This is in contrast to the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land \u2014 either in search of prey (like modern [[mudskipper]]s) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out \u2014 and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.\n\nTwo ideas about the [[Homology (biology)|homology]] of arms, hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years.

However, the most complete specimen of this shark was discovered in 1890, by the fossil hunter Charles H. Sternberg, who published his findings in 1907. The specimen consisted of a nearly complete associated vertebral column and over 250 associated teeth. This kind of exceptional preservation of fossil sharks is rare because a shark's skeleton is made of [[cartilage]], which is not prone to fossilization.

It was during this time that the early [[chordate]]s developed the [[skull]] and the [[vertebral column]], leading to the first [[craniate]]s and [[vertebrate]]s. The first [[fish]] lineages belong to the [[Agnatha]], or jawless fish. Early examples include ''[[Haikouichthys]]''. During the late [[Cambrian]], eel-like jawless fish called the [[conodont]]s, and small mostly armoured fish known as [[ostracoderm]]s, first appeared. Most jawless fish are now extinct; but the extant [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. Lampreys belong to the [[Cyclostomata]], which includes the extant [[hagfish]], and this group may have split early on from other agnathans.\n\nThe earliest [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]] probably developed during the late [[Ordovician]] period. They are first represented in the [[fossil record]] from the [[Silurian]] by two groups of fish: the armoured fish known as [[Placodermi|placoderms]], which evolved from the ostracoderms; and the [[Acanthodii]] (or spiny sharks). The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared during the late Silurian: the [[Chondrichthyes]] (or cartilaginous fish) and the [[Osteichthyes]] (or bony fish). The bony fish evolved into two separate groups: the [[Actinopterygii]] (or ray-finned fish) and [[Sarcopterygii]] (which includes the lobe-finned fish).\n\nDuring the [[Devonian]] period a great increase in fish variety occurred, especially among the ostracoderms and placoderms, and also among the lobe-finned fish and early sharks. This has led to the Devonian being known as the ''age of fishes''. It was from the lobe-finned fish that the [[tetrapod]]s evolved, the four-limbed vertebrates, represented today by [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[mammal]]s, and [[bird]]s. [[Tetrapodomorpha|Transitional tetrapods]] first appeared during the early Devonian, and by the late Devonian the first tetrapods appeared. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed [[mouth]]; but it is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors. Fish do not represent a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group, but a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] one, as they exclude the [[tetrapod]]s.{{sfn|Lecointre|Le Guyader|2007|ps=}}\n\nFish, like many other organisms, have been greatly affected by [[extinction event]]s throughout natural history. The earliest ones, the [[Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events]], led to the loss of many species. The [[late Devonian extinction]] led to the extinction of the ostracoderms and placoderms by the end of the Devonian, as well as other fish. The spiny sharks became extinct at the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]]; the conodonts became extinct at the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]]. The [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]], and the present day [[Holocene extinction]], have also affected fish variety and [[fish stock]]s.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Overview==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 360\n | header            = Vertebrate classes\n | header_align      = \n | header_background = \n | footer            = \n | footer_align      = \n | footer_background = \n | background color  = \n | image1    = Fish evolution.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Spindle diagram for the evolution of fish and other vertebrate classes.

''Pikaia'' had a primitive [[notochord]], a structure that could have developed into a [[vertebral column]] later. Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian, these groups had the basic vertebrate [[body plan]]: a [[notochord]], rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail.{{r|Waggoner2011}} All of these early vertebrates lacked [[jaw]]s in the common sense and relied on filter feeding close to the seabed.{{sfn|Haines|Chambers|2005}}\n\nThese were followed by indisputable fossil vertebrates in the form of heavily armoured fishes discovered in rocks from the [[Ordovician]] Period 500\u2013430 [[mya (unit)|Ma]].\n\nThe first [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]] appeared in the late [[Ordovician]] and became common in the [[Devonian]], often known as the \"Age of Fishes\".{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1954|p=107}} The two groups of  [[bony fishes]], the [[actinopterygii]] and [[sarcopterygii]], evolved and became common.{{sfn|Berg|2004|p=599}} The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all jawless fishes, save for lampreys and hagfish, as well as the [[Placodermi]], a group of armoured fish that dominated much of the late [[Silurian]]. The Devonian also saw the rise of the first [[Labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]], which was a transitional between fishes and [[amphibians]].\n\nThe colonisation of new [[Ecological niche|niche]]s resulted in diversification of body plans and sometimes an increase in size. The [[Devonian]] Period (395 to 345 Ma) brought in such giants as the [[placoderm]] ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'', which could grow up to seven meters long, and early air-breathing fish that could remain on land for extended periods. Among this latter group were ancestral [[amphibian]]s.\n\nThe [[reptiles]] appeared from labyrinthodonts in the subsequent [[Carboniferous]] period. The [[anapsid]] and [[synapsid]] reptiles were common during the late [[Paleozoic]], while the [[diapsid]]s became dominant during the [[Mesozoic]]. In the sea, the [[bony fishes]] became dominant.\n\nThe later radiations, such as those of fish in the Silurian and Devonian periods, involved fewer taxa, mainly with very similar body plans. The first animals to venture onto dry land were [[arthropod]]s. Some fish had lungs and strong, bony fins and could crawl onto the land also.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Jawless fish==\n[[File:Lamprey attached.png|thumb|260px|right|A modern jawless fish, the [[lamprey]], attached to a modern jawed fish]]\n[[File:Petromyzon marinus.003 - Aquarium Finisterrae.JPG|thumb|140px|right|{{center|Lamprey mouth}}]]\n{{main|Agnatha}}\n\nJawless fishes belong to the [[superclass (biology)|superclass]] [[Agnatha]] in the [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] [[Chordata]], subphylum [[Vertebrata]].

Although a minor element of modern marine [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]], jawless fish were prominent among the early fish in the early [[Paleozoic]]. Two types of [[Early Cambrian]] animal apparently having fins, [[vertebrate]] musculature, and gills are known from the early Cambrian [[Maotianshan shales]] of [[China]]: ''[[Haikouichthys]]'' and ''[[Myllokunmingia]]''. They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier. A third possible agnathid from the same region is ''[[Haikouella]]''. A possible agnathid that has not been formally described was reported by Simonetti from the Middle Cambrian [[Burgess Shale]] of [[British Columbia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nMany Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian agnathians were armoured with heavy, bony, and often elaborately sculpted plates derived from mineralized scales. The first armoured agnathans\u2014the [[Ostracoderm]]s, precursors to the [[bony fish]] and hence to the [[tetrapods]] (including humans)\u2014are known from the middle [[Ordovician]], and by the Late [[Silurian]] the agnathans had reached the high point of their evolution. Most of the ostracoderms, such as [[thelodont]]s, [[osteostracan]]s, and [[galeaspid]]s, were more closely related to the gnathostomes than to the surviving agnathans, known as cyclostomes.

The term does not often appear in classifications today because it is [[paraphyletic]] or [[polyphyletic]], and has no phylogenetic meaning.{{sfn|Benton|1999|p=44}} However, the term is still used informally to group together the armoured jawless fishes.\n\nThe ostracoderm armour consisted of 3\u20135&nbsp;mm polygonal plates that shielded the head and gills, and then overlapped further down the body like scales. The eyes were particularly shielded. Earlier [[chordates]] used their [[gill]]s for both respiration and feeding, whereas ostracoderms used their gills for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] only. They had up to eight separate pharyngeal gill pouches along the side of the head, which were permanently open with no protective [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]]. Unlike [[invertebrate]]s that use [[Cilium|cilia]]ted motion to move food, ostracoderms used their muscular pharynx to create a suction that pulled small and slow moving [[prey]] into their mouths.\n\nThe first fossil fishes that were discovered were ostracoderms. The [[Swiss]] anatomist [[Louis Agassiz]] received some fossils of bony armored fish from [[Scotland]] in the 1830s. He had a hard time classifying them as they did not resemble any living creature. He compared them at first with extant armored fish such as [[catfish]] and [[sturgeon]]s but later realizing that they had no movable jaws, classified them in 1844 into a new group \"ostracoderms\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Discovering Fossil Fishes |url=https://archive.org/details/discoveringfossi0000mais |url-access=registration |last=Maisey |first=John G. |year=1996 |publisher=Henry Holt & Company|location=New York |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/discoveringfossi0000mais/page/37 37] |edition=illustrated}}</ref>\n\nOstracoderms existed in two major groups, the more primitive [[Heterostraci|heterostracans]] and the [[cephalaspidomorphi|cephalaspids]].

The two most anterior [[pharyngeal arch]]es are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch, respectively. The hyoid system suspends the jaw from the braincase of the skull, permitting great mobility of the jaws. Already long assumed to be a paraphyletic assemblage leading to more derived gnathostomes, the discovery of ''[[Entelognathus]]'' suggests that placoderms are directly ancestral to modern bony fish.\n\nAs in most [[vertebrate]]s, fish jaws are [[bone|bony]] or [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] and oppose vertically, comprising an ''upper jaw'' and a ''lower jaw''. The jaw is derived from the most anterior two [[pharyngeal arch]]es supporting the gills, and usually bears numerous [[teeth]]. The skull of the last common ancestor of today's jawed vertebrates is assumed to have resembled sharks.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://sciencelife.uchospitals.edu/2012/06/13/where-we-split-from-sharks/|title=Acanthodes and shark-like conditions in the last common ancestor of modern gnathostomes|first1=S.|last1=Davis|first2=J.|last2=Finarelli|first3=M.|last3=Coates|date=25 March 2019|journal=Nature|volume=486|issue=7402|pages=247\u2013250|access-date=25 March 2019|doi=10.1038/nature11080|pmid=22699617}}</ref>\n\nIt is thought that the original selective advantages offered by the jaw were not related to feeding, but to increases in respiration efficiency. The jaws were used in the [[buccal pump]] (observable in modern fish and [[amphibians]]) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians. Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws (to humans) in feeding was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates. Many [[Teleostei|teleost]] fish have substantially modified their jaws for [[suction feeding]] and [[jaw protrusion]], resulting in highly complex jaws with dozens of bones involved.\n\nJawed vertebrates and jawed fish evolved from earlier jawless fish, and the [[cladogram]] below for jawed vertebrates is a continuation of the cladogram in the section above. <small>(\u2020 = group is extinct)</small>\n\n{{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:70%\n|label1='''[[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]]'''\n |1={{clade\n   |1=\u2020[[Placodermi]] (armoured fishes)[[File:Dunkleosteus intermedius.jpg|70 px]]\n   |label2= <span style=\"color:white;\">unnamed</span>\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Acanthodians]] and [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)[[File:Acanthodes BW.jpg|70px]][[File:Carcharodon carcharias drawing.jpg|70 px]]\n      |label2=[[Osteichthyes|Bony fishes]]\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned fishes) <dominant class of fish today [[File:Cyprinus carpio3.jpg|70 px]]\n            |label2=[[Sarcopterygii|Lobe-finned fishes]]\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=?\u2020[[Onychodontiformes]] (lobe-finned)[[File:OnychodusDB15 flipped.jpg|70 px]]\n               |2=[[Actinistia]] (coelacanths)[[File:Coelacanth flipped.png|70 px]]\n               |label3= <span style=\"color:white;\">unnamed</span>\n               |3={{clade\n                  |1=\u2020[[Porolepiformes]] (lobe-finned)[[File:Reconstruction of Porolepis sp flipped.jpg|70 px]]\n                  |2=[[Dipnoi]] (lungfishes)[[File:Protopterus dolloi Boulenger.jpg|70 px]]\n                  }}\n                |label4= <span style=\"color:white;\">unnamed</span>\n                |4={{clade\n                   |1=\u2020[[Rhizodontidae|Rhizodontimorpha]] (predatory lobe-finned)[[File:Gooloogongia loomesi reconstruction.jpg|70 px]]\n                   |2={{clade\n                      |1=\u2020[[Tristichopteridae]] ([[tetrapodomorph]]s)[[File:Elginerpeton BW.jpg|70 px]]\n                      |2='''[[Tetrapoda|Tetrapods]]''' (four-legged animals)[[File:Deutschlands Amphibien und Reptilien (Salamandra salamdra).jpg|70 px]]\n                      }}\n                   }}\n                }}\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===<sup>\u2020</sup>Placoderms===\n[[File:Evolution of placoderms.png|thumb|260px|right|Evolution of the (now extinct) [[placoderms]].

The [[Pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[pelvic fin]]s are articulated in ways resembling the tetrapod limbs they were the precursors to. The fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates, [[amphibian]]s. They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of [[ray-finned fish]]. The braincase of lobe-finned fishes primitively has a hinge line, but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish. Many early lobe-finned fishes have a symmetrical tail. All lobe-finned fishes possess teeth covered with true [[tooth enamel|enamel]].\n\nLobe-finned fishes, such as [[coelacanth]]s and [[lungfish]], were the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Taxonomists who subscribe to the cladistic approach include the grouping [[Tetrapoda]] within the Sarcopterygii, and the tetrapods in turn include all species of four-limbed vertebrates.{{sfn|Nelson|2006}} The fin-limbs of lobe-finned fishes such as the coelacanths show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. The lobe-finned fish apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses, the [[Rhipidistia]] (including the lungfish, and the [[Tetrapodomorpha]], which include the Tetrapoda) and the [[Actinistia]] (coelacanths). The first lobe-finned fishes, found in the uppermost [[Silurian]] (ca 418 Ma), closely resembled [[spiny shark]]s, which became extinct at the end of the Paleozoic. In the early\u2013middle [[Devonian]] (416 - 385 Ma), while the predatory [[placoderms]] dominated the seas, some lobe-finned fishes came into [[freshwater]] habitats.\n\n[[File:Coelacanth-bgiu.png|thumb|right|The [[coelacanth]] is another lobe-finned fish that is a living fossil.

The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the [[Late Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]], from 385 to 299 Ma, as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic; coelacanths still live today in the [[ocean]]s (genus ''[[Latimeria]]''). The Rhipidistians, whose ancestors probably lived in [[estuaries]], migrated into freshwater habitats. They in turn split into two major groups: the [[lungfish]] and the [[tetrapodomorph]]s. The lungfish's greatest diversity was in the [[Triassic]] period; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left. The lungfish evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs, developing the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian (397-385 Ma). The first tetrapodomorphs, which included the gigantic rhizodonts, had the same general anatomy as the lungfish, who were their closest kin, but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch (385 - 359 Ma), with the appearance of [[tetrapods]] (four-legged vertebrates). Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs that survived after the Devonian. Lobe-finned fishes continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era, suffering heavy losses during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] (251 Ma).\n\n====Ray-finned fishes====\n[[File:Evolution of ray-finned fish.png|thumb|500px|right]]\n\n[[Ray-finned fishes]], class Actinopterygii, differ from lobe-finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin supported by spines (\"rays\") made of bone or horn.

However, scales and teeth attributed to this group, as well as more derived jawed fish, such as cartilaginous and bony fish, date from the [[Ordovician]] ~460 Ma. Acanthodians were generally small shark-like fishes varying from toothless filter-feeders to toothed predators. They were once often classified as an order of the class [[Placodermi]], but recent authorities tend to place the acanthodians as a paraphyletic assemblage leading to modern cartilaginous fish. They are distinguished in two respects: they were the earliest known jawed vertebrates, and they had stout [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] supporting all their [[fin]]s, fixed in place and non-movable (like a [[shark]]'s [[dorsal fin]]), an important defensive adaptation.

By the start of the Early Devonian 419 mya, [[jawed fish]]es had divided into four distinct clades: the [[placoderm]]s and [[spiny shark]]s, both of which are now extinct, and the [[Cartilaginous fish|cartilaginous]] and [[bony fish]]es, both of which are still extant. The modern bony fishes, class [[Osteichthyes]], appeared in the late [[Silurian]] or early Devonian, about 416 million years ago. Both the cartilaginous and bony fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks. A subclass of bony fishes, the [[ray-finned fish]]es (Actinopterygii), have become the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant group]] in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.\n\nSea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas were dominated by [[bryozoa]], diverse and abundant [[brachiopoda|brachiopods]], the enigmatic [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[coral]]s. Lily-like [[crinoids]] were abundant, and [[trilobite]]s were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jawless armoured fish ([[ostracoderms]]) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and [[fresh water]]. Armoured [[placoderms]] were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period but became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Osteichthyes]]) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark,  ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time have led to the Devonian being given the name \"The Age of Fish\" in popular culture.\n\nThe first [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned]] and [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned]] [[bony fish]] appeared in the Devonian, while the [[placoderms]] began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. However, another subclass of Osteichthyes, the [[Sarcopterygii]], including lobe-finned fishes including [[coelacanth]]s and [[lungfish]]) and [[tetrapods]], was the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Sarcopterygians are basally characterized by internal nostrils, lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton, and [[cosmoid scale]]s.\n\nDuring the Middle Devonian 393\u2013383 Ma, the armoured jawless [[ostracoderm]] fishes were declining in diversity; the jawed fish were thriving and increasing in diversity in both the oceans and freshwater. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop essential characteristics such as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time. Cartilaginous fishes, class [[Chondrichthyes]], consisting of [[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]] and [[chimaera]]s, appeared by about 395 million years ago, in the middle [[Devonian]]\n\nDuring the Late Devonian the first forests were taking shape on land. The first tetrapods appear in the fossil record over a period, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian 359 mya. The ancestors of all [[tetrapod]]s began adapting to walking on land, their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs (see ''[[Tiktaalik]]'').{{r|BBC2010}} In the oceans, primitive [[shark]]s became more numerous than in the [[Silurian]] and the [[late Ordovician]]. The first [[ammonite]] [[mollusk]]s appeared. [[Trilobite]]s, the mollusk-like [[brachiopod]]s and the great [[coral reef]]s, were still common.\n\nThe [[Late Devonian extinction]] occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage, (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about {{Period start|Famennian}} Ma. Many fossil [[agnathan]] fishes, save for the [[psammosteid]] [[heterostracan]]s, make their last appearance shortly before this event. The Late Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems.\n\nA second extinction pulse, the [[Hangenberg event]] closed the Devonian period and had a dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas. Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event, as did most members of other groups including lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats, leaving only a handful of survivors. This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as euxinia and anoxia in the seas.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear: both; margin-left: 5em\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ddf8f8;\"| [[Devonian]] (419\u2013359 mya): The start of Devonian saw the first appearance of [[lobe-finned fish]], precursors to the [[tetrapod]]s (animals with four limbs).

They evolved from lobe-finned fish of the clade [[Sarcopterygii]], appearing in coastal water in the middle Devonian, and giving rise to the first [[amphibians]].{{r|Nied\u017awiedzki2010}}\n\nThe group of lobe-finned fishes that were the ancestors of the tetrapod are grouped together as the [[Rhipidistia]],{{r|Gordon2004}} and the first tetrapods evolved from these fish over the relatively short timespan 385\u2013360 Ma. The early tetrapod groups themselves are grouped as [[Labyrinthodontia]]. They retained aquatic, fry-like [[tadpole]]s, a system still seen in [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]]. From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly so they could go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However, in 1987, nearly complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363|Ma|Devonian}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had legs and both lungs and gills, but could never have survived on land: its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water<!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush -->. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.{{r|Clack2005}}\n\n[[File:Ancestors of the land vertebrates cropped.png|thumb|250px|left|Until the 1980s early transitional lobe-finned fishes, such as the ''[[Eusthenopteron]]'' shown here, were depicted as emerging onto land.

The traditional explanation is the \"shrinking waterhole hypothesis\" or \"desert hypothesis\" posited by the American paleontologist [[Alfred Romer]]. He believed limbs and lungs may have evolved from the necessity of having to find new bodies of water as old waterholes dried up.{{r|science22011}}\n\nThe second hypothesis is the \"inter-tidal hypothesis\" put forward in 2010 by a team of Polish paleontologists led by Grzegorz Nied\u017awiedzki. They argued that sarcopterygians may have first emerged unto land from [[intertidal zone]]s rather than inland bodies of water. Their hypothesis is based on the discovery of the 395 million-year-old Zache\u0142mie tracks in [[Zache\u0142mie, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship|Zache\u0142mie]], Poland, the oldest ever discovered fossil evidence of tetrapods.{{r|Nied\u017awiedzki2010}}{{r|newscientist2010}}\n\nThe third hypothesis, the \"woodland hypothesis\", was proposed by the American paleontologist Gregory J. Retallack in 2011. He argues that limbs may have developed in shallow bodies of water in woodlands as a means of navigating in environments filled with roots and vegetation. He based his conclusions on the evidence that transitional tetrapod fossils are consistently found in habitats that were formerly humid and wooded [[floodplain]]s.{{r|Retallack2011}}\n\nResearch by [[Jennifer A. Clack]] and her colleagues showed that the very earliest tetrapods, animals similar to ''[[Acanthostega]]'', were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land. This is in contrast to the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land \u2014 either in search of prey (like modern [[mudskipper]]s) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out \u2014 and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.\n\nTwo ideas about the [[Homology (biology)|homology]] of arms, hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years.

They are the earliest known [[vertebrate]]s, and include the first and extinct fish that lived through the [[Cambrian]] to the [[Tertiary]]. The study of prehistoric fish is called ''paleoichthyology''. A few living forms, such as the [[coelacanth]] are also referred to as prehistoric fish, or even [[living fossil]]s, due to their current rarity and similarity to extinct forms.

It was selected to compete for the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[66th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"First9\">{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/wettbewerb/wettbewerb-presse-detail_29588.html |title=Berlinale 2016: First Films for Competition and Berlinale Special |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |work=Berlinale}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in [[New York City]] in 1929. [[Maxwell Perkins]], a successful [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] editor and discoverer of talented authors such as [[Francis Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], lives in a cottage just outside the city with his wife and five daughters. One day, in his office, he reads the drafts of ''O Lost'', a novel by [[Thomas Wolfe]]. Struck by the content, Perkins decides to publish it and begins to collaborate with the author. The novel is eventually published as ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]'' and proves to be a commercial success: fifteen thousand copies sold in a single month. Perkins and Wolfe become best friends, while Wolfe's relationship with [[Aline Bernstein]], a married woman twenty years older than him, is severely tested after the publication of Wolfe's novel. Max manages to publish Wolfe's second novel, ''[[Of Time and the River]]'', after several years of exhausting revision work. The second novel is also a success.\n\nMeanwhile, Wolfe is in Paris where he follows the events remotely, thanks to news received from Perkins. On his return to New York, he immediately goes to work, writing his new book. His turbulent character leads him to quarrel with Perkins, destroying the relationship between the two and making Wolfe turn to another editor. Aline finally leaves Thomas, because he is too self-absorbed and unable to care about others. After Perkins has reconciled himself with Wolfe's absence, a phone call comes from Wolfe's mother: Wolfe has contracted [[miliary tuberculosis]]. Despite surgery, Wolfe shows no signs of improving. After a few weeks he dies, but before that he writes a letter to Max, reaffirming his immense affection for him.

[[Maxwell Perkins]], a successful [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] editor and discoverer of talented authors such as [[Francis Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], lives in a cottage just outside the city with his wife and five daughters. One day, in his office, he reads the drafts of ''O Lost'', a novel by [[Thomas Wolfe]]. Struck by the content, Perkins decides to publish it and begins to collaborate with the author. The novel is eventually published as ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]'' and proves to be a commercial success: fifteen thousand copies sold in a single month. Perkins and Wolfe become best friends, while Wolfe's relationship with [[Aline Bernstein]], a married woman twenty years older than him, is severely tested after the publication of Wolfe's novel. Max manages to publish Wolfe's second novel, ''[[Of Time and the River]]'', after several years of exhausting revision work. The second novel is also a success.\n\nMeanwhile, Wolfe is in Paris where he follows the events remotely, thanks to news received from Perkins. On his return to New York, he immediately goes to work, writing his new book. His turbulent character leads him to quarrel with Perkins, destroying the relationship between the two and making Wolfe turn to another editor. Aline finally leaves Thomas, because he is too self-absorbed and unable to care about others. After Perkins has reconciled himself with Wolfe's absence, a phone call comes from Wolfe's mother: Wolfe has contracted [[miliary tuberculosis]]. Despite surgery, Wolfe shows no signs of improving. After a few weeks he dies, but before that he writes a letter to Max, reaffirming his immense affection for him.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[Maxwell Perkins]]\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Thomas Wolfe]]\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Aline Bernstein]]\n* [[Dominic West]] as [[Ernest Hemingway]]\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as [[F.

It is significant to the Hindu sect of [[Saivism]] as one of the seven major Shiva temples.  Shiva is worshiped as Mahalingeswaraswamy, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]'', with his idol referred to as ''Jothimayalingam''. His consort [[Parvati]] is depicted as Pirguchuntarakujambigai. The ''lingam'' of the temple is believed to be the focal point for the seven consorts of Shiva. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil poet saints known as the [[nayanars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0162.pdf\n |title=Campantar Tevaram -2\n |work=Projectmadurai.org\n |accessdate=16 July 2011\n}}</ref> The 9th century ''Saiva'' saint poet [[Manikkavacakar]] has sung praise about the temple in his works.\n\nThere are 149 inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from [[Pandyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the [[Chola dynasty]] in the 9th century, while later expansions, including the towering [[gopuram]] gatehouses, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century.\n\nThe temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses four gateway towers known as ''[[gopurams]]''. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Mahalingeswaraswamy, Pirguchuntaragujambigai and Mookambigai being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar period]] that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from [[5:30]] a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by [[Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam]], a South Indian monastic institution.\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimaruthur13.jpg|thumb|Tiruvidaimaruthur temple|250px|left]]\nThe name \"Kumbakonam\", roughly translated in English as the \"Jug's Corner\",<ref name=\"catholicp710\">[[#Herbermann|Herbermann 1934]], p. 710</ref> is believed to be an [[allusion]] to the mythical pot (''[[kumbha]]'') of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] that contained the seed of all living beings on earth. The ''kumbha'' is believed to have been displaced by a ''[[pralaya]]'' (dissolution of the universe) and ultimately came to rest at the spot where the town of [[Kumbakonam]] now stands.<ref name=\"chandrasekharendrap73\">[[#Sastri|Sastri 1991]], p. 73</ref><ref name=\"ancienttamilsp88\">[[#Pillai|Pillai]], p. 88</ref> The drops of nectar are believed to have fallen onto five shrines around Kumbakonam, namely Mahalingeswarar temple at [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tirudharasuram, [[Rahu Stalam|Naganathar Temple]] at [[Tirunageswaram]], Tiruvorgam and  Tirupadalavanam.<ref>[[#Dalal|Dalal 2010]], p. 202</ref>\n\nThe legend of a [[Chola]] prince who killed a [[Brahmin]] and was in turn, pursued by his spirit (''Brahmarakshas''), is associated with the temple. The Chola prince, it is believed, entered the Mahalingeswarar Temple and prayed to his favourite God, [[Shiva]] for relief from the clutches of the spirit of the dead Brahmin or ''brahmarakshas''. The Chola prince made his way out through another entrance thereby saving himself.<ref name=\"Ayyar\">[[#Ayyar|Ayyar 1991]], p. 299</ref> Some sources associate the legend with [[Pandya]] king [[Varagunapandian]].<ref name=\"R\">[[#R.|R. 2001]], pp. 145-6</ref> It continues till day where people take the second entrance to exit the premises after worship.  There is a sculpture of ''Chola brahmaharakshas'' on the eastern premises in one of the inner ''[[gopurams]]'' (tower gateway).\n\nShiva is believed to have appeared as a flame to please [[Agastya]] and other sages who were performing penance. Shiva is said to have emanated from the heart of Parvathi. It is also believed that several other deities like [[Rudra]], [[Vinayaga]], [[Murugan]], [[Parvathi]], [[Kali]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswathi]], [[Brahma]], [[Airavata]] (the elephant of celestial king [[Indra]]) and [[Vishnu]] worshipped Mahalingaswamy.<ref name=\"R\"/>\n\n==Etymology ==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimarudur 7.JPG|250px|thumb|Image of the second precinct|right]]\nMarudur is derived from the name of the holy tree, namely Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/><ref name=\"tourist\"/> The ''[[Sthala Vriksha]]'' (temple tree) is Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/> This temple is classified as ''Madhya Arjunam'', called ''Idai Maruthu'' meaning centre Marudur.<ref name=\"padal\"/>  The  [[Mallikarjuna Swamy|Mallikarjuna swamy temple]] are [[Srisailam]] is called ''Thalai Maruthu'' (meaning top Marudur) and Tirupudaimaruthur temple at [[Ambasamudram]] in [[Tirunelveli district]] is called ''Kadai Maruthu'' (meaning lower Marudur).<ref name=\"padal\"/> Since Shiva raised out as a flame to the sages, the presiding deity is also referred as Jyothirmaya Mahalingam. Historically Shiva was worshipped as Jyothi, the sacred flame and with the course of time, [[Jyotirlinga|Jyothrilinga temples]] were developed. Since the place is full of Maruda tree, Shiva is also referred as Marudavanan. The [[Sanskrit]] meaning of the word ''Maruda'' is Archunam, deriving the Tamil name of Idaimaruthu against Mathiarchunam.<ref name=Om35>[[#Om|Narayanaswamy 1987]], pp. 35-6</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\nThere are a total of 149 inscriptions associated with the temple.<ref name=\"R\"/> According to legend, the site of the temple at Thiruvidaimarudur has been used for over 2,000 years and is associated with the [[Pandya]] king Varaguna Pandian. The temple contains inscriptions of the [[Hoysala]] kings and some [[Vijayanagara]] grants, and many records of the later Nayaks and [[Marathas]].<ref>''Imperial gazetteer of India: Provincial series, Volume 18, p.137</ref> The inscriptions in the walls of the temple are from [[Kulothunga Chola I]] indicating revenue survey and settlement and other additions made inside the temple.<ref name=\"Ayyar\"/> This inscription (No. 32 of 1895)<!-- not 1095???? --> on the second precinct records a grant of 120 sheep for two lamps and the ''pujaris'' and inhabitants are appointed trustees of the grant.  The date is the 172nd day of 26th year of the reign of Kulothunga I, who conquered the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] region.  The other inscriptions mention the name of the queen and adore her as the \"mistress of the whole world\".

It is significant to the Hindu sect of [[Saivism]] as one of the seven major Shiva temples.  Shiva is worshiped as Mahalingeswaraswamy, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]'', with his idol referred to as ''Jothimayalingam''. His consort [[Parvati]] is depicted as Pirguchuntarakujambigai. The ''lingam'' of the temple is believed to be the focal point for the seven consorts of Shiva. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil poet saints known as the [[nayanars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0162.pdf\n |title=Campantar Tevaram -2\n |work=Projectmadurai.org\n |accessdate=16 July 2011\n}}</ref> The 9th century ''Saiva'' saint poet [[Manikkavacakar]] has sung praise about the temple in his works.\n\nThere are 149 inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from [[Pandyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the [[Chola dynasty]] in the 9th century, while later expansions, including the towering [[gopuram]] gatehouses, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century.\n\nThe temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses four gateway towers known as ''[[gopurams]]''. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Mahalingeswaraswamy, Pirguchuntaragujambigai and Mookambigai being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar period]] that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from [[5:30]] a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by [[Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam]], a South Indian monastic institution.\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimaruthur13.jpg|thumb|Tiruvidaimaruthur temple|250px|left]]\nThe name \"Kumbakonam\", roughly translated in English as the \"Jug's Corner\",<ref name=\"catholicp710\">[[#Herbermann|Herbermann 1934]], p. 710</ref> is believed to be an [[allusion]] to the mythical pot (''[[kumbha]]'') of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] that contained the seed of all living beings on earth. The ''kumbha'' is believed to have been displaced by a ''[[pralaya]]'' (dissolution of the universe) and ultimately came to rest at the spot where the town of [[Kumbakonam]] now stands.<ref name=\"chandrasekharendrap73\">[[#Sastri|Sastri 1991]], p. 73</ref><ref name=\"ancienttamilsp88\">[[#Pillai|Pillai]], p. 88</ref> The drops of nectar are believed to have fallen onto five shrines around Kumbakonam, namely Mahalingeswarar temple at [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tirudharasuram, [[Rahu Stalam|Naganathar Temple]] at [[Tirunageswaram]], Tiruvorgam and  Tirupadalavanam.<ref>[[#Dalal|Dalal 2010]], p. 202</ref>\n\nThe legend of a [[Chola]] prince who killed a [[Brahmin]] and was in turn, pursued by his spirit (''Brahmarakshas''), is associated with the temple. The Chola prince, it is believed, entered the Mahalingeswarar Temple and prayed to his favourite God, [[Shiva]] for relief from the clutches of the spirit of the dead Brahmin or ''brahmarakshas''. The Chola prince made his way out through another entrance thereby saving himself.<ref name=\"Ayyar\">[[#Ayyar|Ayyar 1991]], p. 299</ref> Some sources associate the legend with [[Pandya]] king [[Varagunapandian]].<ref name=\"R\">[[#R.|R. 2001]], pp. 145-6</ref> It continues till day where people take the second entrance to exit the premises after worship.  There is a sculpture of ''Chola brahmaharakshas'' on the eastern premises in one of the inner ''[[gopurams]]'' (tower gateway).\n\nShiva is believed to have appeared as a flame to please [[Agastya]] and other sages who were performing penance. Shiva is said to have emanated from the heart of Parvathi. It is also believed that several other deities like [[Rudra]], [[Vinayaga]], [[Murugan]], [[Parvathi]], [[Kali]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswathi]], [[Brahma]], [[Airavata]] (the elephant of celestial king [[Indra]]) and [[Vishnu]] worshipped Mahalingaswamy.<ref name=\"R\"/>\n\n==Etymology ==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimarudur 7.JPG|250px|thumb|Image of the second precinct|right]]\nMarudur is derived from the name of the holy tree, namely Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/><ref name=\"tourist\"/> The ''[[Sthala Vriksha]]'' (temple tree) is Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/> This temple is classified as ''Madhya Arjunam'', called ''Idai Maruthu'' meaning centre Marudur.<ref name=\"padal\"/>  The  [[Mallikarjuna Swamy|Mallikarjuna swamy temple]] are [[Srisailam]] is called ''Thalai Maruthu'' (meaning top Marudur) and Tirupudaimaruthur temple at [[Ambasamudram]] in [[Tirunelveli district]] is called ''Kadai Maruthu'' (meaning lower Marudur).<ref name=\"padal\"/> Since Shiva raised out as a flame to the sages, the presiding deity is also referred as Jyothirmaya Mahalingam. Historically Shiva was worshipped as Jyothi, the sacred flame and with the course of time, [[Jyotirlinga|Jyothrilinga temples]] were developed. Since the place is full of Maruda tree, Shiva is also referred as Marudavanan. The [[Sanskrit]] meaning of the word ''Maruda'' is Archunam, deriving the Tamil name of Idaimaruthu against Mathiarchunam.<ref name=Om35>[[#Om|Narayanaswamy 1987]], pp. 35-6</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\nThere are a total of 149 inscriptions associated with the temple.<ref name=\"R\"/> According to legend, the site of the temple at Thiruvidaimarudur has been used for over 2,000 years and is associated with the [[Pandya]] king Varaguna Pandian. The temple contains inscriptions of the [[Hoysala]] kings and some [[Vijayanagara]] grants, and many records of the later Nayaks and [[Marathas]].<ref>''Imperial gazetteer of India: Provincial series, Volume 18, p.137</ref> The inscriptions in the walls of the temple are from [[Kulothunga Chola I]] indicating revenue survey and settlement and other additions made inside the temple.<ref name=\"Ayyar\"/> This inscription (No. 32 of 1895)<!-- not 1095???? --> on the second precinct records a grant of 120 sheep for two lamps and the ''pujaris'' and inhabitants are appointed trustees of the grant.  The date is the 172nd day of 26th year of the reign of Kulothunga I, who conquered the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] region.

Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the [[Shaivism|Shaivaite]] community, a Brahmin sub-caste.

The worship is held amidst music with ''[[nagaswaram]]'' (pipe instrument) and ''[[tavil]]'' (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the [[Vedas]]  read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast.
