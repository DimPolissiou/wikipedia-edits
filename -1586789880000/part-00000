of South Africa|SSAS]] [[South African Police Star for Outstanding Service|SOE]]|birth_place=Ermelo|country=South Africa|nationality=South African|status=Retired|serviceyears=1953-1995|rank=General}}\n\nGeneral '''Johan Velde van der Merwe''' (b. 25 August 1936) is a South African police officer.{{sfn|TRC|1998}} He held senior positions in the Security Branch and was Commissioner of the [[South African Police]] from 1990 to 1995.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=115}} \n\n== Early life ==\nVan der Merwe was born in [[Ermelo, Mpumalanga|Ermelo]] in August 1936 to a family of conservative [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] supporters.{{sfn|TRC|1998}} He attended Ermelo High School and enjoyed sport.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=107}} After leaving school, Johan joined the [[South African Police]] in 1953.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108}}\n\n== Career in the police ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nInterviewed after retirement, van der Merwe says that he enjoyed initial training.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108}} In 1961 he was posted to [[Standerton]] in charge of administration of the new headquarters.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108}} From 1963 to 1966 he worked in an administrative role at Security Headquarters.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108-9}}\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, he commanded a border post at the South Africa-[[Lesotho]] border.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=109}} When interviewed, he said that the Lesotho government under [[Leabua Jonathan]] enjoyed far less support than his superiors thought.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=109-10}}\n\nIn 1970, he was posted to the Security Branch in [[Bloemfontein]]; he eventually took command throughout the [[Orange Free State (Province)|Orange Free State]].{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=110}} Interviewed, he claimed to have helped to prevent unrest during the [[Soweto uprising]] in the Free State due to his close relations with parents of schoolchildren.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=111-2}}\n\nFrom 1979 he was then posted to [[South West Africa]]<nowiki>, now Namibia,{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=112} which was then illegally under the control of the South African authorities.</nowiki>{{sfn|State Department|2009}} He recalled in an interview that he had \u201calmost unlimited legal powers\u201d in Namibia due to the co-operation of the Administrator General; recalling his time in Namibia, he said that he \u201cwould not [have] miss[ed it]\u2026for all the money in the world\u201d.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=115}}\n\n=== Time in the Security Branch and as Commissioner ===\n\nIn 1983 he was posted to Pretoria, where he rose initially from second in charge of the Security Branch to Head of Security, before becoming Deputy Commissioner and then in 1990 Commissioner of the [[South African Police]].{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=115}}\n\nIn 1985 he had a report sent to the minister requesting further powers, but was rebuked by [[Louis le Grange]], then Minister of Police.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=116}} In van der Merwe\u2019s view, the [[apartheid]] government\u2019s response to the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) was hobbled by several factors: arrestees had the right to have the evidence against them furnished before the court, which would frequently identify informers, and it was very difficult to detain children who participated in the unrest.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=117}} He says that at that time \u201cthe main drive for us as a Security Branch [was] to protect our people\u201d and to maintain law and order.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=118}} \n\nDespite the handover of power from the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] to a non-racial [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|government of national unity]] under the provisions of an [[Interim Constitution (South Africa)|negotiated interim constitution]],{{sfn|SAHO|2004}} van der Merwe remained until 1995.\n\n== Retirement and application for amnesty ==\n\nIn 1995 van der Merwe resigned from the police force.{{sfn|Staff Reporter|1995}} The [[Mail & Guardian|''Mail & Guardian'']] reported that he was pressured to resign by the then Safety and Security Minister [[Sydney Mufamadi]] over accusations that he was obstructing investigations into other [[apartheid]]-era officers and alleged so-called [[Third Force (South Africa)|Third Force]] activity.{{sfn|Staff Reporter|1995}}\n\nWith several other security policemen, van der Merwe successfully applied for amnesty from the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] for various offences.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=106}} \n\nHowever, in 2007, van der Merwe along with [[Adriaan Vlok]], an [[apartheid]]-era Minister of Law and Order, and several others was convicted of the murder of [[Frank Chikane]], an anti-[[apartheid]] priest, in 1989, and received a suspended prison sentence.{{sfn|McGreal|2007}}\n\nIn 2016 van der Merwe demanded that the then [[President of South Africa|president]] [[Jacob Zuma]], former president [[Thabo Mbeki]], and former senior [[African National Congress|ANC]] member [[Mac Maharaj]] should be charged for murder.{{sfn|Drum

African|status=Retired|serviceyears=1953-1995|rank=General}}\n\nGeneral '''Johan Velde van der Merwe''' (b. 25 August 1936) is a South African police officer.{{sfn|TRC|1998}} He held senior positions in the Security Branch and was Commissioner of the [[South African Police]] from 1990 to 1995.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=115}} \n\n== Early life ==\nVan der Merwe was born in [[Ermelo, Mpumalanga|Ermelo]] in August 1936 to a family of conservative [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] supporters.{{sfn|TRC|1998}} He attended Ermelo High School and enjoyed sport.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=107}} After leaving school, Johan joined the [[South African Police]] in 1953.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108}}\n\n== Career in the police ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nInterviewed after retirement, van der Merwe says that he enjoyed initial training.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108}} In 1961 he was posted to [[Standerton]] in charge of administration of the new headquarters.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108}} From 1963 to 1966 he worked in an administrative role at Security Headquarters.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=108-9}}\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, he commanded a border post at the South Africa-[[Lesotho]] border.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=109}} When interviewed, he said that the Lesotho government under [[Leabua Jonathan]] enjoyed far less support than his superiors thought.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=109-10}}\n\nIn 1970, he was posted to the Security Branch in [[Bloemfontein]]; he eventually took command throughout the [[Orange free State]].{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=110}} Interviewed, he claimed to have helped to prevent unrest during the [[Soweto uprising]] in the Free State due to his close relations with parents of schoolchildren.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=111-2}}\n\nFrom 1979 he was then posted to [[South West Africa]]<nowiki>, now Namibia,{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=112} which was then illegally under the control of the South African authorities.</nowiki>{{sfn|State Department|2009}} He recalled in an interview that he had \u201calmost unlimited legal powers\u201d in Namibia due to the co-operation of the Administrator General; recalling his time in Namibia, he said that he \u201cwould not [have] miss[ed it]\u2026for all the money in the world\u201d.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=115}}\n\n=== Time in the Security Branch and as Commissioner ===\n\nIn 1983 he was posted to Pretoria, where he rose initially from second in charge of the Security Branch to Head of Security, before becoming Deputy Commissioner and then in 1990 Commissioner of the [[South African Police]].{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=115}}\n\nIn 1985 he had a report sent to the minister requesting further powers, but was rebuked by [[Louis le Grange]], then Minister of Police.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=116}} In van der Merwe\u2019s view, the [[apartheid]] government\u2019s response to the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) was hobbled by several factors: arrestees had the right to have the evidence against them furnished before the court, which would frequently identify informers, and it was very difficult to detain children who participated in the unrest.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=117}} He says that at that time \u201cthe main drive for us as a Security Branch [was] to protect our people\u201d and to maintain law and order.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=118}} \n\nDespite the handover of power from the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] to a non-racial [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|government of national unity]] under the provisions of an [[Interim Constitution (South Africa)|negotiated interim constitution]],{{sfn|SAHO|2004}} van der Merwe remained until 1995.\n\n== Retirement and application for amnesty ==\n\nIn 1995 van der Merwe resigned from the police force.{{sfn|Staff Reporter|1995}} The [[Mail & Guardian|''Mail & Guardian'']] reported that he was pressured to resign by the then Safety and Security Minister [[Sydney Mufamadi]] over accusations that he was obstructing investigations into other [[apartheid]]-era officers and alleged so-called [[Third Force (South Africa)|Third Force]] activity.{{sfn|Staff Reporter|1995}}\n\nWith several other security policemen, van der Merwe successfully applied for amnesty from the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] for various offences.{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=106}} \n\nHowever, in 2007, van der Merwe along with [[Adriaan Vlok]], an [[apartheid]]-era Minister of Law and Order, and several others was convicted of the murder of [[Frank Chikane]], an anti-[[apartheid]] priest, in 1989, and received a suspended prison sentence.{{sfn|McGreal|2007}}\n\nIn 2016 van der Merwe demanded that the then [[President of South Africa|president]] [[Jacob Zuma]], former president [[Thabo Mbeki]], and former senior [[African National Congress|ANC]] member [[Mac Maharaj]] should be charged for murder.{{sfn|Drum Digital|2016}}\n\n== Notes

After release from the cam, the hammer accelerates downwards to hit the outer casing and cause its penetration through the [[regolith]]. Meanwhile a suppressor mass travels upwards and its kinetic energy is compensated by gravitational potential and compression of a brake spring and wire helix on the opposite side of the mole.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'/> \n\nIn principle, every {{cvt|50|cm}} the probe puts out a pulse of heat and its sensors measure how the heat pulse changes with time.

After release from the cam, the hammer accelerates downwards to hit the outer casing and cause its penetration through the [[regolith]]. Meanwhile a suppressor mass travels upwards and its kinetic energy is compensated by gravitational potential and compression of a brake spring and wire helix on the opposite side of the mole.<ref name='Hammering mechanism'/> \n\nIn principle, every {{cvt|50|cm}} the probe puts out a pulse of heat and its sensors measure how the heat pulse changes with time.
