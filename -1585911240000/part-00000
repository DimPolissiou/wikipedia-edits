It is a longstanding political center, and is located at approximately equal distances from the [[Southern Carpathians]] (north) and the [[Danube|River Danube]] (south). Craiova is the chief commercial city west of [[Bucharest]] and the most important city of Oltenia. The city prospered as a regional trading centre despite an earthquake in 1790, a plague in 1795, and a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] assault in 1802 during which it was burned.\n\nEight villages are administered by the city: {{ill|F\u0103c\u0103i, Dolj|ro|lt=F\u0103c\u0103i}}, [[Mofleni]], [[Popoveni]], [[\u0218imnicu de Jos]], [[Cernele]], Cernelele de Sus, Izvoru Rece and Rovine. The last four were a separate commune called ''Cernele'' until 1996, when they were merged into the city.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are two possible etymologies for Craiova: [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:kral|kral]]'' (\"king\"), which has been borrowed in Romania as ''[[wikt:crai|crai]]'' and Slavonic ''[[krajina]]'' (\"border\" or \"edge\").<ref name=\"R\u0103dvan\"/> Since no source prior to 1475 mentions the city, it is impossible to tell which of the two words is the real etymology.<ref name=\"R\u0103dvan\">Lauren\u021biu R\u0103dvan, ''At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities,'' Brill, 2010, {{ISBN|9789004180109}}, p.272</ref> The name is probably of Bulgarian origin, due to historical [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] minorities in the area.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nCraiova, which occupied the site of the [[Dacia]]n and [[Roman Dacia|Roman]] city ''[[Pelendava]]'', was formerly the capital of Oltenia. Its ancient ''[[ban (title)|ban]]s'', the highest ranking [[boyars]] of the [[Wallachia]]n state, were initially those of the [[Craiove\u0219ti|Craiove\u015fti]] family. The ''bans'' had the right of [[Mint (coin)|minting coins]] stamped with their own [[Effigy|effigies]] \u2013 the origin of the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''[[Romanian leu|ban]]'' as used for coins.\n[[File:Mihai Viteazul woodcut.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael the Brave]]]]\nThe economic power of the Craiove\u015fti family at the end of the 16th century was about 100 villages (182 financial goods). This power gave them a statute of political autonomy so big, that the [[hospodar]]s ruling at that time were not able to keep in power without an alliance with this powerful dynasty. From the Craiove\u0219ti family there were chosen a lot of hospodars to rule the country: [[Neagoe Basarab]], [[Radu of Afuma\u021bi|Radu de la Afuma\u021bi]], [[Radu \u0218erban]] (1602\u20131611), [[Matei Basarab]], [[Constantin \u0218erban]], [[\u0218erban Cantacuzino]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]].\n\nIn 1395 Craiova was probably the scene of a victory won by the [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Mircea I of Wallachia]] over [[Bayezid I]], [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] (''see [[Battle of Rovine]]''). {{citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Craiova unirii.jpg|thumb|right|Unirii Boulevard]] -->\nFrequently referred to as \"a city\" after the first half of the 16th century, the Craiova area was always regarded as an important economic region of [[Wallachia]] and Romania at large. During the 1718\u20131739 [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] occupation of Oltenia, Craiova's status declined due to economic pressures and increased [[Centralized government|centralism]], partly leading to an increase in ''[[hajduk]]'' actions, in parallel with protests of Craiovan [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]]. In 1761, under Prince [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]], the ''bans'' relocated to Bucharest, leaving behind ''[[kaymakam]]s'' to represent them in Craiova.\n\nUnder Prince [[Emanuel Giani Ruset]], Wallachia's seat was moved to Craiova (1770\u20131771), viewed as a place of refuge during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774]]. A large part of the city was burned down by the rebel [[pasha]] [[Osman Pazvanto\u011flu]] in 1800.\n\nDuring the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]], inhabitants of the present-day [[Dolj County]] joined [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]'s [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandurs]] in great numbers, contributing to the expedition on Bucharest. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova witnessed economic prosperity, centered on [[handicraft]] trades and public services. During [[Imperial Russia]]n occupation and the early stages of ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' rules (1828\u20131834), the city increased its economic output; in 1832 there were 595 shops, 197 made of which were [[barracks]] and 398 were houses built of brick. At the time, Craiova exported wheat, furs, leather, live animals and other products into the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.\n\nCostache Romanescu, a citizen of Craiova, was among the leaders of the Provisional Government during the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]. Wallachia's last two rulers, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] and [[Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei]], came from an important boyar family residing in Craiova \u2013 the Bibescu family.\n\n[[File:Th Aman Hora Unirii.jpg|thumb|[[Unity Dance]] at Craiova, 1857, by [[Theodor Aman]]]]\n\nAround 1860, there were 4,633 buildings in Craiova, which were 3,220 houses, 26 churches, 11 schools and 60 factories and workshops. In all, the city also housed about 90 industrial establishments, of which 12 were mills, 3 breweries, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] yards and 2 [[printing press]]es; 57% of the total number of craftsmen of [[Dolj County]] lived in Craiova (1,088 [[Master craftsman|craftsmen]], 687 [[journeymen]] and 485 [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]]).\n\n[[File:Craiova - Lipscani Street (28456496140).jpg|thumb|right|Lipscani Street in Craiova]]\n\nThe period following the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Independence War]] was a time of economic and cultural progress. As a result, at the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova, with its 40,000 inhabitants, had developed small factories (producing chemicals, farming utilities, and construction materials) and textile factories. On October 26, 1896, the Craiova [[power station]] entered service (with [[AEG]] equipment working at 310 CP, supplying 365 streetlights on 39 streets, forming a 30&nbsp;km-long network); Craiova was the first city in the country to be supplied with electric power by [[internal combustion engine]]s.\n\nIn 1900, Craiova had 43.1% of the industrial units of [[Oltenia]]; these numbered 924 industrial companies (including 20 large industrial establishments, employing 1,078 workers). The number of large industrial establishments rose to 40 by 1925. [[Banking]] also developed at the beginning of the 20th century (when 6 banks and 2 [[Bureau de change|bureaux de change]] were already operating).\n\nIn the interwar period, Craiova, as the centre of an agricultural region, experienced little further [[industrialization]]; the number of industrial workers remained comparatively small. In 1939, Craiova had 7 industrial units with over 100 workers: the clothing industry companies ''Oltenia'' and ''Scrisul Rom\u00e2nesc'' were well-known all over the country and abroad.\n\nIn the early 1960s, under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], the city became a noted centre for the [[Automaker|automotive]] and [[engine building]] industries, as well as for [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace manufacturing]], [[chemical industry]], [[food industry]], [[construction]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mining]] and the [[electrical power industry]]. The construction of housing estates also begins at this time, with Brazda lui Novac being the one of the first in 1967-1968, followed by Siloz-Valea Ro\u0219ie in the same years. Later on in the 1980s the Craiovi\u021ba Nou\u0103, Rovine, 1 Mai, S\u0103rari and L\u0103pu\u0219-Arge\u0219 housing estates are built.\n\nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] brought the re-establishment of a [[free market]] and decentralisation in overall management, several industries became subject to [[privatisation]], while the market opened itself to private initiatives. Industry, although affected by economic changes, remains an important branch, representing ca. 70% of Craiova's output\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:93%; width:200px; height:16px; border:0; text-align:left; line-height:120%; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"14\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f4f4f4; height:24px;\"|'''Historical population of Craiova'''\n|-\n!

Craiova.jpg|thumb|left|First Ford Transit at Automobile Craiova]]\n\nIn the first two decades of the 19th century Craiova was characterized by economical growth, multiplication of its inhabitants' preoccupations in the areas of trade, commerce, and public services. In comparison with other great urban centers, Craiova is situated as a commercial, administrative and cultural centre.\n\nDuring the [[Tsarist]] take-over (1828\u20131834), Craiova goes through important economic growths. In 1832, there were a number of 595 shops, of which \"187 of wood and 398 of stone wall\". The city is maintained as the commercial centre of [[Oltenia]]; it was exporting to [[Austria]] and [[Turkey]] cereal, skins, wax, animals, tallow and cervices. As a follow-up of the permanent high demands of export, at Craiova was established, in 1846, the first Romanian society on share holds for cereal transport by ship on the [[Danube]], to [[Br\u0103ila]].\n\nAround 1860 in Craiova there were 4633 buildings, of which 3220 were houses, 26 churches, 11 schools, 60 factories - workshops. There were also approximately 90 establishments with an industrial character, of which: 12 [[wind mill]]s, 3 beer factories, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 tanneries, 2 printings. Statistics show that there was, at Craiova, a percent of 57,7% of the total number of craftsmen from the [[Dolj County]] (1088 craftsmen, 687 journeymen and 485 apprentices). Towards the ending of the 19th century, Craiova was a city that had small factories and workshops with chemical products, agricultural machines, graphics art, tanneries, textiles, construction materials, etc. At 26 October 1896 Craiova's power plant starts working (with AEG equipment - Allgemeine Elekticitats Gesellschaft), having an installed power of 310 power horse, and supplying 365 lamps on 39 streets in a network of {{convert|30|km|2|abbr=on}}. Craiova was the first city of the country powered up with electricity based on engines with internal combustion.\n\nIn 1900, Craiova was holding 43, 1% of the number of the industrial units of Oltenia, having 924 industrial firms (of which 20 establishments were belonging to the big industry, using 1078 workers). In 1925, the number of establishments of the \"big industry\" was up to 49, and in 1930 the number of workers was of 5530. The bank commerce was affirming as well, at the beginning of the 20th century already existing 6 banks and 2 exchange offices.\n\nIn the [[Interbellum|Interbelic period]], the city, situated in an area eminently agricultural, was moving forward with too small steps toward the industrial way, in comparison with other urban areas of the country. The number of those who got close to industry was extremely small.\n\nIn 1939, in Craiova were only 7 industrial units with over 100 workers: the \"Oltenia\" clothing factory, the \"Scrisul Romanesc\" (\"The Romanian Writing\") publishing house, the \"Concordia\" macaroni factory, the \"Barbu Druga\" bread and macaroni factory, the \"Semanatoarea\"factory and the \"Traiul\" bread factory .\nThe only industrial branch that had industrial units comparable with similar units of other centers of the country was the industry of graphic art. The two printings \"Ramuri\" and  \"Scrisul romanesc\" were well known all over the country and abroad.\n\nStarting with the 1960s the city becomes a powerful industrial center; it develops the industry of machine and tools construction, planes, the chemical industry, food industry, easy industry, of construction materials, electro technical, extractive, energetic industry. The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] led to important changes in economy, by realizing a free market and by decentralizing the management of all national economic sectors. A value for the property sense was reinstated by liberating the particular initiative and privatization of goods that belonged exclusively to the state.\nIn industry a drop of all capacity production was noticed, determined by the fact that they couldn't anticipate the direction of the impact of change and size of the shocks that followed the modification of the economical-social system. Still, the industry continues to represent the branch of activity with great influence over the city's economy (70%).\n\nDuring the [[History of Romania since 1989|post-Revolution period]], telecommunication services, banking and insurance, [[management consulting]] (CDIMM, Romanian-American Center) began expanding. The number of joint ventures and the value of invested capital at county level have increased to large numbers \u2014 [[Dolj County]] being the first in respect to these aspects.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The [[Automobile Craiova]] factory, formerly owned by [[Daewoo]] and renationalised after Daewoo's bankruptcy, was sold in September 2007 to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].\n\nFord will produce in Romania the B-Max model, a small class mono volume. The aspect of the new model will be somewhere between [[Ford Fiesta]] and C-Max, but smaller than the latter. The American manufacturer expects to become the second biggest seller in [[Romania]] after [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]]. In 2009, Craiova works delivered 300 [[Ford Transit Connect]] units to the market.\n\nOf the city's working population (about 110,000 persons), 38% are employed in industry, 15% in trade and repair services, 10% in transport and storage, 8% in education, 5.7% in the medical field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[File:Craiova BMC bus 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A city bus in Craiova running on route 6]]\n\nPublic transportation in Craiova started in September 1948 with only 2 buses, received from [[Bucharest]]. The buses connected the [[Craiova railway station]] with the [[Nicolae Romanescu Park]].\n\nThe [[Tram]] was first introduced in 1987, on an 18,{{convert|4|km|2|abbr=on}} double-track line, as a result of the state's intention of keeping energy consumption low.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Trasee rat craiova.jpg|thumb|Public transportation lines]] -->\nThe [[public transport]] in Craiova today consists of 3 [[Trolley pole|trolley]] [[tram]] lines and 17 bus lines.

There are 190 buses and 35 trams serving the city today.\n\nCraiova is also a major railway [[Craiova railway station|centre]] and is connected to all other major Romanian cities, as well as local destinations, through the national [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]] network.\n\nThere are daily trains with service from Craiova to:\n[[Bucharest]] (3 hours),\n[[Bra\u0219ov]] (6 \u2013 8 hours - via connecting service),\n[[Cluj-Napoca]] (8 \u2013 10 hours - connecting service),\n[[Sibiu]] (4 \u2013 7 hours),\n[[Sighi\u0219oara]] (8 \u2013 11 hours - connecting service),\n[[Timi\u0219oara]] ( 5 hours) {{citation needed| date=August 2018}}\n\nThe city is served by [[Craiova Airport]], which has recently been modernised.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:The suspended bridge, in Nicolae Romanescu Park, Craiova, Romania.jpg|thumb|The suspended bridge in Nicolae Romanescu Park]]\n[[File:Palatul Jean Mihail Craiova - vedere nocturna.JPG|thumb|Constantin Mihail Palace, now Art Museum]]\n\n* Madona Dudu Church \u2013 built between 1750 and 1756, renovated in 1844, after being destroyed by an 1831 earthquake. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Murals were completed by [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]].\n* [[Cathedral of Saint Demetrius, Craiova|St. Demetrius Cathedral]]\n* The Church of Co\u015funa Monastery \u2013 the oldest building preserved in Craiova, dating from 1483. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n* B\u0103niei House \u2013 the oldest non-religious building that exists in Craiova, dating from 1699.

County]], is situated near the east bank of the river [[Jiu River|Jiu]] in central [[Oltenia]]. It is a longstanding political center, and is located at approximately equal distances from the [[Southern Carpathians]] (north) and the [[Danube|River Danube]] (south). Craiova is the chief commercial city west of [[Bucharest]] and the most important city of Oltenia. The city prospered as a regional trading centre despite an earthquake in 1790, a plague in 1795, and a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] assault in 1802 during which it was burned.\n\nEight villages are administered by the city: {{ill|F\u0103c\u0103i, Dolj|ro|lt=F\u0103c\u0103i}}, [[Mofleni]], [[Popoveni]], [[\u0218imnicu de Jos]], [[Cernele]], Cernelele de Sus, Izvoru Rece and Rovine. The last four were a separate commune called ''Cernele'' until 1996, when they were merged into the city.\n\n==Etymology==\nThere are two possible etymologies for Craiova: [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:kral|kral]]'' (\"king\"), which has been borrowed in Romania as ''[[wikt:crai|crai]]'' and Slavonic ''[[krajina]]'' (\"border\" or \"edge\").<ref name=\"R\u0103dvan\"/> Since no source prior to 1475 mentions the city, it is impossible to tell which of the two words is the real etymology.<ref name=\"R\u0103dvan\">Lauren\u021biu R\u0103dvan, ''At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities,'' Brill, 2010, {{ISBN|9789004180109}}, p.272</ref> The name is probably of Bulgarian origin, due to historical [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] minorities in the area.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nCraiova, which occupied the site of the [[Dacia]]n and [[Roman Dacia|Roman]] city ''[[Pelendava]]'', was formerly the capital of Oltenia. Its ancient ''[[ban (title)|ban]]s'', the highest ranking [[boyars]] of the [[Wallachia]]n state, were initially those of the [[Craiove\u0219ti|Craiove\u015fti]] family. The ''bans'' had the right of [[Mint (coin)|minting coins]] stamped with their own [[Effigy|effigies]] \u2013 the origin of the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''[[Romanian leu|ban]]'' as used for coins.\n[[File:Mihai Viteazul woodcut.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael the Brave]]]]\nThe economic power of the Craiove\u015fti family at the end of the 16th century was about 100 villages (182 financial goods). This power gave them a statute of political autonomy so big, that the [[hospodar]]s ruling at that time were not able to keep in power without an alliance with this powerful dynasty. From the Craiove\u0219ti family there were chosen a lot of hospodars to rule the country: [[Neagoe Basarab]], [[Radu of Afuma\u021bi|Radu de la Afuma\u021bi]], [[Radu \u0218erban]] (1602\u20131611), [[Matei Basarab]], [[Constantin \u0218erban]], [[\u0218erban Cantacuzino]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]].\n\nIn 1395 Craiova was probably the scene of a victory won by the [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Mircea I of Wallachia]] over [[Bayezid I]], [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] (''see [[Battle of Rovine]]''). {{citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Craiova unirii.jpg|thumb|right|Unirii Boulevard]] -->\nFrequently referred to as \"a city\" after the first half of the 16th century, the Craiova area was always regarded as an important economic region of [[Wallachia]] and Romania at large. During the 1718\u20131739 [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] occupation of Oltenia, Craiova's status declined due to economic pressures and increased [[Centralized government|centralism]], partly leading to an increase in ''[[hajduk]]'' actions, in parallel with protests of Craiovan [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]]. In 1761, under Prince [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]], the ''bans'' relocated to Bucharest, leaving behind ''[[kaymakam]]s'' to represent them in Craiova.\n\nUnder Prince [[Emanuel Giani Ruset]], Wallachia's seat was moved to Craiova (1770\u20131771), viewed as a place of refuge during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774]]. A large part of the city was burned down by the rebel [[pasha]] [[Osman Pazvanto\u011flu]] in 1800.\n\nDuring the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]], inhabitants of the present-day [[Dolj County]] joined [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]'s [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandurs]] in great numbers, contributing to the expedition on Bucharest. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova witnessed economic prosperity, centered on [[handicraft]] trades and public services. During [[Imperial Russia]]n occupation and the early stages of ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' rules (1828\u20131834), the city increased its economic output; in 1832 there were 595 shops, 197 made of which were [[barracks]] and 398 were houses built of brick. At the time, Craiova exported wheat, furs, leather, live animals and other products into the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.\n\nCostache Romanescu, a citizen of Craiova, was among the leaders of the Provisional Government during the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]. Wallachia's last two rulers, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] and [[Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei]], came from an important boyar family residing in Craiova \u2013 the Bibescu family.\n\n[[File:Th Aman Hora Unirii.jpg|thumb|[[Unity Dance]] at Craiova, 1857, by [[Theodor Aman]]]]\n\nAround 1860, there were 4,633 buildings in Craiova, which were 3,220 houses, 26 churches, 11 schools and 60 factories and workshops. In all, the city also housed about 90 industrial establishments, of which 12 were mills, 3 breweries, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] yards and 2 [[printing press]]es; 57% of the total number of craftsmen of [[Dolj County]] lived in Craiova (1,088 [[Master craftsman|craftsmen]], 687 [[journeymen]] and 485 [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]]).\n\n[[File:Craiova - Lipscani Street (28456496140).jpg|thumb|right|Lipscani Street in Craiova]]\n\nThe period following the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Independence War]] was a time of economic and cultural progress. As a result, at the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova, with its 40,000 inhabitants, had developed small factories (producing chemicals, farming utilities, and construction materials) and textile factories. On October 26, 1896, the Craiova [[power station]] entered service (with [[AEG]] equipment working at 310 CP, supplying 365 streetlights on 39 streets, forming a 30&nbsp;km-long network); Craiova was the first city in the country to be supplied with electric power by [[internal combustion engine]]s.\n\nIn 1900, Craiova had 43.1% of the industrial units of [[Oltenia]]; these numbered 924 industrial companies (including 20 large industrial establishments, employing 1,078 workers). The number of large industrial establishments rose to 40 by 1925. [[Banking]] also developed at the beginning of the 20th century (when 6 banks and 2 [[Bureau de change|bureaux de change]] were already operating).\n\nIn the interwar period, Craiova, as the centre of an agricultural region, experienced little further [[industrialization]]; the number of industrial workers remained comparatively small. In 1939, Craiova had 7 industrial units with over 100 workers: the clothing industry companies ''Oltenia'' and ''Scrisul Rom\u00e2nesc'' were well-known all over the country and abroad.\n\nIn the early 1960s, under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], the city became a noted centre for the [[Automaker|automotive]] and [[engine building]] industries, as well as for [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace manufacturing]], [[chemical industry]], [[food industry]], [[construction]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mining]] and the [[electrical power industry]]. The construction of housing estates also begins at this time, with Brazda lui Novac being the one of the first in 1967-1968, followed by Siloz-Valea Ro\u0219ie in the same years. Later on in the 1980s the Craiovi\u021ba Nou\u0103, Rovine, 1 Mai, S\u0103rari and L\u0103pu\u0219-Arge\u0219 housing estates are built.\n\nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] brought the re-establishment of a [[free market]] and decentralisation in overall management, several industries became subject to [[privatisation]], while the market opened itself to private initiatives. Industry, although affected by economic changes, remains an important branch, representing ca. 70% of Craiova's output\n\n==Demographics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:93%; width:200px; height:16px; border:0; text-align:left; line-height:120%; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"14\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f4f4f4; height:24px;\"|'''Historical population of Craiova'''\n|-\n!

Craiova.jpg|thumb|left|First Ford Transit at Automobile Craiova]]\n\nIn the first two decades of the 19th century Craiova was characterized by economical growth, multiplication of its inhabitants' preoccupations in the areas of trade, commerce, and public services. In comparison with other great urban centers, Craiova is situated as a commercial, administrative and cultural centre.\n\nDuring the [[Tsarist]] take-over (1828\u20131834), Craiova goes through important economic growths. In 1832, there were a number of 595 shops, of which \"187 of wood and 398 of stone wall\". The city is maintained as the commercial centre of [[Oltenia]]; it was exporting to [[Austria]] and [[Turkey]] cereal, skins, wax, animals, tallow and cervices. As a follow-up of the permanent high demands of export, at Craiova was established, in 1846, the first Romanian society on share holds for cereal transport by ship on the [[Danube]], to [[Br\u0103ila]].\n\nAround 1860 in Craiova there were 4633 buildings, of which 3220 were houses, 26 churches, 11 schools, 60 factories - workshops. There were also approximately 90 establishments with an industrial character, of which: 12 [[wind mill]]s, 3 beer factories, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 tanneries, 2 printings. Statistics show that there was, at Craiova, a percent of 57,7% of the total number of craftsmen from the [[Dolj County]] (1088 craftsmen, 687 journeymen and 485 apprentices). Towards the ending of the 19th century, Craiova was a city that had small factories and workshops with chemical products, agricultural machines, graphics art, tanneries, textiles, construction materials, etc. At 26 October 1896 Craiova's power plant starts working (with AEG equipment - Allgemeine Elekticitats Gesellschaft), having an installed power of 310 power horse, and supplying 365 lamps on 39 streets in a network of {{convert|30|km|2|abbr=on}}. Craiova was the first city of the country powered up with electricity based on engines with internal combustion.\n\nIn 1900, Craiova was holding 43, 1% of the number of the industrial units of Oltenia, having 924 industrial firms (of which 20 establishments were belonging to the big industry, using 1078 workers). In 1925, the number of establishments of the \"big industry\" was up to 49, and in 1930 the number of workers was of 5530. The bank commerce was affirming as well, at the beginning of the 20th century already existing 6 banks and 2 exchange offices.\n\nIn the [[Interbellum|Interbelic period]], the city, situated in an area eminently agricultural, was moving forward with too small steps toward the industrial way, in comparison with other urban areas of the country. The number of those who got close to industry was extremely small.\n\nIn 1939, in Craiova were only 7 industrial units with over 100 workers: the \"Oltenia\" clothing factory, the \"Scrisul Romanesc\" (\"The Romanian Writing\") publishing house, the \"Concordia\" macaroni factory, the \"Barbu Druga\" bread and macaroni factory, the \"Semanatoarea\"factory and the \"Traiul\" bread factory .\nThe only industrial branch that had industrial units comparable with similar units of other centers of the country was the industry of graphic art. The two printings \"Ramuri\" and  \"Scrisul romanesc\" were well known all over the country and abroad.\n\nStarting with the 1960s the city becomes a powerful industrial center; it develops the industry of machine and tools construction, planes, the chemical industry, food industry, easy industry, of construction materials, electro technical, extractive, energetic industry. The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] led to important changes in economy, by realizing a free market and by decentralizing the management of all national economic sectors. A value for the property sense was reinstated by liberating the particular initiative and privatization of goods that belonged exclusively to the state.\nIn industry a drop of all capacity production was noticed, determined by the fact that they couldn't anticipate the direction of the impact of change and size of the shocks that followed the modification of the economical-social system. Still, the industry continues to represent the branch of activity with great influence over the city's economy (70%).\n\nDuring the [[History of Romania since 1989|post-Revolution period]], telecommunication services, banking and insurance, [[management consulting]] (CDIMM, Romanian-American Center) began expanding. The number of joint ventures and the value of invested capital at county level have increased to large numbers \u2014 [[Dolj County]] being the first in respect to these aspects.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  The [[Automobile Craiova]] factory, formerly owned by [[Daewoo]] and renationalised after Daewoo's bankruptcy, was sold in September 2007 to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].\n\nFord will produce in Romania the B-Max model, a small class mono volume. The aspect of the new model will be somewhere between [[Ford Fiesta]] and C-Max, but smaller than the latter. The American manufacturer expects to become the second biggest seller in [[Romania]] after [[Automobile Dacia|Dacia]]. In 2009, Craiova works delivered 300 [[Ford Transit Connect]] units to the market.\n\nOf the city's working population (about 110,000 persons), 38% are employed in industry, 15% in trade and repair services, 10% in transport and storage, 8% in education, 5.7% in the medical field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[File:Craiova BMC bus 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A city bus in Craiova running on route 6]]\n\nPublic transportation in Craiova started in September 1948 with only 2 buses, received from [[Bucharest]].
