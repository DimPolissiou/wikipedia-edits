The other school is focused on the pretesting stage of the optimization process.{{cn|date=February 2016}} In this second approach, the optimization company will invest a considerable amount of time understanding the audience and then creating a targeted message that appeals to that particular audience. Only then would it be willing to deploy testing mechanisms to increase conversion rates.\n\n== Calculation of conversion rate ==\nA conversion rate is defined as the percentage of visitors who complete a goal, as set by the site owner. It is calculated as the total number of conversions, divided by the total number people who visited your website.                                             \n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Conversion\\ rate} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Conversions}}{\\mathrm{Number\\ of\\ visitors}}</math> x100\n\n'''For example:''' Your website receives 100 visitors in a day and 15 visitors sign up for your email newsletter (your chosen conversion to measure). Your conversion rate would be 15% for that day. \n\n==Elements of the test focused approach==\nConversion optimization platforms for content, campaigns, and delivery consist of the following elements:\n\n===Data collection and processing===\nThe platform must process hundreds of variables and automatically discover which [[subset]]s have the greatest [[predictive power]], including any [[multivariate testing in marketing|multivariate]] relationship.  A combination of pre- and post-screening methods is employed, dropping irrelevant or redundant data as appropriate.  A flexible [[data warehouse]] environment accepts customer data as well as data aggregated by third parties.\n\nThis means it's essential to ensure the data is as 'clean' as possible, before undertaking any data analysis. For example, eliminating activity from bots, staging websites, or incorrect configurations of tools such as Google Analytics.\n\nData can be [[numeric data|numeric]] or [[text-based]], [[nominal data|nominal]] or [[ordinal data|ordinal]].  Bad or missing values are handled gracefully.\n\nData may be geographic, contextual, frequential, demographic, behavioral, customer based, etc.\n\n===Hypothesis===\nAfter data collection, forming a hypothesis is the next step. This process forms the foundation of why changes are made. Hypotheses are made based on observation and deduction. It is important that each hypothetical situation be measurable. Without these no conclusions can be derived.\n\n===Optimization goals===\nThe official definition of \"optimization\" is the discipline of applying advanced analytical methods to make better decisions.  Under this framework, business goals are explicitly defined and then decisions are calibrated to optimize those goals.  The methodologies  have a long record of success in a wide variety of industries, such as airline scheduling, [[supply chain management]], financial planning, [[military logistics]] and telecommunications routing.  Goals should include maximization of conversions, revenues, profits, [[Loan-to-value ratio|LTV]] or any combination thereof.\n\n===Business rules===\nArbitrary business rules must be handled under one optimization framework. Using such a platform entails that one should understand these and other business rules, then adapt targeting rules accordingly.\n\n===Real-time decision making===\nOnce [[mathematical model]]s have been built, ad/content servers use an [[audience screen]] method to place visitors into segments and select the best offers, in real time.  Business goals are optimized while business rules are enforced simultaneously.  Mathematical models can be refreshed at any time to reflect changes in business goals or rules.\n\n===Statistical learning===\nEnsuring results are repeatable by employing a wide array of statistical methodologies.  Variable selection, validation testing, simulation, [[Scientific control|control groups]] and other techniques together help to distinguish true effects from chance events.  A champion/challenger framework ensures that the best mathematical models are deployed always.  In addition, performance is enhanced by the ability to analyze huge datasets and to retain historical learning.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Audience screen]]\n*[[Behavioral targeting]]\n*[[Conversion marketing|Conversion Marketing]]\n*[[Conversion rate]]\n*[[Digital marketing engineer]]\n*[[Direct marketing]]\n*[[Internet marketing]]\n*[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate testing]]\n*[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]\n*[[Split testing]]\n*[[Personalization#Web pages|Web personalization]]\n*[[A/B testing]]\n*[[User Intent]]\n*[[Search engine optimization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conversion Optimization}}\n[[Category:Digital marketing]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:Conversion marketing example.svg|thumb|A seller wants to optimize the conversion rate from \"saw the advertisement\" to \"clicked the advertisement\", as well as the conversion rate from \"clicked the advertisement\" to \"bought the product\".]]\nIn [[internet marketing]], and web analytics '''conversion optimization''', or '''conversion rate optimization (CRO)''' is a system for increasing the percentage of visitors to a website that [[conversion (marketing)|convert]] into customers,<ref>Kahled, Saleh and Shukairy, Ayat (2011).

Your conversion rate would be 15% for that day. \n\n==Elements of the test focused approach==\nConversion optimization platforms for content, campaigns, and delivery consist of the following elements:\n\n===Data collection and processing===\nThe platform must process hundreds of variables and automatically discover which [[subset]]s have the greatest [[predictive power]], including any [[multivariate testing in marketing|multivariate]] relationship.  A combination of pre- and post-screening methods is employed, dropping irrelevant or redundant data as appropriate.  A flexible [[data warehouse]] environment accepts customer data as well as data aggregated by third parties.\n\nThis means it's essential to ensure the data is as 'clean' as possible, before undertaking any data analysis. For example, eliminating activity from bots, staging websites, or incorrect configurations of tools such as Google Analytics.\n\nData can be [[numeric data|numeric]] or [[text-based]], [[nominal data|nominal]] or [[ordinal data|ordinal]].  Bad or missing values are handled gracefully.\n\nData may be geographic, contextual, frequential, demographic, behavioral, customer based, etc.\n\n===Hypothesis===\nAfter data collection, forming a hypothesis is the next step. This process forms the foundation of why changes are made. Hypotheses are made based on observation and deduction. It is important that each hypothetical situation be measurable. Without these no conclusions can be derived.\n\n===Optimization goals===\nThe official definition of \"optimization\" is the discipline of applying advanced analytical methods to make better decisions.  Under this framework, business goals are explicitly defined and then decisions are calibrated to optimize those goals.  The methodologies  have a long record of success in a wide variety of industries, such as airline scheduling, [[supply chain management]], financial planning, [[military logistics]] and telecommunications routing.  Goals should include maximization of conversions, revenues, profits, [[Loan-to-value ratio|LTV]] or any combination thereof.\n\n===Business rules===\nArbitrary business rules must be handled under one optimization framework. Using such a platform entails that one should understand these and other business rules, then adapt targeting rules accordingly.\n\n===Real-time decision making===\nOnce [[mathematical model]]s have been built, ad/content servers use an [[audience screen]] method to place visitors into segments and select the best offers, in real time.  Business goals are optimized while business rules are enforced simultaneously.  Mathematical models can be refreshed at any time to reflect changes in business goals or rules.\n\n===Statistical learning===\nEnsuring results are repeatable by employing a wide array of statistical methodologies.  Variable selection, validation testing, simulation, [[Scientific control|control groups]] and other techniques together help to distinguish true effects from chance events.  A champion/challenger framework ensures that the best mathematical models are deployed always.  In addition, performance is enhanced by the ability to analyze huge datasets and to retain historical learning.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Audience screen]]\n*[[Behavioral targeting]]\n*[[Conversion marketing|Conversion Marketing]]\n*[[Conversion rate]]\n*[[Digital marketing engineer]]\n*[[Direct marketing]]\n*[[Internet marketing]]\n*[[Multivariate statistics|Multivariate testing]]\n*[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]\n*[[Split testing]]\n*[[Personalization#Web pages|Web personalization]]\n*[[A/B testing]]\n*[[User Intent]]\n*[[Search engine optimization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conversion Optimization}}\n[[Category:Digital marketing]]\n", "name_user": "Italiafirenze", "label": "safe", "comment": "This reference is to a text about media ethics.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate_optimization"}

Transportation Research Part B, 15, 105-111</ref> though many other papers proceeded and have since followed. In turn, these papers have bases in several works from the mid-1950s. Of special importance are a few that have analogies to [[fluid dynamics]] and movement of gases (Lighthill and Whitman (1955) and Richards (1956) postulated the density of traffic to be a function of position; Newell (1955) makes an analogy between vehicle motion along a sparsely populated roadway and the movement of gases). First mention of simulating traffic with \u201chigh speed computers\u201d is given by Gerlough and Mathewson (1956) and Goode (1956).\n\n==Definition==\nThe impetus for modeling vehicles in a stream of traffic and their subsequent actions and reactions comes from the need to analyze changes to roadway parameters. Indeed, many factors (to include driver, traffic flow and roadway conditions, to name a few) affect how traffic behaves. Gipps (1981) describes models current to that time to be in the general form of:\n\n:<math>a_n(t+\\tau)= l_n \\frac {\\left [ v_{n-1}(t)-v_n(t)\\right] ^k }{\\left [ x_{n-1}(t)-x_n(t)\\right] ^m}</math>\n\nwhich is defined primarily by one vehicle (noted by subscript n) following another (noted by subscript n-1); reaction time of the following vehicle; the location, speed and acceleration of the following vehicle; and finally, model constants to adjust the model to real-life conditions. Gipps\u2019 new and improved model should reflect the following properties:\n\n:# The model should reflect real conditions,\n:# Model parameters should correspond to observable driver characteristics without undue calculation, and,\n:# The model should behave as expected when the interval between successive recalculations of speed and position is the same as driver reaction time.\n\nGipps sets limitations on the model through safety considerations and assuming a driver would estimate his or her speed based on the vehicle in front to be able to come to a full and safe stop if needed (1981). Pipes (1953) and many others have defined following characteristics placed into models based on various driver department codes defining safe following speeds, known informally as a \u201c2 second rule,\u201d though is formally defined through code.\n\n;Model notation\n* <math> a_n </math> is the maximum acceleration which the driver of vehicle <math>n</math> wishes to undertake,\n* <math> b_n </math> is the most severe braking that the driver of vehicle <math>n</math> wishes to undertake <math>(b_n<0)</math>,\n* <math>s_n</math> is the effective size of vehicle <math>n</math>, that is, the physical length plus a margin into which the following vehicle is not willing to intrude, even when at rest,\n* <math>V_n</math> is the speed at which the driver of vehicle <math>n</math> wishes to travel,\n* <math>x_n(t)</math> is the location of the front of vehicle <math>n</math> at time *<math>t</math>,\n* <math>v_n(t)</math> is the speed of vehicle <math>n</math> at time <math>t</math>, and\n* <math>\\tau</math> is the apparent reaction time, a constant for all vehicles.<ref name=\"Gipps\" />\n\n;Constraints leading to development\nGipps defines the model by a set of limitations. The following vehicle is limited by two constraints: that it will not exceed its driver's desired speed and its free acceleration should first increase with speed as engine torque increases then decrease to zero as the desired speed is reached.\n\n:<math>v_n(t+\\tau) \\le v_n(t)+2.5 a_n \\tau( 1-v_n /V_n) ( 0.025+v_n( t)/V_n)^{1/2}</math>\n\nThe third constraint, braking, is given by\n\n:<math>x_{n-1}^\\ast = x_{n-1}(t)-v_{n-1}(t)^2/2b_{n-1}</math>\n\nfor vehicle <math>n-1</math> at point <math>x_{n-1}^\\ast</math>, where <math>x_n^\\ast</math> (for vehicle n is given by\n\n:<math>x_n^\\ast=x_n(t)+\\left[v_n(t)+v_n(t+\\tau)\\right]\\tau/2-v_n(t+\\tau)^2/2b_n </math> at time <math>t+\\tau</math>\n\nFor safety, the driver of vehicle n (the following vehicle) must ensure that the difference between point where vehicle n-1 stops (<math>x_{n-1}^\\ast</math>) and the effective size of vehicle n-1 (<math>s_{n-1}</math>) is greater than the point where vehicle n stops (<math>x_n^\\ast</math>). However, Gipps finds the driver of vehicle n allows for an additional buffer and introduces a safety margin, of delay <math>\\theta</math> when driver n is traveling at speed <math>v_n(t+\\tau)</math>. Thus the braking limitation is given by\n\n:<math>x_{n-1}(t) - v_{n-1}(t)^2/2b_{n-1}-s_{n-1} \\ge x_n(t) + \\left[v_n(t)+ v_n(t+\\tau)\\right]\\tau/2+v_n(t+\\tau)\\theta-v_n(t+\\tau)^2/2b_n</math>\n\nBecause a driver in traffic cannot estimate <math>b_{n-1}</math>, it is replaced by an estimated value <math>\\hat{b}</math>. Therefore, the above after replacement yields,\n\n:<math>-v_n(t+\\tau)^2/2b_n+v_n(t+\\tau)(\\tau/2+\\theta)-\\left[x_{n-1}(t)-s_{n-1}-x_n(t)\\right]+v_n(t)\\tau/2+v_{n-1}(t)^2/2\\hat{b} \\le 0</math>\n\nIf the introduced delay, <math>\\theta</math>, is equal to half of the reaction time, <math>\\tau/2</math>, and the driver is willing to brake hard, a model system can continue without disruption to flow. Thus, the previous equation can be rewritten with this in mind to yield\n\n:<math>v_n(t+\\tau) \\le b_n\\tau+\\sqrt{b_n^2\\tau^2-b_n\\left(2\\left[x_{n-1}(t)-s_{n-1}-x_n(t)\\right]-v_n(t)\\tau-v_{n-1}(t)^2/\\hat{b}\\right)}</math>\n\nIf the final assumption is true, that is, the driver travels as fast and safely as possible, the new speed of the driver's vehicle is given by the final equation being Gipps' model:\n\n:<math>v_n(t+\\tau)= \\mbox{min} \\left\\{v_n (t)+2.5a_n \\tau (1-v_n (t)/V_n) \\left(0.025+v_n \\left(t \\right)/V_n \\right)^{1/2} \\right .,</math>\n::::::<math> \\left .b_n\\tau+\\sqrt{b_n^2\\tau^2-b_n\\left[ 2\\left[x_{n-1}(t)-s_{n-1}-x_n(t)\\right] -v_n(t)\\tau-v_{n-1}(t)^2/b\\right]} \\right \\}</math>\n\nwhere the first argument of the minimization regimes describes an uncongested roadway and headways are large, and the second argument describes congested conditions where headways are small and speeds are limited by followed vehicles.\n\nThese two equations used to determine the velocity of a vehicle in the next timestep represent free-flow and congested conditions, respectively. If the vehicle is in free-flow, the free-flow branch of the equation indicates that the speed of the vehicle will increase as a function of its current speed, the speed at which the driver intends to travel, and the acceleration of the vehicle. Analyzing the variables in these two equations, it becomes apparent that as the gap between two vehicles decreases (i.e. a following vehicle approaches a leading vehicle) the velocity given by the congested branch of the equation will decrease and is more likely to prevail.\n\n==Using numerical methods to generate time-space diagrams==\nAfter determining the velocity of the vehicle at the next timestep, its position at the next timestep should be calculated. There are several numerical ([[Runge\u2013Kutta]]) methods that can be used to do this, depending on the accuracy to which the user would prefer. Using higher order methods to calculate a vehicle's position in the next timestep will yield a result with higher accuracy (if each method uses the same timestep). Numerical methods can also be used to find positions of vehicles in other car following models, such as the [[intelligent driver model]].\n\nEulers Method (first order, and perhaps the simplest of the numerical methods) can be used to obtain accurate results, but the timestep would have to be very small, resulting in a greater amount of computation. Also, as a vehicle comes to a stop and the following vehicle approaches it, the term underneath the square root in the congested part of the velocity equation could potentially fall below zero if Euler's method is being used and the timestep is too large. The position of the vehicle in the next timestep is given by the equation:\n\n''x(t+\u03c4)= x(t) +v(t)\u03c4\n\nHigher order methods not only use the velocity in the current timestep, but velocities from the previous timestep to generate a more accurate result. For instance, Huen\u2019s Method (second order) averages the velocity from the current and previous timestep to determine the next position of a vehicle:\n\nButchers Method (fifth order) uses an even more elegant solution to solve the same problem:\n\n''x(t+\u03c4) = x(t) + (1/90)(7k<sub>1</sub> + 32k<sub>3</sub> + 12k<sub>4</sub>+ 32k<sub>5</sub> + 7k<sub>6</sub>)\u03c4''\n\n''k<sub>1</sub> = v(t-\u03c4)\n\n''k<sub>3</sub> = v(t-\u03c4) + (1/4)(v(t) - v(t-\u03c4))\n\n''k<sub>4</sub> = v(t-\u03c4) + (1/2)(v(t) - v(t-\u03c4))\n\n''k<sub>5</sub> = v(t-\u03c4) + (3/4)(v(t) - v(t-\u03c4))\n\n''k<sub>6</sub> = v(t)\n\nUsing higher-order methods reduces the probability that the term under the square root in the congested branch of the velocity equation will fall below zero.\n\nFor the purpose of simulation, it is important to make sure the velocity and position of every vehicle has been calculated for a timestep before determining the moving along to the next timestep.\n\nIn 2000, Wilson used Gipp's model for simulating driver behavior on a ring road. In this case, every vehicle in the system is following another vehicle \u2013 the leader follows the last vehicle. The results of the experiment showed that the cars followed a free-flow time-space trajectory when the density on the ring road was low. However, as the number of vehicles on the road increases (density increases), kinematic waves begin to form as the congested part of the Gipps\u2019 Model velocity equation prevails.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Newell's car-following model]]\n* [[Intelligent driver model]]\n* [[List of Runge\u2013Kutta methods]]\n* [[Simulation]]\n* [[Traffic simulation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bender, J.C. and Fendon R.E.

For instance, Huen\u2019s Method (second order) averages the velocity from the current and previous timestep to determine the next position of a vehicle:\n\nButchers Method (fifth order) uses an even more elegant solution to solve the same problem:\n\n''x(t+\u03c4) = x(t) + (1/90)(7k<sub>1</sub> + 32k<sub>3</sub> + 12k<sub>4</sub>+ 32k<sub>5</sub> + 7k<sub>6</sub>)\u03c4''\n\n''k<sub>1</sub> = v(t-\u03c4)\n\n''k<sub>3</sub> = v(t-\u03c4) + (1/4)(v(t) - v(t-\u03c4))\n\n''k<sub>4</sub> = v(t-\u03c4) + (1/2)(v(t) - v(t-\u03c4))\n\n''k<sub>5</sub> = v(t-\u03c4) + (3/4)(v(t) - v(t-\u03c4))\n\n''k<sub>6</sub> = v(t)\n\nUsing higher-order methods reduces the probability that the term under the square root in the congested branch of the velocity equation will fall below zero.\n\nFor the purpose of simulation, it is important to make sure the velocity and position of every vehicle has been calculated for a timestep before determining the moving along to the next timestep.\n\nIn 2000, Wilson used Gipp\u2019s model for simulating driver behavior on a ring road. In this case, every vehicle in the system is following another vehicle \u2013 the leader follows the last vehicle. The results of the experiment showed that the cars followed a free-flow time-space trajectory when the density on the ring road was low. However, as the number of vehicles on the road increases (density increases), kinematic waves begin to form as the congested part of the Gipps\u2019 Model velocity equation prevails.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Newell's car-following model]]\n* [[Intelligent driver model]]\n* [[List of Runge\u2013Kutta methods]]\n* [[Simulation]]\n* [[Traffic simulation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bender, J.C. and Fendon R.E.

The air force accomplished hundreds of missions, contributing to Romania's recapture of [[Northern Bucovina]] and [[Basarabia]], which had been occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] a year earlier. Until the [[Odessa]] episode{{Clarify|date=June 2013}}, the Romanian military fighters gained 661 air victories. Romanian Military Aviation fought on the Eastern front until August 22, 1944, bringing an important contribution to the great battles in [[Stalingrad]], [[Crimea]], and the Ukrainian fronts.\nBetween 1941\u20131944, Romanian aircraft won 2,000 air victories. The most famous [[flying ace]]s were [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] Prince [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]], who gained 68 certified victories, Captain [[Horia Agarici]] and Captain [[Alexandru \u015eerb\u0103nescu]], who shot down 60 enemy airplanes.\n\nFollowing [[King Michael's Coup]] in August 1944, Romania turned against Germany and joined the allies.\n\n===Cold War===\n[[File:MiG-21MF(DF-SN-83-01219).jpg|thumb|A pair of Romanian MiG-21 fighters, late 1970s]]\n\nStarting with 1948, Romania tailored its military to Soviet concepts and doctrine. On February 15, 1949, the [[Romanian People's Army|Aviation Command]] was established based on the Soviet model (regiments instead of flotillas). New Soviet aircraft, such as [[Yakovlev Yak-18]], [[Polikarpov Po-2]], [[Lavochkin La-9]], [[Tupolev Tu-2]], and [[Ilyushin Il-10]] entered service. A year later, 9 [[Yakovlev Yak-17]]s and [[Yakovlev Yak-23|Yak-23]]s entered the air force, and in 1952, other 88 aircraft: [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]]. In 1958, the first supersonic fighter [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]] entered the inventory. Three years later, in February 1962, a new fighter was added to the inventory, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]], which represented one of the most effective fighters of that time.\n\nStarting with 1974, Romanian-made aircraft supplemented the already existing jets. The Romanian [[IAR-93]] [[attack aircraft]] flew its first flight on 31 October 1974. It represented a great step forward taking into account that it was the only jet fighter not made by the Soviets, the only one ever manufactured and operated by a [[Warsaw Pact]] country.\n\nIn 1962, the first helicopter subunits were established and followed later on, in 1965, by the first Soviet [[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] and [[Mil Mi-4|Mi-4]] helicopters. Renewing the aircraft fleet process went on, the first 12 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]]s entering the service between July\u2013September 1979.\n\nOn 14 May 1981, at 20:16, Soviet [[spacecraft|spaceship]] Soyuz-40 was launched from [[Baikonur]] to perform a common Romanian-Soviet flight, with [[Lieutenant]] [[Dumitru Prunariu]] and [[Colonel]] [[Leonid Popov]] as commander on board. During the early 1980s, 67th Fighter-Bomber Regiment and 49th Fighter-Bomber Regiment from [[Craiova]] and [[Ianca]] were equipped with new IAR-93s, which replaced old MiG-15s and MiG-17s. In December 1989, just a few days before the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian revolution]] against communism began, [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] aircraft entered the Air Force inventory.\n\n====2007 Baltic Air Policing====\n[[File:MiG-29A50RO.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] place in storage since 2003]]\nFour MiG-21 LanceR Cs were deployed from August\u2013November 2007 at [[\u0160iauliai]], in [[Lithuania]] for [[Baltic Air Policing]]. The Romanian detachment succeeded the [[French Air Force]] [[Mirage 2000]]Cs of ''Escadron de Chasse 01.012'' from [[Cambrai]], which fulfilled the Baltic Air Policing since May 2007. Once the RoAF finished its three-month stint, a [[Portuguese Air Force]] detachment took over the mission.<ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], November 2007 issue, p.36.</ref>\n\nThe four aircraft and most of the staff came from the [[RoAF 71st Air Base|71st Air Base]]. A total of 67 personnel, among them nine pilots, were part of the detachment: 63 served at \u0160iauliai, while other four served at the air traffic control centre in [[Kaunas]], to ensure smooth cooperation with local authorities. The Romanian detachment attracted attention from the local media, not least from the fact that it was only the second time a fighter from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era deployed to [[\u0160iauliai]] - [[Polish Air Force]] MiG-29s had also been deployed there in 2006.<ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], November 2007 issue, p.37.</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==Structure==\n===Air Force General Staff===\nThe Romanian Air Force General Staff represents the military concept-developing, command and executive structure providing Air Forces peacetime, crisis and wartime leadership in order to reach, maintain and increase, as required, the [[Operational art|operational level]] of the military subordinated structures so that to be able to operate under authorized commands responsible for military operations planning and conduct.\n\nGenerate, mobilize, structure, equip, operationalize and regenerate the required forces, provide the logistic support necessary to conduct [[military operation]]s and based on higher orders, take over both the Joint Operation Air Component and independent air operations command and control, through the Main Air Operational Center.\nStarting with July 1, 2010, the Romanian Air Force bases were renamed to Air Flotillas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financiarul.ro/2010/07/02/romanias-air-force-staff-to-be-overhauled-starting-july-1-2010/|title=Romania\u2019s Air Force

The school, conducted by French flight instructors, had five hangars, bleachers for spectators and shops where the [[Farman Aviation Works|Farman planes]] imported from France were assembled. The school opened on July 9, 1910, when the chief flight instructor and director of the school [[Ren\u00e9 Guillemin]] crashed a [[Farman III]] biplane from a height of {{convert|40|m|ft}} during a demonstration flight and broke his leg.\n\nGuillemin was succeeded by [[Michel Molla]] who made the first flight across Bucharest on September 7, 1910. Molla was succeeded by two others before the school closed in late 1912 due to financial difficulties, having trained six officers, but only licensed two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earlyaviators.com/enegresc.htm|title=Gheorghe Negrescu|author=Ralph S.

The air force accomplished hundreds of missions, contributing to Romania's recapture of [[Northern Bucovina]] and [[Basarabia]], which had been occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] a year earlier. Until the [[Odessa]] episode{{Clarify|date=June 2013}}, the Romanian military fighters gained 661 air victories. Romanian Military Aviation fought on the Eastern front until August 22, 1944, bringing an important contribution to the great battles in [[Stalingrad]], [[Crimea]], and the Ukrainian fronts.\nBetween 1941-1944, Romanian aircraft won 2,000 air victories. The most famous [[flying ace]]s were [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] Prince [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]], who gained 68 certified victories, Captain [[Horia Agarici]] and Captain [[Alexandru \u015eerb\u0103nescu]], who shot down 60 enemy airplanes.\n\nFollowing [[King Michael's Coup]] in August 1944, Romania turned against Germany and joined the allies.\n\n===Cold War===\n[[File:MiG-21MF(DF-SN-83-01219).jpg|thumb|A pair of Romanian MiG-21 fighters, late 1970s]]\n\nStarting with 1948, Romania tailored its military to Soviet concepts and doctrine. On February 15, 1949, the [[Romanian People's Army|Aviation Command]] was established based on the Soviet model (regiments instead of flotillas). New Soviet aircraft, such as [[Yakovlev Yak-18]], [[Polikarpov Po-2]], [[Lavochkin La-9]], [[Tupolev Tu-2]], and [[Ilyushin Il-10]] entered service. A year later, 9 [[Yakovlev Yak-17]]s and [[Yakovlev Yak-23|Yak-23]]s entered the air force, and in 1952, other 88 aircraft: [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]]. In 1958, the first supersonic fighter [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]] entered the inventory. Three years later, in February 1962, a new fighter was added to the inventory, [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]], which represented one of the most effective fighters of that time.\n\nStarting with 1974, Romanian-made aircraft supplemented the already existing jets. The Romanian [[IAR-93]] [[attack aircraft]] flew its first flight on 31 October 1974. It represented a great step forward taking into account that it was the only jet fighter not made by the Soviets, the only one ever manufactured and operated by a [[Warsaw Pact]] country.\n\nIn 1962, the first helicopter subunits were established and followed later on, in 1965, by the first Soviet [[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] and [[Mil Mi-4|Mi-4]] helicopters. Renewing the aircraft fleet process went on, the first 12 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]]s entering the service between July\u2013September 1979.\n\nOn 14 May 1981, at 20:16, Soviet [[spacecraft|spaceship]] Soyuz-40 was launched from [[Baikonur]] to perform a common Romanian-Soviet flight, with [[Lieutenant]] [[Dumitru Prunariu]] and [[Colonel]] [[Leonid Popov]] as commander on board. During the early 1980s, 67th Fighter-Bomber Regiment and 49th Fighter-Bomber Regiment from [[Craiova]] and [[Ianca]] were equipped with new IAR-93s, which replaced old MiG-15s and MiG-17s. In December 1989, just a few days before the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian revolution]] against communism began, [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] aircraft entered the Air Force inventory.\n\n====2007 Baltic Air Policing====\n[[File:MiG-29A50RO.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] place in storage since 2003]]\nFour MiG-21 LanceR Cs were deployed from August\u2013November 2007 at [[\u0160iauliai]], in [[Lithuania]] for [[Baltic Air Policing]]. The Romanian detachment succeeded the [[French Air Force]] [[Mirage 2000]]Cs of ''Escadron de Chasse 01.012'' from [[Cambrai]], which fulfilled the Baltic Air Policing since May 2007. Once the RoAF finished its three-month stint, a [[Portuguese Air Force]] detachment took over the mission.<ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], November 2007 issue, p.36.</ref>\n\nThe four aircraft and most of the staff came from the [[RoAF 71st Air Base|71st Air Base]]. A total of 67 personnel, among them nine pilots, were part of the detachment: 63 served at \u0160iauliai, while other four served at the air traffic control centre in [[Kaunas]], to ensure smooth cooperation with local authorities. The Romanian detachment attracted attention from the local media, not least from the fact that it was only the second time a fighter from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era deployed to [[\u0160iauliai]] - [[Polish Air Force]] MiG-29s had also been deployed there in 2006.<ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], November 2007 issue, p.37.</ref>\n\n\n\n\n==Structure==\n===Air Force General Staff===\nThe Romanian Air Force General Staff represents the military concept-developing, command and executive structure providing Air Forces peacetime, crisis and wartime leadership in order to reach, maintain and increase, as required, the [[Operational art|operational level]] of the military subordinated structures so that to be able to operate under authorized commands responsible for military operations planning and conduct.\n\nGenerate, mobilize, structure, equip, operationalize and regenerate the required forces, provide the logistic support necessary to conduct [[military operation]]s and based on higher orders, take over both the Joint Operation Air Component and independent air operations command and control, through the Main Air Operational Center.\nStarting with July 1, 2010, the Romanian Air Force bases were renamed to Air Flotillas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financiarul.ro/2010/07/02/romanias-air-force-staff-to-be-overhauled-starting-july-1-2010/|title=Romania\u2019s Air Force

{"title_page": "List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons (VF)", "text_new": "The VF designation was one of the oldest in use by the U.S. Navy. From 1921 to 1948 it designated \"Fighting Plane Squadron\" or \"Fighting Squadron\". It designated \"Fighter Squadron\" from 1948 until 2006 when the last VF squadron was redesignated to Strike Fighter (VFA) squadron.<ref name=\"auto\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I App 4</ref> The designation has not been used since 2006. During the time the VF designation was in use there were two periods during which a suffix letter was added after the squadron designation number. From 1927 to 1937 the suffix letter denoted to which fleet the squadron belonged; B for Battle Fleet and S for Scouting Fleet. From 15 November 1946 to as late as 1 September 1948 the suffix letter denoted to which type of Carrier Air Group the squadron belonged: A for those assigned to [[USS Essex (CV-9)|''Essex'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Attack\" carriers), B for those assigned to the large [[USS Midway (CV-41)|''Midway'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Battle\" carriers), L for those assigned to \"light\" [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|''Independence'']] or [[USS Saipan (CVL-48)|''Siapan'']] class carriers and E for those assigned to remaining small WWII [[Escort carrier|\"escort carriers\"]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I Chap 1</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1937, VF squadron designation numbers were determined by the hull number of the aircraft carrier (CV) from which they operated. VF-3 for example belonged to the Saratoga's Air Group as USS Saratoga was CV 3. When the ship named Air Groups were given designation numbers themselves, their designation numbers matched the CV hull numbers, the Saratoga Air Group became Carrier Air Group Three (CVG-3) and CVG-3's VF squadron was VF-3. With the massive buildup of WWII the CVG numbers became divorced from CV hull numbers, but the CVG's squadrons were still numbered with the CVG to which they were assigned so, VF-6 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-6 and VF-81 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-81. Before and during WWII each ship named Air Group and CVG had only one VF squadron assigned so numbering the VF squadron with the ship hull number or CVG designation number worked well. There were a few exceptions and in those cases either a second digit was added (VF-41 and VF-42) or a letter was added (VF-74A and VF-74B), but those instances were rare. After the war the CVG and squadron designation system was changed. CVGs were redesignated CVAG, CVBG, CVLG and CVEG according to the type of aircraft carrier to which they were assigned and they were all designated with odd numbers. Each had two VF squadrons assigned which were designated VF-1A and VF-2A for CVAG-1, VF-3A and VF-4A for CVAG-3, VF-1B and VF-2B for CVBG-1 etc... On 1 Sep 1948 the designation system changed again dropping the \"A\", \"B\", \"L\" and \"E\" from both the CVG designations and from the squadron designations. CVGs were numbered sequentially beginning with CVG-1 and each had three VF squadrons assigned which were numbered sequentially by using the CVG number followed by a single digit, so CVG-1's VF squadrons were designated VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 and CVG-11's VF squadrons were designated VF-111, VF-112 and VF-113 etc... Beginning in 1949 most CVGs received a fourth VF squadron (VF-14, VF-24, VF-114 etc...). These varied designation systems used through the years resulted in squadron designations being reused for completely unrelated squadrons; take the designations VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 for example. The first use of each of those designations was used to designate the single VF squadron of each of three different CVGs during WWII, CVG-11, CVG-12 and CVG-13. The second use of those designations designated three VF squadrons of CVG-1 after 1 September 1948.\n\nThroughout this entire period, from pre-WWII to 1965, as squadrons were reassigned from one CVG to another they were redesignated to conform with the numbering system of that CVG. That practice began to be abandoned by the mid 1950s but did not completely cease until 1965. By then, all squadron designation numbers had been \"frozen\" and were divorced from the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) designation numbers. Later, newly established squadrons were numbered either sequentially (such as VF-1 and VF-2 established in 1972) or were given designation numbers to commemorate a long-serving disestablished squadron (VF-191 established in 1986 commemorated a squadron which had existed from 1943 to 1978). This is why today there are squadrons with numbers as low as VFA-2 and as high as VFA-213 with many numbers missing in between.\n\nThe table below does not list disestablished squadrons, it is a list of squadron designations which are no longer in use. In most cases a single squadron carried multiple designations between the time it was established and the time it was disestablished, therefore multiple designations in the table belonged to a single squadron. Most of the squadron designations in the table belonged to squadrons which have been disestablished, but also included are former designations of some VFA squadrons which are still active, and one which has been deactivated. This table includes all \"VF\" designations that have been used by US Navy aircraft squadrons except for those assigned to USNR squadrons which existed before 1970 unless they were activated, in which case they are included. It also does not include 25 \"VF(N)\" designations (night fighter) which were used between 1943 and 1946.<ref name=\"history.navy.mil\">https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/insignias/naval-aviation-squadron-lineage/fighter-squadron-lineage.html</ref> Sorting the table by the \"Disestablished as (or current designation)\" column will display all designations belonging to a single squadron grouped together, note that many squadrons were designated as both VF and VA squadrons at different times during their existence.\n\nNote: The parenthetical (first use), (second use), (1st), (2nd), (3rd) etc... appended to some designations in the table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \"\n! Designation !! Insignia !! Nickname !!

1948. Squadron suffix letters were dropped and CVAGs and CVBGs were all redesignated CVGs. New squadron designation numbers denoted to which CVG the squadron was assigned with the first one or two digits denoting the CVG followed by a 1, 2 or 3 to differentiate between the VF squadrons (CVG-1: VF-11, VF-12, VF-13; CVG-2: VF-21, VF-22, VF-23; CVG-11: VF-111, VF-112, VF-113; CVG-15: VF-151, VF-152, VF-153 etc...). A fourth VF squadron (VF-__4) was added to most CVGs beginning in 1949. When a squadron was moved from one CVG to another it was redesignated to conform with the designation of the newly assigned CVG. That practice had begun to be abandoned by the mid 1950s when squadrons which were transferred from one CVG to another were redesignated in some cases but not in others. By 1965 the practice of redesignataing squadrons in accordance with Carrier Air Wing (CVGs were retitled Carrier Air Wings (CVW) on 20 December 1963) assignment had ceased completely and squadron designations were \"frozen\" and divorced from Carrier Air Wing designations. Squadrons and CVGs are grouped by designation below for ease of reading the table but it should not be assumed that the listed squadrons were assigned only to the CVG in which section they appear in the table.\n|-\n|[[VF-1 (1945-8)|VF-1<br/>(1945-8)]]<br/>(fourth use)\n|\n|Firebirds\n|[[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F]]\n|VF-41(2nd): 26 Mar 1945-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1E: 15 Nov 1946-1 Sep 1948<br/>'''VF-1(4th): 1 Sep 1948-20 Nov 1948'''\n|VF-1 (4th)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|20 November 1948\n|When CVEG-1 was disestablished on 1 Sep 1948 its VF squadron was redesignated VF-1(4th) until it was disestablished less than three months later\n|-\n!colspan=8|[[Carrier Air Wing One|''CVG-1'' (2nd)]]: CVAG-1 redesignated ''CVG-1'' (2nd) 1 Sep 1948, currently exists as CVW-1\n|-\n|[[VF-11|VF-11<br/>(1948-59)]]<br>(second use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]\n|Red Rippers\n|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat|F8F]]<br/>[[McDonnell F2H Banshee|F2H]]\n|VF-5(1st): 1 Feb 1927-1 Jul 1927<br/>VF-5S(1st): 1 Jul 1927-Jan 1928<br/>VF-5B(1st): Jan 1928-1 Jul 1928<br/>''[[U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Aircraft Squadron Designations|VB]]-1B'': 1 Jul 1928-1 Jul 1930<br/>VF-5B(2nd): 1 Jul 1930-Jul 1932<br/>VF-5S(2nd): Jul 1932-Apr 1933<br/>VF-5B(3rd): Apr 1933-1 Jul 1937<br/>VF-4(2nd): 1 Jul 1937-15 Mar 1941<br/>VF-41(1st): 15 Mar 1941-4 Aug 1943<br/>VF-4(4th): 4 Aug 1943-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1A: 15 Nov 1946-2 Aug 1948<br/>'''VF-11(2nd): 2 Aug 1948-15 Feb 1959'''\n|VF-11 (2nd)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|15 February 1959\n|Original \"Red Rippers\" squadron.<br/>Redesignated as one of '''CVG-1'''(2nd)'s initial squadrons\n|-\n|[[VFA-11|VF-11<br/>(1959-2005)]]<br>(third use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]<br/>(Adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|Red Rippers<br/>(adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|[[Vought F-8 Crusader|F8U/F-8]]<br/>[[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]<br/>[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]\n|VF-43(4th): 1 Sep 1950-16 Feb 1959<br/>'''VF-11(3rd): 16 Feb 1959-5 Nov 2005'''<br/>''VFA-11'': 5 Nov 2005\u2013present\n|VFA-11\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|Not applicable, still exists\n|Was redesignated VF-11(3rd) the day after VF-11(2nd) was disestablished to replace VF-11(2nd) in '''CVG-1'''(2nd).

From 1921 to 1948 it designated \"Fighting Plane Squadron\" or \"Fighting Squadron\". It designated \"Fighter Squadron\" from 1948 until 2006 when the last VF squadron was redesignated to Strike Fighter (VFA) squadron.<ref name=\"auto\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I App 4</ref> The designation has not been used since 2006. During the time the VF designation was in use there were two periods during which a suffix letter was added after the squadron designation number. From 1927 to 1937 the suffix letter denoted to which fleet the squadron belonged; B for Battle Fleet and S for Scouting Fleet. From 15 November 1946 to as late as 1 September 1948 the suffix letter denoted to which type of Carrier Air Group the squadron belonged: A for those assigned to [[USS Essex (CV-9)|''Essex'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Attack\" carriers), B for those assigned to the large [[USS Midway (CV-41)|''Midway'']] class carriers (sometimes called \"Battle\" carriers), L for those assigned to \"light\" [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|''Independence'']] or [[USS Saipan (CVL-48)|''Siapan'']] class carriers and E for those assigned to remaining small WWII [[Escort carrier|\"escort carriers\"]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons Vol I Chap 1</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1937, VF squadron designation numbers were determined by the hull number of the aircraft carrier (CV) from which they operated. VF-3 for example belonged to the Saratoga's Air Group as USS Saratoga was CV 3. When the ship named Air Groups were given designation numbers themselves, their designation numbers matched the CV hull numbers, the Saratoga Air Group became Carrier Air Group Three (CVG-3) and CVG-3's VF squadron was VF-3. With the massive buildup of WWII the CVG numbers became divorced from CV hull numbers, but the CVG's squadrons were still numbered with the CVG to which they were assigned so, VF-6 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-6 and VF-81 was the fighter squadron assigned to CVG-81. Before and during WWII each ship named Air Group and CVG had only one VF squadron assigned so numbering the VF squadron with the ship hull number or CVG designation number worked well. There were a few exceptions and in those cases either a second digit was added (VF-41 and VF-42) or a letter was added (VF-74A and VF-74B), but those instances were rare. After the war the CVG and squadron designation system was changed. CVGs were redesignated CVAG, CVBG, CVLG and CVEG according to the type of aircraft carrier to which they were assigned and they were all designated with odd numbers. Each had two VF squadrons assigned which were designated VF-1A and VF-2A for CVAG-1, VF-3A and VF-4A for CVAG-3, VF-1B and VF-2B for CVBG-1 etc... On 1 Sep 1948 the designation system changed again dropping the \"A\", \"B\", \"L\" and \"E\" from both the CVG designations and from the squadron designations. CVGs were numbered sequentially beginning with CVG-1 and each had three VF squadrons assigned which were numbered sequentially by using the CVG number followed by a single digit, so CVG-1's VF squadrons were designated VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 and CVG-11's VF squadrons were designated VF-111, VF-112 and VF-113 etc... Beginning in 1949 most CVGs received a fourth VF squadron (VF-14, VF-24, VF-114 etc...). These varied designation systems used though the years resulted in squadron designations being reused for completely unrelated squadrons; take the designations VF-11, VF-12 and VF-13 for example. The first use of each of those designations was used to designate the single VF squadron of each of three different CVGs during WWII, CVG-11, CVG-12 and CVG-13. The second use of those designations designated three VF squadrons of CVG-1 after 1 September 1948.\n\nThroughout this entire period, from pre-WWII to 1965, as squadrons were reassigned from one CVG to another they were redesignated to conform with the numbering system of that CVG. That practice began to be abandoned by the mid 1950s but did not completely cease until 1965. By then, all squadron designation numbers had been \"frozen\" and were divorced from the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) designation numbers. Later, newly established squadrons were numbered either sequentially (such as VF-1 and VF-2 established in 1972) or were given designation numbers to commemorate a long serving disestablished squadron (VF-191 established in 1986 commemorated a squadron which had existed from 1943 to 1978). This is why today there are squadrons with numbers as low as VFA-2 and as high as VFA-213 with many numbers missing in between.\n\nThe table below does not list disestablished squadrons, it is a list of squadron designations which are no longer in use. In most cases a single squadron carried multiple designations between the time it was established and the time it was disestablished, therefore multiple designations in the table belonged to a single squadron. Most of the squadron designations in the table belonged to squadrons which have been disestablished, but also included are former designations of some VFA squadrons which are still active, and one which has been deactivated. This table includes all \"VF\" designations which have been used by US Navy aircraft squadrons except for those assigned to USNR squadrons which existed before 1970 unless they were activated, in which case they are included. It also does not include 25 \"VF(N)\" designations (night fighter) which were used between 1943 and 1946.<ref name=\"history.navy.mil\">https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/insignias/naval-aviation-squadron-lineage/fighter-squadron-lineage.html</ref> Sorting the table by the \"Disestablished as (or current designation)\" column will display all designations belonging to a single squadron grouped together, note that many squadrons were designated as both VF and VA squadrons at different times during their existence.\n\nNote: The parenthetical (first use), (second use), (1st), (2nd), (3rd) etc... appended to some designations in the table below are not a part of the squadron designation system. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and which use of the designation is indicated. Absence indicates that the designation was used only once.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \"\n! Designation !! Insignia !! Nickname !!

1948. Squadron suffix letters were dropped and CVAGs and CVBGs were all redesignated CVGs. New squadron designation numbers denoted to which CVG the squadron was assigned with the first one or two digits denoting the CVG followed by a 1, 2 or 3 to differentiate between the VF squadrons (CVG-1: VF-11, VF-12, VF-13; CVG-2: VF-21, VF-22, VF-23; CVG-11: VF-111, VF-112, VF-113; CVG-15: VF-151, VF-152, VF-153 etc...). A fourth VF squadron (VF-__4) was added to most CVGs beginning in 1949. When a squadron was moved from one CVG to another it was redesignated to conform with the designation of the newly assigned CVG. That practice had begun to be abandoned by the mid 1950s when squadrons which were transferred from one CVG to another were redesignated in some cases but not in others. By 1965 the practice of redesignataing squadrons in accordance with Carrier Air Wing (CVGs were retitled Carrier Air Wings (CVW) on 20 December 1963) assignment had ceased completely and squadron designations were \"frozen\" and divorced from Carrier Air Wing designations. Squadrons and CVGs are grouped by designation below for ease of reading the table but it should not be assumed that the listed squadrons were assigned only to the CVG in which section they appear in the table.\n|-\n|[[VF-1 (1945-8)|VF-1<br/>(1945-8)]]<br/>(fourth use)\n|\n|Firebirds\n|[[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F]]\n|VF-41(2nd): 26 Mar 1945-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1E: 15 Nov 1946-1 Sep 1948<br/>'''VF-1(4th): 1 Sep 1948-20 Nov 1948'''\n|VF-1 (4th)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|20 November 1948\n|When CVEG-1 was disestablished on 1 Sep 1948 its VF squadron was redesignated VF-1(4th) until it was disestablished less than three months later\n|-\n!colspan=8|[[Carrier Air Wing One|''CVG-1'' (2nd)]]: CVAG-1 redesignated ''CVG-1'' (2nd) 1 Sep 1948, currently exists as CVW-1\n|-\n|[[VF-11|VF-11<br/>(1948-59)]]<br>(second use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]\n|Red Rippers\n|[[Grumman F8F Bearcat|F8F]]<br/>[[McDonnell F2H Banshee|F2H]]\n|VF-5(1st): 1 Feb 1927-1 Jul 1927<br/>VF-5S(1st): 1 Jul 1927-Jan 1928<br/>VF-5B(1st): Jan 1928-1 Jul 1928<br/>''[[U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Aircraft Squadron Designations|VB]]-1B'': 1 Jul 1928-1 Jul 1930<br/>VF-5B(2nd): 1 Jul 1930-Jul 1932<br/>VF-5S(2nd): Jul 1932-Apr 1933<br/>VF-5B(3rd): Apr 1933-1 Jul 1937<br/>VF-4(2nd): 1 Jul 1937-15 Mar 1941<br/>VF-41(1st): 15 Mar 1941-4 Aug 1943<br/>VF-4(4th): 4 Aug 1943-15 Nov 1946<br/>VF-1A: 15 Nov 1946-2 Aug 1948<br/>'''VF-11(2nd): 2 Aug 1948-15 Feb 1959'''\n|VF-11 (2nd)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|15 February 1959\n|Original \"Red Rippers\" squadron.<br/>Redesignated as one of '''CVG-1'''(2nd)'s initial squadrons\n|-\n|[[VFA-11|VF-11<br/>(1959-2005)]]<br>(third use)\n|[[File:Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (US Navy) insignia, 2015.png|40px]]<br/>(Adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|Red Rippers<br/>(adopted from disestablished VF-11(2nd))\n|[[Vought F-8 Crusader|F8U/F-8]]<br/>[[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]<br/>[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]\n|VF-43(4th): 1 Sep 1950-16 Feb 1959<br/>'''VF-11(3rd): 16 Feb 1959-5 Nov 2005'''<br/>''VFA-11'': 5 Nov 2005\u2013present\n|VFA-11\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|Not applicable, still exists\n|Was redesignated VF-11(3rd) the day after VF-11(2nd) was disestablished to replace VF-11(2nd) in '''CVG-1'''(2nd).

A  self-[[record producer|produced]] effort,<ref name=\"411mania\"/> ''Indestructible'' is the first Disturbed album that did not feature [[Johnny K]], the producer of Disturbed's previous three albums, ''[[The Sickness]]'', ''[[Believe (Disturbed album)|Believe]]'', and ''[[Ten Thousand Fists]]''. ''Indestructible'' was recorded at Groovemaster Studios in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The album features two songs, \"[[Perfect Insanity]]\" and \"Divide\",<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/><ref name=\"newsongkuwait\"/> that were written by Disturbed prior to their first album, ''The Sickness'', but were never previously released.\n\nThe album features significantly darker themes than any of Disturbed's previous work, according to the band. Some of the lyrical themes involve actual experiences that vocalist [[David Draiman]] had endured over the course of the past few years prior to making the album, including \"bad relationships\",<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> a motorcycle accident that he was involved with, and an incident of [[suicide]]. To match the aggressive attitude and nature of said themes, Draiman told the other band members to create darker, more textural music than they have before. Despite these themes, the title track, \"[[Indestructible (Disturbed song)|Indestructible]]\", is meant to encourage those in the military that are fighting in wars and boost their [[morale]].<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/>\n\n''Indestructible'' was released on June 3, 2008 in [[Compact Disc]] format, and also as two different limited edition and special edition [[digipak]]s,<ref name=\"preorder\"/> debuting at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it the third consecutive number one debut by Disturbed on that chart, which had only been achieved by five other rock bands prior to the album's release.<ref name=\"Indestructible #1 for 5 weeks\"/> The album also shipped over 253,000 units in its opening week.<ref name=\"Indestructible is #1 on charts\"/> ''Indestructible'' was met with mixed reviews by critics, earning a score of 57% on review-aggregating website [[Metacritic]], based on six reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/indestructible|title=Metacritic score|accessdate=September 30, 2008|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 2009 for shipping over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The [[Single (music)|single]] \"[[Inside the Fire (song)|Inside the Fire]]\" was nominated for a 2009 [[Grammy Award]] in the \"[[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]\" category.<ref name=\"grammyawards\"/>\n\n==Recording and production==\nAfter touring in support of the band's previous album, ''[[Ten Thousand Fists]]'', the band took a break. During this time, drummer [[Mike Wengren]] got married, and guitarist [[Dan Donegan]] had a child. In February 2007, after the break was over, the band went to Groovemaster Studios in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and began writing music. ''Indestructible'' is Disturbed's first self-produced effort, without [[Johnny K]] acting as producer, as he did on the band's previous albums, ''[[The Sickness]]'', ''[[Believe (Disturbed album)|Believe]]'', and ''Ten Thousand Fists''.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The band was comfortable with self-producing, despite having Johnny K produce two consecutive number-one albums, and this being their first time without him. As vocalist [[David Draiman]] reasoned, \"we learned it, and we'd like to try [self-producing].\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\">{{cite DVD notes|title=The Making of Indestructible|origyear=2008|others=Rafa Alcantara|type=booklet|publisher=Twentyfourcore Productions|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the writing process, Donegan created guitar [[riff]]s. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote the rest of the music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, \"The writing process is&nbsp;... pretty much the same since the beginning&nbsp;... of this band. It's always been riffs; something musically that I'll come up with [that begins the writing process].\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Wengren commented, \"We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Bassist [[John Moyer]] left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, \"When the basic guitar, bass, [and] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n\nWhen the instrumentation was completed, Draiman began to write melody lines for each song.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Draiman commented, \"I'm a big believer in the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate what it is to be about and so if you start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The first song completed musically was \"[[The Night (Disturbed song)|The Night]]\", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record ''The Night''.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> As Draiman recalled, \"The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, [[Reprise Records]], and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n{{Listen\n|filename=DivideDisturbedcomparisons.ogg\n|title=Disturbed \"Divide\" (1990s/2008)\n|description=Comparison of the 2008 ''Indestructible'' recording of the song \"Divide\", and the demo version from early in Disturbed's career, respectively.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nWengren commented, \"We thought it would be pretty cool, especially for the fans, if we brought back maybe a song or two, that were actually written during the same period that ''[[The Sickness]]'' songs were written. Danny brought in some old demo tapes, I'm talking twelve years old, back when '[[Down With the Sickness]]' and '[[Stupify]]' [''[[sic]]''], and all that stuff was written, this was actually written before that.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The songs that Wengren was referring to were \"[[Perfect Insanity]]\",<ref name=\"newsongkuwait\"/> and \"Divide\".<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The band also recorded a version of the song \"[[Midlife Crisis]]\", which was originally performed by [[Faith No More]].

One song, titled \"Emptiness\", was never fully recorded ever by the band.\n\n==Title==\n''Indestructible'' took the longest amount of time to title when compared to Disturbed's previous records, according to Wengren. The band had originally wanted to title the record ''The Night'', because it was the first track to be completed, and it defined the musical direction the band wanted to use with ''Indestructible''. The record had a song whose working title was \"Defend\", but it eventually was re-titled \"[[Indestructible (Disturbed song)|Indestructible]]\". When the title was changed, the band felt the title had, as Donegan reasoned, \"made a bigger statement\".<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Draiman said they titled the record ''Indestructible'' because the title \"...&nbsp;kind of symbolizes the fact that we're still fucking here, that we haven't been destroyed, that we withstood the test of time.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n\nRegarding the choice of the title, Moyer commented, \"Usually there's some name or phrase that sort of sums up, you know, what the vibe of the record's about, so this one's ''Indestructible'', and it is an aggressive record, this record's about kicking ass.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Donegan, commenting on the meaning of the title, stated, \"We feel that we've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business, and continuing a success with it.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Draiman concluded, \"We have been through a lot. No matter what gets thrown at us, as a band, no matter what happens in the musical environment, we're still here, we're still viable, and still standing.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n\n==Musical style and lyrical themes==\n{{Listen\n|filename=TornDisturbedSoloSample.ogg\n|title=Disturbed \"Torn\" (2008)\n|description=The incorporation of guitar solos, such as the one used in this sample of \"Torn\", was considered a significant expansion of Disturbed's typical sound and was generally praised by most critics.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nVocalist [[David Draiman]] states that, lyrically, the album was inspired by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. \"I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles,\" Draiman commented. \"...&nbsp;I've had really bad relationships that I've been in and out of. They've left their mark\",<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> he concluded. The song \"[[Indestructible (Disturbed song)|Indestructible]]\" is \"an anthem for soldiers\", Draiman comments.<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> \"It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong,\"<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> he concludes. Cuts such as \"Deceiver\" and \"[[Inside the Fire (song)|Inside the Fire]]\" are about \"really bad relationships\".<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> \"Inside the Fire\" is about \"standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself,\" says Draiman.<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> The song \"[[The Night (Disturbed song)|The Night]]\" is, \"just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it,\" Draiman comments.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The band's vocalist also says the song \"[[Perfect Insanity]]\" is about \"toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [insane] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies.\"<ref name=\"daviddraimanpodcastinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://hbbpodcast.blogspot.com/2008/04/interview-with-disturbed-frontman-david.html|title=David Draiman interview on Headbangers Ball Podcast|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=January 19, 2009|publisher=[[Headbangers Ball]]}}</ref> Draiman says the track \"Divide\" \"is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!'

(band)|Disturbed]]. A  self-[[record producer|produced]] effort,<ref name=\"411mania\"/> ''Indestructible'' is the first Disturbed album that did not feature [[Johnny K]], the producer of Disturbed's previous three albums, ''[[The Sickness]]'', ''[[Believe (Disturbed album)|Believe]]'', and ''[[Ten Thousand Fists]]''. ''Indestructible'' was recorded at Groovemaster Studios in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The album features two songs, \"[[Perfect Insanity]]\" and \"Divide\",<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/><ref name=\"newsongkuwait\"/> that were written by Disturbed prior to their first album, ''The Sickness'', but were never previously released.\n\nThe album features significantly darker themes than any of Disturbed's previous work, according to the band. Some of the lyrical themes involve actual experiences that vocalist [[David Draiman]] had endured over the course of the past few years prior to making the album, including \"bad relationships\",<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> a motorcycle accident that he was involved with, and an incident of [[suicide]]. To match the aggressive attitude and nature of said themes, Draiman told the other band members to create darker, more textural music than they have before. Despite these themes, the title track, \"[[Indestructible (Disturbed song)|Indestructible]]\", is meant to encourage those in the military that are fighting in wars and boost their [[morale]].<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/>\n\n''Indestructible'' was released on June 3, 2008 in [[Compact Disc]] format, and also as two different limited edition and special edition [[digipak]]s,<ref name=\"preorder\"/> debuting at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it the third consecutive number one debut by Disturbed on that chart, which had only been achieved by five other rock bands prior to the album's release.<ref name=\"Indestructible #1 for 5 weeks\"/> The album also shipped over 253,000 units in its opening week.<ref name=\"Indestructible is #1 on charts\"/> ''Indestructible'' was met with mixed reviews by critics, earning a score of 57% on review-aggregating website [[Metacritic]], based on six reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/indestructible|title=Metacritic score|accessdate=September 30, 2008|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 2009 for shipping over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The [[Single (music)|single]] \"[[Inside the Fire (song)|Inside the Fire]]\" was nominated for a 2009 [[Grammy Award]] in the \"[[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]\" category.<ref name=\"grammyawards\"/>\n\n==Recording and production==\nAfter touring in support of the band's previous album, ''[[Ten Thousand Fists]]'', the band took a break. During this time, drummer [[Mike Wengren]] got married, and guitarist [[Dan Donegan]] had a child. In February 2007, after the break was over, the band went to Groovemaster Studios in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and began writing music. ''Indestructible'' is Disturbed's first self-produced effort, without [[Johnny K]] acting as producer, as he did on the band's previous albums, ''[[The Sickness]]'', ''[[Believe (Disturbed album)|Believe]]'', and ''Ten Thousand Fists''.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The band was comfortable with self-producing, despite having Johnny K produce two consecutive number-one albums, and this being their first time without him. As vocalist [[David Draiman]] reasoned, \"we learned it, and we'd like to try [self-producing].\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\">{{cite DVD notes|title=The Making of Indestructible|origyear=2008|others=Rafa Alcantara|type=booklet|publisher=Twentyfourcore Productions|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the writing process, Donegan created guitar [[riff]]s. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote the rest of the music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, \"The writing process is&nbsp;... pretty much the same since the beginning&nbsp;... of this band. It's always been riffs; something musically that I'll come up with [that begins the writing process].\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Wengren commented, \"We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Bassist [[John Moyer]] left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, \"When the basic guitar, bass, [and] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n\nWhen the instrumentation was completed, Draiman began to write melody lines for each song.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Draiman commented, \"I'm a big believer in the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate what it is to be about and so if you start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The first song completed musically was \"[[The Night (Disturbed song)|The Night]]\", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record ''The Night''.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> As Draiman recalled, \"The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, [[Reprise Records]], and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n{{Listen\n|filename=DivideDisturbedcomparisons.ogg\n|title=Disturbed \"Divide\" (1990s/2008)\n|description=Comparison of the 2008 ''Indestructible'' recording of the song \"Divide\", and the demo version from early in Disturbed's career, respectively.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nWengren commented, \"We thought it would be pretty cool, especially for the fans, if we brought back maybe a song or two, that were actually written during the same period that ''[[The Sickness]]'' songs were written. Danny brought in some old demo tapes, I'm talking twelve years old, back when '[[Down With the Sickness]]' and '[[Stupify]]' [''[[sic]]''], and all that stuff was written, this was actually written before that.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The songs that Wengren was referring to were \"[[Perfect Insanity]]\",<ref name=\"newsongkuwait\"/> and \"Divide\".<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> The band also recorded a version of the song \"[[Midlife Crisis]]\", which was originally performed by [[Faith No More]]. Draiman comments, \"We took the song, revamped it and modernized it to our current level, and the version's killer.\"<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/21/in-the-studio-disturbeds-david-draiman-talks-indestructible-new-album/|title=In the studio: Disturbed\u2019s David Draiman talks ''Indestructible'' new album|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=August 29, 2008|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Daniel|last=Kreps}}</ref> However, the song did not make it into the final track listing of the album,<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> and is instead featured on ''[[Covered, A Revolution in Sound]]''.<ref name=\"warnerbroscovered\">{{cite magazine|title=Warner acts go covers crazy for compilation|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269622/warner-acts-go-covers-crazy-for-compilation|date=January 13, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2009|magazine=[[Billboard.com]]|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan}}</ref> This version of \"Midlife Crisis\" later appeared on ''[[The Lost Children (album)|The Lost Children]]'', the band's first compilation album. One song, titled \"Emptiness\", was never fully recorded ever by the band.\n\n==Title==\n''Indestructible'' took the longest amount of time to title when compared to Disturbed's previous records, according to Wengren. The band had originally wanted to title the record ''The Night'', because it was the first track to be completed, and it defined the musical direction the band wanted to use with ''Indestructible''. The record had a song whose working title was \"Defend\", but it eventually was re-titled \"[[Indestructible (Disturbed song)|Indestructible]]\". When the title was changed, the band felt the title had, as Donegan reasoned, \"made a bigger statement\".<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Draiman said they titled the record ''Indestructible'' because the title \"...&nbsp;kind of symbolizes the fact that we're still fucking here, that we haven't been destroyed, that we withstood the test of time.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n\nRegarding the choice of the title, Moyer commented, \"Usually there's some name or phrase that sort of sums up, you know, what the vibe of the record's about, so this one's ''Indestructible'', and it is an aggressive record, this record's about kicking ass.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Donegan, commenting on the meaning of the title, stated, \"We feel that we've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business, and continuing a success with it.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/> Draiman concluded, \"We have been through a lot. No matter what gets thrown at us, as a band, no matter what happens in the musical environment, we're still here, we're still viable, and still standing.\"<ref name=\"indestructible DVD\"/>\n\n==Musical style and lyrical themes==\n{{Listen\n|filename=TornDisturbedSoloSample.ogg\n|title=Disturbed \"Torn\" (2008)\n|description=The incorporation of guitar solos, such as the one used in this sample of \"Torn\", was considered a significant expansion of Disturbed's typical sound and was generally praised by most critics.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nVocalist [[David Draiman]] states that, lyrically, the album was inspired by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. \"I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles,\" Draiman commented. \"...&nbsp;I've had really bad relationships that I've been in and out of. They've left their mark\",<ref name=\"disturbedmidlifecrisis\"/> he concluded.

The character is depicted as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], one of the student body in the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], and a member of the former [[New Mutants]] squad therein. She maintained her powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and was the leader of the [[New X-Men]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nSurge was created by [[Nunzio DeFilippis]], [[Christina Weir]], [[Keron Grant]] and first appeared in ''[[New Mutants#The New Mutants, vol. 2|New Mutants]]'', vol. 2 #8 (January 2004).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=366}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNoriko Ashida was born in [[Japan]]. She was close to her brother, Keitaro, but she ran away from home after her powers manifested when she was thirteen years old; she claimed that her father \"doesn't believe in mutants.\" How she came to the [[United States]] is unknown, but she ended up [[homeless]] on the streets of [[North Salem, New York|Salem Center]], reduced to buying [[illegal drug use|illegal drugs]] using stolen money.\n\nWith no training or practice in the use of her powers, Noriko's body would automatically absorb all nearby electricity and, once fully charged, release it in a storm of electrical bolts. In addition, her acceleration ability would force her to speak so quickly that no one could understand her. Though she found no treatment for most of these problems, the drugs would sedate her body enough that she could control her outbursts of electrical power. Keeping herself regularly supplied proved impossible, however, and during a robbery Noriko accidentally hits the young owner of a coffee shop with an electric bolt. A group of young mutants find her and bring her back to the X-Mansion. There, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] designs gauntlets that regulate her absorption of ambient electricity and discharge as required to prevent further mental overloads.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 2 #8-10 (January - May 2004)</ref>\n\nNori becomes a student of the Xavier Institute and, when the school adopts a squad system, is assigned to the [[New Mutants]] squad led by [[Danielle Moonstar]]. She is forced to share a room with [[Dust (comics)|Dust]]; the two young women disagree upon the role of women and the [[Muslim]] traditions that Dust follows.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #2 (August 2004)</ref> Though initially hostile to the mutants who took her off the street - [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|David Alleyne]], [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]], [[Sofia Mantega]], and [[Wallflower (comics)|Laurie Collins]] - she soon comes to accept them as her friends.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 2 #12 (June 2004)</ref><ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #1 (July 2004)</ref>\n\nDavid asks [[Emma Frost]] to remove a mental block in his mind inhibiting him from recalling all the information and skills he has acquired. David sees a possible future in which he becomes the world's foremost genius, marries Noriko, and leads to her death. Disturbed, David begins to avoid her. Annoyed at such treatment, Nori ultimately confronts David, which leads to the two becoming an active couple.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #10-11</ref>\n\nNoriko retains her powers after the events of [[House of M]].  With [[New X-Men|only 27 students retaining their powers]], Emma Frost orders the depowered students and staff, including Nori's advisor [[Danielle Moonstar]], to leave the Institute. As it departs, one bus of depowered students is bombed by anti-mutant zealot Reverend [[William Stryker]], killing all on board. Though depowered, David is not killed, and he and Nori further their romantic relationship.<ref>''New X-Men'' #22</ref> Most of the remaining students are organized into a melee fight to determine who would become a member of Emma Frost's [[New X-Men#X-Men trainees|X-Men-in-training]]. Nori is chosen by Frost to be the team's leader. Soon afterwards, Nori receives new, lighter, and more effective gauntlets from [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\nCaught in an argument over the rescue of [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Cessily]], Surge and [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] are the only students that are not teleported to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] uses her powers to get a message to the two, informing them that the Institute students had been taken into Limbo by [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]], and that Belasco killed David. Coordinating with O*N*E*, Surge and Hellion discover that [[Amanda Sefton]] has been expelled from Limbo and is in a coma in Germany. Surge becomes impulsive and angry at David's death, threatening the O*N*E* troopers when they attempt to block her from seeing Sefton, using her electrical powers to revive the sorceress despite the risks.<ref>''New X-Men'' #40</ref> At the behest of Lexington, Megaton's pilot, Surge and Hellion stop fighting demons and head for the castle.

The character is depicted as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], one of the student body in the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], and a member of the former [[New Mutants]] squad therein. She maintained her powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and was the leader of the [[New X-Men]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nSurge was created by [[Nunzio DeFilippis]], [[Christina Weir]], [[Keron Grant]] and first appeared in ''[[New Mutants#The New Mutants, vol. 2|New Mutants]]'', vol. 2 #8 (January 2004).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=366}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNoriko Ashida was born in [[Japan]]. She was close to her brother, Keitaro, but she ran away from home after her powers manifested when she was thirteen years old; she claimed that her father \"doesn't believe in mutants.\" How she came to the [[United States]] is unknown, but she ended up [[homeless]] on the streets of [[North Salem, New York|Salem Center]], reduced to buying [[illegal drug use|illegal drugs]] using stolen money.\n\nWith no training or practice in the use of her powers, Noriko's body would automatically absorb all nearby electricity and, once fully charged, release it in a storm of electrical bolts. In addition, her acceleration ability would force her to speak so quickly that no one could understand her. Though she found no treatment for most of these problems, the drugs would sedate her body enough that she could control her outbursts of electrical power. Keeping herself regularly supplied proved impossible, however, and during a robbery Noriko accidentally hits the young owner of a coffee shop with an electric bolt. A group of young mutants find her and bring her back to the X-Mansion. There, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] designs gauntlets that regulate her absorption of ambient electricity and discharge as required to prevent further mental overloads.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 2 #8-10 (January - May 2004)</ref>\n\nNori becomes a student of the Xavier Institute and, when the school adopts a squad system, is assigned to the [[New Mutants]] squad led by [[Danielle Moonstar]]. She is forced to share a room with [[Dust (comics)|Dust]]; the two young women disagree upon the role of women and the [[Muslim]] traditions that Dust follows.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #2 (August 2004)</ref> Though initially hostile to the mutants who took her off the street - [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|David Alleyne]], [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]], [[Sofia Mantega]], and [[Wallflower (comics)|Laurie Collins]] - she soon comes to accept them as her friends.<ref>''New Mutants'', vol. 2 #12 (June 2004)</ref><ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #1 (July 2004)</ref>\n\nDavid asks [[Emma Frost]] to remove a mental block in his mind inhibiting him from recalling all the information and skills he has acquired. David sees a possible future in which he becomes the world's foremost genius, marries Noriko, and leads to her death. Disturbed, David begins to avoid her. Annoyed at such treatment, Nori ultimately confronts David, which leads to the two becoming an active couple.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #10-11</ref>\n\nNoriko retains her powers after the events of [[House of M]].  With [[New X-Men|only 27 students retaining their powers]], Emma Frost orders the depowered students and staff, including Nori's advisor [[Danielle Moonstar]], to leave the Institute. As it departs, one bus of depowered students is bombed by anti-mutant zealot Reverend [[William Stryker]], killing all on board. Though depowered, David is not killed, and he and Nori further their romantic relationship.<ref>''New X-Men'' #22</ref> Most of the remaining students are organized into a melee fight to determine who would become a member of Emma Frost's [[New X-Men#X-Men trainees|X-Men-in-training]]. Nori is chosen by Frost to be the team's leader. Soon afterwards, Nori receives new, lighter, and more effective gauntlets from [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\nCaught in an argument over the rescue of [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Cessily]], Surge and [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] are the only students that are not teleported to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] uses her powers to get a message to the two, informing them that the Institute students had been taken into Limbo by [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]], and that Belasco killed David. Coordinating with O*N*E*, Surge and Hellion discover that [[Amanda Sefton]] has been expelled from Limbo and is in a coma in Germany. Surge becomes impulsive and angry at David's death, threatening the O*N*E* troopers when they attempt to block her from seeing Sefton, using her electrical powers to revive the sorceress despite the risks.<ref>''New X-Men'' #40</ref> At the behest of Lexington, Megaton's pilot, Surge and Hellion stop fighting demons and head for the castle. Surge leads the united Xavier Institute students against the demonic hordes, engaging the twisted sorcerer in single combat before Belasco is killed by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] and Darkchild. The Institute is returned to Earth, at Santo's insistence.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nAfter their return from Limbo, Surge finds out from [[X-23]] the torture David went through in Limbo.
