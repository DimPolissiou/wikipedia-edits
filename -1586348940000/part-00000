He is the husband of [[Kath Day-Knight]] and is a passionate [[Butcher| \"purveyor of fine meats\"]]. He is portrayed by the comic actor [[Glenn Robbins]].\n\n[[John Michael Higgins]] portrayed his equivalent (Philip \"Phil\" Lesley Knight) in the [[Kath & Kim (U.S. TV series)|U.S. version of ''Kath & Kim'']],<ref>[http://epguides.com/KathandKim_US/ http][http://epguides.com/KathandKim_US/ ://epguides.com/KathandKim_US/]</ref> and his portrayal was highly criticized.\n\n==Personality==\nCal comes across as an honest, respectable, reliable man who finds out he has many talents throughout the episodes. \n\n===Physical appearance and personal outlook===\nCal takes pride in maintaining himself, although not to Kath's extent. He has greased-down hair and wears pants which are too high for his body, often showing his socks. He exercises often, enjoying power walks and using the home gym.\n\n===Hobbies===\nCal\u2019s main hobby is probably his job. He takes great pride in his butcher shop at [[Fountain Gate Shopping Centre]] and also loves to cook. Together with Kath, Cal loves to exercise and do aerobics. He is a [[Sydney Swans]] supporter, much to the annoyance of Kath who supports [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond Tigers]]. He is somewhat sexually ambiguous and is seen as a [[metrosexual]]. During series four he wins Fountion gate retailer of the year and starts coming home early from work and putting up posters around his workshop to show he won, which proves that Cal is extremely passionate about butchering. Cal also didn't show up to work one time after beating up [[List of Kath & Kim characters|Eric Bana]]; this is the only time Cal has been seen slacking off work.\n\n===Background===\nCal is four months younger than Kath. He was very reluctant on the day of their (first invalid) marriage. Cal had previously had four of his past girlfriends/fianc\u00e9es taken away from him, feeling he was unlucky in love and became drunk on the wedding day. He has always been a gourmet butcher. It is also said in the season 1 episode 2 \"Gay\" that Cal had previously been in the Navy, where he experienced several instances of being gay with the others in the Navy. It is speculated very lightly that Cal might have possibly acted again on his slight gayness again in the episode before the wedding when Kath wonders how he managed to get the carriage for the wedding from the man who offered himself to Kath for the carriage, in which Cal replies with \"Oh, I had my ways\".\n\n===Struggles in [[Kath & Kimderella]]===\nDuring the film Cal is seen having a [[fear of flying]], after a session with former marriage councilor [[List of Kath & Kim characters|Marion]] his phobia is cured.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Kath===\n[[File:Jane Turner (Kath Day Knight) at Kath & Kimderella movie premiere.jpg|thumb|upright|Kath Day-Knight]]\nKel's relationship with Kath is very good. They have odd traditions including their work-out time, which includes awkward stretching and power walking. The relationship has had limited difficulties on various occasions where Kath's ex-husband [[List of Kath & Kim characters|Gary Poole]] showed up and revealed that the marriage (Kath & Kel) was invalid as ''he'' and Kath were, in fact, still married since the 1970s. Also, Kath being older than Kel has created worry for herself. Kel likes to take over Kath's duties sometimes (as seen in \"Inside Out\") which annoys her; as she likes to be kept busy and be in charge.\n\n===Kim===\n[[File:Gina Riley at Kath & Kimderella movie premiere.jpg|thumb|upright|Kim Craig]]\n[[Kim Craig]], Kel's step-daughter and Kath's daughter, is played by [[Gina Riley]]. From the beginning of the series, Kim had an instant dislike of Kel, due to the fact that Kath & Kim had each other all of their lives without a father/husband figure in place. Kim and Kel rarely interact, and when they do, the mood goes \"off\" and the scene is completely awkward, with one muttering a single word to the other and the other either walking away or trying to give out a grin. Kel is now the focus of Kath's attention which annoys Kim who likes to always be the centre of attention. Kel often tries to express his opinion of Kim to Kath, who does not always agree with what is said.\n\n===Sharon===\n[[File:Sharon Strzelecki (7879439094).jpg|thumb|upright|Sharon Strzelecki]]\n[[Sharon Strzelecki]], played by Magda Szubanski shows respect towards Kel throughout the entire series. She is first introduced to Kel when Kath introduces the two. They don't usually talk.  A mutual respect seems to exist between these characters however, with Kel having referred to Sharon as a \"good stick\".\n\n===Brett===\nBrett, Kel's step son-in-law and Kel's best man at the wedding, is played by [[Peter Rowsthorn (actor)|Peter Rowsthorn]]. Brett is usually the one who gets informed about [[Kath Day-Knight|Kath]] and Kel's sexual activities.\n\n===Romantic life===\nBefore Kel met Kath, he had a bad history with women. Every person he came close to marrying was always snatched away from him by longtime friend [[List of Kath & Kim characters|Sandy Freckle]],\nwhich raised doubt to his mind before his marriage to Kath.\n\n==Information==\n[[File:Kath Day-Knight, Kel Knight (7879431796).jpg|thumb|upright|Kath and Cal kissing]]\n[[File:Kel Knight (7879434866).jpg|thumb|upright|Cal\u2019s hair]]\n[[File:Kel Knight, Kath Day-Knight (7879430390).jpg|thumb|Cal massaging Kath]]\n\n===Short story lines===\nThroughout the series, Cal\u2019s storylines include taking over as the lady of the house which annoys Kath, the lead up to his marriage to Kath, entering a midlife crisis and having 'mock angina' leading to a 99% fat free obsession. In \"Da Kath & Kim Code\", Cal develops a strong dislike of [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]], as Kath has a crush on him and Cal does not approve. Cal is a Sydney Swans supporter in the [[Australian Football League]], something Kath was not aware of until they were married.\n\n===Quirks, personality traits and features===\nCal wears a combover hairstyle kept in place with [[Brylcreem]] and is never without one of his manbags. Cal is often seen wearing a pair of shorts, way above the kneeline, when he is powerwalking. One of Cal\u2019s many interests is books and he seems to have a soft spot for the South African author [[Bryce Courtenay]]. This is evident in many episodes. For example, in episode 3, failing to make communication with the other butchers at a butchers' convention, he pulls out the book ''[[The Power of One (novel)|The Power of One]]''. In episode 4, he mentions the author twice: Kath is reading the ''Anti Candida'' diet book, and Cal mentions Bryce Courtenay, although Courtenay did not actually write the book (far from his genre). Later on, Cal complains of Kath participating in the musical ''The Hours''. Kath recommends he joins the play, which he does, due to them having busy schedules, looking for some time to spend together. Kath explains to Cal that it was a book/movie adaptation to which Cal responds, \"That was that Bryce Courtenay book, wasn't it?\". However, Bryce did not write this book either. In series 4, when Kath, Kim, Cal and Brett were playing [[Trivial Pursuit]], Kath asked Cal who wrote ''[[Captain Underpants]]'' and he replied Bryce Courtenay.\n\n===Kel's greased down hair, vinyl coat and pleather man bags===\nKel he has greased down hair in every episode, held in place with [[Brylcreem]].\n\nKel is seen wearing a [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] coat: during the TV series he is seen wearing coats purchased from Mens Land, which is mentioned by Kel in the \"[[Da Kath & Kim Code]]\".\n\nKel is seen with a man bag made out of [[pleather]] during the TV series. When Kath and Kel are going on their honeymoon, Kel asks if his man bags can fit in Kath's bag; however, Kath tells Kel he needs only one, which proves that Kel is extremely metrosexual and has an intensive fondness for [[Handbag|man bags]].\n\n===Smart car===\n[[File:Kath and Kimderella red carpet (7879457992).jpg|thumb|Kel's car at the Kath & Kimderella film premiere]]\n\nKel is known for driving a smart car around in the series\n\n==See also==\n\n===Other characters===\n*[[Kim Craig]]\n*[[Kath Day-Knight]]\n*[[Sharon Strzelecki]]\n*[[Brett Craig]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kath and Kim}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Knight, Kel}}\n[[Category:Kath & Kim characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional butchers]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Fictional Royal Australian Navy personnel]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| colour = Lavender \n| series = Kath & Kim\n| name = Calvin Graham Knight\n| image =File:Kel Knight (7879440288).jpg \n| caption =[[Glenn Robbins]] as Cal Knight at the ''[[Kath & Kimderella]]'' film premiere.

It was in 1890 that the colors buff and blue officially became Punahou's school colors depicting the hues of the sand and the sea. Back in 1890, long before the development of high-rises and hotels in Waikiki, all that was visible in the distance from the top of Punahou's campus was the buff-colored sand and blue-colored sea of Waikiki Beach which is probably why the colors buff and blue were chosen.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hawaii|Schools}}\n* [[List of Punahou School alumni]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* A.

It was in 1890 that the colors buff and blue officially became Punahou's school colors depicting the hues of the sand and the sea. Back in 1890, long before the development of high-rises and hotels in Waikiki, all that was visible in the distance from the top of Punahou's campus was the buff-colored sand and blue-colored sea of Waikiki Beach which is probably why the colors buff and blue were chosen.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hawaii|Schools}}\n* [[List of Punahou School alumni]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* A.

Playing a vital role in ceremonial parades and ceremonies, the SAF Band provides musical support for parades such as the National Day Parade, SAF Day Parade, Passing Out Parades, Change of Command Parades and other military duties. Other than discharging ceremonial duties, the SAF Band also presents public concerts that aim to bring a wide range of music to the populace. They also seek to build up the band's music repertoire into an extensive array of styles and variety.\n\nThrough the years, the SAF Band have worked with several distinguished conductors and soloists including Frank Renton, Steven Mead, John Sharpley, [[Evelyn Glennie]], [[Jan Van der Roost]], Toshio Akiyama, Yasuhide Ito, [[Eric Whitacre]] and Hardy Mertens. More recently, the band was conducted by [[Philip Sparke]], [[Frank Ticheli]], [[James Barnes (composer)|James Barnes]], Roger Swift, Douglas Bostock, Prof Allen McMurray and Prof. James F Keene of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]].\n\nThe SAF Band has recently represented Singapore at international music festivals.

The formation of the Singapore Military Forces Staff Band on 1 June 1958 spelled the beginning of the nation's love affair with military bands. From this core group of 45 musicians would come five generations of military musicians from the country\u2019s armed services.\n\nWO1 Frederick Roy, the 15th/19th Hussars bandmaster became the first Director of Music of the SMFSB, a duty he did until 1962. The band's main duty then was as musical support to the [[Singapore Infantry Regiment]]'s activities. One of his young musicians, SSGT Abdullah Ahmad, was sent to the Royal Military School of Music for further training, later becoming a warrant officer upon graduating. The band's first composition, the ''Singapore Infantry Regiment March'', later became the Singapore Army's official march.\n\nLt. Edward Crowcroft of the York and Northumberland Brigade Band succeeded WO1 Roy in September 1962 as Bandmaster and Director of Music. By November, it became the Singapore Infantry Regiment Band, and WO1 Arthur Edward Hollowell, DOM of the Band of the Parachute Brigade, replaced Lt. Crowcroft. He became a captain by commission and led the band to its first overseas visit in 1964: the band's visit to Kuala Lumpur as part of the [[Merdeka Parade]] on 31 August that year.\n\nA year after, WO1 Ahmad was appointed the Singapore Armed Forces Director of Music, becoming a lieutenant, and later as captain. He led the new SIR Band to the very first [[Singapore National Day Parade|National Day Parade]] on the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] the following year. By 1968, the band made its first recording under his direction.\n\nTwo years after, the Band of the Singapore Armed Forces was formed, with joint headquarters with the SIR Band at HQ 1 Singapore Infantry Btn., Beach Road Camp. They both later moved to HQ 3 SIB at Ulu Pandan Camp and later at 5 SIB at Portsdown Camp, and by 1972, the latter band was led by a Republic of Singapore Police officer, WO1 Ervin Dragon.\n\nBy January the next year, a new band, the NSF (National Service-Full-time) Band, was formed at Telok Pagu Camp at Changi. WO2 Alan Teo became its first conductor.\n\nMay saw the first name change for the bands. They were renamed as\n\n# 3 Singapore Infantry Btn. Band, also known as the SIR Band\n# 4 Singapore Infantry Btn. Band, also known as the Band of the Singapore Armoured Regiment\n# 2 Singapore Infantry Btn. Band\n\nAlan Teo, by then a captain, left the DOM post at 2 SIB band by July that year, to join the then newly created SAF Music and Drama Company. Tonni Wei, then a sergeant and playing with one of the bands, was then studying at the Royal Military School of Music, graduating in October 1976 to become the bandmaster of 2 SIB Band, was commissioned as a second lieutenant (2LT)\n\nIn 1975, the 3 SIB Band soon moved to Jurong Camp, the 3rd Division headquarters.\n\nIn January 1977, Tonni Wei joined the MDC and Alan Teo returned to his old post. By February, 3 SIB Band became the SIR Band yet again, and Teo joined the now renamed Band of the Republic of Singapore Navy-the former 2 SIB Band-to Sembawang Camp and the RSN School of Naval Training. The SIR Band would later relocate itself at Jurong Camp that May. Peter Yan, then a musician sergeant with the army, and a part of the SIR Band, was then studying at Uxbridge at the RAF School of Music for Director of Music training. He graduated the next year and soon joined the RSN Band as its director.\n\nCPT Ahmad retired from his post in May 1979.\n\nIn 1981, SGT Terry Seah Cheong Lock, who started his military music career earlier in 1975 with the Singapore Armoured Regiment Band, returned to Singapore from the UK after graduating from the Royal Air Force School of Music in England. He was commissioned as an officer upon his return, as well as being appointed the new Director of Music of SIR Band. CPT Terry Seah Cheong Lock led the band for 13 years, up to 1994.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed the public image of the bands was positive indeed, reinforced with increased participation of the service bands in the NDP and major military events such as the Open Houses as well as their concerts. By 1982, the SAR Band (4SIB Band) was soon relaunched as the Republic of Singapore Air Force Band, and would later move to Tengah Air Base. The SIR Band was also relaunched as the Singapore Army Band, but the band's new name and image never caught on. In 1986 the RSN Band welcomed its first lady musician. Their first appearance together in the NDP was in 1987's edition in the Padang conducted by the SAF's first Senior Director of Music MAJ Erwin Dragon, with another joint performance in 1990. 1988 saw the rebirth of the SAF Music Board and the formation of the SAF Symphonic Wind Band.\n\nThe SAF Band was formed in 1994 from men and women of the [[Singapore Infantry Regiment]] Band, [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] Band and [[Republic of Singapore Navy]] Band. The formation of SAF Band come in a restructuring of the bands within the [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]] for more effective distribution of manpower. From 1994, the different bands within the SAF Band operated at different camps and locations. The SAF Central Band and SAF Band HQ(RSNB) were by the time of the merger in Tanglin Camp, Parade Band B (RSAFB) in Tengah Airbase and Parade Band A (SIRB) in Pasir Laba Camp, as they formerly represented the three branches of the SAF before their 1994 merger which resulted to these bands playing for the SAF at various events, including their participation in the National Day Parade as regular participants and arrival honours ceremonies at the Istana. These sections combined in November 2003 after the completion of renovations work to the 'White House', the former British Colonial Officer's Mess in Nee Soon Camp.\n\nIn 2009, the Parade Bands were renamed as Ceremonial Bands to reflect their duties more accurately.\n\n== Logo ==\nThe logo of SAF Band is a combination of the three services within the armed forces. Light blue signifies the air division, red signifies the land division and deep blue signifies the sea division. They are all united within the lyre, which is a universal symbol of military musicians. The logo is topped with the [[Coat of arms of Singapore|National Coat of Arms]] which was launched on 3 December 1959 together with the [[Flag of Singapore|National Flag]] and [[Majulah Singapura|National Anthem]] at the installation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara at the City Hall steps and adopted by government agencies nationwide. Below the logo is a banner inscribed with the Band's motto, \"In Harmony\". The logo was designed by retired Senior Director of Music MAJ Tonni Wei and Military Expert (ME) 3 (then SSG) Goh Poh Wah.\n\n== Structure of SAF Band ==\nThe unit is made up the SAF Band HQ, SAF Band Training Wing and three operational bands: SAF Central Band, SAF Ceremonial Band A, and SAF Ceremonial Band B.\n\n=== SAF Band HQ ===\nThe HQ is the main support wing of the SAF Band.

Formerly known as 2 SIB Band and later the Republic of Singapore Navy Band before the 1994 merger, the SAF Central Band performs as a concert band, a marching band as well as a ceremonial band. It is further able to perform in a variety of smaller configurations, of which include a brass quintet, a combo & stage band, ceremonial fanfare trumpeters and a wind quintet. The SAF Central Band is most often seen in the public at major parades such as the National Day Parade. On a regular basis, the Central Band stages at least four public concerts a year, as part of its \u201cIn Harmony\u201d and \u201cChamber Repertory\u201d series.\n* Director of Music: ME5 Tan Aik Kee Ken Steven\n* Band Major: ME3 Goh Poh Wah\n* Concertmaster & Woodwind Group Leader: ME2 Ang Yi Xiang\n* Brass Group Leader: ME2 Ronnie Quek Boon Kiang\n* Percussion Group Leader: ME2 Hazizi Jaafar\n* Drum Major: ME1 Jash Chua\n\n=== SAF Ceremonial Band ===\nFully made up of Full-time National Servicemen (NSF), the two ceremonial bands co-share official military duties and parades.

They both later moved to HQ 3 SIB at Ulu Pandan Camp and later at 5 SIB at Portsdown Camp, and by 1972, the latter band was led by a Republic of Singapore Police officer, WO1 Ervin Dragon.\n\nBy January the next year, a new band, the NSF (National Service-Full-time) Band, was formed at Telok Pagu Camp at Changi. WO2 Alan Teo became its first conductor.\n\nMay saw the first name change for the bands. They were renamed as\n\n# 3 Singapore Infantry Btn. Band, also known as the SIR Band\n# 4 Singapore Infantry Btn. Band, also known as the Band of the Singapore Armoured Regiment\n# 2 Singapore Infantry Btn. Band\n\nAlan Teo, by then a captain, left the DOM post at 2 SIB band by July that year, to join the then newly created SAF Music and Drama Company. Tonni Wei, then a sergeant and playing with one of the bands, was then studying at the Royal Military School of Music, graduating in October 1976 to become the bandmaster of 2 SIB Band, was commissioned as a second lieutenant (2LT)\n\nIn 1975, the 3 SIB Band soon moved to Jurong Camp, the 3rd Division headquarters.\n\nIn January 1977, Tonni Wei joined the MDC and Alan Teo returned to his old post. By February, 3 SIB Band became the SIR Band yet again, and Teo joined the now renamed Band of the Republic of Singapore Navy-the former 2 SIB Band-to Sembawang Camp and the RSN School of Naval Training. The SIR Band would later relocate itself at Jurong Camp that May. Peter Yan, then a musician sergeant with the army, and a part of the SIR Band, was then studying at Uxbridge at the RAF School of Music for Director of Music training. He graduated the next year and soon joined the RSN Band as its director.\n\nCPT Ahmad retired from his post in May 1979.\n\nIn 1981, SGT Terry Seah Cheong Lock, who started his military music career earlier in 1975 with the Singapore Armoured Regiment Band, returned to Singapore from the UK after graduating from the Royal Air Force School of Music in England. He was commissioned as an officer upon his return, as well as being appointed the new Director of Music of SIR Band. CPT Terry Seah Cheong Lock led the band for 13 years, up to 1994.\n\nAs the 1980s progressed the public image of the bands was positive indeed, reinforced with increased participation of the service bands in the NDP and major military events such as the Open Houses as well as their concerts. By 1982, the SAR Band (4SIB Band) was soon relaunched as the Republic of Singapore Air Force Band, and would later move to Tengah Air Base. The SIR Band was also relaunched as the Singapore Army Band, but the band's new name and image never caught on. In 1986 the RSN Band welcomed its first lady musician. Their first appearance together in the NDP was in 1987's edition in the Padang conducted by the SAF's first Senior Director of Music MAJ Erwin Dragon, with another joint performance in 1990. 1988 saw the rebirth of the SAF Music Board and the formation of the SAF Symphonic Wind Band.\n\nThe SAF Band was formed in 1994 from men and women of the [[Singapore Infantry Regiment]] Band, [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] Band and [[Republic of Singapore Navy]] Band. The formation of SAF Band come in a restructuring of the bands within the [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]] for more effective distribution of manpower. From 1994, the different bands within the SAF Band operated at different camps and locations. The SAF Central Band and SAF Band HQ(RSNB) were by the time of the merger in Tanglin Camp, Parade Band B (RSAFB) in Tengah Airbase and Parade Band A (SIRB) in Pasir Laba Camp, as they formerly represented the three branches of the SAF before their 1994 merger which resulted to these bands playing for the SAF at various events, including their participation in the National Day Parade as regular participants and arrival honours ceremonies at the Istana. These sections combined in November 2003 after the completion of renovations work to the 'White House', the former British Colonial Officer's Mess in Nee Soon Camp.\n\nIn 2009, the Parade Bands were renamed as Ceremonial Bands to reflect their duties more accurately.\n\n== Logo ==\nThe logo of SAF Band is a combination of the three services within the armed forces. Light blue signifies the air division, red signifies the land division and deep blue signifies the sea division. They are all united within the lyre, which is a universal symbol of military musicians. The logo is topped with the [[Coat of arms of Singapore|National Coat of Arms]] which was launched on 3 December 1959 together with the [[Flag of Singapore|National Flag]] and [[Majulah Singapura|National Anthem]] at the installation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara at the City Hall steps and adopted by government agencies nationwide. Below the logo is a banner inscribed with the Band's motto, \"In Harmony\".
