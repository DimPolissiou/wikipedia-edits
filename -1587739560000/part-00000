It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], March 17, 1978 on Stage 33 at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears in a comic sketch; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured is a final sketch of \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" with Burnett and Lawrence as Eunice and Mama where Eunice consults a psychiatrist (played by [[Craig Richard Nelson]]) trying to figure out what went wrong with her life, as well as a final sketch of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" with Burnett and Conway as Mrs. Wiggins and Mr. Tudball in which Mr. Tudball is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\".

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], March 17, 1978 on Stage 33 at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears in a comic sketch; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured is a final sketch of \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" with Burnett and Lawrence as Eunice and Mama where Eunice consults a psychiatrist (played by [[Craig Richard Nelson]]) trying to figure out what went wrong with her life, as well as a final sketch of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" with Burnett and Conway as Mrs. Wiggins and Mr. Tudball in which Mr. Tudball is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre.
