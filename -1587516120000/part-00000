The blueberry maggot is closely related to the [[apple maggot]] (''R. pomonella''), a larger fruit fly in the same genus. It is a major pest of plant species in the [[Ericaceae]] family, such as blueberry, cranberry, and huckleberry. The larva is 5 to 8&nbsp;mm long, apodous, and white with chewing mouthparts. Female adults are 4.75mm in length, males are slightly smaller. Both adults are mostly black in color with white stripes, orange-red eyes, and a single pair of clear wings with black banding. The adult female fly lays a single egg per blueberry, and when the larva hatches it consumes the fruit, usually finishing the entire berry in under 3 weeks and rendering it unmarketable. The larva then falls to the soil and [[pupa]]tes. Adult flies emerge, mate, and females [[Oviparity|oviposit]] when blueberry plants are producing fruit. Each female fly can lay 25 to 100 eggs in their lifetime.\n\nIt is present in regions of the eastern and southern United States and eastern Canada. The spread of infestation is regulated by national and regional [[International Plant Protection Convention|plant protection organizations]]. These include the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA), the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), the [[European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization]] (EPPO), and smaller regional government organizations.\n\nBlueberry maggot infestations are predominantly controlled with the use of [[Insecticide|chemical insecticides]]. [[Degree day]] predictive models and [[Crop scouting|monitoring]] data gathered through sticky card traps are used in an [[integrated pest management]] program to make decisions on timing and frequency of control applications. Cultural measures such as removing overripe berries are often paired with chemical insecticide treatments in control programs.\n\n== Morphology ==\nEggs are white and elongate in shape.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://extension.umaine.edu/blueberries/factsheets/insects/201-monitoring-for-the-blueberry-maggot/|title=201-Monitoring for the Blueberry Maggot (Rhagoletis mendax Curran) - Cooperative Extension: Maine Wild Blueberries - University of Maine Cooperative Extension|website=Cooperative Extension: Maine Wild Blueberries|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Full-grown larvae or maggots are 7.75mm (5/16 inches) long, off white, with large preoral teeth (in front of the mouth), a cone-shaped distal sensory organ at the head, and large anal lobes and paired [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracles]] located on the blunt posterior.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rodriguez-Saona|first=Cesar|last2=Vincent|first2=Charles|last3=Polk|first3=Dean|last4=Drummond|first4=Francis A.|date=2015-03-01|title=A Review of the Blueberry Maggot Fly (Diptera: Tephritidae)|url=https://academic.oup.com/jipm/article/6/1/11/2936978|journal=Journal of Integrated Pest Management|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1093/jipm/pmv010|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/47057|title=Rhagoletis mendax (blueberry fruit fly)|website=www.cabi.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The pupa is encased in a brown outer skin known as a [[pupa]]rium.

Forests are often found in [[riparian]] areas, where they receive more summer water. [[Conifer]]ous forests also occur, especially around the Mediterranean. Pine and deciduous oak forest are widespread across California.\n*[[Woodland]]: [[California oak woodland|Oak woodlands]] are characteristic of the Mediterranean Basin and in California. [[Pine]] woodlands are also present in the Mediterranean Basin. California additionally has [[walnut]] woodlands.\n*[[Savanna]] and [[grassland]]: The [[California Central Valley grasslands]] are the largest Mediterranean grassland eco-region, although these grasslands have mostly been converted to agriculture. The remaining woodlands feature mainly oak, walnut and pine. The cork oak savanna in Portugal, known as ''[[montado]]'', is a good example of a mediterranean savanna.\n*[[Shrubland]]: Shrublands are dense thickets of evergreen sclerophyll [[shrubs]] and small trees. They are most common near the seacoast, and are often adapted to wind and salt air from the ocean. They are called [[chaparral]] (California and [[Alentejo|southern Portugal]]), ''[[matorral]]'' in Chile and southern Spain, ''[[garrigue]]'' or ''maquis'' in France, ''[[macchia]]'' or ''gariga'' in Italy, ''phrygana'' in Greece, ''tomillares'' in Spain, ''[[fynbos]]'' and ''strandveld'' in South Africa, ''[[kwongan]]'' in Southwest Australia and ''batha'' in Israel.  [[Northern coastal scrub]] and [[coastal sage scrub]], also known as soft chaparral, occur near the California coast.

Many of the plants are [[pyrophyte]]s, or fire-loving, adapted or even depending on fire for reproduction, recycling of nutrients, and the removal of dead or senescent vegetation.

Forests are often found in [[riparian]] areas, where they receive more summer water. [[Conifer]]ous forests also occur, especially around the Mediterranean. Pine and deciduous oak forest are widespread across California.\n*[[Woodland]]: [[California oak woodland|Oak woodlands]] are characteristic of the Mediterranean Basin and in California. [[Pine]] woodlands are also present in the Mediterranean Basin. California additionally has [[walnut]] woodlands.\n*[[Savanna]] and [[grassland]]: The [[California Central Valley grasslands]] are the largest Mediterranean grassland eco-region, although these grasslands have mostly been converted to agriculture. The remaining woodlands feature mainly oak, walnut and pine. The cork oak savanna in Portugal, known as ''[[montado]]'', is a good example of a mediterranean savanna.\n*[[Shrubland]]: Shrublands are dense thickets of evergreen sclerophyll [[shrubs]] and small trees. They are most common near the seacoast, and are often adapted to wind and salt air from the ocean. They are called [[chaparral]] (California and [[Alentejo|southern Portugal]]), ''[[matorral]]'' in Chile and southern Spain, ''[[garrigue]]'' or ''maquis'' in France, ''[[macchia]]'' or ''gariga'' in Italy, ''phrygana'' in Greece, ''tomillares'' in Spain, ''[[fynbos]]'' and ''strandveld'' in South Africa, ''[[kwongan]]'' in Southwest Australia and ''batha'' in Israel.  [[Northern coastal scrub]] and [[coastal sage scrub]], also known as soft chaparral, occur near the California coast. In some places shrublands are of the mature vegetation type, and in other places are the result of degradation of former forest or woodland by logging or [[overgrazing]], or disturbance by major fires.\n\n==Fire as a medium of change==\n{{Further|Fire ecology}}\n[[File:Liebre Mountains 001.jpg|thumb|Scrubland of the [[Sierra Pelona Mountains]], Southern California]] \nFire, both natural and human-caused,    has played a large role in shaping the ecology of Mediterranean [[ecoregion]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gil-Tena|first1=Assu|last2=Aquilue|first2=Nuria|last3=Duane|first3=Andrea|last4=de Caceres|first4=Miquel|last5=Brotons|first5=Lluis|title=Mediterranean fire regime effects on pine-oak forest landscape mosaics under global change in NE Spain|journal=European Journal of Forest Research|date=2016|volume=135|issue=2|pages=403\u2013416|doi=10.1007/s10342-016-0943-1}}</ref> The hot, dry summers make much of the region prone to fires, and lightning-caused fires occur with some frequency.

Technically a suburb of the much larger capital city of [[Funchal]], it is one of the larger population centres and an extension of the Funchal economy.\n\n==History==\nThe location of the modern town is believed to be the original landing point for the Portuguese discoverer [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]], who is credited with the discovery of the [[Madeira Islands]]. When the explorer disembarked in this area (1419), he observed a narrow rocky peninsula that extended into the ocean, and another nearby that formed an amphitheatre-like harbour that could shelter ships from Atlantic storms. There, Zarco and his men also found a large colony of marine animals that would become the reason for naming this area ''C\u00e2mara de Lobos''.\n[[File:2012 C\u00e2mara de Lobos.jpg|left|thumb|235px|Port with dry fish]]\nThe name ''lobos'' is a Portuguese derivation for \"seals\" ({{lang-pt|lobos-marinhos}}), which were the animals discovered by Zarco and his men in the sheltered bay. Because of the large colony of these animals, the area was christened ''c\u00e2mara dos lobos''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cm-camaradelobos.pt/Lobo_Marinho-1073.aspx|title=Lobo Marinho|author=C\u00e2mara Municipal|publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal da C\u00e2mara de Lobos|location=C\u00e2mara de Lobos|language=Portuguese|year=2011|accessdate=2011-02-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223092522/http://www.cm-camaradelobos.pt/Lobo_Marinho-1073.aspx|archivedate=2011-02-23|df=}}</ref> This was a pejorative term, since ''c\u00e2mara'' is the Portuguese word for \"municipal chamber\" (sometimes erroneously referred to as the \"town hall\" or \"town council\"), and the sailors literally named the area the \"Municipal chamber of [the place where there are] sea-wolves\". Today, the species of [[Mediterranean monk seal|monk seals]] are rare, being an animal common to the Mediterranean, but today confined to a small colony on the [[Desertas Islands]].<ref>Although known as a sea-lion by the early sailors because of the noise it made, the monk seal is characterised by a wrinkle on its neck that looks like the hood of a monk, as well as its solitary habits.</ref>\n\nThe municipality was created by ministerial decree on 25 May 1835, and invested its executive on 4 October 1835. Initially, this administrative division included the parishes of C\u00e2mara de Lobos, [[Curral das Freiras]], [[Estreito de C\u00e2mara de Lobos]] and [[Campan\u00e1rio (Ribeira Brava)|Campan\u00e1rio]], all districts of Funchal. With many alterations, the newly constituted municipality of C\u00e2mara de Lobos operated with those parishes as its core, until  [[Quinta Grande]] was constituted from sites in the parishes of Campan\u00e1rio and C\u00e2mara de Lobos, but maintaining its total area. On 6 May 1914, Campan\u00e1rio is deannexed to the newly created municipality of  Ribeira Brava, and on 5 July 1996, the parish of [[Jardim da Serra]] was constituted from the higher localities of Estreito de C\u00e2mara de Lobos.\n\nOn 15 September 1994, the parish of Estreito de C\u00e2mara de Lobos was elevated to the status of town, while two years later, on 3 August 1996, the village of C\u00e2mara de Lobos attained the status of town.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aerial view from S\u00e3o Martinho towards Cabo Gir\u00e3o - Madeira 2009.jpg|left|thumb|235px|Aerial view of the built-up areas of C\u00e2mara de Lobos along the coast, with the steep cliffs of [[Cabo Gir\u00e3o]] in the distance]]\n[[File:Camara de Lobos 1.JPG|235px|left|thumb|The main settlement of C\u00e2mara de Lobos, and first area settled by colonists to this area]]\nC\u00e2mara de Lobos is the second largest settlement by population in [[Madeira]] with the largest (45%) contribution of youth under 25 years.

On the west, follow Pico do Jorge along a line in the altitudes specified by the Pico Arranha-Mata, Pico do Cerco, Pico Grande, Pico do Serradinho, Boca do Pa\u00e7o de Aires, Boca dos Corgos, Alto dos Aviceiros, Lombo do Cov\u00e3o, or Estrebaria, Pico do Trevo, Eira das Mo\u00e7as and Pico da Cruz, where they follow the road of Achada in Campan\u00e1rio until Vera Cruz, continuing through the escarpment of Partilha until an escarpment overlooing the sea, conforming to demarkations signed by cadastral services. To the south, the municipality is limited by the foremetioned escarpment until the mouth of the Ribeira da Quinta Grande and then by the coast line until the ravine in Socorridos, but not including the Faj\u00e3 dos Padres. The east corresponds to the western limit of the municipality of Funchal, or specifically the line that exits Pico do Serrado and follows Lombo da Partilha until the confluence of the ravine of Eiroses and Socorridos, which serves as the municipalities limit until the ocean.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concelhodecamaradelobos.com/|title=\u00c1rea e limites geogr\u00e1ficos do concelho de C\u00e2mara de Lobos|trans-title=Area and Geographic Limits of the Municipality of C\u00e2mara de Lobos|first=Manuel Pedro da|last=Silva Freitas|publisher=C\u00e2mara de Lobos Dicion\u00e1rio Corogr\u00e1fico|location=C\u00e2mara de Lobos (Madeira), Portugal|language=Portuguese|year=2011|accessdate=2011-02-25}}</ref>\n\n===Human geography===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of<br>C\u00e2mara de Lobos<br><small>(1849 - 2011)</small>\n| 1849 | 12391\n| 1900 | 17468\n| 1930 | 21806\n| 1960 | 29759\n| 1981 | 31035\n| 1991 | 31476\n| 2001 | 34614\n| 2011 | 35666\n}}\n}}\n|}\nThe municipality of C\u00e2mara de Lobos, in accord with the 2001 census, has a population of 30,814, while its resident population is 31,476 inhabitants (47% to 53%, male to female composition).

Technically a suburb of the much larger capital city of [[Funchal]], it is one of the larger population centres and an extension of the Funchal economy.\n\n==History==\nThe location of the modern town is believed to be the original landing point for the Portuguese discoverer [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]], who is credited with the discovery of the [[Madeira Islands]]. When the explorer disembarked in this area (1419), he observed a narrow rocky peninsula that extended into the ocean, and another nearby that formed an amphitheatre-like harbour that could shelter ships from Atlantic storms. There, Zarco and his men also found a large colony of marine animals that would become the reason for naming this area ''C\u00e2mara de Lobos''.\n[[File:2012 C\u00e2mara de Lobos.jpg|left|thumb|235px|Port with dry fish]]\nThe name ''lobos'' is a Portuguese derivation for \"seals\" ({{lang-pt|lobos-marinhos}}), which were the animals discovered by Zarco and his men in the sheltered bay. Because of the large colony of these animals, the area was christened ''c\u00e2mara dos lobos''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cm-camaradelobos.pt/Lobo_Marinho-1073.aspx|title=Lobo Marinho|author=C\u00e2mara Municipal|publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal da C\u00e2mara de Lobos|location=C\u00e2mara de Lobos|language=Portuguese|year=2011|accessdate=2011-02-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223092522/http://www.cm-camaradelobos.pt/Lobo_Marinho-1073.aspx|archivedate=2011-02-23|df=}}</ref> This was a pejorative term, since ''c\u00e2mara'' is the Portuguese word for \"municipal chamber\" (sometimes erroneously referred to as the \"town hall\" or \"town council\"), and the sailors literally named the area the \"Municipal chamber of [the place where there are] sea-wolves\". Today, the species of [[Mediterranean monk seal|monk seals]] are rare, being an animal common to the Mediterranean, but today confined to a small colony on the [[Desertas Islands]].<ref>Although known as a sea-lion by the early sailors because of the noise it made, the monk seal is characterised by a wrinkle on its neck that looks like the hood of a monk, as well as its solitary habits.</ref>\n\nThe municipality was created by ministerial decree on 25 May 1835, and invested its executive on 4 October 1835. Initially, this administrative division included the parishes of C\u00e2mara de Lobos, [[Curral das Freiras]], [[Estreito de C\u00e2mara de Lobos]] and [[Campan\u00e1rio (Ribeira Brava)|Campan\u00e1rio]], all districts of Funchal. With many alterations, the newly constituted municipality of C\u00e2mara de Lobos operated with those parishes as its core, until  [[Quinta Grande]] was constituted from sites in the parishes of Campan\u00e1rio and C\u00e2mara de Lobos, but maintaining its total area. On 6 May 1914, Campan\u00e1rio is deannexed to the newly created municipality of  Ribeira Brava, and on 5 July 1996, the parish of [[Jardim da Serra]] was constituted from the higher localities of Estreito de C\u00e2mara de Lobos.\n\nOn 15 September 1994, the parish of Estreito de C\u00e2mara de Lobos was elevated to the status of town, while two years later, on 3 August 1996, the village of C\u00e2mara de Lobos attained the status of town.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aerial view from S\u00e3o Martinho towards Cabo Gir\u00e3o - Madeira 2009.jpg|left|thumb|235px|Aerial view of the built-up areas of C\u00e2mara de Lobos along the coast, with the steep cliffs of [[Cabo Gir\u00e3o]] in the distance]]\n[[File:Camara de Lobos 1.JPG|235px|left|thumb|The main settlement of C\u00e2mara de Lobos, and first area settled by colonists to this area]]\nC\u00e2mara de Lobos is the second largest settlement by population in [[Madeira]] with the largest (45%) contribution of youth under 25 years.

Skyline is a part of the [[Dallas Independent School District]] (DISD) and  serves grades 9 through 12. \n\nIn 2015, the school was rated \"[[Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system|Met Standard]]\" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport//account/2015/srch.html?srch=C|title = 2015 Accountability Rating System|publisher = Texas Education Agency}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-1960s, B. J. Stamps, Bragg Stockton, and other Dallas educators conceived the idea of a very large high school for the Dallas Independent School District that would offer career education in addition to a traditional high-school curriculum. Stamps emphasized continually that the facility he envisioned was \"absolutely not going to be a [[vocational school]] for unsuccessful students\" but rather a place where superior students could undertake studies in preparation for a variety of [[profession]]s. In December 1966, architectural plans for the school, whose working name was \"Science-Technical Center,\" were approved by the Dallas [[Board of education|School Board]]. By 1969, Stamps, who had been slated as the school's first principal, suggested the name \"Skyline High School,\" inspired by the view of the [[Downtown Dallas]] [[skyline]] afforded from the school's upper floors, and in February 1970 the Skyline name was approved by the School Board.<ref>\"Plans OK'd For Big New Dallas School\" by Carolyn Barta.

February 26, 1970. Page 5. Available from [[NewsBank]], accessible from the [[Houston Public Library]] [http://hpl.lib.tx.us/newspapers with a library card]</ref>\n\nClasses at Skyline began in the fall semester of 1970. Until the main facility at 7777 Forney Road opened early in 1971, instruction was held at other southeast Dallas sites. From its inception, Skyline has fulfilled Stamps's original conception of offering both a regular high-school curriculum and a multitude of [[magnet school]] programs. The magnet offerings are organized as ''clusters'', which are collectively called the Career Development Center. A student attending Skyline may generally choose between two options: pursuing a normal, traditional curriculum (Skyline's original attendance zone was drawn to relieve overcrowding at [[W. W. Samuell High School|Samuell]] and [[Bryan Adams High School|Bryan Adams]] high schools); or attending both a cluster and regular classes at Skyline.\n\nIn the early years of Skyline's existence, administrators and faculty of existing, traditional high schools in the Dallas Independent School District frequently expressed resentment of Skyline's desire to recruit their talented and gifted students and in some instances actively resisted recruitment efforts. District officials appointed a task force to address these concerns.<ref>\"Resentment Reported: Magnet Recruiting Rift Probed.\" ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'', 15 March 1977.</ref> Nevertheless, with the continued existence of Skyline's magnet programs and the subsequent \"spinning off\" of several independent magnet schools, the issue has persisted to the present day, and district officials continue efforts to allay feelings of resentment.<ref>\"Magnet map attracts blog views.\" ''The Dallas Morning News'', 16 January 2008.</ref>\n\nOver time, numerous clusters have left Skyline and moved into facilities of their own, becoming full-fledged DISD magnet high schools. For example, the Performing Arts Cluster and the Health Careers Cluster both discontinued their affiliations with Skyline in 1976 and became, respectively, the (presently-named) [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]] and the High School for the Health Professions (now the [[School of Health Professions]] at [[Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Center]]). In 2007, district officials announced a plan to relieve overcrowding at Skyline by moving several Skyline magnet programs to [[Emmett J. Conrad High School]], meanwhile hoping to increase the latter's achievement levels. These actions have in some instances occasioned resentment by Skyline's own faculty and educational community, who have worried that Skyline's Career Development Center was created only to ultimately self-destruct, and, in the most recent events, that successful students educated at Skyline are being used to artificially boost another school's academic standing. District officials continue in their efforts to respond to these controversies.<ref>\"Magnets Attract Skyline Success\" by Eric Miller.

Skyline is a part of the [[Dallas Independent School District]] (DISD) and  serves grades 9 through 12. \n\nIn 2015, the school was rated \"[[Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system|Met Standard]]\" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport//account/2015/srch.html?srch=C|title = 2015 Accountability Rating System|publisher = Texas Education Agency}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-1960s, B. J. Stamps, Bragg Stockton, and other Dallas educators conceived the idea of a very large high school for the Dallas Independent School District that would offer career education in addition to a traditional high-school curriculum. Stamps emphasized continually that the facility he envisioned was \"absolutely not going to be a [[vocational school]] for unsuccessful students\" but rather a place where superior students could undertake studies in preparation for a variety of [[profession]]s. In December 1966, architectural plans for the school, whose working name was \"Science-Technical Center,\" were approved by the Dallas [[Board of education|School Board]]. By 1969, Stamps, who had been slated as the school's first principal, suggested the name \"Skyline High School,\" inspired by the view of the [[Downtown Dallas]] [[skyline]] afforded from the school's upper floors, and in February 1970 the Skyline name was approved by the School Board.<ref>\"Plans OK'd For Big New Dallas School\" by Carolyn Barta. ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. December 15, 1966. Page 1. Available from [[NewsBank]], accessible from the [[Houston Public Library]] [http://hpl.lib.tx.us/newspapers with a library card]</ref><ref>\"Science Technical Center: School Getting New Image\" by Judy Wiessler. ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. December 15, 1969. Available from [[NewsBank]], accessible from the [[Houston Public Library]] [http://hpl.lib.tx.us/newspapers with a library card]</ref><ref>\"Students to Have Say In Naming of School.\" ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. February 26, 1970. Page 5. Available from [[NewsBank]], accessible from the [[Houston Public Library]] [http://hpl.lib.tx.us/newspapers with a library card]</ref>\n\nClasses at Skyline began in the fall semester of 1970. Until the main facility at 7777 Forney Road opened early in 1971, instruction was held at other southeast Dallas sites. From its inception, Skyline has fulfilled Stamps's original conception of offering both a regular high-school curriculum and a multitude of [[magnet school]] programs. The magnet offerings are organized as ''clusters'', which are collectively called the Career Development Center. A student attending Skyline may generally choose between two options: pursuing a normal, traditional curriculum (Skyline's original attendance zone was drawn to relieve overcrowding at [[W. W. Samuell High School|Samuell]] and [[Bryan Adams High School|Bryan Adams]] high schools); or attending both a cluster and regular classes at Skyline.\n\nIn the early years of Skyline's existence, administrators and faculty of existing, traditional high schools in the Dallas Independent School District frequently expressed resentment of Skyline's desire to recruit their talented and gifted students and in some instances actively resisted recruitment efforts. District officials appointed a task force to address these concerns.<ref>\"Resentment Reported: Magnet Recruiting Rift Probed.\" ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'', 15 March 1977.</ref> Nevertheless, with the continued existence of Skyline's magnet programs and the subsequent \"spinning off\" of several independent magnet schools, the issue has persisted to the present day, and district officials continue efforts to allay feelings of resentment.<ref>\"Magnet map attracts blog views.\" ''The Dallas Morning News'', 16 January 2008.</ref>\n\nOver time, numerous clusters have left Skyline and moved into facilities of their own, becoming full-fledged DISD magnet high schools. For example, the Performing Arts Cluster and the Health Careers Cluster both discontinued their affiliations with Skyline in 1976 and became, respectively, the (presently-named) [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]] and the High School for the Health Professions (now the [[School of Health Professions]] at [[Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Center]]). In 2007, district officials announced a plan to relieve overcrowding at Skyline by moving several Skyline magnet programs to [[Emmett J. Conrad High School]], meanwhile hoping to increase the latter's achievement levels. These actions have in some instances occasioned resentment by Skyline's own faculty and educational community, who have worried that Skyline's Career Development Center was created only to ultimately self-destruct, and, in the most recent events, that successful students educated at Skyline are being used to artificially boost another school's academic standing. District officials continue in their efforts to respond to these controversies.<ref>\"Magnets Attract Skyline Success\" by Eric Miller.

Basaltic shield volcanoes typically feature two main rift zones, situated with angles of 120\u00b0 between in ideal situations.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> On shield volcanoes forming from level seafloor without neighboring vents, flank rifting occurs more evenly distributed around the vent.<ref name=\":0\" />  However, where the flanks of a volcano may be supported on one side by the presence of a pre-existing feature, or burdened with various planes of weakness, rift zone formation promulgates according to down-slope pull of gravity.\n\n==Structure==\nThe infill of magmas in the form of dykes helps to define the shape of a volcano.  A higher frequency of intrusive events along rift zones leads to elongated topographies of the affected edifices.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mathematical models show how the presence of rift zones contributes to a central horizontal bulge or ridge parallel to the orientation of the rifts.<ref name=\":2\" />  This same modelling shows how this central bulge is dependent on the ration between rift zone length and depth of the magma sources, with longer fissures over shallower sources being more positively associated with very elongated topographies of the associated flanks.<ref name=\":2\" /> \nOccasionally, fissure eruptions associated with rift zones can actually evolve into new vents along the volcanic edifice, generating lava flows lasting for months or longer.<ref name=\":0\" /> These lava flows add surface materials to the slopes of the volcano, extending the slopes outward in a general flattening of the morphology of the flank.<ref name=\":4\" />  The extensional character of these events can contribute to flank instability and [[mass wasting]] events where whole sections of the volcanic edifice can collapse along rift zone boundaries.<ref name=\":3\" />  These mass wasting events can affect the dyke formations and orientations as the mass of the edifice shifts, which can have profound impacts on the structural development of the edifice,<ref name=\":3\" /> while also potentially creating many [[volcanic hazards]], such as tsunamis and dramatic shifts in directions of lava flows, to unsuspecting communities.   \n \nVolcanologist [[George P.L. Walker]] stated that rift zones were common in most volcanoes around the world, regardless of their type and formation.<ref name=\":1\" />  Walker put forward the idea that, absent any obvious signs of rifting on the surface, the presence of other volcanic features that are also associated with dyke intrusions (such as elongated cinder cones and linearly-aligned fissure vents) should also be taken to represent the presence of a rift zone-like processes in the given region.<ref name=\":1\" />  Therefore, rift zones of various lengths and widths can be tentatively identified on many [[stratovolcano]]es and [[Monogenetic volcanic field|monogenetic lava field]]s in addition to classic Hawaiian [[shield volcano]]es.\n\n==Examples==\n* [[Hawaii]]: Most Hawaiian volcanoes have two or sometimes three rift zones.\n** [[M\u0101hukona]]\n** [[Mauna Loa]]\n** [[Hualalai]]\n** [[Kilauea]]\n* [[Galapagos Islands]]\n* [[Canary Islands]]\n** [[La Palma#Volcano|La Palma]]\n** [[El Hierro]]\n* [[Newberry Volcano]], Oregon\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fracture (geology)]]\n*[[Lateral eruption]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/rift-zones Rift Zones | Volcano World | Oregon State University]\n\n[[Category:Volcanology]]\n[[Category:Volcanism of Hawaii]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|rift|rift valley}}\n{{short description|Part of a volcano where a set of linear cracks form}}\n[[Image:East rift zone kilauea.jpg|thumb|300px|East Rift Zone on [[K\u012blauea]], Hawai{{okina}}i]]\nA '''rift zone''' is a feature of some [[volcano]]es, especially [[shield volcano]]es, in which a set of linear cracks (or [[rift]]s) develops in a volcanic edifice, typically forming into two or three well-defined regions along the flanks of the vent.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Volcanoes : global perspectives|last=W.|first=Hazlett, Richard|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781405162500|oclc=892899076|date = 2010-05-17}}</ref>  Believed to be primarily caused by internal and gravitational stresses generated by [[magma]] emplacement within and across various regions of the volcano, rift zones allow the intrusion of magmatic [[dike (geology)|dykes]] into the slopes of the volcano itself.

The  internal extensional forces and [[Isostasy|isostatic loading]] generated by intruding magma volumes (either associated with the magma chamber or subsequent dyke and [[Sill (geology)|sill]] formation extending outward from that chamber), in conjunction with accumulation of erupted materials, contribute to the mass and slope of the forming edifice.  It is the weight of the edifice exceeding its material strength, with the additional stresses of the magma inflating the internal regions of the edifice, that can generate the initial cracking around a developing volcanic summit.<ref name=\":1\" />  Additionally, tectonic activity such as normal faulting is also commonly associated with formation of rifts along volcanic flanks.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=T.

Basaltic shield volcanoes typically feature two main rift zones, situated with angles of 120\u00b0 between in ideal situations.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> On shield volcanoes forming from level seafloor without neighboring vents, flank rifting occurs more evenly distributed around the vent.<ref name=\":0\" />  However, where the flanks of a volcano may be supported on one side by the presence of a pre-existing feature, or burdened with various planes of weakness, rift zone formation promulgates according to down-slope pull of gravity.\n\n==Structure==\nThe infill of magmas in the form of dykes helps to define the shape of a volcano.  A higher frequency of intrusive events along rift zones leads to elongated topographies of the affected edifices.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mathematical models show how the presence of rift zones contributes to a central horizontal bulge or ridge parallel to the orientation of the rifts.<ref name=\":2\" />  This same modelling shows how this central bulge is dependent on the ration between rift zone length and depth of the magma sources, with longer fissures over shallower sources being more positively associated with very elongated topographies of the associated flanks.<ref name=\":2\" /> \nOccasionally, fissure eruptions associated with rift zones can actually evolve into new vents along the volcanic edifice, generating lava flows lasting for months or longer.<ref name=\":0\" /> These lava flows add surface materials to the slopes of the volcano, extending the slopes outward in a general flattening of the morphology of the flank.<ref name=\":4\" />  The extensional character of these events can contribute to flank instability and [[mass wasting]] events where whole sections of the volcanic edifice can collapse along rift zone boundaries.<ref name=\":3\" />  These mass wasting events can affect the dyke formations and orientations as the mass of the edifice shifts, which can have profound impacts on the structural development of the edifice,<ref name=\":3\" /> while also potentially creating many [[volcanic hazards]], such as tsunamis and dramatic shifts in directions of lava flows, to unsuspecting communities.   \n \nVolcanologist [[George P.L. Walker]] stated that rift zones were common in most volcanoes around the world, regardless of their type and formation.<ref name=\":1\" />  Walker put forward the idea that, absent any obvious signs of rifting on the surface, the presence of other volcanic features that are also associated with dyke intrusions (such as elongated cinder cones and linearly-aligned fissure vents) should also be taken to represent the presence of a rift zone-like processes in the given region.<ref name=\":1\" />  Therefore, rift zones of various lengths and widths can be tentatively identified on many [[stratovolcano]]es and [[Monogenetic volcanic field|monogenetic lava field]]s in addition to classic Hawaiian [[shield volcano]]es.\n\n==Examples==\n* [[Hawaii]]: Most Hawaiian volcanoes have two or sometimes three rift zones.\n** [[M\u0101hukona]]\n** [[Mauna Loa]]\n** [[Hualalai]]\n** [[Kilauea]]\n* [[Galapagos Islands]]\n* [[Canary Islands]]\n** [[La Palma#Volcano|La Palma]]\n** [[El Hierro]]\n* [[Newberry Volcano]], Oregon\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fracture (geology)]]\n*[[Lateral eruption]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/rift-zones Rift Zones | Volcano World | Oregon State University]\n\n[[Category:Volcanology]]\n[[Category:Volcanism of Hawaii]]\n", "name_user": "Cadere09", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed \"(that's what she said)\" after the word \"elongated\" in the first paragraph", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_zone"}
