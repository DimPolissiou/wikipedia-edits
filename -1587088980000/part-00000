In 1853, Colonel Thomas J. Nevins, San Francisco's first superintendent of schools, had broached the idea of a free high school for boys and a seminary for girls. It took three years for Nevins to convince the Board of Education that a high school was necessary, and a resolution was passed on July 10, 1856 to establish the San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary. Six days later, however, the resolution was rescinded on the grounds that a high school could not legally be part of the San Francisco Common Schools; opponents in the City saw no need for an education beyond the eighth grade funded on public budgets. A simple name change from the proposed San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary to the Union Grammar School appeased those who had opposed the creation of the school. Thus was San Francisco's first public school that provided a secondary education established.\n\nThe Union Grammar School first opened on August 25, 1856 in rented quarters at the Wesleyan Methodist Church on Powell Street, between Clay and Sacramento. By 1860, the church was purchased and reconstructed as a school at the same location. The new two-storied school building had four classrooms, an assembly room, and two rooms for gymnastic exercises and calisthenics. Dedication ceremonies for the new structure took place on September 19, 1860. The school in the new building was already referred to as the San Francisco High School because by that time, it was generally recognized that the course of study was on the secondary level.\n\nIn May 1864, the Board of Education decided to form separate schools for boys and girls. Boys remained at the same campus at the Boys' High School, while girls were moved to their own school at Bush and Stockton Streets (Girls' High School), where they would remain until the return of coeducation (in practice) in the 1880s.\n\nIn 1894, the school was renamed to honor the distinguished poet [[James Russell Lowell]], chiefly by Pelham W. Ames, a member of the school board and ardent admirer of James Russell Lowell. The school relocated in January 1913 to an entire block on Hayes Street between Ashbury and Masonic. Lowell remained there for 50 years and established its position as the city's [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory high school]]. In 1952, the school sought a new location near [[Lake Merced]] and moved there (its present address) in 1962.<ref name=\"alumni\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, Lowell has had unique and close relationships with the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. When the University of California first opened its first campus in Oakland in September 1896, Lowell (Boys' High School) began to evolve its curriculum to prepare students for the college. From its inception, the University was to have a special relationship with its unique secondary school feeder in San Francisco. Boys' High School quickly became seen as a stepping-stone to college. Of the University of California's first six graduating classes (1873-1878), over a third had attended Boys' High School. William T. Reid, the high school's fourth principal, later became the president of the University of California. Part of Lowell folklore is that Stanford took its colors and the Cardinal name from Lowell.\n\n=== ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1980s) ===\nIn 1983, the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD) attempted to ensure racial desegregation at Lowell and other schools by implementing a race-based admissions policy as a result of ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' and the 1983 Consent Decree settlement.\n\nBecause of the Consent Decree, SFUSD strived to create a more equal distribution of race at Lowell, which was predominantly [[Chinese American]], particularly trying to introduce more African American and Hispanic students into the school's population. As a result of this policy, effective in 1985, Chinese-American freshman applicants needed to score 62 out of a possible total of 69 eligibility points, whereas Caucasian and other East Asian candidates needed only 58 points.<ref>{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 July 1995 |title=COLUMN ONE : Caught on the Wrong Side of the Line? : Chinese Americans must outscore all other groups to enter elite Lowell High in San Francisco, sparking an ugly battle over diversity and the image of a 'model minority.' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-13/news/mn-23543_1_chinese-americans/2 |work=Los Angeles times |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1990s) ===\n{{Main|Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District}}\n\nIn 1994, a group of Chinese-American community activists organized a lawsuit to challenge the 1983 Consent Decree race-based admissions policies used by SFUSD for its public schools. The lawsuit was led by Lowell alum, Lee Cheng.<ref>{{cite news |last=Har |first=Janie |agency=Associated Press |date=27 August 2018 |title=Race-based school criteria roils Asian-Americans - again |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/race-based-school-criteria-roils-asian-americans---again/2018/08/27/39265076-a9af-11e8-9a7d-cd30504ff902_story.html?noredirect=on |work=Washington Post |location= |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, both parties agreed to a settlement which modified the 1983 Consent Decree to create a new \"diversity index\" system which substituted race as a factor for admissions with a variety of factors such as socioeconomic background, mother's educational level, academic achievement, language spoken at home, and English Learner Status.\n\n=== Expiration of the Consent Decree ===\nCritics of the diversity index created by ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' point out that many schools, including Lowell, have become even less racially diverse since it was enacted.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied a request to extend the Consent Decree, which was set to expire on December 31, 2005 after it had been extended once before to December 31, 2002. The ruling claimed \"since the settlement of the ''Ho'' litigation [resulting in the institution of the \"diversity index\"], the consent decree has proven to be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in achieving diversity in San Francisco public schools\" by making schools more racially segregated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf |title=110805order.pdf |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |author=The United States District Court of the Northern District of California |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712183508/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:LowellHighSchoolMainEntranceFromEuclyptausStreet.jpg|thumbnail|Lowell High School's Main Entrance.]]\nLowell is located north of [[Lake Merced]], south of [[San Francisco]]'s Parkside District.

Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors (the system tends to produce \"incomplete\" schedules which must be dealt with after the scheduling period).<ref name=\"SFChroniclearenascheduling\">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/04/BAGVIHIKD71.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea Class scheduling methods put Lowell High in a tizzy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref><ref name=\"keeparenascheduling\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ Self-scheduling is fundamental to Lowell.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020935/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ |date=2007-09-27 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref>\n\nProponents of arena argued that the system distinguishes Lowell and gives students additional responsibility and flexibility with shaping their high school careers. Doing so, students can prepare for a similar selecting of courses in college. Students would be able to choose teachers whom they found to be compatible with their learning style. The rotating priority system of picking teachers and times would assure the fairest results for the greatest number of people.\n\nAfter a student forum, committee meetings, several student petitions, and final deliberation by then-principal Paul Cheng and the administration, it was decided that arena would remain in place, with modifications to address concerns about inequities and class imbalance, including the abolishment of early scheduling for Shield and Scroll and \"mini arena,\" which allowed people with incomplete schedules another chance to complete them by opening up all the classes again with a few slots.\n\nUnder pressure from faculty and students, in 2013 the Lowell administration decided on an \"online arena\"\u2014very different from the previous arena.<ref name=\"onlinearena\">[http://thelowell.org/2013/05/29/shift-to-online-self-scheduling-a-success Shift to online self-scheduling a success.] From ''The Lowell''.</ref> In 2012, the Lowell administration began preliminary testing by requiring students to submit their proposed classes for the next school year through an online form, designed and maintained by a few students from the computer programming classes. The preliminary trials were a success as students were able to submit their schedules into a database by means of a computerized system, saving the faculty from having to input the information themselves.

Lowell has competitive [[American football|football]], [[Cross country running|cross-country]], [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[wrestling]], [[badminton]], [[dragonboat]], [[softball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[track and field]], [[fencing]], [[flag football]], [[golf]], [[cheerleading]], and [[baseball]] teams.\n\nLowell's Boys Varsity Basketball has recently been very successful. In 2004, the team won its first AAA Championship since 1952. Following a runner-up finish in 2005, the 2006 squad went undefeated in league play and finished with a 30\u20133 record and a city championship.  The 2007 squad also won the championships, while the 2008 squad finished high in the playoffs. The 2009 team once again won the 2009 AAA championships over Lincoln. The basketball team engages in an annual rivalry with [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|Washington High School]] in a game commonly known to those in the city as the \"Battle of the Birds\" game.  This is based on the fact that Lowell's mascot is the cardinal and Washington High School's mascot is the eagle.\n\nLowell's Varsity Baseball team, led by coach John Donohue, won eight of ten championships from 1994 to 2004<ref name=\"baseballchampions\">[http://www.cifsf.org/Sports/baseballchampions.pdf AAA Baseball Annual Champions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510151753/http://cifsf.org/Sports/baseballchampions.pdf |date=2006-05-10 }}</ref> while posting a regular season record of 185 wins and only 11 losses<ref name=\"baseballrecord\">[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/26/SPGMIIFBBF1.DTL 3 teams have caught Lowell in race for baseball supremacy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref> during that span.

The close rivalry between the Cardinals' and the Washington Eagles ended with Lowell coming out on top of all the other SFUSD high schools participating, which included [[Balboa High School (San Francisco)|Balboa High]], [[Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco)|Lincoln High]], and Wallenberg High School.\nIn April 2008, Lowell's varsity swim team won their 12th consecutive AAA Championship title, with an undefeated season yet again. The rivalry between the Cardinals' and the Washington Eagles ended with Lowell coming on top with the varsity boys scoring 170-49 and the girls 122\u201362. The JV girls also were able to defeat Washington with a score of 104\u201367. However, the JV boys lost to their counterpart from Lincoln 93\u201369.\n\nIn April 2007, Lowell's dragonboat team competed in the California Dragonboat Association Youth Race at Lake Merced in San Francisco, California. They brought home three golds and two silvers. The Lowellitas, the girls' team, won their seventh consecutive gold medal. In the spring of 2010 the Lowell Dragonboat team won gold medals in the top division, breaking a five-year drought of golds for Lowell in the top division traced back to 2005.\n\nLowell's Varsity Girls' Soccer has won the AAA Championship title for the past 21<ref>https://thelowell.org/varsity-girls-soccer-crowned-champions-75b3b8be97de</ref> years in a row. In 2012, they ended their season without being scored on in league games, a record of 101\u20130.  Their most recent defeat was two seasons ago, a forfeit to Balboa on April 6, 2010. Aside from forfeits, the girls have remained undefeated for the past 10 years in league play. There is no JV team.\n\nLowell's JV Girls' Gymnastics team placed first in the NCVAL JV Gymnastics Finals from 2007 to 2010.  At the CCS Varsity Finals, Lowell's Varsity Girls' Gymnastics team placed third in 2009 and second in 2010.  Lowell does not have a boys' gymnastics team.\n\nThe Lowell Varsity Cheer Squad placed 1st in stunts and received a runner up medal in dance in the 2009 AAA competition. They also went to USA Nationals (2010) and placed in the top half of their division (4 points away from 1st place). In 2015 Lowell Cheer attended USA Nationals and won 4th place in the Super Novice Show Cheer Division. Lowell Cheer also performs at school rallies and pumps up the crowd at most, if not all, boys' football and basketball games.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nNotable alumni of Lowell High School have been cataloged by the Lowell Alumni Association.<ref name=AlumniAssociation>{{cite web|title=Famous Lowell Graduates |url=http://www.lowellalumni.org/list_famous.shtml |date=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924064617/http://www.lowellalumni.org/list_famous.shtml |archive-date=September 24, 2014 |website=Lowell Alumni Association |access-date=January 23, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Alumni include:\n\n{{AlumniStart|sortable=1}}\n{{Alum|name=[[Albert Abraham Michelson]]|year=1868|nota=[[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1907.

In 1853, Colonel Thomas J. Nevins, San Francisco's first superintendent of schools, had broached the idea of a free high school for boys and a seminary for girls. It took three years for Nevins to convince the Board of Education that a high school was necessary, and a resolution was passed on July 10, 1856 to establish the San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary. Six days later, however, the resolution was rescinded on the grounds that a high school could not legally be part of the San Francisco Common Schools; opponents in the City saw no need for an education beyond the eighth grade funded on public budgets. A simple name change from the proposed San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary to the Union Grammar School appeased those who had opposed the creation of the school. Thus was San Francisco's first public school that provided a secondary education established.\n\nThe Union Grammar School first opened on August 25, 1856 in rented quarters at the Wesleyan Methodist Church on Powell Street, between Clay and Sacramento. By 1860, the church was purchased and reconstructed as a school at the same location. The new two-storied school building had four classrooms, an assembly room, and two rooms for gymnastic exercises and calisthenics. Dedication ceremonies for the new structure took place on September 19, 1860. The school in the new building was already referred to as the San Francisco High School because by that time, it was generally recognized that the course of study was on the secondary level.\n\nIn May 1864, the Board of Education decided to form separate schools for boys and girls. Boys remained at the same campus at the Boys' High School, while girls were moved to their own school at Bush and Stockton Streets (Girls' High School), where they would remain until the return of coeducation (in practice) in the 1880s.\n\nIn 1894, the school was renamed to honor the distinguished poet [[James Russell Lowell]], chiefly by Pelham W. Ames, a member of the school board and ardent admirer of James Russell Lowell. The school relocated in January 1913 to an entire block on Hayes Street between Ashbury and Masonic. Lowell remained there for 50 years and established its position as the city's [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory high school]]. In 1952, the school sought a new location near [[Lake Merced]] and moved there (its present address) in 1962.<ref name=\"alumni\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, Lowell has had unique and close relationships with the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. When the University of California first opened its first campus in Oakland in September 1896, Lowell (Boys' High School) began to evolve its curriculum to prepare students for the college. From its inception, the University was to have a special relationship with its unique secondary school feeder in San Francisco. Boys' High School quickly became seen as a stepping-stone to college. Of the University of California's first six graduating classes (1873-1878), over a third had attended Boys' High School. William T. Reid, the high school's fourth principal, later became the president of the University of California. Part of Lowell folklore is that Stanford took its colors and the Cardinal name from Lowell.\n\n=== ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1980s) ===\nIn 1983, the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD) attempted to ensure racial desegregation at Lowell and other schools by implementing a race-based admissions policy as a result of ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' and the 1983 Consent Decree settlement.\n\nBecause of the Consent Decree, SFUSD strived to create a more equal distribution of race at Lowell, which was predominantly [[Chinese American]], particularly trying to introduce more African American and Hispanic students into the school's population. As a result of this policy, effective in 1985, Chinese-American freshman applicants needed to score 62 out of a possible total of 69 eligibility points, whereas Caucasian and other East Asian candidates needed only 58 points.<ref>{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 July 1995 |title=COLUMN ONE : Caught on the Wrong Side of the Line? : Chinese Americans must outscore all other groups to enter elite Lowell High in San Francisco, sparking an ugly battle over diversity and the image of a 'model minority.' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-13/news/mn-23543_1_chinese-americans/2 |work=Los Angeles times |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1990s) ===\n{{Main|Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District}}\n\nIn 1994, a group of Chinese-American community activists organized a lawsuit to challenge the 1983 Consent Decree race-based admissions policies used by SFUSD for its public schools. The lawsuit was led by Lowell alum, Lee Cheng.<ref>{{cite news |last=Har |first=Janie |agency=Associated Press |date=27 August 2018 |title=Race-based school criteria roils Asian-Americans - again |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/race-based-school-criteria-roils-asian-americans---again/2018/08/27/39265076-a9af-11e8-9a7d-cd30504ff902_story.html?noredirect=on |work=Washington Post |location= |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, both parties agreed to a settlement which modified the 1983 Consent Decree to create a new \"diversity index\" system which substituted race as a factor for admissions with a variety of factors such as socioeconomic background, mother's educational level, academic achievement, language spoken at home, and English Learner Status.\n\n=== Expiration of the Consent Decree ===\nCritics of the diversity index created by ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' point out that many schools, including Lowell, have become even less racially diverse since it was enacted.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied a request to extend the Consent Decree, which was set to expire on December 31, 2005 after it had been extended once before to December 31, 2002. The ruling claimed \"since the settlement of the ''Ho'' litigation [resulting in the institution of the \"diversity index\"], the consent decree has proven to be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in achieving diversity in San Francisco public schools\" by making schools more racially segregated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf |title=110805order.pdf |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |author=The United States District Court of the Northern District of California |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712183508/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:LowellHighSchoolMainEntranceFromEuclyptausStreet.jpg|thumbnail|Lowell High School's Main Entrance.]]\nLowell is located north of [[Lake Merced]], south of [[San Francisco]]'s Parkside District.

Students also have the opportunity to choose from a large number of Advanced Placement courses. Lowell has a graduation rate of nearly 100%, and it is the largest feeder school to the [[University of California]] system, particularly to the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[University of California, Davis|Davis]] campuses.\n\n=== Arena scheduling system ===\nLowell uses an \"arena\" class scheduling system in which students are given a time slot and directed to a website to choose their classes allowing students a degree of programming freedom.\n\nWhile scheduling classes for the 2006 spring semester, one of the students who had volunteered to assist the running of arena was caught abusing the scheduling system to use early scheduling privileges, granted to volunteers by the administration, to let friends schedule before others.<ref name=\"schedulinginequity\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1521/28/ Honor society causes scheduling inequity.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020928/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1521/28/ |date=2007-09-27 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref><ref name=\"shieldandscrollmorals\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1665/29/ Shield and Scroll must maintain high moral standards.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819221716/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1665/29/ |date=2006-08-19 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref>\n\nThis abuse proved to be a catalyst for anti-arena faculty in the school. Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors (the system tends to produce \"incomplete\" schedules which must be dealt with after the scheduling period).<ref name=\"SFChroniclearenascheduling\">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/04/BAGVIHIKD71.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea Class scheduling methods put Lowell High in a tizzy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref><ref name=\"keeparenascheduling\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ Self-scheduling is fundamental to Lowell.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020935/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ |date=2007-09-27 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref>\n\nProponents of arena argued that the system distinguishes Lowell and gives students additional responsibility and flexibility with shaping their high school careers. Doing so, students can prepare for a similar selecting of courses in college. Students would be able to choose teachers whom they found to be compatible with their learning style. The rotating priority system of picking teachers and times would assure the fairest results for the greatest number of people.\n\nAfter a student forum, committee meetings, several student petitions, and final deliberation by then-principal Paul Cheng and the administration, it was decided that arena would remain in place, with modifications to address concerns about inequities and class imbalance, including the abolishment of early scheduling for Shield and Scroll and \"mini arena,\" which allowed people with incomplete schedules another chance to complete them by opening up all the classes again with a few slots.\n\nUnder pressure from faculty and students, in 2013 the Lowell administration decided on an \"online arena\"\u2014very different from the previous arena.<ref name=\"onlinearena\">[http://thelowell.org/2013/05/29/shift-to-online-self-scheduling-a-success Shift to online self-scheduling a success.] From ''The Lowell''.</ref> In 2012, the Lowell administration began preliminary testing by requiring students to submit their proposed classes for the next school year through an online form, designed and maintained by a few students from the computer programming classes. The preliminary trials were a success as students were able to submit their schedules into a database by means of a computerized system, saving the faculty from having to input the information themselves.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. say). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cwill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. say).

The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

The degree is usually contrasted with the [[Master of Science]]. Those admitted to the degree typically study [[linguistics]], [[history]], [[communication studies]], [[diplomacy]], [[public administration]], [[political science]], or other subjects within the scope of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the natural sciences and mathematics. The degree can be conferred in respect of completing courses and passing examinations, research, or a combination of the two.\n\nThe Master of Arts traces its origin to the teaching license or {{lang|la|Licentia docendi}} of the [[University of Paris]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Master of Arts}}</ref>\n\n==Europe==\n===Germany===\nIn Germany, the traditional equivalent of the postgraduate Master of Arts was the ''Magister Artium''. This degree, which usually required 5 years of studies, did exist in former [[West Germany]] and in reunited Germany, but not in former [[East Germany]] where all degree courses led to [[Diplom]] degrees. Traditional Magister degrees were granted in [[social science]]s and most of the humanities ([[International business|International Business]], Affairs, [[European studies|European Studies]]  and [[Economics]] included), with the exception of visual and performing arts such as music and theatre.\n\nThe Magister Artium was either a double major degree or a combination of one major and two minors. German postgraduate Master's of Arts and Master's of Science degrees were introduced in 2001. Therefore, the new Master of Arts and the old Magister Artium degrees existed side by side until the phase out of the old degrees since 2010; Magister Artium degrees are still awarded (as of 2014). The new Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees together also require 5 years of studies, which is the reason why the new Master of Arts and the old Magister Artium degrees are considered equivalent.\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands, the master of Arts and the Master of Science degrees were introduced in 2002. Until that time, a single program that led to the [[doctorandus]] degree (or the [[ingenieur]] degree in the case of technical subjects) was in effect, which comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs put together. Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, upon completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (before their name, abbreviated to 'drs.'; in the case of ingenieur, this would be 'ir.'), or simply use the master's degree (behind their name) in accordance with the new standard (so, 'MA' or 'MSc'). Because these graduates do not have a separate bachelor's degree (which is in fact \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 incorporated into the program), the master's degree is their first academic degree.\n\n===Poland===\nThe Polish equivalent of Master of Arts is \"magister\" (its abbreviation \"mgr\" is placed before one's name, like dr). At the technical universities, one is awarded with in\u017cynier (engineer) after three years and then with \"magister\" after completing another two years of study and graduating. Such persons use titles \"mgr in\u017c\". In the 1990s, the MA programs usually lasting 5 years were replaced by separate 3-year bachelor's and 2-year master's programs. The degree is awarded in the arts (literature, foreign languages, filmmaking, theatre etc.), natural sciences, mathematics, computer science fields, and economics. The completion of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.\n\n===Nordic countries===\nIn Finland, Denmark and Norway, the master's degree is a combined taught/research degree, awarded after 2 years of studies after completing the bachelor's degree. The student is required to write a scientific thesis.\n\nIn Finland, this master's degree is called a ''filosofian maisteri'' (Finnish) or ''filosofie magister'' (Swedish) degree, and it is abbreviated as ''FM'' or \"fil.mag.\".\n\nIn Sweden, there is still an intermediate degree between the Bachelor (''kandidat'') and Master called ''magister'' which only requires one year of studies, including a scientific thesis after completing the bachelor's degree. This fourth year typically constitutes the first half of Master programme. If not, it may be supplemented by a fifth year and a Master's thesis to obtain a master's degree in the field of study.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n\n====Most universities====\nThe MA is typically a \"taught\" postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examination, and a dissertation based on independent research. Taught master's programs involve one or two years of full-time study. Many can be done part-time as well. Until recently, both the undergraduate and postgraduate master's degrees were awarded without grade or class (like the class of an [[honours degree]]). Nowadays, however, master's degrees are normally classified into the categories of Fail, Pass, Pass with Merit, or Pass with Distinction. This education pattern in the United Kingdom is followed in India and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Nations]].\n\nThe [[Master of Laws]] (LLM) is the standard degree taught for law, but certain courses may lead to MA, MLitt, [[Master of Studies]] (MSt), and the [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (BCL) at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. All of these degrees are considered substitutes to one another and are thus generally equivalent.\n\n====Scotland====\nIn the [[ancient universities of Scotland]], the degree of Master of Arts is awarded in universities as a four-year undergraduate degree, see [[Master of Arts (Scotland)]].\n\nThe Master of Arts is awarded in [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[theology]], and [[social sciences]]. However, some universities&mdash;particularly those in Scotland&mdash;award the [[Master of Letters]] (MLitt) to students in the [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], and [[social sciences]].\n\n====Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin (conferred)====\n{{Main|Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)}}\nAt [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]], the MA is conferred [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|after a certain number of years]] without further examination to those who are Bachelors of Arts.\n\nThe title of Master of Arts may also be awarded, in the case of the oldest British universities only, without further examination to those who have graduated as [[Bachelor of Arts]] and who have the requisite years' standing as members of the university or as graduates. This happens, in England, only at the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], four years after completing a bachelor's degree, and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], six years after the first term of study. It is also the case at the [[University of Dublin]] in Ireland.  The abbreviated name of the university (Oxon, Cantab or Dubl) is therefore almost always appended in parentheses to the initials \"MA\" in the same way that it is to higher degrees, e.g. \"John Smith, MA (Cantab), PhD (Lond)\", principally so that it is clear (to those who are aware of the system) that these are nominal and unexamined degrees.<ref>Debretts Correct Form (2013 edn) - Academics</ref>\n\nThe MLitt is a research degree at the [[University of Cambridge]], where the [[Master of Philosophy]] (MPhil) is the name given to the standard one-year taught degree with a unique research element, in contrast to the use of MPhil at other institutions for a research degree.\n\n=====Confusion=====\nIn February 2011, Labour MP for Nottingham East, [[Chris Leslie (politician)|Chris Leslie]], sponsored a private member's bill in Parliament, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010\u201312, in order to \"prohibit universities awarding Master\u2019s degrees unless certain standards of study and assessment are met\". The Bill's supporters described the practice as a \"historical anachronism\u201d and argued that unearned qualifications should be discontinued in order to preserve the academic integrity of the taught MA. Further, they warned that the title gave Oxbridge graduates an unfair advantage in the job market.\n\nResearch by the universities watchdog, the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]], in 2000, showed that two-thirds of employers were unaware that the Cambridge MA did not represent any kind of post-graduate achievement involving study.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oxbridge students' MA 'degrees' under threat|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8318460/Oxbridge-students-MA-degrees-under-threat.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 October 2011, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010\u201312 received its second reading. The Bill failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the end of the session, meaning it made no further progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary business|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/mastersdegreesminimumstandards.html|publisher=http://www.parliament.uk/|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Oxford, Cambridge (earned)====\nA number of different master's degrees may be earned at Oxford and Cambridge.  The most common, the Master of Philosophy (MPhil), is a two-year research degree. The Master of Science (MSc) and the Master of Studies (MSt) degrees each take one year.  They often combine some coursework with research.  The Master of Letters (MLitt) is a pure research master's degree.  More recently, Oxford and Cambridge offer a Masters of Business Administration.  Master's degrees are generally offered without classification, though the top five percent may be deemed worthy of Distinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing|title=Graduate courses A-Z listing - University of Oxford|publisher=}}</ref> Both universities also offer a variety of four-year undergraduate integrated master's degrees such as [[MEng]] or [[MMath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|title=The structure of undergraduate courses at the University of Cambridge|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/mathematics?wssl=1|title=Mathematics|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/engineering-science?wssl=1|title=Engineering Science|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== North America ==\n{{Main|List of master's degrees in North America}}\nIn Canada and the United States, the Master of Arts (''Magister Artium'') and [[Master of Science]] (''Magister Scienti\u00e6'') are the basic graduate-level degrees in most subjects and may be course-based, research-based, or, more typically, a combination of the two.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/master.doc | publisher=International Affairs Office, [[U.S. Department of Education]] |date= February 2008 |title= Structure of the U.S. Education System: Master's Degrees |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>\n\nAdmission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]].

For example, [[Harvard University]], [[Dartmouth College]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[MIT]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Brown University]] use the abbreviations AM and SM for some of their master's degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Degree Programs - The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/degree_programs.php|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Degree Abbreviations - Harvard University|url=http://www.harvard.edu/on-campus/commencement/degree-abbreviations|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref> A Master of Arts may be given in a scientific discipline, common at [[Ivy League|Ivy League universities]].\n\nMany universities offer Master of Arts programs, which are differentiated either as Thesis or Non-Thesis programs. Usually, the duration for a Non-Thesis option is one to two years of full-time study. The period for a Thesis option may last longer, depending also on the required level of courses and complexity of the [[thesis]]. Sometimes, qualified students who are admitted to a \"very high research\" Master of Arts might have to earn credits also at the PhD level, and they may need to complete their program in about three years of full-time candidature e.g. at the universities [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in the US and [[McGill University|McGill]] in Canada.\n\nA thesis must be a distinct contribution to knowledge. It must demonstrate ability to plan and carry out research, organize results, and defend the approach and conclusions in a scholarly manner. The research presented must meet current standards of the discipline. Finally, the thesis must clearly demonstrate how the research advances knowledge in the field.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Master of Arts}}\n[[Category:Master's degrees|Arts (postgraduate)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Type of Master's degree in the fields of humanities and social sciences}}\n{{Other uses|Master of Arts (disambiguation)}}\n{{Redirect|M.A.|other uses|MA (disambiguation)}}\n{{Multiple|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Incomplete|Master of Arts in other continents.|date=April 2019}}\n}}\n\nA '''Master of Arts''' ({{lang-la|Magister Artium}} or ''Artium Magister''; abbreviated '''MA''' or '''AM''') is a type of [[master's degree]] awarded by [[University|universities]] in many countries.

Because these graduates do not have a separate bachelor's degree (which is in fact \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 incorporated into the program), the master's degree is their first academic degree.\n\n===Poland===\nThe Polish equivalent of Master of Arts is \"magister\" (its abbreviation \"mgr\" is placed before one's name, like dr). At the technical universities, one is awarded with in\u017cynier (engineer) after three years and then with \"magister\" after completing another two years of study and graduating. Such persons use titles \"mgr in\u017c\". In the 1990s, the MA programs usually lasting 5 years were replaced by separate 3-year bachelor's and 2-year master's programs. The degree is awarded in the arts (literature, foreign languages, filmmaking, theatre etc.), natural sciences, mathematics, computer science fields, and economics. The completion of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.\n\n===Nordic countries===\nIn Finland, Denmark and Norway, the master's degree is a combined taught/research degree, awarded after 2 years of studies after completing the bachelor's degree. The student is required to write a scientific thesis.\n\nIn Finland, this master's degree is called a ''filosofian maisteri'' (Finnish) or ''filosofie magister'' (Swedish) degree, and it is abbreviated as ''FM'' or \"fil.mag.\".\n\nIn Sweden, there is still an intermediate degree between the Bachelor (''kandidat'') and Master called ''magister'' which only requires one year of studies, including a scientific thesis after completing the bachelor's degree. This fourth year typically constitutes the first half of Master programme. If not, it may be supplemented by a fifth year and a Master's thesis to obtain a master's degree in the field of study.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n\n====Most universities====\nThe MA is typically a \"taught\" postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examination, and a dissertation based on independent research. Taught master's programs involve one or two years of full-time study. Many can be done part-time as well. Until recently, both the undergraduate and postgraduate master's degrees were awarded without grade or class (like the class of an [[honours degree]]). Nowadays, however, master's degrees are normally classified into the categories of Fail, Pass, Pass with Merit, or Pass with Distinction. This education pattern in the United Kingdom is followed in India and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Nations]].\n\nThe [[Master of Laws]] (LLM) is the standard degree taught for law, but certain courses may lead to MA, MLitt, [[Master of Studies]] (MSt), and the [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (BCL) at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. All of these degrees are considered substitutes to one another and are thus generally equivalent.\n\n====Scotland====\nIn the [[ancient universities of Scotland]], the degree of Master of Arts is awarded in universities as a four-year undergraduate degree, see [[Master of Arts (Scotland)]].\n\nThe Master of Arts is awarded in [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[theology]], and [[social sciences]]. However, some universities&mdash;particularly those in Scotland&mdash;award the [[Master of Letters]] (MLitt) to students in the [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], and [[social sciences]].\n\n====Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin (conferred)====\n{{Main|Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)}}\nAt [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]], the MA is conferred [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|after a certain number of years]] without further examination to those who are Bachelors of Arts.\n\nThe title of Master of Arts may also be awarded, in the case of the oldest British universities only, without further examination to those who have graduated as [[Bachelor of Arts]] and who have the requisite years' standing as members of the university or as graduates. This happens, in England, only at the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], four years after completing a bachelor's degree, and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], six years after the first term of study. It is also the case at the [[University of Dublin]] in Ireland.  The abbreviated name of the university (Oxon, Cantab or Dubl) is therefore almost always appended in parentheses to the initials \"MA\" in the same way that it is to higher degrees, e.g. \"John Smith, MA (Cantab), PhD (Lond)\", principally so that it is clear (to those who are aware of the system) that these are nominal and unexamined degrees.<ref>Debretts Correct Form (2013 edn) - Academics</ref>\n\nThe MLitt is a research degree at the [[University of Cambridge]], where the [[Master of Philosophy]] (MPhil) is the name given to the standard one-year taught degree with a unique research element, in contrast to the use of MPhil at other institutions for a research degree.\n\n=====Confusion=====\nIn February 2011, Labour MP for Nottingham East, [[Chris Leslie (politician)|Chris Leslie]], sponsored a private member's bill in Parliament, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010\u201312, in order to \"prohibit universities awarding Master\u2019s degrees unless certain standards of study and assessment are met\". The Bill's supporters described the practice as a \"historical anachronism\u201d and argued that unearned qualifications should be discontinued in order to preserve the academic integrity of the taught MA. Further, they warned that the title gave Oxbridge graduates an unfair advantage in the job market.\n\nResearch by the universities watchdog, the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]], in 2000, showed that two-thirds of employers were unaware that the Cambridge MA did not represent any kind of post-graduate achievement involving study.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oxbridge students' MA 'degrees' under threat|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8318460/Oxbridge-students-MA-degrees-under-threat.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 October 2011, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010\u201312 received its second reading. The Bill failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the end of the session, meaning it made no further progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary business|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/mastersdegreesminimumstandards.html|publisher=http://www.parliament.uk/|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Oxford, Cambridge (earned)====\nA number of different master's degrees may be earned at Oxford and Cambridge.  The most common, the Master of Philosophy (MPhil), is a two-year research degree. The Master of Science (MSc) and the Master of Studies (MSt) degrees each take one year.  They often combine some coursework with research.  The Master of Letters (MLitt) is a pure research master's degree.  More recently, Oxford and Cambridge offer a Masters of Business Administration.  Master's degrees are generally offered without classification, though the top five percent may be deemed worthy of Distinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing|title=Graduate courses A-Z listing - University of Oxford|publisher=}}</ref> Both universities also offer a variety of four-year undergraduate integrated master's degrees such as [[MEng]] or [[MMath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|title=The structure of undergraduate courses at the University of Cambridge|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/mathematics?wssl=1|title=Mathematics|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/engineering-science?wssl=1|title=Engineering Science|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== North America ==\n{{Main|List of master's degrees in North America}}\nIn Canada and the United States, the Master of Arts (''Magister Artium'') and [[Master of Science]] (''Magister Scienti\u00e6'') are the basic graduate-level degrees in most subjects and may be course-based, research-based, or, more typically, a combination of the two.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/master.doc | publisher=International Affairs Office, [[U.S. Department of Education]] |date= February 2008 |title= Structure of the U.S. Education System: Master's Degrees |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>\n\nAdmission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]]. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's after about five years.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.cgu.edu/pages/623.asp the program] run by [[Claremont Graduate University]] for graduates of the [[Claremont Colleges]]</ref> Some universities use the Latin degree names, such as ''Artium Magister'' (AM) or ''Scienti\u00e6 Magister'' (SM). For example, [[Harvard University]], [[Dartmouth College]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[MIT]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Brown University]] use the abbreviations AM and SM for some of their master's degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Degree Programs - The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/degree_programs.php|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Degree Abbreviations - Harvard University|url=http://www.harvard.edu/on-campus/commencement/degree-abbreviations|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref> A Master of Arts may be given in a scientific discipline, common at [[Ivy League|Ivy League universities]].\n\nMany universities offer Master of Arts programs, which are differentiated either as Thesis or Non-Thesis programs. Usually, the duration for a Non-Thesis option is one to two years of full-time study. The period for a Thesis option may last longer, depending also on the required level of courses and complexity of the [[thesis]]. Sometimes, qualified students who are admitted to a \"very high research\" Master of Arts might have to earn credits also at the PhD level, and they may need to complete their program in about three years of full-time candidature e.g. at the universities [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in the US and [[McGill University|McGill]] in Canada.\n\nA thesis must be a distinct contribution to knowledge. It must demonstrate ability to plan and carry out research, organize results, and defend the approach and conclusions in a scholarly manner. The research presented must meet current standards of the discipline. Finally, the thesis must clearly demonstrate how the research advances knowledge in the field.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Master of Arts}}\n[[Category:Master's degrees|Arts (postgraduate)]]\n", "name_user": "63.143.76.133", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts"}

In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli]. Today the company is in the hands of the third generation. The family history is documented in a book called Celebrazione! launched in 2003 to celebrate De Bortoli Wines' 75th Anniversary.\n\n===Darren===\n'''Darren De Bortoli''' (born 1960) is currently the managing director of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited.
