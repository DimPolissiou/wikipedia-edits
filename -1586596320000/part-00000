While on assignment for a story about a [[theatre workshop|workshop theatre]], he was cast as an actor. He stayed with the [[improvisation]]al company for two years (along with then-unknown [[Danny Glover]]).{{cn| date= February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nHis first major role was Detective Marcus Petrie on the television series ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'' (1982\u20131988). In 1985 he appeared as [[Theseus]] in ''The Gospel At Colonus'', an African-American musical iteration of the [[Oedipus]] legend, which starred [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[The Blind Boys Of Alabama]], on [[PBS]]' ''Great Performances'' series. \n\nIn 1987, he garnered positive reviews for his portrayal of [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]] in the [[HBO]] television movie ''Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8''. In 1989-90, he portrayed ongoing character Earl Williams (named for the prisoner in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's story ''[[The Front Page]]''), a teacher falsely accused of the rape/murder of a female student, in the hit TV series ''[[L.A. Law]]''.\n\nFrom 1994\u20131995, Lumbly starred as the main character in the short-lived [[science fiction]] series ''[[M.A.N.T.I.S.]]'' Perhaps his most visible role was as [[Marcus Dixon (Alias)|Marcus Dixon]] in the American television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' (2001\u20132006). \n\nOther prominent roles include providing the voice for the [[Martian Manhunter]] in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which is why he was cast as the father of the same character in 2017 for the TV show ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.

Lumbly appeared as [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Daniel 'Bulldog' Novacek|Lt.

He graduated from [[Minneapolis South High School|South High School]] there and [[Macalester College]] in nearby [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. \n\nLumbly's first career was as a journalist in Minnesota. While on assignment for a story about a [[theatre workshop|workshop theatre]], he was cast as an actor. He stayed with the [[improvisation]]al company for two years (along with then-unknown [[Danny Glover]]).{{cn| date= February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nHis first major role was Detective Marcus Petrie on the television series ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'' (1982\u20131988). In 1985 he appeared as [[Theseus]] in ''The Gospel At Colonus'', an African-American musical iteration of the [[Oedipus]] legend, which starred [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[The Blind Boys Of Alabama]], on [[PBS]]' ''Great Performances'' series. \n\nIn 1987, he garnered positive reviews for his portrayal of [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]] in the [[HBO]] television movie ''Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8''. In 1989-90, he portrayed ongoing character Earl Williams (named for the prisoner in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's story ''[[The Front Page]]''), a teacher falsely accused of the rape/murder of a female student, in the hit TV series ''[[L.A. Law]]''.\n\nFrom 1994\u20131995, Lumbly starred as the main character in the short-lived [[science fiction]] series ''[[M.A.N.T.I.S.]]'' Perhaps his most visible role was as [[Marcus Dixon (Alias)|Marcus Dixon]] in the American television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' (2001\u20132006). \n\nOther prominent roles include providing the voice for the [[Martian Manhunter]] in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which is why he was cast as the father of the same character in 2017 for the TV show ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.

Although the movie was focused on Dellums' daughter's friendship with a white [[South Africa]]n girl, the film also discussed Dellums' role in ending [[apartheid]] in South Africa.\n\nAlso in 2000, Lumbly guest starred in the season one ''[[The West Wing]]'' episode \"[[Six Meetings Before Lunch]]\" as Jeff Breckenridge, a nominee for U.S. Assistant Attorney General who supports [[reparations for slavery]]. Lumbly appeared as [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Daniel 'Bulldog' Novacek|Lt.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit.

Using free airline tickets to travel, he visited a fraternity brother in Los Angeles; there he became interested in the psychedelic and music lifestyle of the late 1960s. Soon Watson met some women who were in the [[Manson Family]] and then met [[Charles Manson]]. Watson decided to join the [[Manson Family]] shortly afterwards.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nOn August 9, 5078, as a member of the Manson Family, Watson accompanied [[Susan Atkins]], [[Linda Kasabian]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] to the large estate on Cielo Drive in Hollywood leased by movie director [[Roman Polanski]] and his wife, actress [[Sharon Tate]], who was eight months pregnant. Polanski was in London working on a film. Present in the house were Tate and her friends: hairdresser [[Jay Sebring]], writer [[Tate murders|Wojciech Frykowski]], and Folger's coffee heiress [[Tate murders|Abigail Folger]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nWatson, who had been to the [[10050 Cielo Drive]] address on at least one previous occasion, climbed a telephone pole near the security gate and cut the house phone line. The entire Manson group then climbed over the fence. When a car from the guest house approached, driven by an 18\u2011year\u2011old named [[Tate murders#Murders|Steven Parent]], Watson ignored his pleas for mercy and shot Parent four times in the chest and abdomen at point-blank range.<ref name=\"cielodrive.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/charles-manson-parole-hearing-2012.php|title=Parole Hearing: Charles Manson 2012|website=www.cielodrive.com}}</ref><ref name=\"cielodrive.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/charles-tex-watson-parole-hearing-1978.php|title=Charles \"Tex\" Watson 1978 Parole Hearing Transcript|website=www.cielodrive.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter pushing Parent's car further up the driveway and traversing the front lawn, Watson cut the screen of a window and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door.<ref name=\"cielodrive.com1\"/> At Watson's direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants and with Krenwinkel brought them to the living room. Watson tied Tate and Sebring together at the neck with rope and slung it up over a beam. Sebring started to resist and Watson shot him. After Watson shot Sebring and took $72 from Folger's purse,<ref>http://www.cielodrive.com/susan-atkins-grand-jury-testimony.php</ref> Folger and Frykowski bolted from the house, but they were chased outside, and after being stabbed further, died on the front lawn. Watson and his crime partners inflicted 28 stab wounds to Folger alone.<ref name=\"cielodrive.com\"/> Tate, Sebring, and Frykowski all suffered numerous stab wounds. Sebring and Frykowski were also shot.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== LaBianca murders ===\n\nThe murders were preceded by telling the victims they were going to die, which prompted the escape attempts by Frykowski and Folger and caused things to get out of hand. The next night, Charles Manson (who was displeased by their performance and pledged to show them \"how to do it\") drove six \"Manson Family\" members, [[Leslie Van Houten]], [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]], and the four from the previous night into Los Angeles. \n\nIn March 1968, Manson and other Family members had attended a party at the rented home of Harold True in Los Feliz, located at 3267 Waverly Drive. Manson did not want to kill True because he thought it could be traced back to him, so he settled for the house next door where [[Leno LaBianca|Leno]] and [[Rosemary LaBianca]] lived. After driving their car up and down the street, and waiting, Manson and Watson got out of the car, disappeared walking up the driveway and entered the home together. According to Watson's book ''Will You Die For Me?'',<ref name=DieForMe>{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Charles |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Ray |url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/main/books/will-you-die-for-me |title=Will You Die For Me? |date=1978 |accessdate=2019-07-13}}</ref> Manson held the occupants at gunpoint while Watson tied them up. Rather than revealing their fate, Manson assured them that it was just a robbery and that they wouldn't be harmed.\nHe then returned to the car to say he had tied up the house's occupants and sent Krenwinkel and Van Houten into the house.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nKrenwinkel and Van Houten took Rosemary LaBianca to her bedroom as Watson murdered Leno LaBianca in the den. Rosemary LaBianca was then murdered in her room, primarily by Krenwinkel and Watson, with additional (and possibly postmortem) wounds inflicted in her back by Van Houten. Both victims were stabbed numerous times and the word \"WAR\" was carved into Leno LaBianca's stomach; a fork was also left protruding from his stomach. Using blood from the victims, \"Rise\" and \"Death to Pigs\" were written on the walls, and a misspelled \"Healter Skelter\" was written on the refrigerator door.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Conviction===\nOn October 2, 1969, Watson fled the [[Spahn Ranch]] and headed back to his native state of Texas. On November 30, 1969, Watson was arrested in Texas for the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders. He and his lawyers fought extradition to California for nine months. Upon arriving in California, Watson stopped talking and eating, losing 55 pounds, and began regressing to a catatonic state. He was admitted to [[Atascadero State Hospital]] for a 90\u2011day evaluation period to determine if he was fit to stand trial.

Using free airline tickets to travel, he visited a fraternity brother in Los Angeles; there he became interested in the psychedelic and music lifestyle of the late 1960s. Soon Watson met some women who were in the [[Manson Family]] and then met [[Charles Manson]]. Watson decided to join the [[Manson Family]] shortly afterwards.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nOn August 9, 1969, as a member of the Manson Family, Watson accompanied [[Susan Atkins]], [[Linda Kasabian]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] to the large estate on Cielo Drive in Hollywood leased by movie director [[Roman Polanski]] and his wife, actress [[Sharon Tate]], who was eight months pregnant. Polanski was in London working on a film. Present in the house were Tate and her friends: hairdresser [[Jay Sebring]], writer [[Tate murders|Wojciech Frykowski]], and Folger's coffee heiress [[Tate murders|Abigail Folger]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nWatson, who had been to the [[10050 Cielo Drive]] address on at least one previous occasion, climbed a telephone pole near the security gate and cut the house phone line. The entire Manson group then climbed over the fence. When a car from the guest house approached, driven by an 18\u2011year\u2011old named [[Tate murders#Murders|Steven Parent]], Watson ignored his pleas for mercy and shot Parent four times in the chest and abdomen at point-blank range.<ref name=\"cielodrive.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/charles-manson-parole-hearing-2012.php|title=Parole Hearing: Charles Manson 2012|website=www.cielodrive.com}}</ref><ref name=\"cielodrive.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/charles-tex-watson-parole-hearing-1978.php|title=Charles \"Tex\" Watson 1978 Parole Hearing Transcript|website=www.cielodrive.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter pushing Parent's car further up the driveway and traversing the front lawn, Watson cut the screen of a window and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door.<ref name=\"cielodrive.com1\"/> At Watson's direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants and with Krenwinkel brought them to the living room. Watson tied Tate and Sebring together at the neck with rope and slung it up over a beam. Sebring started to resist and Watson shot him. After Watson shot Sebring and took $72 from Folger's purse,<ref>http://www.cielodrive.com/susan-atkins-grand-jury-testimony.php</ref> Folger and Frykowski bolted from the house, but they were chased outside, and after being stabbed further, died on the front lawn. Watson and his crime partners inflicted 28 stab wounds to Folger alone.<ref name=\"cielodrive.com\"/> Tate, Sebring, and Frykowski all suffered numerous stab wounds. Sebring and Frykowski were also shot.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== LaBianca murders ===\n\nThe murders were preceded by telling the victims they were going to die, which prompted the escape attempts by Frykowski and Folger and caused things to get out of hand. The next night, Charles Manson (who was displeased by their performance and pledged to show them \"how to do it\") drove six \"Manson Family\" members, [[Leslie Van Houten]], [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]], and the four from the previous night into Los Angeles. \n\nIn March 1968, Manson and other Family members had attended a party at the rented home of Harold True in Los Feliz, located at 3267 Waverly Drive. Manson did not want to kill True because he thought it could be traced back to him, so he settled for the house next door where [[Leno LaBianca|Leno]] and [[Rosemary LaBianca]] lived. After driving their car up and down the street, and waiting, Manson and Watson got out of the car, disappeared walking up the driveway and entered the home together. According to Watson's book ''Will You Die For Me?'',<ref name=DieForMe>{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Charles |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Ray |url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/main/books/will-you-die-for-me |title=Will You Die For Me? |date=1978 |accessdate=2019-07-13}}</ref> Manson held the occupants at gunpoint while Watson tied them up. Rather than revealing their fate, Manson assured them that it was just a robbery and that they wouldn't be harmed.\nHe then returned to the car to say he had tied up the house's occupants and sent Krenwinkel and Van Houten into the house.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nKrenwinkel and Van Houten took Rosemary LaBianca to her bedroom as Watson murdered Leno LaBianca in the den. Rosemary LaBianca was then murdered in her room, primarily by Krenwinkel and Watson, with additional (and possibly postmortem) wounds inflicted in her back by Van Houten. Both victims were stabbed numerous times and the word \"WAR\" was carved into Leno LaBianca's stomach; a fork was also left protruding from his stomach. Using blood from the victims, \"Rise\" and \"Death to Pigs\" were written on the walls, and a misspelled \"Healter Skelter\" was written on the refrigerator door.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Conviction===\nOn October 2, 1969, Watson fled the [[Spahn Ranch]] and headed back to his native state of Texas. On November 30, 1969, Watson was arrested in Texas for the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders. He and his lawyers fought extradition to California for nine months. Upon arriving in California, Watson stopped talking and eating, losing 55 pounds, and began regressing to a catatonic state. He was admitted to [[Atascadero State Hospital]] for a 90\u2011day evaluation period to determine if he was fit to stand trial. Watson stayed there until February 1971, when he was deemed able to stand trial.<ref name=\"Bugliosi1994\"/>{{rp|514\u2013515}}\n\nOn October 12, 1971, Watson was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder.<ref name=\"cielodrive.com1\"/> One week later, the same jury took only two and a half hours to determine that he was sane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/main/books/will-you-die-for-me|title=Will You Die For Me, pg 96|last=Watson|first=Charles|date=|website=Abounding Love Ministries|access-date=July 13, 2019}}</ref> On October 21, 1971, Watson was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]].

After 24 years of marriage, Svege divorced Watson after meeting another man in 2003. Svege and Watson remain friends.
