The design makes use of proven components, such as the L7 gun of the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], the [[Leyland L60]] multi-fuel engine, the transmission and fire control system of the [[Chieftain tank|Chieftain]]. Many tanks were also built by India under licence as the [[Vijayanta]].\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Vickers MBT followed on from a 24-tonne [[Ordnance QF 20-pounder|20-pdr]] gunned tank design intended for export.<ref name=\"Ogorkiewicz, R M 1973\">Ogorkiewicz, R M (1973). ''Vickers Battle Tank'', Profile Publications, August 1973.</ref> This would be as well equipped as a [[Centurion tank|Centurion]] but substantially cheaper and with [[Vickers Vigilant]] missiles as effective. However, with the appearance of the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105&nbsp;mm L7]] gun into the British, US and German tank designs, this light tank would have been less powerful while too large for the reconnaissance role, and so a new design was required. With armour twice that of the light tank design, it would still be 12 tonnes lighter than Centurion and hence more mobile. The design would use the new engine and transmission of the Chieftain tank then being developed. The development coincided with an agreement with India in 1961 to produce a tank design and help set up a factory there to produce it.\n\nThe Vickers MBT Mk 1 was designed to be a simple, low-cost, but effective tank.<ref name=TGelbart108>{{Cite book|last=Gelbart |first=Marsh |title=Tanks main battle and light tanks |year=1996 |publisher=Brassey\u2019s UK Ltd |isbn=1-85753-168-X |page=108}}</ref> The first prototype was completed in 1963.<ref name=TGelbart108 /> In 1964, one of the prototypes was sent to India.\n\nThe Vickers was made of welded [[rolled homogeneous armour]] plates. It weighed 38,600&nbsp;kg, carried a 105&nbsp;mm gun with 44 rounds and had a top speed of 48&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=TGelbart108 /> 70 tanks were sold to [[Kuwait]] and many of a modified version were made in India where the tank was called [[Vijayanta]].<ref name=TGelbart108 />\n\n==Versions==\n\n===Vickers Main Battle Tank  Mark 2===\n\nThe 1968 proposal for a vehicle specification that differed from the Mark 1 in the following respects:\n#Transistorised gun-control equipment.\n#New turret of cast front and mantlet-less design, with new gun mounting.\n#Improved frontal aspect to the hull and turret.\n#Improved track, suitable for {{convert|56|km/h|abbr=on}} continuously.\n#Reduced ground pressure due to reduced total weight, increased track width and increased track on the ground by moving two (or three) rear wheel stations backwards (made possible by the change to a General Motors engine).\n#Engine delivering full horsepower as for the Chieftain through redesigned final drives to give 56+&nbsp;km/h (made possible by the General Motors engine's potential for uprating).\n#Improved commander cupola to take the Chieftain vision devices.\n#Provision for fitting four [[Swingfire]] wire-controlled anti-tank missiles (intended as a response to weapons of greater range, such as the 120&nbsp;mm L11 tank gun.\n\nThe Mark 2 did not proceed beyond a mock-up although a Vickers Mark 1 MBT with four Swingfire missiles, two mounted either side of the turret towards the rear, was shown at [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough]]. A note in Vickers's files dated from 20 November 1970 explains the probable reason:\n\n\"Guided missiles have an inherent disadvantage in that is almost impossible to fire them from under armour since the rocket motor efflux presents a serious problem. Generally speaking, the best that can be achieved is to put the crew under armour and mount the missiles externally. This presents reloading problems and leaves the missiles vulnerable to small arms and mortar fire.\"\n\nIn any case, only four spare missile rounds could be carried.<ref name=\"Patrick Stephens Limited\">{{cite book |last1=Foss |first1=Christopher F. |last2=McKenzie |first2=Peter |title=The Vickers Tanks: From Landship to Challenger |date=1988 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |isbn=9781852601416 |page=256}}</ref>\n\n===Vickers Main Battle Tank  Mark 3===\n\nThe Mk. 3 retains most of the proposed features of the Mk. 2. Others were the provision for infrared/white-light searchlights and the abandonment of flotation gear. A laser rangefinder of the type being fitted to the Chieftain was also proposed since the range of the L7A1 105&nbsp;mm gun was well beyond that of the 12.7&nbsp;mm ranging machine gun fitted. Some thought was also given the idea of mounting the heavier British L11 120&nbsp;mm gun on the Vickers tank, but this was abandoned because the 105&nbsp;mm L7-series rifled gun was becoming the NATO standard, 120&nbsp;mm ammunition was more expensive than 105&nbsp;mm and was used only by the British Army in Europe, and the weight advantage of the Vicker's tank would be reduced.\n\nThe Mark 3 differs from the Mark 1 mainly in having a turret with well-shaped cast front welded to a fabricated armour plate body. It also has a cast gun mantlet which is better shaped from the point of view of its resistance to armour-piercing  projectiles than the flat mantlet of the Mark. 1.<ref>{{Cite book|title=AFV Weapons Profile|last=Ogorkiewicz |first=R.

This was not used on the Mk. 1 supplied to India (''Vijayanta'') in order to keep the overall height of the tank within a fixed limit. The cupola of the Mk. 3 has 360 degree hand traverse and is fitted with one sight periscope with a magnification of \u00d71 and \u00d710, and six periscopes for all-around observation.

Matchmakers are rushing to the rescue. They try to reconcile their children, but everyone does it in their own way, as a result of which matchmakers do not just quarrel with children, but also bring the family to the brink of divorce. Only the alliance of the matchmakers can save their marriage. Masha gives birth to twins.\n\n=== ''Svaty 3'' (2009) ===\nSeveral months have passed since the events of the second part. Summer begins. Masha and Maxim leave for the [[Netherlands]], and Zhenya is left in the village of Kuchugury under the supervision of Budko. The Kovalevs come to them to help look after their granddaughter and at the same time prepare her for entering the Lyceum.\n\nSince that moment, no less important character appears in the story \u2014 friend, cousin, neighbor and drinking buddy of Ivan Budko \u2014 Dmitry Bukhankin, who is called Mitya. In this season matchmakers begin to get along. Together they have to lead a healthy lifestyle: do not drink, do not smoke and do not eat after 18:00. Ivan is fired from his job, but soon he returns to the bakery and becomes the manager of the garage.\n\n=== ''Svaty 4'' (2010) ===\nThe action takes place one year after the events of the third season, and again in the summer. The matchmakers leave for Turkey to visit their children and grandchildren. Zhenya's parents send her to the children's camp \"[[Artek (camp)|Artek]]\". The grandparents go to [[Crimea]], not so much to rest as to take care of their beloved granddaughter Zhenya. Matchmakers never learn to live without a granddaughter; it is difficult for them to get along with each other. By happy circumstance they get a house, which they turn into a hotel, in order to show their gratitude for finding temporary housing all the money they have earned to Masha and Maxim. Olga and Yuri try to hide from all their divorce, but soon everyone learns about it, including Olga's parents.\n\n=== ''Novogodniye Svaty'' (2010) ===\nThe main characters Ivan and Valentina decide to celebrate [[New Year]] very modestly, without Christmas trees and festive delicacies, in the native village of Kuchugury. But, their city matchmakers come \u2014 Yuri and Olga Kovalev with Zhenya, their granddaughter. And the celebrities who are going to corporate parties become stuck in the village because of heavy snowfall and drifts on the roads. The hotel does not have enough space, and matchmakers, experienced in this business, offer their services.\n\n=== ''Svaty 5'' (2011) ===\nSince the last events eight years have passed. The young Kovalevs \u2014 Maxim and Masha \u2014 all this time have lived in the Netherlands. But now they decide to return to their homeland. The grandparents (Yuri Anatolyevich Kovalev died three years ago before the events of the film from a heart attack) look forward to meeting with their grandchildren, but none of them expected to see a cheerful, fervent and sweet little Zhenechka in a new goth style with a bunch of problems and conflicts. But this is only part of the trouble for the matchmakers. After all, there are also twins \u2014 Nikita and Vika, who turn out to be so modern and prudent that the black clothes and \"black\" humor of their older sister will be insignificant in comparison with their antics. For the whole summer, the three grandchildren get into the society of the spouses Budko and Olga Kovaleva. Alexander Berkovich tries to win Olga's heart, and over time he succeeds. Zhenya finds a girlfriend who steals her boyfriend. Valentine has learned to drive a car and organized a food business, which she leads with Larissa and Evgeny Zhuk.\n\n=== ''Svaty 6'' (2012) ===\nThe story takes place six months after the events described in ''Svaty 5''. In season 6, the plot covers almost the entire year, from March until the New Year. During this time in the life of the main characters a lot happens. The grandparents continue to re-educate the negligent twins and help solve problems to Genet. Olga Nikolaevna and Alexander Berkovich officially formulate their relations and marry. Ivan Budko takes up business, saves the country from bureaucracy, goes to work, is poisoned with mushrooms and celebrates an anniversary. Zhenya finishes school, goes to college and meets her love. Larissa gives birth to a girl, and Mitya becomes a father for the third time (he already has two sons, an adult son Andrei from his first marriage, who lives separately, and a young Artem, their son and Larissa). The Budko family remains without a roof over their heads, and the mother-in-law comes to Bukhankin. Matchmakers go to Euro-2012, a cruise along the Volga, a hike and the Carpathians, where they celebrate the New Year.\n\n==Production==\nIn 2008, a two-part TV movie ''Svaty'' was shot in Kiev.

films and serials ''Svaty'' ==\n\n=== ''Svaty'' (2008) ===\nThe young spouses Masha and Maxim Kovalev decide to go to Italy for a vacation and leave their five-year-old daughter Zhenya under the supervision of their parents, but they say they are too busy and refuse. As a result of confusion, both Masha's and Maxim's parents come to watch their granddaughter. Coming from absolutely opposite social sphere (Masha's parents \u2014 Valentina and Ivan Budko \u2014 are ordinary villagers, and Maxim's parents \u2014 Olga and Yuri Kovalyov \u2014 typical urban intellectuals with subtle manners), it turns out that they cannot stand each other. The four of them are in the same house, and they have a conflict of interests. Everyone has their own methods of upbringing. The battle for the attention of the granddaughter commences. The city-dwellers limit her in everything, and the rural couple allow many things. Matchmakers constantly fall into ridiculous situations, the way out of which they have to find together, which brings them closer. By the end, they nevertheless make peace with Zhenya's help.\n\n=== ''Svaty 2'' (2009) ===\nThe story takes place on the eve of March 8. Masha is in the last month of pregnancy. She and Maxim have a crisis in their relationship, and their six-year-old daughter Zhenya begins to interfere. The girl finds an original solution \u2014 she calls her grandparents. Matchmakers are rushing to the rescue. They try to reconcile their children, but everyone does it in their own way, as a result of which matchmakers do not just quarrel with children, but also bring the family to the brink of divorce. Only the alliance of the matchmakers can save their marriage. Masha gives birth to twins.\n\n=== ''Svaty 3'' (2009) ===\nSeveral months have passed since the events of the second part. Summer begins. Masha and Maxim leave for the [[Netherlands]], and Zhenya is left in the village of Kuchugury under the supervision of Budko. The Kovalevs come to them to help look after their granddaughter and at the same time prepare her for entering the Lyceum.\n\nSince that moment, no less important character appears in the story \u2014 friend, cousin, neighbor and drinking buddy of Ivan Budko \u2014 Dmitry Bukhankin, who is called Mitya. In this season matchmakers begin to get along. Together they have to lead a healthy lifestyle: do not drink, do not smoke and do not eat after 18:00. Ivan is fired from his job, but soon he returns to the bakery and becomes the manager of the garage.\n\n=== ''Svaty 4'' (2010) ===\nThe action takes place one year after the events of the third season, and again in the summer. The matchmakers leave for Turkey to visit their children and grandchildren. Zhenya's parents send her to the children's camp \"[[Artek (camp)|Artek]]\". The grandparents go to [[Crimea]], not so much to rest as to take care of their beloved granddaughter Zhenya. Matchmakers never learn to live without a granddaughter; it is difficult for them to get along with each other. By happy circumstance they get a house, which they turn into a hotel, in order to show their gratitude for finding temporary housing all the money they have earned to Masha and Maxim. Olga and Yuri try to hide from all their divorce, but soon everyone learns about it, including Olga's parents.\n\n=== ''Novogodniye Svaty'' (2010) ===\nThe main characters Ivan and Valentina decide to celebrate [[New Year]] very modestly, without Christmas trees and festive delicacies, in the native village of Kuchugury. But, their city matchmakers come \u2014 Yuri and Olga Kovalev with Zhenya, their granddaughter. And the celebrities who are going to corporate parties become stuck in the village because of heavy snowfall and drifts on the roads. The hotel does not have enough space, and matchmakers, experienced in this business, offer their services.\n\n=== ''Svaty 5'' (2011) ===\nSince the last events eight years have passed. The young Kovalevs \u2014 Maxim and Masha \u2014 all this time have lived in the Netherlands. But now they decide to return to their homeland. The grandparents (Yuri Anatolyevich Kovalev died three years ago before the events of the film from a heart attack) look forward to meeting with their grandchildren, but none of them expected to see a cheerful, fervent and sweet little Zhenechka in a new goth style with a bunch of problems and conflicts. But this is only part of the trouble for the matchmakers. After all, there are also twins \u2014 Nikita and Vika, who turn out to be so modern and prudent that the black clothes and \"black\" humor of their older sister will be insignificant in comparison with their antics. For the whole summer, the three grandchildren get into the society of the spouses Budko and Olga Kovaleva. Alexander Berkovich tries to win Olga's heart, and over time he succeeds. Zhenya finds a girlfriend who steals her boyfriend. Valentine has learned to drive a car and organized a food business, which she leads with Larissa and Evgeny Zhuk.\n\n=== ''Svaty 6'' (2012) ===\nThe story takes place six months after the events described in ''Svaty 5''. In season 6, the plot covers almost the entire year, from March until the New Year. During this time in the life of the main characters a lot happens. The grandparents continue to re-educate the negligent twins and help solve problems to Genet. Olga Nikolaevna and Alexander Berkovich officially formulate their relations and marry. Ivan Budko takes up business, saves the country from bureaucracy, goes to work, is poisoned with mushrooms and celebrates an anniversary. Zhenya finishes school, goes to college and meets her love. Larissa gives birth to a girl, and Mitya becomes a father for the third time (he already has two sons, an adult son Andrei from his first marriage, who lives separately, and a young Artem, their son and Larissa). The Budko family remains without a roof over their heads, and the mother-in-law comes to Bukhankin. Matchmakers go to Euro-2012, a cruise along the Volga, a hike and the Carpathians, where they celebrate the New Year.\n\n==Production==\nIn 2008, a two-part TV movie ''Svaty'' was shot in Kiev. The project was not originally intended to continue, but after its success on television, it was extended for the second season (which was also filmed in a telefilm format), and then for subsequent seasons (shot in mini-series).\n\n''Svaty 6'' was to be the final season.<ref>[http://www.vokrug.tv/article/show/Svaty-6_stanut_poslednimi_36579/ \u00ab\u0421\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b-6\u00bb \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438] 8 December 2012</ref><ref>[http://kp.ua/kptv/386530-anna-koshmal-rasskazala-budet-ly-prodolzhenye-svatov \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0448\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0430, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u00ab\u0421\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u00bb] // [[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430]], 28 March 2013</ref> However, later the creators of the series said that it was possible to continue the series until the seventh season.<ref>[http://www.vokrug.tv/article/show/Svaty_-_6_sedmoi_sezon_budet_39792/ \u00ab\u0421\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b-6\u00bb: \u0441\u0435\u0434\u044c\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442] 25 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2013</ref> Shooting of ''Svaty 7'' was to begin in 2014, but because of the political situation in Ukraine it was postponed.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waJE7Bug1O8 \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u0440\u043e \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0438 \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c]</ref> In May 2015, [[Volodymyr Zelensky|Vladimir Zelensky]] said that the scenario of the seventh season had already been written, but the shooting was still postponed.

{"title_page": "History of the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{US Constitution article series}}{{United States constitutional law}}\n[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Page one of the original copy of the [[United States Constitution]]]]\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] has served as the supreme law of the United States since taking effect in 1789. The document was written at the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]] and was ratified through a series of state conventions held in 1787 and 1788. Since 1789, the Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; particularly important amendments include the ten amendments of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]].ertyuicdfvgh\neq\nThe Constitution grew out of efforts to reform the [[Articles of Confederation]], an earlier constitution which provided for a loose alliance of states with a weak central government. From May 1787 through September 1787, delegates from twelve of the thirteen states convened in Philadelphia, where they wrote a new constitution. Two alternative plans were developed at the convention. The nationalist majority, soon to be called \"Federalists,\" put forth the [[Virginia Plan]], a consolidated government based on proportional representation among the states by population. The \"old patriots,\" later called \"[[Anti-Federalist]]s,\" advocated the [[New Jersey Plan]], a purely federal proposal, based on providing each state with equal representation. The [[Connecticut Compromise]] allowed for both plans to work together. Other controversies developed regarding slavery and a Bill of Rights in the original document.\n\nThe drafted Constitution was submitted to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in September 1787; that same month it approved the forwarding of the Constitution as drafted to the states, each of which would hold a ratification convention. ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', published while the states were debating ratification, provided background and justification for the Constitution. Some states agreed to ratify the Constitution only if the amendments that were to become the Bill of Rights would be taken up immediately by the new government. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation certified that eleven states had ratified the new Constitution, and directed that elections be held. The new government began on March 4, 1789, assembled in New York City, and the government authorized by the Articles of Confederation dissolved itself.\n\nIn 1791, the states ratified the Bill of Rights, which established protections for various civil liberties. The Bill of Rights initially only applied to the federal government, but following a process of [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] most protections of the Bill of Rights now apply to state governments. Further amendments to the Constitution have addressed federal relationships, election procedures, terms of office, expanding the electorate, financing the federal government, consumption of alcohol, and congressional pay. Between 1865 and 1870, the states ratified the Reconstruction Amendments, which abolished [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], guaranteed equal protection of the law, and implemented prohibitions on the restriction of voter rights. The meaning of the Constitution is interpreted by [[judicial review]] in the federal courts. The original parchment copies are on display at the [[National Archives Building]].\n\n==Background: revolution and early governance==\n\n===Declaration of Independence===\n{{Main|United States Declaration of Independence}}\nOn June 4, 1776, [[Lee Resolution|a resolution]] was introduced in the [[Second Continental Congress]] declaring the union with Great Britain to be dissolved, proposing the formation of foreign alliances, and suggesting the drafting of a plan of confederation to be submitted to the respective states. Independence was declared on July 4, 1776; the preparation of a plan of confederation was postponed. Although the Declaration was a statement of principles, it did not create a government or even a framework for how politics would be carried out. It was the [[Articles of Confederation]] that provided the necessary structure to the new nation during and after the [[American Revolution]]. The Declaration, however, did set forth the ideas of [[natural rights]] and the [[social contract]] that would help form the foundation of constitutional government.\n\nThe era of the Declaration of Independence is sometimes called the \"Continental Congress\" period. [[John Adams]] famously estimated as many as one-third of those resident in the original thirteen colonies were patriots. Scholars such as [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] describe how Americans were caught up in the Revolutionary fervor and excitement of creating governments, societies, a new nation on the face of the earth by rational choice as Thomas Paine declared in [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]].\n\nRepublican government and personal liberty for \"the people\" were to overspread the New World continents and to last forever, a gift to posterity.  These goals were influenced by [[Enlightenment philosophy]]. The adherents to this cause seized on English [[Whiggism|Whig political philosophy]] as described by historian [[Forrest McDonald]] as justification for most of their changes to received colonial charters and traditions. It was rooted in opposition to monarchy they saw as venal and corrupting to the \"permanent interests of the people.\"\n\nTo these partisans, voting was the only permanent defense of the people. Elected terms for legislature were cut to one year, for Virginia's Governor, one year without re-election. Property requirements for [[suffrage]] for men were reduced to taxes on their tools in some states. Free blacks in New York could vote if they owned enough property. New Hampshire was thinking of abolishing all voting requirements for men except residency and religion. New Jersey let women vote. In some states, senators were now elected by the same voters as the larger electorate for the House, and even judges were elected to one-year terms.\n\nThese \"[[radical Whigs]]\" were called the people \"out-of-doors.\" They distrusted not only royal authority, but any small, secretive group as being unrepublican. Crowds of men and women massed at the steps of rural Court Houses during market-militia-court days. [[Shays Rebellion]] (1786\u201387) is a famous example. Urban riots began by the out-of-doors rallies on the steps of an oppressive government official with speakers such as members of the [[Sons of Liberty]] holding forth in the \"people's \"committees\" until some action was decided upon, including hanging his effigy outside a bedroom window, or looting and burning down the offending tyrant's home.\n\n=== First and Second Continental Congresses ===\nThe [[First Continental Congress]] met from September 5 to October 26, 1774. It agreed that the states should impose an economic boycott on British trade, and drew up a petition to [[King George III]] of England, pleading for redress of their grievances and repeal of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. It did not propose independence or a separate government for the states.\n\nThe [[Second Continental Congress]] convened on May 10, 1775, and functioned as a ''de facto'' national government at the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Beginning in 1777, the substantial powers assumed by Congress \"made the league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history\".<ref>Wood, Gordon S., \"The Creation of the American Republic, 1776\u20131787\" (1972) {{ISBN|978-0-807-84723-7}}, p. 359.</ref> The process created the United States \"by the people in collectivity, rather than by the individual states\", because only four states had constitutions at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and three of those were provisional.\n\nThe Supreme Court in [[Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators]] (1795), and again in [[Ware v. Hylton]] (1796), ruled on the federal government's powers prior to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1788. It said that Congress exercised powers derived from the people, expressly conferred through the medium of state conventions or legislatures, and, once exercised, those powers were \"impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people\".<ref>Morris, Richard B., American Historical Association [http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/presidential-addresses/richard-b-morris Presidential Address] AHA December 28, 1976. Viewed June 8, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Confederation Period===\n{{Main|Confederation Period}}\nThe [[Articles of Confederation]] was approved by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and sent to the states for [[ratification]]. It came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states.  Over the previous four years it had been used by Congress as a \"working document\" to administer the early United States government and win the Revolutionary War. and secure\n\nLasting successes under the Articles of Confederation included the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] with Great Britain and the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], whereby Congress promised settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains full citizenship and eventual statehood.<ref>Morris (1987) ch. 3\u20134.</ref> Some historians characterize this period from 1781 to 1789 as weakness, dissension, and turmoil.<ref>Morris (1987); Nevins (1924)</ref> Other scholars view the evidence as reflecting an underlying stability and prosperity.<ref>Jensen (1950)</ref> But the returning of prosperity in some areas did not slow the growth of domestic and foreign problems.  Nationalists saw the confederation's central government as not strong enough to establish a sound financial system, regulate trade, enforce treaties, or go to war when needed.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\">Morris (1987)</ref>\n\nThe [[Congress of the Confederation]], as defined in the Articles of Confederation, was the sole organ of the national government; there was no national court to interpret laws nor an executive branch to enforce them. Governmental functions, including declarations of war and calls for an army, were voluntarily supported by each state, in full, partly, or not at all.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\" />\n\nThe newly independent states, separated from Britain, no longer received [[Navigation Acts|favored treatment]] at British ports. The British refused to negotiate a commercial treaty in 1785 because the individual American states would not be bound by it. Congress could not act directly upon the States nor upon individuals. It had no authority to regulate foreign or interstate commerce. Every act of government was left to the individual States. Each state levied taxes and tariffs on other states at will, which invited retaliation. Congress could vote itself mediator and judge in state disputes, but states did not have to accept its decisions.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\" />\n\nThe weak central government could not back its policies with military strength, embarrassing it in foreign affairs. The British refused to withdraw their troops from the forts and trading posts in the new nation's [[Northwest Territory]], as they had agreed to do in the [[Treaty of Paris of 1783]]. British officers on the northern boundaries and Spanish officers to the south supplied arms to Native American tribes, allowing them to attack American settlers. The Spanish refused to allow western American farmers to use their port of New Orleans to ship produce.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\"/>\n\nRevenues were requisitioned by Congressional petition to each state.  None paid what they were asked; sometimes some paid nothing. Congress appealed to the thirteen states for an amendment to the Articles to tax enough to pay the public debt as principal came due. Twelve states agreed, Rhode Island did not, so it failed.<ref>Jensen, Merrill; ''The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781\u20131789'' (1950). When Congress could borrow no more money, it sold western lands. This revenue source would grow to provide the Early Republic with half of its annual expenditures, freeing the states of national tax burdens.</ref> The Articles required super majorities. Amendment proposals to states required ratification by all thirteen states, all important legislation needed 70% approval, at least nine states. Repeatedly, one or two states defeated legislative proposals of major importance.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\"/>\n\nWithout taxes the government could not pay its debt. Seven of the thirteen states printed large quantities of its own paper money, backed by gold, land, or nothing, so there was no fair exchange rate among them. State courts required state creditors to accept payments at face value with a fraction of real purchase power. The same legislation that these states used to wipe out the Revolutionary debt to patriots was used to pay off promised veteran pensions. The measures were popular because they helped both small farmers and plantation owners pay off their debts.<ref>E. James Ferguson, ''The Power of The Purse: A History of American Public Finance, 1776\u20131790'' (1961)</ref>\n\nThe Massachusetts legislature was one of the five against paper money. It imposed a tightly limited currency and high taxes. Without paper money veterans without cash lost their farms for back taxes. This triggered [[Shays Rebellion]] to stop tax collectors and close the courts.  Troops quickly suppressed the rebellion, but nationalists like George Washington warned, \"There are combustibles in every state which a spark might set fire to.\" <ref>Flexner, James Thomas, ''George Washington and the New Nation: 1783\u20131793'' (1970) 3:100</ref>\n\n==Prelude to the Constitutional Convention==\n\n=== Mount Vernon Conference ===\n{{Main|Mount Vernon Conference}}\nAn important milestone in interstate cooperation outside the framework of the Articles of Confederation occurred in March 1785, when delegates representing [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] met in Virginia, to address navigational [[Riparian water rights|rights]] in the states's common waterways.<ref name=\"GWMV\">{{cite web|title=Mount Vernon Conference|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/mount-vernon-conference/|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>{{refn|group = lower-alpha |Historians following [[Charles A.

Seven amendments to the Articles of Confederation were proposed. Under these reforms, Congress would gain \"sole and exclusive\" power to regulate trade. States could not favor foreigners over citizens. Tax bills would require 70% vote, public debt 85%, not 100%. Congress could charge states a late payment penalty fee. A state withholding troops would be charged for them, plus a penalty. If a state did not pay, Congress could collect directly from its cities and counties.

Yet the proposed Constitution as reported from the Convention was an \"innovation\", the most dismissive epithet a politician could use to condemn any new proposal. It promised a fundamental change from the old confederation into a new, consolidated yet federal government. The accepted secrecy of usual affairs conducted in regular order did not apply. It became a major issue in the very public debates leading up to the crowd-filled ratification conventions.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Both the British House of Commons and their North American colonial assemblies were secret.

But as the Convention went on, individual delegate coming and going meant that a state's vote could change with the change of delegation composition.

State delegations absented themselves at votes different times of day. There was no minimum for a state delegation; one would do. Daily sessions would have thirty members present. Members came and went on public and personal business. The Congress of the Confederation was meeting at the same time, so members would absent themselves to New York City on Congressional business for days and weeks at a time.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=15, 24}}\n\nBut the work before them was continuous, even if attendance was not. The Convention resolved itself into a \"Committee of the Whole\", and could remain so for days. It was informal, votes could be taken and retaken easily, positions could change without prejudice, and importantly, no formal [[quorum call]] was required. The nationalists were resolute. As Madison put it, the situation was too serious for despair.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=15, 19\u201320, 54}} They used the same State House, later named [[Independence Hall]], as the Declaration signers.

The state legislatures of the day used these occasions to say why they were sending representatives abroad. New York thus publicly enjoined its members to pursue all possible \"alterations and provisions\" for good government and \"preservation of the Union\". New Hampshire called for \"timely measures to enlarge the powers of Congress\".

It was weighted toward the interests of the larger, more populous states. The intent was to meet the purposes set out in the Articles of Confederation, \"common defense, security of liberty and general welfare\". The Virginia Plan was national, authority flowed from the people.

Both factions were intent on forging a nation in which both could be full participants in the changes which were sure to come, since that was most likely to allow for their national union, guarantee liberty for their posterity, and promote their mutual long-term material prosperity.\n\n====Slavery in debate====\n{{Main|Slavery in the United States}}\nThe contentious issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was too controversial to be resolved during the Convention. But it was at center stage in the Convention three times, June 7 regarding who would vote for Congress, June 11 in debate over how to proportion relative seating in the 'house', and August 22 relating to commerce and the future wealth of the nation.\n\nOnce the Convention looked at how to proportion the House representation, tempers among several delegates exploded over slavery. When the Convention progressed beyond the personal attacks, it adopted the existing \"federal ratio\" for taxing states by three-fifths of slaves held.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=95}}\n\nOn August 6, the Committee of Detail reported its proposed revisions to the Randolph Plan. Again the question of slavery came up, and again the question was met with attacks of outrage. Over the next two weeks, delegates wove a web of mutual compromises relating to commerce and trade, east and west, slave-holding and free. The transfer of power to regulate slave trade from states to central government could happen in 20 years, but only then.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|The Constitution sets up a bicameral legislature which enacts law only if there are national majorities both among (a) the states in the 'senate' and (b) the people in the 'house'. At the time the Constitution was ratified, it balanced states equally relative to slavery in the Senate. There were six states north of Pennsylvania, and six states south of it. Pennsylvania, the \"keystone\" state, split Senators one-one at first. After Pennsylvania abolished slavery, the next state to enter the Union in 1792 was Kentucky, which was admitted with slavery. That action maintained a \"sectional equality\" between free-soil states and slave-holding states, 7\u20137. Then in 1850, California was admitted as a free state, then Minnesota, Oregon and Kansas followed as free states before outbreak of the Civil War. The Constitution's House of Representatives began nearly equal, but the decennial census reallocated power away from declining slave-economies and towards the places which supported more people. Over time, ten years at a time, under the Constitution, the state antecedents, wealth, commerce and militias matter less than the numbers of people it can sustain in its domestic economy.}} Later generations could try out their own answers. The delegates were trying to make a government that might last that long.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=197\u2013204}}\n\nMigration of the free or \"importation\" of indentures and slaves could continue by states, defining slaves as persons, not property. Long-term power would change by population as counted every ten years. Apportionment in the House would not be by wealth, it would be by people, the free citizens and three-fifths the number of other persons meaning propertyless slaves and taxed Indian farming families.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Section 2 of Article I provides in part: \"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states ... by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.\" State population for U.S. representation or taxes was to exclude all numbers of untaxed Native-Americans.\u2014\"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states ... by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.}}\n\nIn 1806, President Thomas Jefferson sent a message to the 9th Congress on their constitutional opportunity to remove U.S. citizens from the transatlantic slave trade \"[violating] human rights\".<ref>Annals of Congress, [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=016/llac016.db&recNum=118 \"House of Representatives, 9th Congress, 2nd Session\"], History of Congress, \"Importation of Slaves\" pp. 241\u201342.

Still, the Constitution \"as written\" was an improvement over the Articles from an abolitionist point of view. The Constitution provided for abolition of the slave trade but the Articles did not. The outcome could be determined gradually over time.{{sfn|Maier|2010|pp=201, 284}} Sometimes contradictions among opponents were used to try to gain abolitionist converts. In Virginia, Federalist George Nicholas dismissed fears on both sides. Objections to the Constitution were inconsistent, \"At the same moment it is opposed for being promotive and destructive of slavery!\" {{sfn|Maier|2010|p=284}} But the contradiction was never resolved peaceably, and the failure to do so contributed to the Civil War.<ref>See ''South Carolina Declaration of Causes of Secession'' (December 24, 1860), reprinted in Richard Hofstadter, ''Great Issues in American History''.

Although awkward, vulgar and laughable to more polished colleagues, he was an honest political broker. The most frequent speakers on the Convention floor were Madison, Wilson, G.

It was like the proposal he made in the 1776 Continental Congress. Representation in Congress should be both by states and by population. There, he was voted down by the small states in favor of all states equal, one vote only.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=93\u201394}} Now in 1787 Convention, he wanted to balance all the big-state victories for population apportionment.

Supporters explained that it \"sustained the sovereignty of the states\", while the Edmund Randolph (VA) \"Virginia Plan\" erased it. The Convention had no authority to propose anything not sent up from state legislatures, and the states were not likely to adopt anything new. The \"nationalists\" answered, The Convention could not conclude anything, but it could recommend anything.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=107}}\n\n\"Patriots\" said if their legislature knew anything about proposals for consolidated government, it would not have sent anyone. \"Nationalists\" countered, that it would be treason to withhold any proposal for good government when the salvation of the American republic was at stake.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=107}} Three sessions after its introduction, the New Jersey Plan failed : 7 against, 3 for, 1 divided.<ref>Farrand, op.cit., Vol. I. p. 322 Madison, Mr. King's motion June 19.</ref> For nearly a month there was no progress; small states were seriously thinking of walking out of the Convention.{{refn| group = lower-alpha |Yates and Lansing (NY) would walk out July 10.

In the \"senate\", the states should have equal representation. Advocates said that it could not be agreed to, the union would fall apart somehow.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=129\u201330}} Big states would not be trusted, the small states could confederate with a foreign power showing \"more good faith\".

This time a vote was taken, but it stalled again, tied at 5 yes, 5 no, 1 divided. The Convention elected one delegate out of the delegation of each state onto a Committee to make a proposal; it reported July 5.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=138\u2013139}} Nothing changed over five days.

First the new 'house' seat apportionment was agreed, balancing big and small, north and south. The big states got a decennial census for 'house' apportionment to reflect their future growth. Northerners had insisted on counting only free citizens for the 'house'; southern delegations wanted to add property. Benjamin Franklin's compromise was that there would be no \"property\" provision to add representatives, but states with large slave populations would get a bonus added to their free persons by counting three-fifths other ''persons''.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=236}}\n\nOn July 16, Sherman's \"Great Compromise\" prevailed on its fifth try.

Previously, a thirteen-member committee had been left behind in Philadelphia when Congress adjourned to carry out the \"executive\" functions. Suits between states were referred to the Congress of the Confederation, and treated as a private bill to be determined by majority vote of members attending that day.\n\nOn June 7, the \"national executive\" was taken up in Convention. The \"chief magistrate\", or 'presidency' was of serious concern for a formerly colonial people fearful of concentrated power in one person. But to secure a \"vigorous executive\", nationalist delegates such as James Wilson (PA), Charles Pinckney (SC), and John Dickenson (DE) favored a single officer. They had someone in mind whom everyone could trust to start off the new system, George Washington.\n\nAfter introducing the item for discussion, there was a prolonged silence. Benjamin Franklin (Pa) and John Rutledge (SC) had urged everyone to speak their minds freely. When addressing the issue with George Washington in the room, delegates were careful to phrase their objections to potential offenses by officers chosen in the future who would be 'president' \"subsequent\" to the start-up.

They returned to items when overnight coalitions required adjustment to previous votes to secure a majority on the next item of business. June 19, and it was Randolph's Ninth Resolve next, about the national court system. On the table was the nationalist proposal for the inferior (lower) courts in the national judiciary.\n\nPure 1776 republicanism had not given much credit to judges, who would set themselves up apart from and sometimes contradicting the state legislature, the voice of the sovereign people. Under the precedent of English Common Law according to [[William Blackstone]], the legislature, following proper procedure, was for all constitutional purposes, \"the people.\" This dismissal of unelected officers sometimes took an unintended turn among the people. One of John Adams clients believed the First Continental Congress in 1775 had assumed the sovereignty of Parliament, and so abolished all previously established courts in Massachusetts.<!-- ref name=autogenerated7 -->{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=63\u201366}}\n\nIn the Convention, looking at a national system, Judge Wilson (PA) sought appointments by a single person to avoid legislative payoffs. Judge Rutledge (SC) was against anything but one national court, a Supreme Court to receive appeals from the highest state courts, like the South Carolina court he presided over as Chancellor. Rufus King (MA) thought national district courts in each state would cost less than appeals that otherwise would go to the 'supreme court' in the national capital. National inferior courts passed but making appointments by 'congress' was crossed out and left blank so the delegates could take it up later after \"maturer reflection.\"{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=63\u201366}}\n\n===Re-allocate power===\n{{Main|Federalism in the United States}}\n{{Wikisource|Constitution of the United States}}\nThe [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] created a new, unprecedented form of government by reallocating powers of government. Every previous national authority had been either a centralized government, or a \"confederation of sovereign constituent states.\" The American power-sharing was unique at the time. The sources and changes of power were up to the states. The foundations of government and extent of power came from both national and state sources. But the new government would have a national operation.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=276\u201377}} To meet their goals of cementing the Union and securing citizen rights, Framers allocated power among executive, senate, house and judiciary of the central government. But each state government in their variety continued exercising powers in their own sphere.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=261}}\n\n====Increase Congress====\nThe Convention did not start with national powers from scratch, it began with the powers already vested in the Congress of the Confederation with control of the military, international relations and commerce.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|The Articles of Confederation gave Congress control of (1) the military: appoint and commission officers, build a navy, regulate uniform justice, and use privateers. (2) international relations: declare war and make peace, exchange ambassadors, enter treaties and alliances, establish admiralty courts, punish crimes on the high seas and regulate captures, and manage trade and affairs with non-state Indians. (3) commerce: value of coin, uniform standards of weights and measures, post offices, borrow money and establish courts to adjudicate issues between states.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=262}}}} The Constitution added ten more. Five were minor relative to power sharing, including business and manufacturing protections.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|McDonald lists his five \"minor powers\" as governing the federal district, punishing crimes against the law of nations, copyrights and patents, bankruptcies and counterfeiting.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=262\u201363}}}} One important new power authorized Congress to protect states from the \"domestic violence\" of [[riot]] and [[civil disorder]], but it was conditioned by a state request.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=262\u201363}}\n\nThe Constitution increased Congressional power to organize, arm and discipline the state militias, to use them to enforce the laws of Congress, suppress rebellions within the states and repel invasions. But the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] would ensure that Congressional power could not be used to disarm state militias.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=267}}<ref>U.S. Senate, [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt2.html The Second Amendment\u2014Bearing Arms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221095731/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt2.html |date=December 21, 2011 }} in the Constitution of the United States, p. 1193. Government Printing Office, 1995, viewed 08/11/2011</ref>\n\n[[Taxation in the United States|Taxation]] substantially increased the power of Congress relative to the states. It was limited by restrictions, forbidding taxes on exports, per capita taxes, requiring import duties to be uniform and that taxes be applied to paying U.S. debt. But the states were stripped of their ability to levy taxes on imports, which was at the time, \"by far the most bountiful source of tax revenues\".\n\nCongress had no further restrictions relating to [[political economy]]. It could institute protective [[tariff]]s, for instance. Congress overshadowed state power regulating [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]]; the United States would be the \"largest area of free trade in the world.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=263\u201367}} The most undefined grant of power was the power to \"make laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" the Constitution's enumerated powers.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=267}}\n\n====Limit governments====\nAs of ratification, sovereignty was no longer to be theoretically indivisible. With a wide variety of specific powers among different branches of national governments and thirteen republican state governments, now \"each of the ''portions'' of powers delegated to the one or to the other ... is ... sovereign ''with regard to its proper objects''\".{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=277\u2013278}} There were some powers that remained beyond the reach of both national powers and state powers,{{refn|group = lower-alpha|States would lose more powers with the addition of Constitutional Amendments, the 14th will extend national Bill of Rights freedoms to states, the 15th and 19th will enlarge state citizenship, and the 18th will strip state legislatures of U.S. Senator election.}} so the logical seat of American \"sovereignty\" belonged directly with the people-voters of each state.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=279\u201380}}\n\nBesides expanding Congressional power, the Constitution limited states and central government. Six limits on the national government addressed property rights such as slavery and taxes.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Property right provisions included prohibiting restrictions on slavery within the country until 1808; banning export duties, direct taxes, and port preference; taxing interstate commerce, and confiscating estates.}} Six protected liberty such as prohibiting ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' laws and no [[religious test]]s for national offices in any state, even if they had them for state offices.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Guarantees for liberty in the original Constitution included prohibiting suspension of the writ of [[habeas corpus]] except in times of rebellion or invasion, prohibiting ''ex post facto'' laws and [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]], providing for [[impeachment]] of all civil officers, [[Jury trial]] in criminal cases, narrowing the definition of [[treason]] by direct action and two witnesses, and forbidding religious qualifications for national office.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=268\u201369}}}} Five were principles of a republic, as in legislative [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]].{{refn|group = lower-alpha|In a republic, theory proposed that the people's agent (represented by the House of Representatives) would originate money bills. No money could be spent but by legislative appropriation. Military appropriations were limited to two-years duration. There could be no dual office-holding in the national government and no titles of nobility.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=268\u201369}}}} These restrictions lacked systematic organization, but all constitutional prohibitions were practices that the British Parliament had \"legitimately taken in the absence of a specific denial of the authority.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=268\u201369}}\n\nThe regulation of state power presented a \"qualitatively different\" undertaking. In the state constitutions, the people did not enumerate powers. They gave their representatives every right and authority not explicitly reserved to themselves. The Constitution extended the limits that the states had previously imposed upon themselves under the Articles of Confederation, forbidding taxes on imports and disallowing treaties among themselves, for example.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|The Articles prohibited each state from treating with foreign governments, exchanging ambassadors, grant titles of nobility, maintaining their own armies or ships of war or [[privateer]]s, they were not to engage in war unless invaded, lay taxes on imports. The states under the Articles of Confederation were not to make treaties among themselves.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=270}}}}\n\nIn light of the repeated abuses by [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] passed by the state legislatures, 1783\u20131787, the Constitution prohibited ''ex post facto'' laws and bills of attainder to protect United States citizen property rights and right to a fair trial. Congressional power of the purse was protected by forbidding taxes or restraint on interstate commerce and foreign trade. States could make no law \"impairing the obligation of contracts.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=270}}{{refn|group = lower-alpha|This was necessary since Blackstone held the British Parliament was restrained from ''ex post facto'' laws only in criminal matters.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=271\u201372}}}} To check future state abuses the framers searched for a way to review and veto state laws harming the national welfare or citizen rights. They rejected proposals for Congressional veto of state laws and gave the Supreme Court appellate case jurisdiction over state law because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=275}} The United States had such a geographical extent that it could only be safely governed using a combination of republics. Federal judicial districts would follow those state lines.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=279\u201380}}\n\n====Population power====\nThe British had relied upon a concept of \"[[virtual representation]]\" to give legitimacy to their [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]]. It was not necessary to elect anyone from a large port city, or the American colonies, because the representatives of \"[[rotten borough]]s\", the mostly abandoned medieval fair towns with twenty voters, \"virtually represented\" them. Philadelphia in the colonies was second in population only to London.{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=174\u201375}}\n\nThey were all Englishmen, supposed to be a single people, with one definable interest. Legitimacy came from membership in Parliament of the sovereign realm, not elections from people. As Blackstone explained, the Member is \"not bound ... to consult with, or take the advice, of his constituents.\" As Constitutional historian Gordon Wood elaborated, \"The Commons of England contained all of the people's power and were considered to be the very persons of the people they represented.\"{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=175\u201376}}\n\n{|align=right\n|-\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"1\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Gouverneur Morris 1753.png|<center>''' [[Gouverneur Morris|G. Morris]]''', <small>PA<br>provinces forever</small></center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nWhile the English \"virtual representation\" was hardening into a theory of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the American theory of representation was moving towards a theory of sovereignty of the people. In their new constitutions written since 1776, Americans required community residency of voters and representatives, expanded suffrage, and equalized populations in voting districts. There was a sense that representation \"had to be proportioned to the population.\"{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=184, 186}} The Convention would apply the new principle of \"sovereignty of the people\" both to the House of Representatives, and to the United States Senate.\n\n=====House changes=====\nOnce the Great Compromise was reached, delegates in Convention then agreed to a decennial census to count the population. The Americans themselves did not allow for universal suffrage for all adults.{{refn| group = lower-alpha|But because the 18th Century Founders did not choose universal suffrage for representatives or for direct proposition referendums does not mean that they did not have to argue the point down and outvote their opponents. In a letter to James Sullivan, May 26, 1776, John Adams asked rhetorically, \"Shall we say, that every member of the community, old and young, male and female, as well as rich and poor, must consent, expressly, to every act of legislation?\" His answer was, for 1776, No.{{sfn|Wood|1998|p=182}}}} Their sort of \"virtual representation\" said that those voting in a community could understand and themselves represent non-voters when they had like interests that were unlike other political communities. There were enough differences among people in different American communities for those differences to have a meaningful social and economic reality. Thus New England colonial legislatures would not tax communities which had not yet elected representatives. When the royal governor of Georgia refused to allow representation to be seated from four new counties, the legislature refused to tax them.{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=177\u201378, 183}}\n\nThe 1776 Americans had begun to demand expansion of the franchise, and in each step, they found themselves pressing towards a philosophical \"actuality of consent.\"{{sfn|Wood|1998|p=179}} The Convention determined that the power of the people, should be felt in the House of Representatives. For the U.S. Congress, persons alone were counted. Property was not counted.\n\n=====Senate changes=====\nThe Convention found it more difficult to give expression to the will of the people in new states. What state might be \"lawfully arising\" outside the boundaries of the existing thirteen states?{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=66}} The new government was like the old, to be made up of pre-existing states. Now there was to be admission of new states. Regular order would provide new states by state legislatures for Kentucky, Tennessee and Maine. But the Congress of the Confederation had by its [[Northwest Ordnance]] presented the Convention with a new issue. Settlers in the Northwest Territory might one day constitute themselves into \"no more than five\" states. More difficult still, most delegates anticipated adding alien peoples of Canada, Louisiana and Florida to United States territory.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=282}} Generally in American history, European citizens of empire were given U.S. citizenship on territorial acquisition. Should they become states?\n\nSome delegates were reluctant to expand into any so \"remote wilderness\". It would retard the commercial development of the east. They would be easily influenced, \"foreign gold\" would corrupt them. Western peoples were the least desirable Americans, only good for perpetual provinces.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=282\u201383}} There were so many foreigners moving out west, there was no telling how things would turn out. These were poor people, they could not pay their fair share of taxes. It would be \"suicide\" for the original states. New states could become a majority in the Senate, they would abuse their power, \"enslaving\" the original thirteen. If they also loved liberty, and could not tolerate eastern state dominance, they would be justified in civil war. Western trade interests could drag the country into an inevitable war with Spain for the Mississippi River.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=80\u201381, 176\u201378}} As time wore on, any war for the Mississippi River was obviated by the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the 1812 American [[Battle of New Orleans|victory at New Orleans]].\n\nEven if there were to be western states, a House representation of 40,000 might be too small, too easy for the westerners. \"States\" had been declared out west already. They called themselves republics, and set up their own courts directly from the people without colonial charters. In [[Transylvania (colony)|Transylvania]], [[Westsylvania]], [[State of Franklin|Franklin]], and Vandalia, \"legislatures\" met with emissaries from British and Spanish Empires in violation of the Articles of Confederation, just as the sovereign states had done.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|This point was the principal reason for Maryland's reluctance to ratify the Articles in the first place, delaying its unanimous adoption from 1777 to 1783. Luther Martin (MD) stopped any spontaneously arising western claim of independent statehood by ensuring that the United States owned all the backlands ceded by the states.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=176}}}} In the Constitution as written, no majorities in Congress could break up the larger states without their consent.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=282}}\n\n\"New state\" advocates had no fear of western states achieving a majority one day. For example, the British sought to curb American growth. That brought hate, then separation. Follow the same rule, get the same results. Congress has never been able to discover a better rule than majority rule. If they grow, let them rule. As they grow, they must get all their supplies from eastern businesses. Character is not determined by points of a compass. States admitted are equals, they will be made up of our brethren. Commit to right principles, even if the right way, one day, benefits other states. They will be free like ourselves, their pride will not allow anything but equality.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=179\u201380}}\n\nIt was at this time in the Convention that Reverend [[Manasseh Cutler]] arrived to lobby for western land sales. He brought acres of land grants to parcel out. Their sales would fund most of the U.S. government expenditures for its first few decades. There were allocations for the Ohio Company stockholders at the Convention, and for others delegates too. Good to his word, in December 1787, Cutler led a small band of pioneers into the Ohio Valley.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=181, 184}}\n\nThe provision for admitting new states became relevant at the purchase of Louisiana. It was constitutionally justifiable under the \"treaty making\" power of the federal government. The agrarian advocates sought to make the purchase of land that had never been administered, conquered, or formally ceded to any of the original thirteen states. Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans would divide the Louisiana Purchase into states, speeding land sales to finance the federal government with no new taxes. The new populations of new states would swamp the commercial states in the Senate. They would populate the House with egalitarian Democrat-Republicans to overthrow the Federalists.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Federalists ruled the first twelve years of government with a President by Washington and Adams. The Democratic-Republicans ruled for the next twenty-four, and arguably after one-term John Quincy Adams, for another thirty years under the Jacksonian Democrats.}} Jefferson dropped the proposal of Constitutional amendment to permit the purchase, and with it, his notion of a confederation of sovereign states.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=285}}\n\n===Final document===\nAfter nearly four months of debate, on September 8, 1787, the final text of the Constitution was set down and revised.

Though amendments were debated, they were all defeated. On September 28, 1787, the Congress of the Confederation resolved \"unanimously\" to transmit the Constitution to state legislatures for submitting to a ratification convention according to the Constitutional procedure.{{sfn|Maier|2010|pp=54\u201358}} Several states enlarged the numbers qualified just for electing ratification delegates. In doing so, they went beyond the Constitution's provision for the most voters for the state legislature.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Connecticut expanded electorate to add all town meeting voters;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=134}} New Hampshire dropped certain property requirements, and added town delegates;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=218}} Rhode Island put the question to a referendum which rejected the ratification convention, the Federalist minority centered in Newport and Providence boycotted the election;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=223}} Virginia dropped \"legal and Constitutional requirements\" to expand the freehold electorate;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=228}} New York dropped property requirements, timed assembly elections at the same time, and allowed up to five sequential days of voting until the voting rolls were \"complete\".{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=327}}}}\n\nDelaware, on December 7, 1787, became the first State to ratify the new Constitution, with its vote being unanimous. Pennsylvania ratified on December 12, 1787, by a vote of 46 to 23 (66.67%). New Jersey ratified on December 19, 1787, and Georgia on January 2, 1788, both unanimously. The requirement of ratification by nine states, set by Article Seven of the Constitution, was met when New Hampshire voted to ratify, on June 21, 1788.\n\nIn New York, fully two thirds of the convention delegates were at first opposed to the Constitution. Hamilton led the Federalist campaign, which included the fast-paced appearance of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' in New York newspapers. An attempt to attach conditions to ratification almost succeeded, but on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a recommendation that a bill of rights be appended. The vote was close \u2013 yeas 30 (52.6%), nays 27 \u2013 due largely to Hamilton's forensic abilities and his reaching a few key compromises with moderate anti-Federalists led by [[Melancton Smith]].{{refn| group = lower-alpha |Opposition to ratification was led by Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]; the opposition also suggested that New York reserve the right to withdraw if the Constitution were not amended. Madison led the first session of the first Congress to propose amendments, and ten of the twelve were made Constitutional.}}\n\nFollowing Massachusetts's lead, the Federalist minorities in both Virginia and New York were able to obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments.<!-- ref name=\"MaierPauline_a\" -->{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=431}} A minority of the Constitution's critics continued to oppose the Constitution. Maryland's [[Luther Martin]] argued that the federal convention had exceeded its authority; he still called for amending the Articles.{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=430}} Article 13 of the Articles of Confederation stated that the union created under the Articles was \"perpetual\" and that any alteration must be \"agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State\".<ref name=\"Articles of Confederation\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation|title=Articles of Confederation|accessdate=2009-07-18|author=[[WikiSource]]}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the unanimity required under the Articles made all attempts at reform impossible. Martin's allies such as New York's [[John Lansing, Jr.]], dropped moves to obstruct the Convention's process. They began to take exception to the Constitution \"as it was\", seeking amendments. Several conventions saw supporters for \"amendments before\" shift to a position of \"amendments after\" for the sake of staying in the Union. New York Anti's \"circular letter\" was sent to each state legislature proposing a second constitutional convention for \"amendments before\". It failed in the state legislatures. Ultimately only North Carolina and Rhode Island would wait for amendments from Congress before ratifying.{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=431}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; float:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ece9f8;\"| The Constitution was ratified by the states<br>in the following order:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/ratifications.html|title=Ratification Dates and Votes \u2013 The U.S. Constitution Online|author=|date=|work=USConstitution.net|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" rowspan=\"2\"|<abbr title=\"Order of state's ratification\">{{Number sign}}</abbr>\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" rowspan=\"2\"| State\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" colspan=\"2\"| Votes\n|-\n!

On September 13, 1788, the Congress of the Confederation certified that the new Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for it to go into effect. Congress fixed the city of New York as the temporary seat of the new government and set the dates for the election of representatives and presidential electors. It also set the date for operations to begin under the new [[Federal government of the United States|government]].{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=429}} This occurred on March 4, 1789, when the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] convened.\n\nThe membership of the new Congress was decidedly federalist. In the eleven-state (minus North Carolina and Rhode Island) Senate 20 were Federalist and two Anti-federalist (both from Virginia). The House included 48 Federalists and 11 Anti-federalists (from four states: Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and Virginia).{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=433}} On April 6 the House and Senate held a joint meeting to count the electoral vote. [[George Washington]] was unanimously elected the first president, even receiving the electoral vote of ardent anti-federalist [[Patrick Henry]].{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=438}} [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts was elected vice president. Both were sworn into office on April 30, 1789.

The debates in the state ratifying conventions centered around the absence of anything equivalent to the bill of rights found in several state constitutions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: With a Summary of the Actions of the States in Ratification of the Provisions Thereof|year=1961|publisher=Virginia Department on Constitutional Government|location=Richmond, Virginia|editor=James J.

He also opposed the constitution when it was brought before the state for ratification. He acquiesced and the convention voted narrowly to give its assent only after it was decided that a list of twenty proposed amendments be sent along with the state's resolution of ratification. Delegates to [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779\u20131780|Massachusetts' convention]] had many of the same concerns, and along with its notification of approval made a request for nine alterations, the first among them being \"that it be explicitly declared that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved to the states to be exercised by them.\" New York, not to be outdone, appended a list of thirty-two requested amendments plus a lengthy statement of ''impressions'' and ''explanations'' about the new Constitution to their affirmative vote.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe sharp Anti-Federalist critique of the Constitution did not abate after it became operational, and by the time the [[First United States Congress|First Congress]] convened in March 1789, there existed widespread sentiment in both the House and Senate in favor of making alterations. That September, Congress adopted twelve amendments and sent to the states for ratification. Ten of these were ratified by the required number of states in December 1791 and became part of the Constitution. These amendments enumerate freedoms not explicitly indicated in the main body of the Constitution, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, a free press, and free assembly; the right to keep and bear arms; freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, security in personal effects, and freedom from warrants issued without probable cause; indictment by a [[grand jury]] for a [[Capital punishment|capital]] or \"infamous crime\"; guarantee of a speedy, public trial with an impartial [[Jury trial|jury]]; and prohibition of double jeopardy.

Calhoun]]]]\nIn [[History of the United States|United States history]], four periods of widespread Constitutional criticism have been characterized by the idea that specific political powers belong to [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] and not to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]\u2014a doctrine commonly known as [[states rights]]. At each stage, states' rights advocates failed to develop a preponderance in public opinion or to sustain the democratic political will required to alter the generally held constitutional understanding and political practice in the United States. At its adoption among the people in the state ratification conventions, the \"men of original principles\" opposed the new national government as violating the [[Whig (British political party)#American impact|Whig philosophy]] generally accepted among the original thirteen colonies in 1776. According to this view, Congress as a legislature should be only equal to any state legislature, and only the people in each state might be sovereign. They are now referred to as the [[Anti-Federalists]] in American historiography. The proponents of \"state sovereignty\" and \"states rights\" were outvoted in eleven of thirteen state ratification conventions, then thirteen of thirteen, to \"ordain and establish\" the Constitution.\n\nDuring [[Andrew Jackson]]'s administration, South Carolina objected to U.S. government's \"[[Tariff of 1828|tariff of abominations]]\" collected as federal duties in Charleston Harbor. The [[Nullification Crisis]] ensued. Justification for the nullifiers was found in the U.S. Senate speeches and writings of [[John C. Calhoun]]. He defended slavery against the Constitutional provisions allowing its statutory regulation or its eventual abolition by Constitutional amendment, most notably in his [[John C. Calhoun#Disquisition on Government|Disquisition on Government]]. The crisis was averted when President Jackson, a former Major General, declared he would march a U.S. army into South Carolina and hang the first nullifier he saw from the first tree, and a new negotiated tariff, the [[Compromise Tariff of 1833]], satisfactory to South Carolina was enacted.  Despite this, a states-rights-based defense of slavery persisted amongst Southerners until the American Civil War; conversely, Northerners explored nullification of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850#Nullification|Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]. Abraham Lincoln kept a portrait of Andrew Jackson above his desk at the War Department for the duration of the American Civil War as a clear symbol of Lincoln's intent and resolve as well as to draw attention to an executive precedent for Lincoln's actions.\n\nIn the mid-19th Century during the administrations of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant]], the United States suffered a tragic passage through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. An important survey of the philosophical and legal underpinnings of \"States Rights\" as held by secessionists and [[Lost Cause]] advocates afterwards is found in the speeches of Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] and his [[Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]. Davis defended secession by appealing to the \"original principles\" of the Founders' 1776 Revolutionary generation, and by expanding on [[William Blackstone]]'s doctrine of legislative supremacy. By the elections of 1872, all states which had been admitted to the United States in accordance with the Constitution were fully represented in the U.S. Congress.\n\n[[File:Jefferson Davis 1853 daguerreotype-restored.png|thumb|upright=1.0|right|[[Jefferson Davis]]]]\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court 1954 holding in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] used National Guard and U.S. paratroopers to enforce the rulings of the Federal Courts as they pertained to the Constitution. The \"States Rights\" doctrine was again appealed to during the mid-20th Century resistance to racial integration in the schools, notably in Arkansas' [[Little Rock Nine]], Alabama's [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]], and Virginia's [[Massive Resistance]]. Public schools in every state are now racially integrated by law under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe tradition is seen in many shorter episodes of limited minority protest against the United States. During the War of 1812, Federalists conducted a [[Hartford Convention]] proposing New England secession during wartime to reopen trade with the declared enemy of the United States. It led to accusations of treason and the demise of the [[Federalist Party]] as a force in American politics. In 1921, the Maryland Attorney General sued to block [[Women's suffrage|woman suffrage]]. He argued in ''[[Leser v. Garnett]]'' that state legislatures were Constitutionally the sole determiners of who should vote in what federal or state elections, and that the 19th Amendment was improper. The Supreme Court's judicial review of the state court findings held that the 19th Amendment was Constitutional, and that it applied to the women's right to vote in every state. Women now vote in every state under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOne exceptional example of \"states rights\" persuading overwhelming majorities in a democratic and sustained way, and so transforming the nation came in the [[John Adams]] administration. Fear had spread that radical democratic sentiment might turn subversive as it had in the French [[Reign of Terror]]. But the Federalist-sponsored [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] meant to preempt the danger led to suppression of opposition press. The political reaction in the [[Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] sparked public opposition against the Federalist policy and led to twenty-four years of Constitutionally elected [[Democratic-Republican Party]] rule through six administrations of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, opponents of federal laws prohibiting the sale and possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] have based their objections partially on states' rights grounds, as have opponents of federal laws and regulations pertaining to [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|firearms]]. States' rights under the constitution has also been recently raised as an issue on a number of other occasions, most notably regarding [[Common Core Standards|Common Core]], the [[Affordable Care Act]], and [[Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States|same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/246582-states-move-to-counter-gay-marriage-ruling|title=States move to counter gay marriage ruling|author=Tim Devaney|publisher=TheHill |date=2015-06-30}}</ref>\n\n==History of the physical document==\nAt first, little interest was shown in the parchment object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801\u20131809) but having left Washington, he had lost track of it in the years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the Constitution. In 1883 historian [[J. Franklin Jameson]] found the parchment folded in a small tin box on the floor of a closet at the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building|State, War and Navy Building]]. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a safe.<ref>Robert G. Ferris and James H. Charleton, ''The Signers of the Constitution'' (1986) p. 245</ref>\n\nThe two parchment documents were turned over to the Library of Congress by executive order, and in 1924 President Coolidge dedicated the bronze-and-marble shrine for public display of the Constitution in the main building. The parchments were laid over moisture absorbing cellulose paper, vacuum-sealed between double panes of insulated plate glass, and protected from light by a gelatin film. Although building construction of the Archives Building was completed in 1935, in December 1941 they were moved from the Library of Congress until September 1944, and stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository, [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]], along with the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address.<ref>Stephen Puleo, American Treasures: The Secret Efforts to Save the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Gettysburg Address.</ref> In 1951 following a study by the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to protect from atmosphere, insects, mold and light, the parchments were re-encased with special light filters, inert helium gas and proper humidity. They were transferred to the National Archives in 1952.<ref>Ferris and Charleton, ''The Signers of the Constitution'' (1986) pp. 246\u201348</ref>\n\nSince 1952, the \"Charters of Freedom\" have been displayed in the Rotunda of the National Archives Building. Visual inspections have been enhanced by electronic imaging. Changes in the cases led to removal from their cases July 2001, preservation treatment by conservators, and installment in new encasements for public display in September 2003.<ref>Since 1987, inspections were enhanced by an electronic imaging monitoring system developed for NARA<!--NASA?--> by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. In 1995, conservators noticed changes in the glass encasements of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Glass experts from Libby-Owens-Ford (the original manufacturer of the encasement glass) and the Corning Glass Museum identified signs of deterioration. Both the glass experts and the National Archives Advisory Committee on Preservation recommended that the Charters be re-encased by 2002 for document safety.

The document was written at the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]] and was ratified through a series of state conventions held in 1787 and 1788. Since 1789, the Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; particularly important amendments include the ten amendments of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] and the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]].\n\nThe Constitution grew out of efforts to reform the [[Articles of Confederation]], an earlier constitution which provided for a loose alliance of states with a weak central government. From May 1787 through September 1787, delegates from twelve of the thirteen states convened in Philadelphia, where they wrote a new constitution. Two alternative plans were developed at the convention. The nationalist majority, soon to be called \"Federalists,\" put forth the [[Virginia Plan]], a consolidated government based on proportional representation among the states by population. The \"old patriots,\" later called \"[[Anti-Federalist]]s,\" advocated the [[New Jersey Plan]], a purely federal proposal, based on providing each state with equal representation. The [[Connecticut Compromise]] allowed for both plans to work together. Other controversies developed regarding slavery and a Bill of Rights in the original document.\n\nThe drafted Constitution was submitted to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in September 1787; that same month it approved the forwarding of the Constitution as drafted to the states, each of which would hold a ratification convention. ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', published while the states were debating ratification, provided background and justification for the Constitution. Some states agreed to ratify the Constitution only if the amendments that were to become the Bill of Rights would be taken up immediately by the new government. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation certified that eleven states had ratified the new Constitution, and directed that elections be held. The new government began on March 4, 1789, assembled in New York City, and the government authorized by the Articles of Confederation dissolved itself.\n\nIn 1791, the states ratified the Bill of Rights, which established protections for various civil liberties. The Bill of Rights initially only applied to the federal government, but following a process of [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] most protections of the Bill of Rights now apply to state governments. Further amendments to the Constitution have addressed federal relationships, election procedures, terms of office, expanding the electorate, financing the federal government, consumption of alcohol, and congressional pay. Between 1865 and 1870, the states ratified the Reconstruction Amendments, which abolished [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], guaranteed equal protection of the law, and implemented prohibitions on the restriction of voter rights. The meaning of the Constitution is interpreted by [[judicial review]] in the federal courts. The original parchment copies are on display at the [[National Archives Building]].\n\n==Background: revolution and early governance==\n\n===Declaration of Independence===\n{{Main|United States Declaration of Independence}}\nOn June 4, 1776, [[Lee Resolution|a resolution]] was introduced in the [[Second Continental Congress]] declaring the union with Great Britain to be dissolved, proposing the formation of foreign alliances, and suggesting the drafting of a plan of confederation to be submitted to the respective states. Independence was declared on July 4, 1776; the preparation of a plan of confederation was postponed. Although the Declaration was a statement of principles, it did not create a government or even a framework for how politics would be carried out. It was the [[Articles of Confederation]] that provided the necessary structure to the new nation during and after the [[American Revolution]]. The Declaration, however, did set forth the ideas of [[natural rights]] and the [[social contract]] that would help form the foundation of constitutional government.\n\nThe era of the Declaration of Independence is sometimes called the \"Continental Congress\" period. [[John Adams]] famously estimated as many as one-third of those resident in the original thirteen colonies were patriots. Scholars such as [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] describe how Americans were caught up in the Revolutionary fervor and excitement of creating governments, societies, a new nation on the face of the earth by rational choice as Thomas Paine declared in [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]].\n\nRepublican government and personal liberty for \"the people\" were to overspread the New World continents and to last forever, a gift to posterity.  These goals were influenced by [[Enlightenment philosophy]]. The adherents to this cause seized on English [[Whiggism|Whig political philosophy]] as described by historian [[Forrest McDonald]] as justification for most of their changes to received colonial charters and traditions. It was rooted in opposition to monarchy they saw as venal and corrupting to the \"permanent interests of the people.\"\n\nTo these partisans, voting was the only permanent defense of the people. Elected terms for legislature were cut to one year, for Virginia's Governor, one year without re-election. Property requirements for [[suffrage]] for men were reduced to taxes on their tools in some states. Free blacks in New York could vote if they owned enough property. New Hampshire was thinking of abolishing all voting requirements for men except residency and religion. New Jersey let women vote. In some states, senators were now elected by the same voters as the larger electorate for the House, and even judges were elected to one-year terms.\n\nThese \"[[radical Whigs]]\" were called the people \"out-of-doors.\" They distrusted not only royal authority, but any small, secretive group as being unrepublican. Crowds of men and women massed at the steps of rural Court Houses during market-militia-court days. [[Shays Rebellion]] (1786\u201387) is a famous example. Urban riots began by the out-of-doors rallies on the steps of an oppressive government official with speakers such as members of the [[Sons of Liberty]] holding forth in the \"people's \"committees\" until some action was decided upon, including hanging his effigy outside a bedroom window, or looting and burning down the offending tyrant's home.\n\n=== First and Second Continental Congresses ===\nThe [[First Continental Congress]] met from September 5 to October 26, 1774. It agreed that the states should impose an economic boycott on British trade, and drew up a petition to [[King George III]] of England, pleading for redress of their grievances and repeal of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. It did not propose independence or a separate government for the states.\n\nThe [[Second Continental Congress]] convened on May 10, 1775, and functioned as a ''de facto'' national government at the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Beginning in 1777, the substantial powers assumed by Congress \"made the league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history\".<ref>Wood, Gordon S., \"The Creation of the American Republic, 1776\u20131787\" (1972) {{ISBN|978-0-807-84723-7}}, p. 359.</ref> The process created the United States \"by the people in collectivity, rather than by the individual states\", because only four states had constitutions at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and three of those were provisional.\n\nThe Supreme Court in [[Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators]] (1795), and again in [[Ware v. Hylton]] (1796), ruled on the federal government's powers prior to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1788. It said that Congress exercised powers derived from the people, expressly conferred through the medium of state conventions or legislatures, and, once exercised, those powers were \"impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people\".<ref>Morris, Richard B., American Historical Association [http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/presidential-addresses/richard-b-morris Presidential Address] AHA December 28, 1976. Viewed June 8, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Confederation Period===\n{{Main|Confederation Period}}\nThe [[Articles of Confederation]] was approved by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and sent to the states for [[ratification]]. It came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states.  Over the previous four years it had been used by Congress as a \"working document\" to administer the early United States government and win the Revolutionary War. and secure\n\nLasting successes under the Articles of Confederation included the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] with Great Britain and the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], whereby Congress promised settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains full citizenship and eventual statehood.<ref>Morris (1987) ch. 3\u20134.</ref> Some historians characterize this period from 1781 to 1789 as weakness, dissension, and turmoil.<ref>Morris (1987); Nevins (1924)</ref> Other scholars view the evidence as reflecting an underlying stability and prosperity.<ref>Jensen (1950)</ref> But the returning of prosperity in some areas did not slow the growth of domestic and foreign problems.  Nationalists saw the confederation's central government as not strong enough to establish a sound financial system, regulate trade, enforce treaties, or go to war when needed.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\">Morris (1987)</ref>\n\nThe [[Congress of the Confederation]], as defined in the Articles of Confederation, was the sole organ of the national government; there was no national court to interpret laws nor an executive branch to enforce them. Governmental functions, including declarations of war and calls for an army, were voluntarily supported by each state, in full, partly, or not at all.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\" />\n\nThe newly independent states, separated from Britain, no longer received [[Navigation Acts|favored treatment]] at British ports. The British refused to negotiate a commercial treaty in 1785 because the individual American states would not be bound by it. Congress could not act directly upon the States nor upon individuals. It had no authority to regulate foreign or interstate commerce. Every act of government was left to the individual States. Each state levied taxes and tariffs on other states at will, which invited retaliation. Congress could vote itself mediator and judge in state disputes, but states did not have to accept its decisions.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\" />\n\nThe weak central government could not back its policies with military strength, embarrassing it in foreign affairs. The British refused to withdraw their troops from the forts and trading posts in the new nation's [[Northwest Territory]], as they had agreed to do in the [[Treaty of Paris of 1783]]. British officers on the northern boundaries and Spanish officers to the south supplied arms to Native American tribes, allowing them to attack American settlers. The Spanish refused to allow western American farmers to use their port of New Orleans to ship produce.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\"/>\n\nRevenues were requisitioned by Congressional petition to each state.  None paid what they were asked; sometimes some paid nothing. Congress appealed to the thirteen states for an amendment to the Articles to tax enough to pay the public debt as principal came due. Twelve states agreed, Rhode Island did not, so it failed.<ref>Jensen, Merrill; ''The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781\u20131789'' (1950). When Congress could borrow no more money, it sold western lands. This revenue source would grow to provide the Early Republic with half of its annual expenditures, freeing the states of national tax burdens.</ref> The Articles required super majorities. Amendment proposals to states required ratification by all thirteen states, all important legislation needed 70% approval, at least nine states. Repeatedly, one or two states defeated legislative proposals of major importance.<ref name=\"Morris 1987\"/>\n\nWithout taxes the government could not pay its debt. Seven of the thirteen states printed large quantities of its own paper money, backed by gold, land, or nothing, so there was no fair exchange rate among them. State courts required state creditors to accept payments at face value with a fraction of real purchase power. The same legislation that these states used to wipe out the Revolutionary debt to patriots was used to pay off promised veteran pensions. The measures were popular because they helped both small farmers and plantation owners pay off their debts.<ref>E.

It imposed a tightly limited currency and high taxes. Without paper money veterans without cash lost their farms for back taxes. This triggered [[Shays Rebellion]] to stop tax collectors and close the courts.

But as the Convention went on, individual delegate coming and going meant that a state's vote could change with the change of delegation composition.

State delegations absented themselves at votes different times of day. There was no minimum for a state delegation; one would do. Daily sessions would have thirty members present. Members came and went on public and personal business. The Congress of the Confederation was meeting at the same time, so members would absent themselves to New York City on Congressional business for days and weeks at a time.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=15, 24}}\n\nBut the work before them was continuous, even if attendance was not. The Convention resolved itself into a \"Committee of the Whole\", and could remain so for days. It was informal, votes could be taken and retaken easily, positions could change without prejudice, and importantly, no formal [[quorum call]] was required. The nationalists were resolute. As Madison put it, the situation was too serious for despair.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=15, 19\u201320, 54}} They used the same State House, later named [[Independence Hall]], as the Declaration signers.

The state legislatures of the day used these occasions to say why they were sending representatives abroad. New York thus publicly enjoined its members to pursue all possible \"alterations and provisions\" for good government and \"preservation of the Union\". New Hampshire called for \"timely measures to enlarge the powers of Congress\".

It was weighted toward the interests of the larger, more populous states. The intent was to meet the purposes set out in the Articles of Confederation, \"common defense, security of liberty and general welfare\". The Virginia Plan was national, authority flowed from the people. If the people will ratify them, changes for better republican government and national union should be proposed.\n\nMuch of the Virginia Plan was adopted.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Elements of Randolph's \"Virginia Plan\" proposal as submitted were not adopted.

Both factions were intent on forging a nation in which both could be full participants in the changes which were sure to come, since that was most likely to allow for their national union, guarantee liberty for their posterity, and promote their mutual long-term material prosperity.\n\n====Slavery in debate====\n{{Main|Slavery in the United States}}\nThe contentious issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was too controversial to be resolved during the Convention. But it was at center stage in the Convention three times, June 7 regarding who would vote for Congress, June 11 in debate over how to proportion relative seating in the 'house', and August 22 relating to commerce and the future wealth of the nation.\n\nOnce the Convention looked at how to proportion the House representation, tempers among several delegates exploded over slavery. When the Convention progressed beyond the personal attacks, it adopted the existing \"federal ratio\" for taxing states by three-fifths of slaves held.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=95}}\n\nOn August 6, the Committee of Detail reported its proposed revisions to the Randolph Plan. Again the question of slavery came up, and again the question was met with attacks of outrage. Over the next two weeks, delegates wove a web of mutual compromises relating to commerce and trade, east and west, slave-holding and free. The transfer of power to regulate slave trade from states to central government could happen in 20 years, but only then.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|The Constitution sets up a bicameral legislature which enacts law only if there are national majorities both among (a) the states in the 'senate' and (b) the people in the 'house'. At the time the Constitution was ratified, it balanced states equally relative to slavery in the Senate. There were six states north of Pennsylvania, and six states south of it. Pennsylvania, the \"keystone\" state, split Senators one-one at first. After Pennsylvania abolished slavery, the next state to enter the Union in 1792 was Kentucky, which was admitted with slavery. That action maintained a \"sectional equality\" between free-soil states and slave-holding states, 7\u20137. Then in 1850, California was admitted as a free state, then Minnesota, Oregon and Kansas followed as free states before outbreak of the Civil War. The Constitution's House of Representatives began nearly equal, but the decennial census reallocated power away from declining slave-economies and towards the places which supported more people. Over time, ten years at a time, under the Constitution, the state antecedents, wealth, commerce and militias matter less than the numbers of people it can sustain in its domestic economy.}} Later generations could try out their own answers. The delegates were trying to make a government that might last that long.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=197\u2013204}}\n\nMigration of the free or \"importation\" of indentures and slaves could continue by states, defining slaves as persons, not property. Long-term power would change by population as counted every ten years. Apportionment in the House would not be by wealth, it would be by people, the free citizens and three-fifths the number of other persons meaning propertyless slaves and taxed Indian farming families.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Section 2 of Article I provides in part: \"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states ... by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.\" State population for U.S. representation or taxes was to exclude all numbers of untaxed Native-Americans.\u2014\"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states ... by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.}}\n\nIn 1806, President Thomas Jefferson sent a message to the 9th Congress on their constitutional opportunity to remove U.S. citizens from the transatlantic slave trade \"[violating] human rights\".<ref>Annals of Congress, [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=016/llac016.db&recNum=118 \"House of Representatives, 9th Congress, 2nd Session\"], History of Congress, \"Importation of Slaves\" pp. 241\u201342.

[[William Lloyd Garrison]] famously declared the Constitution \"a covenant with death and an agreement with Hell.\"<ref>Phillip Shaw Paludan, ''A Covenant with Death: the Constitution, Law, and Equality in the Civil War Era'' (1975) pp. 2\u20134</ref>\n\nIn ratification conventions, the anti-slavery delegates sometimes began as anti-ratification votes. Still, the Constitution \"as written\" was an improvement over the Articles from an abolitionist point of view. The Constitution provided for abolition of the slave trade but the Articles did not. The outcome could be determined gradually over time.{{sfn|Maier|2010|pp=201, 284}} Sometimes contradictions among opponents were used to try to gain abolitionist converts. In Virginia, Federalist George Nicholas dismissed fears on both sides. Objections to the Constitution were inconsistent, \"At the same moment it is opposed for being promotive and destructive of slavery!\" {{sfn|Maier|2010|p=284}} But the contradiction was never resolved peaceably, and the failure to do so contributed to the Civil War.<ref>See ''South Carolina Declaration of Causes of Secession'' (December 24, 1860), reprinted in Richard Hofstadter, ''Great Issues in American History''.

Although awkward, vulgar and laughable to more polished colleagues, he was an honest political broker. The most frequent speakers on the Convention floor were Madison, Wilson, G.

When you are a majority, vote.\" Among the small-state advocates, he would make the most speeches throughout the Convention.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=93}} Arriving right behind the nationalist leaders on May 30, Sherman was reported to prefer a \"patch up\" of the existing Confederacy. <!-- ref name=autogenerated12 -->{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=93\u201394}} Another small state delegate, George Read (DE) agreed with the nationalists that state legislatures were a national problem.

It was like the proposal he made in the 1776 Continental Congress. Representation in Congress should be both by states and by population. There, he was voted down by the small states in favor of all states equal, one vote only.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=93\u201394}} Now in 1787 Convention, he wanted to balance all the big-state victories for population apportionment.

Supporters explained that it \"sustained the sovereignty of the states\", while the Edmund Randolph (VA) \"Virginia Plan\" erased it.

The \"nationalists\" answered, The Convention could not conclude anything, but it could recommend anything.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=107}}\n\n\"Patriots\" said if their legislature knew anything about proposals for consolidated government, it would not have sent anyone. \"Nationalists\" countered, that it would be treason to withhold any proposal for good government when the salvation of the American republic was at stake.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=107}} Three sessions after its introduction, the New Jersey Plan failed : 7 against, 3 for, 1 divided.<ref>Farrand, op.cit., Vol. I. p. 322 Madison, Mr. King's motion June 19.</ref> For nearly a month there was no progress; small states were seriously thinking of walking out of the Convention.{{refn| group = lower-alpha |Yates and Lansing (NY) would walk out July 10.

The 'senate' would be chosen by the state legislatures, not the people, passed: 9 for, 2 against.<ref>Farrand, op.cit., Vol. I. p. 408 Madison, on the question \"that the members of the 2nd branch be chosen by the individual legislatures.\". June 25.</ref> The basis of representation for both the 'house' and the 'senate' re-surfaced.

In the \"senate\", the states should have equal representation. Advocates said that it could not be agreed to, the union would fall apart somehow.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=129\u201330}} Big states would not be trusted, the small states could confederate with a foreign power showing \"more good faith\".

Journal. June 29.</ref>\n\nOn July 2, the Convention for the fourth time considered a \"senate\" with equal state votes. This time a vote was taken, but it stalled again, tied at 5 yes, 5 no, 1 divided. The Convention elected one delegate out of the delegation of each state onto a Committee to make a proposal; it reported July 5.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=138\u2013139}} Nothing changed over five days.

First the new 'house' seat apportionment was agreed, balancing big and small, north and south. The big states got a decennial census for 'house' apportionment to reflect their future growth. Northerners had insisted on counting only free citizens for the 'house'; southern delegations wanted to add property. Benjamin Franklin's compromise was that there would be no \"property\" provision to add representatives, but states with large slave populations would get a bonus added to their free persons by counting three-fifths other ''persons''.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=236}}\n\nOn July 16, Sherman's \"Great Compromise\" prevailed on its fifth try.

Previously, a thirteen-member committee had been left behind in Philadelphia when Congress adjourned to carry out the \"executive\" functions. Suits between states were referred to the Congress of the Confederation, and treated as a private bill to be determined by majority vote of members attending that day.\n\nOn June 7, the \"national executive\" was taken up in Convention. The \"chief magistrate\", or 'presidency' was of serious concern for a formerly colonial people fearful of concentrated power in one person. But to secure a \"vigorous executive\", nationalist delegates such as James Wilson (PA), Charles Pinckney (SC), and John Dickenson (DE) favored a single officer. They had someone in mind whom everyone could trust to start off the new system, George Washington.\n\nAfter introducing the item for discussion, there was a prolonged silence. Benjamin Franklin (Pa) and John Rutledge (SC) had urged everyone to speak their minds freely. When addressing the issue with George Washington in the room, delegates were careful to phrase their objections to potential offenses by officers chosen in the future who would be 'president' \"subsequent\" to the start-up. Roger Sherman (CT), Edmund Randolph (VA) and Pierce Butler{{refn| group = lower-alpha |Pierce Butler of South Carolina was generally a nationalist, representing up-country interests against the state-dominating big plantations, but on this, he switched between Resolution 7 and Resolution 8, speaking with the small-states, supporting a two- or three-person 'presidency'.

The vote for a one-man 'presidency' carried 7-for, 3-against, New York, Delaware and Maryland in the negative. Virginia, along with George Washington, had voted yes. As of that vote for a single 'presidency', George Mason (VA) gravely announced to the floor, that as of that moment, the Confederation's federal government was \"in some measure dissolved by the meeting of this Convention.\"{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=55\u201362}}\n\n{|align=right\n|-\n|<center>First national court(s)</center>\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"1\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Rufus King.jpg|<center>'''[[Rufus King]]''', <small>MA<br>district courts = flexibility</small></center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe Convention was following the Randolph Plan for an agenda, taking each resolve in turn to move proceedings forward. They returned to items when overnight coalitions required adjustment to previous votes to secure a majority on the next item of business. June 19, and it was Randolph's Ninth Resolve next, about the national court system. On the table was the nationalist proposal for the inferior (lower) courts in the national judiciary.\n\nPure 1776 republicanism had not given much credit to judges, who would set themselves up apart from and sometimes contradicting the state legislature, the voice of the sovereign people. Under the precedent of English Common Law according to [[William Blackstone]], the legislature, following proper procedure, was for all constitutional purposes, \"the people.\" This dismissal of unelected officers sometimes took an unintended turn among the people. One of John Adams clients believed the First Continental Congress in 1775 had assumed the sovereignty of Parliament, and so abolished all previously established courts in Massachusetts.<!-- ref name=autogenerated7 -->{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=63\u201366}}\n\nIn the Convention, looking at a national system, Judge Wilson (PA) sought appointments by a single person to avoid legislative payoffs. Judge Rutledge (SC) was against anything but one national court, a Supreme Court to receive appeals from the highest state courts, like the South Carolina court he presided over as Chancellor. Rufus King (MA) thought national district courts in each state would cost less than appeals that otherwise would go to the 'supreme court' in the national capital. National inferior courts passed but making appointments by 'congress' was crossed out and left blank so the delegates could take it up later after \"maturer reflection.\"{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=63\u201366}}\n\n===Re-allocate power===\n{{Main|Federalism in the United States}}\n{{Wikisource|Constitution of the United States}}\nThe [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] created a new, unprecedented form of government by reallocating powers of government. Every previous national authority had been either a centralized government, or a \"confederation of sovereign constituent states.\" The American power-sharing was unique at the time. The sources and changes of power were up to the states. The foundations of government and extent of power came from both national and state sources. But the new government would have a national operation.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=276\u201377}} To meet their goals of cementing the Union and securing citizen rights, Framers allocated power among executive, senate, house and judiciary of the central government. But each state government in their variety continued exercising powers in their own sphere.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=261}}\n\n====Increase Congress====\nThe Convention did not start with national powers from scratch, it began with the powers already vested in the Congress of the Confederation with control of the military, international relations and commerce.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|The Articles of Confederation gave Congress control of (1) the military: appoint and commission officers, build a navy, regulate uniform justice, and use privateers. (2) international relations: declare war and make peace, exchange ambassadors, enter treaties and alliances, establish admiralty courts, punish crimes on the high seas and regulate captures, and manage trade and affairs with non-state Indians. (3) commerce: value of coin, uniform standards of weights and measures, post offices, borrow money and establish courts to adjudicate issues between states.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=262}}}} The Constitution added ten more. Five were minor relative to power sharing, including business and manufacturing protections.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|McDonald lists his five \"minor powers\" as governing the federal district, punishing crimes against the law of nations, copyrights and patents, bankruptcies and counterfeiting.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=262\u201363}}}} One important new power authorized Congress to protect states from the \"domestic violence\" of [[riot]] and [[civil disorder]], but it was conditioned by a state request.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=262\u201363}}\n\nThe Constitution increased Congressional power to organize, arm and discipline the state militias, to use them to enforce the laws of Congress, suppress rebellions within the states and repel invasions. But the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] would ensure that Congressional power could not be used to disarm state militias.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=267}}<ref>U.S. Senate, [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt2.html The Second Amendment\u2014Bearing Arms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221095731/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt2.html |date=December 21, 2011 }} in the Constitution of the United States, p. 1193. Government Printing Office, 1995, viewed 08/11/2011</ref>\n\n[[Taxation in the United States|Taxation]] substantially increased the power of Congress relative to the states. It was limited by restrictions, forbidding taxes on exports, per capita taxes, requiring import duties to be uniform and that taxes be applied to paying U.S. debt. But the states were stripped of their ability to levy taxes on imports, which was at the time, \"by far the most bountiful source of tax revenues\".\n\nCongress had no further restrictions relating to [[political economy]]. It could institute protective [[tariff]]s, for instance. Congress overshadowed state power regulating [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]]; the United States would be the \"largest area of free trade in the world.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=263\u201367}} The most undefined grant of power was the power to \"make laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" the Constitution's enumerated powers.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=267}}\n\n====Limit governments====\nAs of ratification, sovereignty was no longer to be theoretically indivisible. With a wide variety of specific powers among different branches of national governments and thirteen republican state governments, now \"each of the ''portions'' of powers delegated to the one or to the other ... is ... sovereign ''with regard to its proper objects''\".{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=277\u2013278}} There were some powers that remained beyond the reach of both national powers and state powers,{{refn|group = lower-alpha|States would lose more powers with the addition of Constitutional Amendments, the 14th will extend national Bill of Rights freedoms to states, the 15th and 19th will enlarge state citizenship, and the 18th will strip state legislatures of U.S. Senator election.}} so the logical seat of American \"sovereignty\" belonged directly with the people-voters of each state.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=279\u201380}}\n\nBesides expanding Congressional power, the Constitution limited states and central government. Six limits on the national government addressed property rights such as slavery and taxes.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Property right provisions included prohibiting restrictions on slavery within the country until 1808; banning export duties, direct taxes, and port preference; taxing interstate commerce, and confiscating estates.}} Six protected liberty such as prohibiting ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' laws and no [[religious test]]s for national offices in any state, even if they had them for state offices.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Guarantees for liberty in the original Constitution included prohibiting suspension of the writ of [[habeas corpus]] except in times of rebellion or invasion, prohibiting ''ex post facto'' laws and [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]], providing for [[impeachment]] of all civil officers, [[Jury trial]] in criminal cases, narrowing the definition of [[treason]] by direct action and two witnesses, and forbidding religious qualifications for national office.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=268\u201369}}}} Five were principles of a republic, as in legislative [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]].{{refn|group = lower-alpha|In a republic, theory proposed that the people's agent (represented by the House of Representatives) would originate money bills. No money could be spent but by legislative appropriation. Military appropriations were limited to two-years duration. There could be no dual office-holding in the national government and no titles of nobility.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=268\u201369}}}} These restrictions lacked systematic organization, but all constitutional prohibitions were practices that the British Parliament had \"legitimately taken in the absence of a specific denial of the authority.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=268\u201369}}\n\nThe regulation of state power presented a \"qualitatively different\" undertaking. In the state constitutions, the people did not enumerate powers. They gave their representatives every right and authority not explicitly reserved to themselves. The Constitution extended the limits that the states had previously imposed upon themselves under the Articles of Confederation, forbidding taxes on imports and disallowing treaties among themselves, for example.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|The Articles prohibited each state from treating with foreign governments, exchanging ambassadors, grant titles of nobility, maintaining their own armies or ships of war or [[privateer]]s, they were not to engage in war unless invaded, lay taxes on imports. The states under the Articles of Confederation were not to make treaties among themselves.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=270}}}}\n\nIn light of the repeated abuses by [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] passed by the state legislatures, 1783\u20131787, the Constitution prohibited ''ex post facto'' laws and bills of attainder to protect United States citizen property rights and right to a fair trial. Congressional power of the purse was protected by forbidding taxes or restraint on interstate commerce and foreign trade. States could make no law \"impairing the obligation of contracts.\"{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=270}}{{refn|group = lower-alpha|This was necessary since Blackstone held the British Parliament was restrained from ''ex post facto'' laws only in criminal matters.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=271\u201372}}}} To check future state abuses the framers searched for a way to review and veto state laws harming the national welfare or citizen rights. They rejected proposals for Congressional veto of state laws and gave the Supreme Court appellate case jurisdiction over state law because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=275}} The United States had such a geographical extent that it could only be safely governed using a combination of republics. Federal judicial districts would follow those state lines.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=279\u201380}}\n\n====Population power====\nThe British had relied upon a concept of \"[[virtual representation]]\" to give legitimacy to their [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]]. It was not necessary to elect anyone from a large port city, or the American colonies, because the representatives of \"[[rotten borough]]s\", the mostly abandoned medieval fair towns with twenty voters, \"virtually represented\" them. Philadelphia in the colonies was second in population only to London.{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=174\u201375}}\n\nThey were all Englishmen, supposed to be a single people, with one definable interest. Legitimacy came from membership in Parliament of the sovereign realm, not elections from people. As Blackstone explained, the Member is \"not bound ... to consult with, or take the advice, of his constituents.\" As Constitutional historian Gordon Wood elaborated, \"The Commons of England contained all of the people's power and were considered to be the very persons of the people they represented.\"{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=175\u201376}}\n\n{|align=right\n|-\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"1\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Gouverneur Morris 1753.png|<center>''' [[Gouverneur Morris|G. Morris]]''', <small>PA<br>provinces forever</small></center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nWhile the English \"virtual representation\" was hardening into a theory of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], the American theory of representation was moving towards a theory of sovereignty of the people. In their new constitutions written since 1776, Americans required community residency of voters and representatives, expanded suffrage, and equalized populations in voting districts. There was a sense that representation \"had to be proportioned to the population.\"{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=184, 186}} The Convention would apply the new principle of \"sovereignty of the people\" both to the House of Representatives, and to the United States Senate.\n\n=====House changes=====\nOnce the Great Compromise was reached, delegates in Convention then agreed to a decennial census to count the population. The Americans themselves did not allow for universal suffrage for all adults.{{refn| group = lower-alpha|But because the 18th Century Founders did not choose universal suffrage for representatives or for direct proposition referendums does not mean that they did not have to argue the point down and outvote their opponents. In a letter to James Sullivan, May 26, 1776, John Adams asked rhetorically, \"Shall we say, that every member of the community, old and young, male and female, as well as rich and poor, must consent, expressly, to every act of legislation?\" His answer was, for 1776, No.{{sfn|Wood|1998|p=182}}}} Their sort of \"virtual representation\" said that those voting in a community could understand and themselves represent non-voters when they had like interests that were unlike other political communities. There were enough differences among people in different American communities for those differences to have a meaningful social and economic reality. Thus New England colonial legislatures would not tax communities which had not yet elected representatives. When the royal governor of Georgia refused to allow representation to be seated from four new counties, the legislature refused to tax them.{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=177\u201378, 183}}\n\nThe 1776 Americans had begun to demand expansion of the franchise, and in each step, they found themselves pressing towards a philosophical \"actuality of consent.\"{{sfn|Wood|1998|p=179}} The Convention determined that the power of the people, should be felt in the House of Representatives. For the U.S. Congress, persons alone were counted. Property was not counted.\n\n=====Senate changes=====\nThe Convention found it more difficult to give expression to the will of the people in new states. What state might be \"lawfully arising\" outside the boundaries of the existing thirteen states?{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=66}} The new government was like the old, to be made up of pre-existing states. Now there was to be admission of new states. Regular order would provide new states by state legislatures for Kentucky, Tennessee and Maine. But the Congress of the Confederation had by its [[Northwest Ordnance]] presented the Convention with a new issue. Settlers in the Northwest Territory might one day constitute themselves into \"no more than five\" states. More difficult still, most delegates anticipated adding alien peoples of Canada, Louisiana and Florida to United States territory.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=282}} Generally in American history, European citizens of empire were given U.S. citizenship on territorial acquisition. Should they become states?\n\nSome delegates were reluctant to expand into any so \"remote wilderness\". It would retard the commercial development of the east. They would be easily influenced, \"foreign gold\" would corrupt them. Western peoples were the least desirable Americans, only good for perpetual provinces.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|pp=282\u201383}} There were so many foreigners moving out west, there was no telling how things would turn out. These were poor people, they could not pay their fair share of taxes. It would be \"suicide\" for the original states. New states could become a majority in the Senate, they would abuse their power, \"enslaving\" the original thirteen. If they also loved liberty, and could not tolerate eastern state dominance, they would be justified in civil war. Western trade interests could drag the country into an inevitable war with Spain for the Mississippi River.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=80\u201381, 176\u201378}} As time wore on, any war for the Mississippi River was obviated by the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the 1812 American [[Battle of New Orleans|victory at New Orleans]].\n\nEven if there were to be western states, a House representation of 40,000 might be too small, too easy for the westerners. \"States\" had been declared out west already. They called themselves republics, and set up their own courts directly from the people without colonial charters. In [[Transylvania (colony)|Transylvania]], [[Westsylvania]], [[State of Franklin|Franklin]], and Vandalia, \"legislatures\" met with emissaries from British and Spanish Empires in violation of the Articles of Confederation, just as the sovereign states had done.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|This point was the principal reason for Maryland's reluctance to ratify the Articles in the first place, delaying its unanimous adoption from 1777 to 1783. Luther Martin (MD) stopped any spontaneously arising western claim of independent statehood by ensuring that the United States owned all the backlands ceded by the states.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=176}}}} In the Constitution as written, no majorities in Congress could break up the larger states without their consent.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=282}}\n\n\"New state\" advocates had no fear of western states achieving a majority one day. For example, the British sought to curb American growth. That brought hate, then separation. Follow the same rule, get the same results. Congress has never been able to discover a better rule than majority rule. If they grow, let them rule. As they grow, they must get all their supplies from eastern businesses. Character is not determined by points of a compass. States admitted are equals, they will be made up of our brethren. Commit to right principles, even if the right way, one day, benefits other states. They will be free like ourselves, their pride will not allow anything but equality.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=179\u201380}}\n\nIt was at this time in the Convention that Reverend [[Manasseh Cutler]] arrived to lobby for western land sales. He brought acres of land grants to parcel out. Their sales would fund most of the U.S. government expenditures for its first few decades. There were allocations for the Ohio Company stockholders at the Convention, and for others delegates too. Good to his word, in December 1787, Cutler led a small band of pioneers into the Ohio Valley.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=181, 184}}\n\nThe provision for admitting new states became relevant at the purchase of Louisiana. It was constitutionally justifiable under the \"treaty making\" power of the federal government. The agrarian advocates sought to make the purchase of land that had never been administered, conquered, or formally ceded to any of the original thirteen states. Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans would divide the Louisiana Purchase into states, speeding land sales to finance the federal government with no new taxes. The new populations of new states would swamp the commercial states in the Senate. They would populate the House with egalitarian Democrat-Republicans to overthrow the Federalists.{{refn|group = lower-alpha|Federalists ruled the first twelve years of government with a President by Washington and Adams. The Democratic-Republicans ruled for the next twenty-four, and arguably after one-term John Quincy Adams, for another thirty years under the Jacksonian Democrats.}} Jefferson dropped the proposal of Constitutional amendment to permit the purchase, and with it, his notion of a confederation of sovereign states.{{sfn|McDonald|1958|p=285}}\n\n===Final document===\nAfter nearly four months of debate, on September 8, 1787, the final text of the Constitution was set down and revised.  Then, an official copy of the document was [[Engrossed bill|engrossed]] by [[Jacob Shallus]].  The effort consisted of copying the text (prelude, articles and endorsement) on four sheets of [[vellum]] [[parchment]], made from treated animal skin and measuring approximately {{convert|28|in|cm}} by {{convert|23|in|cm}}, probably with a [[goose]] [[quill]].

Though amendments were debated, they were all defeated. On September 28, 1787, the Congress of the Confederation resolved \"unanimously\" to transmit the Constitution to state legislatures for submitting to a ratification convention according to the Constitutional procedure.{{sfn|Maier|2010|pp=54\u201358}} Several states enlarged the numbers qualified just for electing ratification delegates. In doing so, they went beyond the Constitution's provision for the most voters for the state legislature.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Connecticut expanded electorate to add all town meeting voters;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=134}} New Hampshire dropped certain property requirements, and added town delegates;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=218}} Rhode Island put the question to a referendum which rejected the ratification convention, the Federalist minority centered in Newport and Providence boycotted the election;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=223}} Virginia dropped \"legal and Constitutional requirements\" to expand the freehold electorate;{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=228}} New York dropped property requirements, timed assembly elections at the same time, and allowed up to five sequential days of voting until the voting rolls were \"complete\".{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=327}}}}\n\nDelaware, on December 7, 1787, became the first State to ratify the new Constitution, with its vote being unanimous. Pennsylvania ratified on December 12, 1787, by a vote of 46 to 23 (66.67%). New Jersey ratified on December 19, 1787, and Georgia on January 2, 1788, both unanimously. The requirement of ratification by nine states, set by Article Seven of the Constitution, was met when New Hampshire voted to ratify, on June 21, 1788.\n\nIn New York, fully two thirds of the convention delegates were at first opposed to the Constitution. Hamilton led the Federalist campaign, which included the fast-paced appearance of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' in New York newspapers. An attempt to attach conditions to ratification almost succeeded, but on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a recommendation that a bill of rights be appended. The vote was close \u2013 yeas 30 (52.6%), nays 27 \u2013 due largely to Hamilton's forensic abilities and his reaching a few key compromises with moderate anti-Federalists led by [[Melancton Smith]].{{refn| group = lower-alpha |Opposition to ratification was led by Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]; the opposition also suggested that New York reserve the right to withdraw if the Constitution were not amended. Madison led the first session of the first Congress to propose amendments, and ten of the twelve were made Constitutional.}}\n\nFollowing Massachusetts's lead, the Federalist minorities in both Virginia and New York were able to obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments.<!-- ref name=\"MaierPauline_a\" -->{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=431}} A minority of the Constitution's critics continued to oppose the Constitution. Maryland's [[Luther Martin]] argued that the federal convention had exceeded its authority; he still called for amending the Articles.{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=430}} Article 13 of the Articles of Confederation stated that the union created under the Articles was \"perpetual\" and that any alteration must be \"agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State\".<ref name=\"Articles of Confederation\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation|title=Articles of Confederation|accessdate=2009-07-18|author=[[WikiSource]]}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the unanimity required under the Articles made all attempts at reform impossible. Martin's allies such as New York's [[John Lansing, Jr.]], dropped moves to obstruct the Convention's process. They began to take exception to the Constitution \"as it was\", seeking amendments. Several conventions saw supporters for \"amendments before\" shift to a position of \"amendments after\" for the sake of staying in the Union. New York Anti's \"circular letter\" was sent to each state legislature proposing a second constitutional convention for \"amendments before\". It failed in the state legislatures. Ultimately only North Carolina and Rhode Island would wait for amendments from Congress before ratifying.{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=431}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; float:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ece9f8;\"| The Constitution was ratified by the states<br>in the following order:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/ratifications.html|title=Ratification Dates and Votes \u2013 The U.S. Constitution Online|author=|date=|work=USConstitution.net|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" rowspan=\"2\"|<abbr title=\"Order of state's ratification\">{{Number sign}}</abbr>\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" rowspan=\"2\"| State\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" colspan=\"2\"| Votes\n|-\n!

On September 13, 1788, the Congress of the Confederation certified that the new Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for it to go into effect. Congress fixed the city of New York as the temporary seat of the new government and set the dates for the election of representatives and presidential electors. It also set the date for operations to begin under the new [[Federal government of the United States|government]].{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=429}} This occurred on March 4, 1789, when the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] convened.\n\nThe membership of the new Congress was decidedly federalist. In the eleven-state (minus North Carolina and Rhode Island) Senate 20 were Federalist and two Anti-federalist (both from Virginia). The House included 48 Federalists and 11 Anti-federalists (from four states: Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and Virginia).{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=433}} On April 6 the House and Senate held a joint meeting to count the electoral vote.

Prior to the Twenty-seventh Amendment, which languished for 202 years, 7 months, 12 days before being ratified (submitted for ratification in 1789 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], but not ratified until 1992), the Twenty-second Amendment held the record for longest time taken to successfully complete the ratification process \u2013 3 years, 11 months, 6 days. The Twenty-sixth Amendment holds the record for shortest time taken \u2013 3 months, 8 days.<ref>For dates proposed and ratified: U.S. Congress, House.

The debates in the state ratifying conventions centered around the absence of anything equivalent to the bill of rights found in several state constitutions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: With a Summary of the Actions of the States in Ratification of the Provisions Thereof|year=1961|publisher=Virginia Department on Constitutional Government|location=Richmond, Virginia|editor=James J. Kilpatrick}}</ref> [[George Mason]], a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, and the author of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], refused to sign the document because he felt it did not specifically spell out or protect individual rights sufficiently. He also opposed the constitution when it was brought before the state for ratification. He acquiesced and the convention voted narrowly to give its assent only after it was decided that a list of twenty proposed amendments be sent along with the state's resolution of ratification. Delegates to [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779\u20131780|Massachusetts' convention]] had many of the same concerns, and along with its notification of approval made a request for nine alterations, the first among them being \"that it be explicitly declared that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved to the states to be exercised by them.\" New York, not to be outdone, appended a list of thirty-two requested amendments plus a lengthy statement of ''impressions'' and ''explanations'' about the new Constitution to their affirmative vote.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe sharp Anti-Federalist critique of the Constitution did not abate after it became operational, and by the time the [[First United States Congress|First Congress]] convened in March 1789, there existed widespread sentiment in both the House and Senate in favor of making alterations. That September, Congress adopted twelve amendments and sent to the states for ratification. Ten of these were ratified by the required number of states in December 1791 and became part of the Constitution. These amendments enumerate freedoms not explicitly indicated in the main body of the Constitution, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, a free press, and free assembly; the right to keep and bear arms; freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, security in personal effects, and freedom from warrants issued without probable cause; indictment by a [[grand jury]] for a [[Capital punishment|capital]] or \"infamous crime\"; guarantee of a speedy, public trial with an impartial [[Jury trial|jury]]; and prohibition of double jeopardy. In addition, the Bill of Rights reserves for the people any rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution and reserves all powers not specifically granted to the federal government to the people or the States.\n\n===Subsequent amendments===\n{{Wikisource|Additional amendments to the United States Constitution}}\nAmendments to the Constitution subsequent to the Bill of Rights cover a wide range of subjects. Several have added significant content to the original document. One of the most far-reaching is the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]], ratified in 1868, which establishes a clear and simple definition of [[citizenship in the United States|citizenship]] and guarantees equal treatment under the law. Also significant are the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]], [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth]], and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth]], which were enacted to extend the [[Suffrage|right to vote]] to persons previously considered ineligible and also to protect their exercise of that right.

Calhoun]]]]\nIn [[History of the United States|United States history]], four periods of widespread Constitutional criticism have been characterized by the idea that specific political powers belong to [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] and not to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]\u2014a doctrine commonly known as [[states rights]]. At each stage, states' rights advocates failed to develop a preponderance in public opinion or to sustain the democratic political will required to alter the generally held constitutional understanding and political practice in the United States. At its adoption among the people in the state ratification conventions, the \"men of original principles\" opposed the new national government as violating the [[Whig (British political party)#American impact|Whig philosophy]] generally accepted among the original thirteen colonies in 1776. According to this view, Congress as a legislature should be only equal to any state legislature, and only the people in each state might be sovereign. They are now referred to as the [[Anti-Federalists]] in American historiography. The proponents of \"state sovereignty\" and \"states rights\" were outvoted in eleven of thirteen state ratification conventions, then thirteen of thirteen, to \"ordain and establish\" the Constitution.\n\nDuring [[Andrew Jackson]]'s administration, South Carolina objected to U.S. government's \"[[Tariff of 1828|tariff of abominations]]\" collected as federal duties in Charleston Harbor. The [[Nullification Crisis]] ensued. Justification for the nullifiers was found in the U.S. Senate speeches and writings of [[John C. Calhoun]]. He defended slavery against the Constitutional provisions allowing its statutory regulation or its eventual abolition by Constitutional amendment, most notably in his [[John C. Calhoun#Disquisition on Government|Disquisition on Government]]. The crisis was averted when President Jackson, a former Major General, declared he would march a U.S. army into South Carolina and hang the first nullifier he saw from the first tree, and a new negotiated tariff, the [[Compromise Tariff of 1833]], satisfactory to South Carolina was enacted.  Despite this, a states-rights-based defense of slavery persisted amongst Southerners until the American Civil War; conversely, Northerners explored nullification of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850#Nullification|Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]. Abraham Lincoln kept a portrait of Andrew Jackson above his desk at the War Department for the duration of the American Civil War as a clear symbol of Lincoln's intent and resolve as well as to draw attention to an executive precedent for Lincoln's actions.\n\nIn the mid-19th Century during the administrations of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant]], the United States suffered a tragic passage through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. An important survey of the philosophical and legal underpinnings of \"States Rights\" as held by secessionists and [[Lost Cause]] advocates afterwards is found in the speeches of Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] and his [[Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]. Davis defended secession by appealing to the \"original principles\" of the Founders' 1776 Revolutionary generation, and by expanding on [[William Blackstone]]'s doctrine of legislative supremacy. By the elections of 1872, all states which had been admitted to the United States in accordance with the Constitution were fully represented in the U.S. Congress.\n\n[[File:Jefferson Davis 1853 daguerreotype-restored.png|thumb|upright=1.0|right|[[Jefferson Davis]]]]\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court 1954 holding in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] used National Guard and U.S. paratroopers to enforce the rulings of the Federal Courts as they pertained to the Constitution. The \"States Rights\" doctrine was again appealed to during the mid-20th Century resistance to racial integration in the schools, notably in Arkansas' [[Little Rock Nine]], Alabama's [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]], and Virginia's [[Massive Resistance]]. Public schools in every state are now racially integrated by law under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe tradition is seen in many shorter episodes of limited minority protest against the United States. During the War of 1812, Federalists conducted a [[Hartford Convention]] proposing New England secession during wartime to reopen trade with the declared enemy of the United States. It led to accusations of treason and the demise of the [[Federalist Party]] as a force in American politics. In 1921, the Maryland Attorney General sued to block [[Women's suffrage|woman suffrage]]. He argued in ''[[Leser v. Garnett]]'' that state legislatures were Constitutionally the sole determiners of who should vote in what federal or state elections, and that the 19th Amendment was improper. The Supreme Court's judicial review of the state court findings held that the 19th Amendment was Constitutional, and that it applied to the women's right to vote in every state. Women now vote in every state under the authority of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOne exceptional example of \"states rights\" persuading overwhelming majorities in a democratic and sustained way, and so transforming the nation came in the [[John Adams]] administration. Fear had spread that radical democratic sentiment might turn subversive as it had in the French [[Reign of Terror]]. But the Federalist-sponsored [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] meant to preempt the danger led to suppression of opposition press. The political reaction in the [[Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] sparked public opposition against the Federalist policy and led to twenty-four years of Constitutionally elected [[Democratic-Republican Party]] rule through six administrations of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, opponents of federal laws prohibiting the sale and possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] have based their objections partially on states' rights grounds, as have opponents of federal laws and regulations pertaining to [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|firearms]]. States' rights under the constitution has also been recently raised as an issue on a number of other occasions, most notably regarding [[Common Core Standards|Common Core]], the [[Affordable Care Act]], and [[Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States|same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/246582-states-move-to-counter-gay-marriage-ruling|title=States move to counter gay marriage ruling|author=Tim Devaney|publisher=TheHill |date=2015-06-30}}</ref>\n\n==History of the physical document==\nAt first, little interest was shown in the parchment object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801\u20131809) but having left Washington, he had lost track of it in the years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the Constitution. In 1883 historian [[J. Franklin Jameson]] found the parchment folded in a small tin box on the floor of a closet at the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building|State, War and Navy Building]]. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a safe.<ref>Robert G. Ferris and James H. Charleton, ''The Signers of the Constitution'' (1986) p. 245</ref>\n\nThe two parchment documents were turned over to the Library of Congress by executive order, and in 1924 President Coolidge dedicated the bronze-and-marble shrine for public display of the Constitution in the main building. The parchments were laid over moisture absorbing cellulose paper, vacuum-sealed between double panes of insulated plate glass, and protected from light by a gelatin film. Although building construction of the Archives Building was completed in 1935, in December 1941 they were moved from the Library of Congress until September 1944, and stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository, [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]], along with the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address.<ref>Stephen Puleo, American Treasures: The Secret Efforts to Save the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Gettysburg Address.</ref> In 1951 following a study by the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to protect from atmosphere, insects, mold and light, the parchments were re-encased with special light filters, inert helium gas and proper humidity. They were transferred to the National Archives in 1952.<ref>Ferris and Charleton, ''The Signers of the Constitution'' (1986) pp. 246\u201348</ref>\n\nSince 1952, the \"Charters of Freedom\" have been displayed in the Rotunda of the National Archives Building. Visual inspections have been enhanced by electronic imaging. Changes in the cases led to removal from their cases July 2001, preservation treatment by conservators, and installment in new encasements for public display in September 2003.<ref>Since 1987, inspections were enhanced by an electronic imaging monitoring system developed for NARA<!--NASA?--> by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. In 1995, conservators noticed changes in the glass encasements of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Glass experts from Libby-Owens-Ford (the original manufacturer of the encasement glass) and the Corning Glass Museum identified signs of deterioration. Both the glass experts and the National Archives Advisory Committee on Preservation recommended that the Charters be re-encased by 2002 for document safety.

Drawing on religious and [[supernatural]] phenomena, the Guardians of Time are stone statues that are cloaked in hooded robes and situated to seem like they are moving forth in some kind of ritual. In some cases the figures stand alone; in other instances, they are grouped together as if whispering to each other. Kielnhofer places his statues in public places like ancient castles, old mines, plazas, and parks. They are installed and moved without fanfare, heightening the eerie, mystic aura they give off. The first of these mysterious figures was created in 2006. Since then, Kielnhofer continues to create and install these statues all over the world. In 2012, the artist created the first of a new series of miniature guardians out of plastic.<ref>[http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2011/02/guardians-time-mystic-sculpture-manfred-kielnhofer/] recalled at October 29, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Kielnhofer developed a new sort of 'act photographs', which involves the construction of a waterplate in his studio, where he can take photos of models sitting or lying down, likely on a mirror.\n\nIn 2010 he developed the concept of the [[Light Art Biennale Austria 2010]] with [[Martina Schettina]].<ref>[http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/kultur/art16,456017 Ulrike Breit in: Lichtkunst-Biennale: International und heimisch, leuchtend und blinkend, O\u00d6N Kultur] recalled at September 13, 2010</ref>\n\nThe Interlux-Chair, Kielnhofers artwork shown at the biennial, was registered in the design-database of the [[Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien|MAK]], the Museum for Applied Arts in Vienna.<ref>[http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id%3D1868%26amp%3Bstyle%3Dimage&object_id=7226&style=image MAK-Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093430/http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id=1868&amp%3Bstyle=image&object_id=7226&style=image |date=July 6, 2011 }}(recalled at September 30, 2010)</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Establishment of the first miniature guardian.

Since 2000 he lives as a freelance artist in [[Linz]]. 2005 he launched Gallery Artpark in Linz.\n\n== Work ==\nKielnhofer's most famous work is, \"[[Guardians of Time (Art)|Guardians of Time]]\". Drawing on religious and [[supernatural]] phenomena, the Guardians of Time are stone statues that are cloaked in hooded robes and situated to seem like they are moving forth in some kind of ritual. In some cases the figures stand alone; in other instances, they are grouped together as if whispering to each other. Kielnhofer places his statues in public places like ancient castles, old mines, plazas, and parks. They are installed and moved without fanfare, heightening the eerie, mystic aura they give off. The first of these mysterious figures was created in 2006. Since then, Kielnhofer continues to create and install these statues all over the world. In 2012, the artist created the first of a new series of miniature guardians out of plastic.<ref>[http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2011/02/guardians-time-mystic-sculpture-manfred-kielnhofer/] recalled at October 29, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Kielnhofer developed a new sort of 'act photographs', which involves the construction of a waterplate in his studio, where he can take photos of models sitting or lying down, likely on a mirror.\n\nIn 2010 he developed the concept of the [[Light Art Biennale Austria 2010]] with [[Martina Schettina]].<ref>[http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/kultur/art16,456017 Ulrike Breit in: Lichtkunst-Biennale: International und heimisch, leuchtend und blinkend, O\u00d6N Kultur] recalled at September 13, 2010</ref>\n\nThe Interlux-Chair, Kielnhofers artwork shown at the biennial, was registered in the design-database of the [[Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien|MAK]], the Museum for Applied Arts in Vienna.<ref>[http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id%3D1868%26amp%3Bstyle%3Dimage&object_id=7226&style=image MAK-Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093430/http://dip.mak.at/detail_product.php?designer_id=1868&search=%2Fsearchresult_product.php%3Fdesigner_id=1868&amp%3Bstyle=image&object_id=7226&style=image |date=July 6, 2011 }}(recalled at September 30, 2010)</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Establishment of the first miniature guardian.
