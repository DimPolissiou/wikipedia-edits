The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]].

She received the Kaula Sannyasa and the name Sri Bharati from [[Swami Saradananda]].

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world... Hence it is her Math that I want first... Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished.... Hence we must first build a Math for Mother.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cBrother, in this terrible winter I am lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds may be collected for Mother\u2019s Math.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cWith the Holy Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) as the centre of inspiration, a Math is to be established on the eastern bank of the [[Ganga]].\u201d<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1989), vol.7, p.214</ref>\n\n\u201cIn the Women's Math there shall be no connection with monks, and in the Math for Men no connection with nuns.\u201d<ref>''Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math'', Belur, (1967), p.2</ref>\n\nSwami Vivekananda wanted women to set right their own problems. He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of Sri Ramakrishna such as Gauri Ma, Yogin Ma, and Golap M. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition. Daily ritual worships are performed here by the nuns. The birthdays of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and other holy personalities are celebrated here, besides the Hindu festivals. Religious discourse and lectures are also done regularly.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mathhq.php</ref>\n\nThe training of brahmacharinis and novices are an essential activity of the Sri Sarada Math.\n\n== Publication ==\n''Nibodhata'', is the Bengali journal published every two months. It contains articles on various matters related to religion, science, art, culture, society, history.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/nibodhata.php</ref>\n\n''Samvit'' is the English journal published by Sri Sarada Math's New Delhi Center. Samvit was first published in 1980, through the efforts of Revered Pravrajika Muktiprana, the first General Secretary of Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The journal covers various religio-spiritual issues.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/samvit.php</ref>\n\nBesides journals, the Sri Sarada Math and its branch centres also have published several biographies of holy personalities, and books on Ramakrishna-Vedanta.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.srisaradamath.org/\n* http://srisaradamathrb.org/\n* https://saradavedanta.org/sri-sarada-math/\n* http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html\n\n[[Category:Hindu new religious movements]]\n[[Category:Ramakrishna Mission]]\n[[Category:Hindu organisations based in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu monasteries in India]]\n[[Category:Hinduism]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{Lead missing|date=April 2020}}\n{{POV|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n'''Sri Sarada Math''' is named after [[Sri Sarada Devi]],<ref> Udbodhan (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> the consort of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] and founded on 2 December 1954 in [[Dakshineswar]], [[Kolkata]].

Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]]. Following the guidance of her Guru and other disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]], Sarala Devi lived in [[Varanasi]] from 1927 to 1954, performing spiritual disciplines. She received the Kaula Sannyasa and the name Sri Bharati from [[Swami Saradananda]]. Assuming the leadership of the Sri Sarada Math, Bharatiprana served from December 1954 to January 1973, till her Mahasamadhi.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.232</ref>\nHer pious life was written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''Bharatiprana Smriti Katha'' and later translated in [[English language|English]] by Pravrajika Atmaprana as Pravrajika Bharatiprana.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.233</ref>\n\n=== Pravrajika Mokshaprana ===\n[[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]] (1915-1999) was the second President.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mokshaprana.php</ref> She also served as the headmistress of Sister Nivedita's Girls' School from 1946 to 1948.<ref>Mokshaprana, Pravrajika. \"Sri Sarada Society Notes Fall 1999, Volume 5, Issue 2\" (PDF). Sri Sarada Math.</ref><ref>Mokshaprana, Pravrajika. \"Guiding lights \u2013 Presidents and First General Secretary of Sri Sarada Math & Ramakrishna Sarada Mission\".</ref>\n\n=== Pravrajika Muktiprana ===\nPravrajika Muktiprana (1915-1994) was the third President of the Math. Her parents were disciples of [[Swami Shivananda]], a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/muktiprana.php</ref>\n\n=== Pravrajika Shraddhaprana ===\n[[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]] (1918-2009) was the fourth President and the last of the first batch of Sannyasinis.<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.20</ref>\n\n== The Idea ==\nThe idea to form a monastic institution for women was first envisioned by [[Swami Vivekananda]], long before he established the well-known [[Ramakrishna Math]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\nMother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world... Hence it is her Math that I want first... Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished.... Hence we must first build a Math for Mother.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cBrother, in this terrible winter I am lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds may be collected for Mother\u2019s Math.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cWith the Holy Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) as the centre of inspiration, a Math is to be established on the eastern bank of the [[Ganga]].\u201d<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1989), vol.7, p.214</ref>\n\n\u201cIn the Women's Math there shall be no connection with monks, and in the Math for Men no connection with nuns.\u201d<ref>''Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math'', Belur, (1967), p.2</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition. Daily ritual worships are performed here by the nuns. The birthdays of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and other holy personalities are celebrated here, besides the Hindu festivals. Religious discourse and lectures are also done regularly.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mathhq.php</ref>\n\nThe training of brahmacharinis and novices are an essential activity of the Sri Sarada Math.\n\n== Publication ==\n''Nibodhata'', is the Bengali journal published every two months. It contains articles on various matters related to religion, science, art, culture, society, history.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/nibodhata.php</ref>\n\n''Samvit'' is the English journal published by Sri Sarada Math's New Delhi Center. Samvit was first published in 1980, through the efforts of Revered Pravrajika Muktiprana, the first General Secretary of Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The journal covers various religio-spiritual issues.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/samvit.php</ref>\n\nBesides journals, the Sri Sarada Math and its branch centres also have published several biographies of holy personalities, and books on Ramakrishna-Vedanta.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.srisaradamath.org/\n* http://srisaradamathrb.org/\n* https://saradavedanta.org/sri-sarada-math/\n* http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html\n\n[[Category:Hindu new religious movements]]\n[[Category:Ramakrishna Mission]]\n[[Category:Hindu organisations based in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu monasteries in India]]\n[[Category:Hinduism]]\n", "name_user": "Ranee Narendranath", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Idea:New paragraph", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Sarada_Math"}

In the book, Fromm explores humanity's shifting relationship with [[liberty|freedom]], with particular regard to the personal consequences of its absence. His special emphasis is the [[psychosocial]] conditions that facilitated the rise of [[Nazism]].\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Fromm's concept of freedom===\n\nFromm distinguishes between 'freedom from' ([[negative freedom]]) and 'freedom to' ([[positive freedom]]). The former refers to emancipation from restrictions such as social conventions placed on individuals by other people or institutions. This is the kind of freedom typified by the [[existentialism]] of [[Sartre]], and has often been fought for historically but, according to Fromm, on its own it can be a destructive force unless accompanied by a creative element - 'freedom to' - the use of freedom to employ  the total integrated personality in creative acts. This, he argues, necessarily implies a true connectedness with others that goes beyond the superficial bonds of conventional social intercourse: \"...in the spontaneous realization of the self, man unites himself anew with the world...\"\n\nIn the process of becoming freed from authority, we are often left with feelings of hopelessness (he likens this process to the individuation of infants in the normal course of [[child development]]) that will not abate until we use our 'freedom to' and develop some form of replacement of the old order. However, a common substitute for exercising \"freedom to\" or [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is to submit to an [[authoritarian]] system that replaces the old order with another of different external appearance but identical function for the individual: to eliminate uncertainty by prescribing what to think and how to act. Fromm characterizes this as a [[dialectic]] historical process whereby the original situation is the [[thesis]] and the emancipation from it the [[antithesis]]. The [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] is only reached when something has replaced the original order and provided humans with a new security. Fromm does not indicate that the new system will necessarily be an improvement. In fact, Fromm indicates this will only break the never-ending cycle of negative freedom that society submits to.\n\n===Freedom in history===\n\nFreedom, argues Fromm, became an important issue in the 20th century, being seen as something to be fought for and defended. However, it has not always occupied such a prominent place in people's thinking and, as an experience, is not necessarily something that is unambiguously enjoyable.\n\nA major chapter in the book deals with the development of [[Protestantism|Protestant theology]], with a discussion of the work of [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and [[Martin Luther|Luther]]. The collapse of an old social order and the rise of capital led to a more developed awareness that people could be separate autonomous beings and direct their own future rather than simply fulfilling a socioeconomic role. This in turn fed into a new conception of God that had to account for the new freedom while still providing some [[moral authority]]. Luther painted a picture of man's relationship with God that was personal and individuated and free from the influence of the church, while Calvin's doctrine of [[predestination]] suggested that people could not work for salvation but have instead been chosen arbitrarily before they could make any difference. Both of these, argues Fromm, are responses to a freer economic situation. The first gives individuals more freedom to find holiness in the world around them without a complex church structure. The second, although superficially giving the appearance of a kind of [[determinism]] actually provided a way for people to work towards salvation. While people could not change their destinies, they could discover the extent of their holiness by committing themselves to hard work and frugality, both traits that were considered virtuous. In reality this made people work harder to 'prove' to themselves that they were destined for God's kingdom.\n\n===Escaping freedom===\n\nAs 'freedom from' is not an experience we enjoy in itself, Fromm suggests that many people, rather than using it successfully, attempt to minimise its negative effects by developing thoughts and behaviours that provide some form of security. These are as follows:\n#'''Authoritarianism:''' Fromm characterises the authoritarian personality as containing both sadistic and masochistic elements. The authoritarian wishes to gain control over other people in a bid to impose some kind of order on the world, but also wishes to submit to the control of some superior force which may come in the guise of a person or an abstract idea. \n#'''Destructiveness:''' Although this bears a similarity to sadism, Fromm argues that the sadist wishes to gain control over something. A destructive personality wishes to destroy something it cannot bring under its control.\n#'''Conformity:''' This process is seen when people unconsciously incorporate the [[conformity|normative beliefs]] and thought processes of their society and experience them as their own. This allows them to avoid genuine [[free thinking]], which is likely to provoke anxiety.\n\n===Freedom in the 20th century===\n\nFromm analyzes the character of Nazi ideology and suggests that the psychological conditions of Germany after the first world war fed into a desire for some form of new order to restore the nation's pride. This came in the form of [[National Socialism]] and Fromm's interpretation of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' suggests that Hitler had an authoritarian personality structure that not only made him want to rule over Germany in the name of a higher authority (the idea of a natural master race) but also made him an appealing prospect for an insecure middle class that needed some sense of pride and certainty. Fromm suggests there is a propensity to submit to authoritarian regimes when nations experience negative freedom but he sounds a positive note when he claims that the work of cultural evolution hitherto cannot be undone and Nazism does not provide a genuine union with the world.\n\nFromm examines [[democracy]] and [[freedom (political)|freedom]]. Modern democracy and the industrialised nation are models he praises but it is stressed that the kind of external freedom provided by this kind of society can never be utilised to the full without an equivalent inner freedom. Fromm suggests that though we are free from totalitarian influence of any sorts in this kind of society, we are still dominated by the advice of experts and the influence of advertising. The way to become free as an individual is to be spontaneous in our self-expression and in the way we behave. This is crystallised in his existential statement \"there is only one meaning of life: the act of living it\". Fromm counters suggestions that this might lead to social chaos by claiming that being truly in touch with our humanity is to be truly in touch with the needs of those with whom we share the world.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Critical theory]]\n* [[Freudo-Marxism]]\n* ''[[Life Against Death]]''\n* [[Psychohistory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1941 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Farrar & Rinehart books]]\n[[Category:Psychology books]]\n[[Category:Sociology books]]\n[[Category:Works by Erich Fromm]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2007}}\n{{infobox book\n | name = Escape from Freedom\n | image = File:Escape from Freedom, first edition.jpg\n | caption = Cover of the first edition\n | author = [[Erich Fromm]]\n | country = United States\n | language = English\n | subject = [[Social psychology]]\n | publisher = [[Farrar & Rinehart]]\n | pub_date = 1941\n | pages = 257\n | isbn = 0-7448-0014-5\n}}\n{{Frankfurt School}}\n'''''Escape from Freedom''''' is a book by the Frankfurt-born psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]], first published in the United States by [[Farrar & Rinehart]] <ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |author=Funk, Rainer |title=Erich Fromm: His Life and Ideas |publisher=Continuum |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=169, 173 |isbn=0-8264-1224-6}}</ref> in 1941 and a year later as '''''The Fear of Freedom''''' in UK by [[Routledge & Kegan Paul]].
