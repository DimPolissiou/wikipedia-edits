The regiment gained notoriety as the first unit in the Union army to suffer fatal casualties in action during the Civil War in the [[Baltimore Riot of 1861|Baltimore Riot]] and the first militia unit to arrive in [[Washington D.C.]] in response to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] initial [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|call for 75,000 troops]]. Private [[Luther C. Ladd]] of the 6th Massachusetts is often referred to as the first Union soldier killed in action during the war.\n\nIn the years immediately preceding the war and during its first enlistment, the regiment consisted primarily of [[Company (military unit)|companies]] from [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]. During its first term of service, four out of ten companies of the regiment were from [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Edward F. Jones]] commanded the regiment during its first term. He later commanded the [[26th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|26th Massachusetts]] and was awarded the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During its second and third terms of service, the unit was commanded by Colonel Albert S. Follansbee.\n\nThe regiment first enlisted for a \"90-day\" term of service which lasted from April 16 to August 2, 1861. Following their engagement in the Baltimore Riot, the 6th Massachusetts proceeded to Washington and then returned to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] to guard locations within the city as well as the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] station at [[Elkridge, Maryland]]. Their second term of service lasted nine months from August 1862 to June 1863. During this time the 6th Massachusetts was attached to the [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]] and participated in several expeditions and actions in the vicinity of [[Suffolk, Virginia]], most notably the [[Siege of Suffolk]] and the [[Battle of Carrsville]] in April and May 1863. Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt's bravery at Carrsville earned him the [[Medal of Honor]]. The 6th Massachusetts served a third term in response to the call for troops to defend fortifications around Washington. During this term, which lasted 100 days from July to October 1864, the 6th Massachusetts [[garrison]]ed [[Fort C. F. Smith (Arlington, Virginia)|Fort C. F. Smith]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]] and guarded Confederate prisoners of war at [[Fort Delaware]] near the mouth of the [[Delaware River]].\n\n==Earlier units==\nThe 6th Massachusetts regiment that served during the Civil War was formed in 1855 during the reorganization of the Massachusetts militia. Other units dating back to the 18th century were given the designation 6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia.{{sfnp|Hall|1900|p=168}} They were formed and disbanded at various times and although they shared the same numerical designation, there was no continuous unit known as the 6th Massachusetts. One of the units designated as the 6th Massachusetts was a regiment that served during [[King George's War]] in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|Siege of Louisbourg]] in 1745.{{sfnp|General Society of Colonial Wars|1896|p=xviii}} During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the [[6th Massachusetts Regiment]] was engaged in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]], the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]].{{sfnp|Carrington|1876|pp=221 and 336}}\n\n==90-day term of service==\n===Preparations===\n[[File:6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia departing Jersey City 1861.jpg|The 6th Massachusetts en route to Washington, April 18, 1861|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a long column of soldiers at a large train station preparing to board a train]]Shortly after [[South Carolina]] issued its [[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union|Declaration of Secession]], Massachusetts Governor [[John A. Andrew]] anticipated imminent civil war and issued an order on January 16, 1861, to the ten existing Massachusetts units of peacetime militia to immediately reorganize and prepare for active service.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=58}} Colonel Edward F. Jones was the first militia commander to respond to the Governor's order. His letter indicating the regiment's readiness, dated January 21, was brought to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and read in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] by then state Senator [[Benjamin F. Butler]].{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=190}}\n\nOn April 15, 1861, three days after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces fired on [[Fort Sumter]], [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers]] to serve in putting down the insurrection. The call was relayed by Governor Andrew to the existing regiments of Massachusetts militia the same day. Eight companies of the original 6th Massachusetts (one from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]], one from [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], two from [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], and four from Lowell) gathered in Lowell on April 16 and proceeded to Boston.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=14}} That night, the men of the 6th Massachusetts barracked in [[Faneuil Hall|Faneuil]] and [[Boylston Hall (Boston)|Boylston Halls]].{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=77}} The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]], and another from [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total. Thus composed entirely of existing volunteer militia companies, the 6th Massachusetts was made up of volunteer soldiers.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=4}} The regiment proceed that day to the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]], where Governor Andrew presented regimental [[Colours, standards and guidons|colors]] to Colonel Jones. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston for Washington via railroad at 7 p.m. on April 17.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Baltimore Riot===\n[[File:6th Massachusetts Militia attacked in Baltimore 1861.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Mob attacks companies of the 6th Massachusetts Militia on Pratt Street during the Baltimore Riot.|alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a formation of militia soldiers with bayonets fixed surrounded by rioters]]On April 19, 1861, the 6th Massachusetts boarded train cars in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in the early morning hours and departed for Washington via Baltimore. Before the end of the day, the regiment saw combat during the Baltimore Riot. The date was the anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] which began the American Revolution.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=78}}\n\nAlthough Maryland remained in the Union, [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] sentiment and support for the Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of [[sabotage]] to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause [[derailment]] and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=131}}\n\nTrains passing through Baltimore at that time could not proceed directly through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at [[President Street Station]] on the east side of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on [[Pratt Street]] by horsepower to [[Camden Station]] on the west side of Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]], where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=132}} The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=195}} The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=132}}\n\n[[File:Ladd, Luther.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Private Ladd of the 6th Massachusetts was the first Union soldier killed in action during the Civil War.|alt=A sepia toned portrait photograph depicting the head and shoulders of a young man in an elaborate militia uniform. He wears a tall dress uniform hat.]]The blockage of the railroad left four companies, numbering 220 men, at President Street Station with no choice but to march through the city to reach Camden Station, slightly more than one mile away. The size of the crowd obstructing their path was estimated at roughly 10,000.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=196}} [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Follansbee, the senior captain, took charge of the detachment. After crossing the Pratt Street Bridge, which had been partially dismantled by the crowd, Follansbee ordered his men to march at the \"double-quick.\" This roused the crowd further as they perceived the quickened pace as an indication of panic. As well as stones and bricks being thrown, shots were now fired at the 6th Massachusetts from the stores and houses around them. Captain Follansbee gave the order to return fire.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nSeventeen-year-old Private Luther C. Ladd, a factory worker from Lowell, was hit in the head by a piece of scrap iron that was thrown from a rooftop and fractured his skull.{{sfnp|A citizen of Alexandria and an eye witness|1862|p=20}} As he staggered, one of the rioters took Ladd's musket from him and fired, wounding him in the leg.{{sfnp|Thorp|2011|}} Ladd died on Pratt Street. He is known as the first Union soldier to be killed in action during the Civil War.{{sfnp|Thorp|2011|}}{{sfnp|Kimball|1861|p=341}} Three other militiamen were killed during the riot: Private Addison O. Whitney, Private Charles A. Taylor and Corporal Sumner H. Needham. A total of 36 members of the 6th Massachusetts were wounded.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=159}}\n\nA formation of approximately 50 officers of the [[Baltimore Police Department|Baltimore Police]] eventually placed themselves between the rioters and the militiamen, allowing the 6th Massachusetts to proceed to Camden Station.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=133}} The companies boarded the train which quickly got underway for Washington, though the crowd followed the train for some miles attempting to stop it. A total of 12 civilians were killed during the riot and an unknown number were injured.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=79}}\n\n===Garrison duty===\nThe 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, the first unit to arrive in response to Lincoln's call for troops.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=59}} A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north of the [[US Capitol|Capitol]]. Among the crowd was [[Clara Barton]] who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]], Barton gained her first experience in caring for wounded soldiers as she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts.{{sfnp|Oates|1994|pp=3\u20134}}\n\n[[File:6th Massachusetts in Baltimore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The 6th Massachusetts bivouacked in Monument Square in Baltimore on July 1, 1861, at the close of their second garrison encampment in the city.|alt=An antique photograph depicting a city square with a stone monument and a large number of soldiers at rest]]The 6th Massachusetts was barracked in the [[Old Senate Chamber|Senate Chamber]] in the Capitol. The next morning, tensions in Washington were high as rumors circulated of an impending Confederate attack. After reviewing the 6th Massachusetts, Lincoln expressed his anxiety to the members of the regiment, telling them, \"I don't believe there is any North. The Seventh Regiment [New York] is a myth. Rhode Island is not known in our geography any longer. You are the only northern realities.\"{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=59}}{{sfnp|Goodwin|2005|p=354}}\n\nIn the days and weeks after the Baltimore Riot, newspapers and politicians across the country drew comparisons between the Massachusetts militia who had fought on April 19, 1775, at the start of the Revolution and the Massachusetts troops who fought on April 19, 1861.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=60}} Among the 6th Massachusetts were descendants of those [[Minutemen]] who had fought in Lexington and Concord in 1775. Due to the coincidence of the date and the ancestry of some members, the 6th Massachusetts was often called the \"Minutemen of '61.\"{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=193}}\n\nThe 6th Massachusetts remained in Washington until May 5, when they were assigned to garrison a key railroad relay station about 15 miles outside of Baltimore at [[Elkridge, Maryland|Elkridge]].{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}} Their presence there helped keep open the crucial rail line from the northeastern states to Washington.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=61}}\nThe regiment returned to Baltimore on May 13, when [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] Benjamin F. Butler occupied the city with several Union regiments in anticipation of a Confederate attack on Baltimore which never developed. The 6th Massachusetts marched through the city to [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]], where they set up camp for a short stay of three days. On May 16, the regiment returned to the Elkridge relay station. They served out the majority of their term at the relay station and vicinity, except for a second assignment in Baltimore from June 26 to July 1, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\nThe regiment's return to Boston at the close of their 90-day term was delayed slightly by special request of Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. In light of the recent Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], in which the 6th Massachusetts did not participate, he asked the regiment voluntarily remain at Elkridge another week in the event of a Confederate advance on Washington. On July 29, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to break camp and boarded trains for Boston which was reached on August 1. The regiment was mustered out on August 2, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\n==9-month term of service==\n===Organization and departure===\nThe regiment was again activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven of the ten original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was necessary in order to fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=161}} To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=142}} Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at [[Camp Chase (Massachusetts)|Camp Henry Wilson]] in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship ''Plymouth Rock.'' Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=148}}{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=162}}\n\n===Blackwater River expeditions===\n[[File:Five soldiers in Union uniforms of the 6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Five soldiers of the 6th Massachusetts during their second term of service, photo likely taken in camp near Suffolk, Virginia|alt=A sepia toned photograph of five soldiers standing at parade rest in a neat line]] Upon reaching Washington, the regiment was ordered to [[Fortress Monroe]] and from there to [[Suffolk, Virginia]]. The 6th Massachusetts was assigned to the Second Brigade (commanded by Colonel [[Robert Sanford Foster|Robert S. Foster]]) of the First Division of the [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]].{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}} They served garrison and [[Picket (military)|picket]] duty in the vicinity of Suffolk, occasionally taking part in reconnaissance expeditions to the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater River]] (which represented the boundary between the Union occupied counties of southeast Virginia and Confederate territory of the interior) and engaged in minor skirmish actions.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=163}}\n\nTheir first such expedition took place on October 3, 1862, about two weeks after the regiment reached Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts formed a peripheral part of the [[Joint Expedition against Franklin|Expedition against Franklin]], a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near [[Western Branch, Virginia|Western Branch Church]], far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets for the first time in action.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=171}} Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle made a strong impression on the new recruits.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=81}} During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near [[Zuni, Virginia]] and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment\u20142nd Lieutenant Robert G. Barr.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=190}} The regiment did not again leave Suffolk until an expedition on January 29, 1863, again towards the Blackwater River. Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the [[Battle of Deserted House]] in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=164}} The 6th Massachusetts was sharply engaged and lost five killed and seven wounded.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=203}}\n\n===Siege of Suffolk===\nThe majority of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees in front of the defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|pp=79\u201380}} This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn early 1863, Major General [[James Longstreet]] was given command of the Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His objectives were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the [[Siege of Suffolk]] on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied a position on the right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the [[Nansemond River]]. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=164}}\n\nOn May 3, 1863, Longstreet abandoned the siege and began moving his forces north to rejoin the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent in pursuit of the retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the [[Somerton Historic District|Somerton]] Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=184}}\n\n===Battle of Carrsville and Medal of Honor recipient===\nMajor General [[John Adams Dix|John A. Dix]], commanding Union forces at Suffolk, conducted several reconnaissances in force  to determine the disposition of Confederate forces remaining in the region. On May 13, the 6th Massachusetts joined another expedition to the Blackwater River. This was the final action of their second term of service. The column was commanded by Major General Foster and Colonel Follansbee was promoted to command of the [[brigade]] to which the 6th Massachusetts belonged.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=238}} A considerable Confederate force attacked the Union expedition in a sharp engagement on May 14\u201315, 1863, known as the [[Battle of Carrsville]] or the Battle of Holland House. During this fight, the 6th Massachusetts supported the 7th Massachusetts Battery and exchanged in heavy, prolonged firing with the Confederates. The 6th Massachusetts made an advance, driving the enemy into the woods, then were driven back and made a second counter-attack, reclaiming their position at the start of the battle. The regiment suffered casualties of five killed or mortally wounded, twelve wounded and five prisoners.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn the middle of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C perceived that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort to pull them out, he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. In this action, he earned the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, \"When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner.\" Sweatt was eventually released; the three men he endeavored to rescue did not survive.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nOn May 18, the 6th Massachusetts and other regiments fell back to Deserted House outside of Suffolk. On May 20 they were posted in support of artillery at [[Windsor, Virginia]]. Finally, on May 23, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to return to Massachusetts. The regiment reached Boston by steamship on May 26 to be welcomed and addressed in front of the State House by Governor Andrew. The 6th Massachusetts then proceeded to Lowell, where they were received with enthusiastic festivities. The regiment reassembled on June 3, 1863, at Camp Wilson and were mustered out.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=165}} In all during their second enlistment, the regiment lost 13 men killed or mortally wounded in combat and 18 by disease.{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}}\n\n==100-day term of service==\n[[File:United States bonds; or Duress by federal authority- a journal of current events during an imprisonment of fifteen months, at Fort Delaware (1874) (14759557101).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|At Fort Delaware, Union guards (unit unidentified) \"perambulating\" a group of Confederate prisoners around the island|alt=A lithograph of a large column of soldiers without weapons in disorderly dress marching outside a large stone fort being guarded by a few soldiers in dark uniforms holding rifles]]In May 1864, Major General  [[Ulysses S. Grant]] removed fresh troops from the defensive fortifications of Washington and transferred them into the field to strengthen the [[Army of the Potomac]]. To man defenses around the capital in their place, and to relieve regiments at various northern fortifications, Lincoln issued a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days. This measure would allow enough time to raise longer-term regiments to occupy rearward defenses. The 6th Massachusetts was activated for a third time in response to this call for 100-day regiments.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=297}}\n\nThe regiment organized at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts]], just outside of Boston beginning July 13, 1864.

Their month of service there was mundane, consisting of regular drills, inspections and fatigue duty.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=298}}\n\nOn August 21, 1864, the regiment was ordered to move. They traveled by rail to Philadelphia and by steamship to [[Fort Delaware]] on [[Pea Patch Island]] on the [[Delaware River]]. The regiment relieved the [[157th Ohio Infantry]] and commenced garrison and guard duty over the 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war held at Fort Delaware.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=167}} There had been widespread instances of mistreatment of prisoners by Union units that previously garrisoned the fort, including abuse and theft of prisoners' property. Members of the 6th Massachusetts condemned these practices and generally refrained from similar abuses.{{sfnp|Temple|2003|p=113}} Their duty consisted of standing post and escorting prisoners on various work details. The fort was large and in excellent condition. The barracks were newly constructed, comfortable, and included a library and other amenities. The field and staff officers as well as several company officers were joined by their wives and children at the post. The regimental historian recorded that many members of the unit remember their time at Fort Delaware as extremely pleasant.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=301}}\n\nOn October 19, 1864, the 6th Massachusetts was relieved and began the journey back to Boston, which they reached on October 21.

An appropriation of $2,000 was secured from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a further $2,700 was provided by the city. The monument was constructed in front of the Lowell courthouse in what is now known as Monument Square. Ladd and Whitney had both been buried in the [[Lowell Cemetery]]. On April 28, 1865, their remains were re-interred in a vault beneath the monument. The monument was to be dedicated on April 19, 1865, on the anniversary of the Baltimore Riot, but the ceremonies were delayed due to the [[assassination of President Lincoln]]. It was instead dedicated on the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, a local holiday, June 17, 1865. The procession numbered more than 4,500 people.

The regiment gained notoriety as the first unit in the Union army to suffer fatal casualties in action during the Civil War in the [[Baltimore Riot of 1861|Baltimore Riot]] and the first militia unit to arrive in [[Washington D.C.]] in response to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] initial [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|call for 75,000 troops]]. Private [[Luther C. Ladd]] of the 6th Massachusetts is often referred to as the first Union soldier killed in action during the war.\n\nIn the years immediately preceding the war and during its first enlistment, the regiment consisted primarily of [[Company (military unit)|companies]] from [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]. During its first term of service, four out of ten companies of the regiment were from [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Edward F. Jones]] commanded the regiment during its first term. He later commanded the [[26th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|26th Massachusetts]] and was awarded the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During its second and third terms of service, the unit was commanded by Colonel Albert S. Follansbee.\n\nThe regiment first enlisted for a \"90-day\" term of service which lasted from April 16 to August 2, 1861. Following their engagement in the Baltimore Riot, the 6th Massachusetts proceeded to Washington and then returned to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] to guard locations within the city as well as the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] station at [[Elkridge, Maryland]]. Their second term of service lasted nine months from August 1862 to June 1863. During this time the 6th Massachusetts was attached to the [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]] and participated in several expeditions and actions in the vicinity of [[Suffolk, Virginia]], most notably the [[Siege of Suffolk]] and the [[Battle of Carrsville]] in April and May 1863. Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt's bravery at Carrsville earned him the [[Medal of Honor]]. The 6th Massachusetts served a third term in response to the call for troops to defend fortifications around Washington. During this term, which lasted 100 days from July to October 1864, the 6th Massachusetts [[garrison]]ed [[Fort C. F. Smith (Arlington, Virginia)|Fort C. F. Smith]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]] and guarded Confederate prisoners of war at [[Fort Delaware]] near the mouth of the [[Delaware River]].\n\n==Earlier units==\nThe 6th Massachusetts regiment that served during the Civil War was formed in 1855 during the reorganization of the Massachusetts militia. Other units dating back to the 18th century were given the designation 6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia.{{sfnp|Hall|1900|p=168}} They were formed and disbanded at various times and although they shared the same numerical designation, there was no continuous unit known as the 6th Massachusetts. One of the units designated as the 6th Massachusetts was a regiment that served during [[King George's War]] in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|Siege of Louisbourg]] in 1745.{{sfnp|General Society of Colonial Wars|1896|p=xviii}} During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the [[6th Massachusetts Regiment]] was engaged in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]], the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]].{{sfnp|Carrington|1876|pp=221 and 336}}\n\n==90-day term of service==\n===Preparations===\n[[File:6th Regiment Massachusetts Militia departing Jersey City 1861.jpg|The 6th Massachusetts en route to Washington, April 18, 1861|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a long column of soldiers at a large train station preparing to board a train]]Shortly after [[South Carolina]] issued its [[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union|Declaration of Secession]], Massachusetts Governor [[John A. Andrew]] anticipated imminent civil war and issued an order on January 16, 1861, to the ten existing Massachusetts units of peacetime militia to immediately reorganize and prepare for active service.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=58}} Colonel Edward F. Jones was the first militia commander to respond to the Governor's order. His letter indicating the regiment's readiness, dated January 21, was brought to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and read in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] by then state Senator [[Benjamin F. Butler]].{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=190}}\n\nOn April 15, 1861, three days after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces fired on [[Fort Sumter]], [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers]] to serve in putting down the insurrection. The call was relayed by Governor Andrew to the existing regiments of Massachusetts militia the same day. Eight companies of the original 6th Massachusetts (one from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]], one from [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], two from [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], and four from Lowell) gathered in Lowell on April 16 and proceeded to Boston.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=14}} That night, the men of the 6th Massachusetts barracked in [[Faneuil Hall|Faneuil]] and [[Boylston Hall (Boston)|Boylston Halls]].{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=77}} The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]], and another from [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total. Thus composed entirely of existing volunteer militia companies, the 6th Massachusetts was made up of volunteer soldiers.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=4}} The regiment proceed that day to the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]], where Governor Andrew presented regimental [[Colours, standards and guidons|colors]] to Colonel Jones. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston for Washington via railroad at 7 p.m. on April 17.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Baltimore Riot===\n[[File:6th Massachusetts Militia attacked in Baltimore 1861.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Mob attacks companies of the 6th Massachusetts Militia on Pratt Street during the Baltimore Riot.|alt=A black and white lithograph depicting a formation of militia soldiers with bayonets fixed surrounded by rioters]]On April 19, 1861, the 6th Massachusetts boarded train cars in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in the early morning hours and departed for Washington via Baltimore. Before the end of the day, the regiment saw combat during the Baltimore Riot. The date was the anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] which began the American Revolution.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=78}}\n\nAlthough Maryland remained in the Union, [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] sentiment and support for the Confederacy was widespread in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of [[sabotage]] to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause [[derailment]] and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=131}}\n\nTrains passing through Baltimore at that time could not proceed directly through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at [[President Street Station]] on the east side of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on [[Pratt Street]] by horsepower to [[Camden Station]] on the west side of Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]], where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=132}} The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=195}} The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=132}}\n\n[[File:Ladd, Luther.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Private Ladd of the 6th Massachusetts was the first Union soldier killed in action during the Civil War.|alt=A sepia toned portrait photograph depicting the head and shoulders of a young man in an elaborate militia uniform. He wears a tall dress uniform hat.]]The blockage of the railroad left four companies, numbering 220 men, at President Street Station with no choice but to march through the city to reach Camden Station, slightly more than one mile away. The size of the crowd obstructing their path was estimated at roughly 10,000.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=196}} [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Follansbee, the senior captain, took charge of the detachment. After crossing the Pratt Street Bridge, which had been partially dismantled by the crowd, Follansbee ordered his men to march at the \"double-quick.\" This roused the crowd further as they perceived the quickened pace as an indication of panic. As well as stones and bricks being thrown, shots were now fired at the 6th Massachusetts from the stores and houses around them. Captain Follansbee gave the order to return fire.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nSeventeen-year-old Private Luther C. Ladd, a factory worker from Lowell, was hit in the head by a piece of scrap iron that was thrown from a rooftop and fractured his skull.{{sfnp|A citizen of Alexandria and an eye witness|1862|p=20}} As he staggered, one of the rioters took Ladd's musket from him and fired, wounding him in the leg.{{sfnp|Thorp|2011|}} Ladd died on Pratt Street. He is known as the first Union soldier to be killed in action during the Civil War.{{sfnp|Thorp|2011|}}{{sfnp|Kimball|1861|p=341}} Three other militiamen were killed during the riot: Private Addison O. Whitney, Private Charles A. Taylor and Corporal Sumner H. Needham. A total of 36 members of the 6th Massachusetts were wounded.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=159}}\n\nA formation of approximately 50 officers of the [[Baltimore Police Department|Baltimore Police]] eventually placed themselves between the rioters and the militiamen, allowing the 6th Massachusetts to proceed to Camden Station.{{sfnp|Puleo|2010|p=133}} The companies boarded the train which quickly got underway for Washington, though the crowd followed the train for some miles attempting to stop it. A total of 12 civilians were killed during the riot and an unknown number were injured.{{sfnp|Berenson|2015|p=79}}\n\n===Garrison duty===\nThe 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, the first unit to arrive in response to Lincoln's call for troops.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=59}} A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north of the [[US Capitol|Capitol]]. Among the crowd was [[Clara Barton]] who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]], Barton gained her first experience in caring for wounded soldiers as she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts.{{sfnp|Oates|1994|pp=3\u20134}}\n\n[[File:6th Massachusetts in Baltimore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The 6th Massachusetts bivouacked in Monument Square in Baltimore on July 1, 1861, at the close of their second garrison encampment in the city.|alt=An antique photograph depicting a city square with a stone monument and a large number of soldiers at rest]]The 6th Massachusetts was barracked in the [[Old Senate Chamber|Senate Chamber]] in the Capitol. The next morning, tensions in Washington were high as rumors circulated of an impending Confederate attack. After reviewing the 6th Massachusetts, Lincoln expressed his anxiety to the members of the regiment, telling them, \"I don't believe there is any North. The Seventh Regiment [New York] is a myth. Rhode Island is not known in our geography any longer. You are the only northern realities.\"{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=59}}{{sfnp|Goodwin|2005|p=354}}\n\nIn the days and weeks after the Baltimore Riot, newspapers and politicians across the country drew comparisons between the Massachusetts militia who had fought on April 19, 1775, at the start of the Revolution and the Massachusetts troops who fought on April 19, 1861.{{sfnp|O'Connor|1997|p=60}} Among the 6th Massachusetts were descendants of those [[Minutemen]] who had fought in Lexington and Concord in 1775. Due to the coincidence of the date and the ancestry of some members, the 6th Massachusetts was often called the \"Minutemen of '61.\"{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=193}}\n\nThe 6th Massachusetts remained in Washington until May 5, when they were assigned to garrison a key railroad relay station about 15 miles outside of Baltimore at [[Elkridge, Maryland|Elkridge]].{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}} Their presence there helped keep open the crucial rail line from the northeastern states to Washington.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=61}}\nThe regiment returned to Baltimore on May 13, when [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] Benjamin F. Butler occupied the city with several Union regiments in anticipation of a Confederate attack on Baltimore which never developed. The 6th Massachusetts marched through the city to [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]], where they set up camp for a short stay of three days. On May 16, the regiment returned to the Elkridge relay station. They served out the majority of their term at the relay station and vicinity, except for a second assignment in Baltimore from June 26 to July 1, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\nThe regiment's return to Boston at the close of their 90-day term was delayed slightly by special request of Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. In light of the recent Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], in which the 6th Massachusetts did not participate, he asked the regiment voluntarily remain at Elkridge another week in the event of a Confederate advance on Washington. On July 29, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to break camp and boarded trains for Boston which was reached on August 1. The regiment was mustered out on August 2, 1861.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=160}}\n\n==9-month term of service==\n===Organization and departure===\nThe regiment was again activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. Seven of the ten original companies returned for the second period of service. Members who had served during the regiment's first term were not compelled to reenlist. While many did reenlist, considerable recruiting of new volunteers was necessary in order to fill out the companies and thus the roster during the second term was different than the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=161}} To complete the regiment, an additional three companies, made up entirely of fresh recruits, were organized. The roster of officers during the nine months term was substantially the same as the 90-day term.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=142}} Follansbee, who had assumed command of the detached companies engaged in the Baltimore Riot, was promoted to colonel and commanded the regiment during its second term of service. The unit was mustered in at [[Camp Chase (Massachusetts)|Camp Henry Wilson]] in Lowell beginning August 31, 1862. The 6th Massachusetts departed Boston on September 9 on board the steamship ''Plymouth Rock.'' Arriving in New York, the regiment traveled by rail through Baltimore and on to Washington. The unit received a very different welcome in Baltimore during their second term and were given a large reception with food and drink and much cheering from the citizens of the city.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=148}}{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=162}}\n\n===Blackwater River expeditions===\n[[File:Five soldiers in Union uniforms of the 6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Five soldiers of the 6th Massachusetts during their second term of service, photo likely taken in camp near Suffolk, Virginia|alt=A sepia toned photograph of five soldiers standing at parade rest in a neat line]] Upon reaching Washington, the regiment was ordered to [[Fortress Monroe]] and from there to [[Suffolk, Virginia]]. The 6th Massachusetts was assigned to the Second Brigade (commanded by Colonel [[Robert Sanford Foster|Robert S. Foster]]) of the First Division of the [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]].{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}} They served garrison and [[Picket (military)|picket]] duty in the vicinity of Suffolk, occasionally taking part in reconnaissance expeditions to the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater River]] (which represented the boundary between the Union occupied counties of southeast Virginia and Confederate territory of the interior) and engaged in minor skirmish actions.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=163}}\n\nTheir first such expedition took place on October 3, 1862, about two weeks after the regiment reached Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts formed a peripheral part of the [[Joint Expedition against Franklin|Expedition against Franklin]], a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near [[Western Branch, Virginia|Western Branch Church]], far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets for the first time in action.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=171}} Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle made a strong impression on the new recruits.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=81}} During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near [[Zuni, Virginia]] and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment\u20142nd Lieutenant Robert G. Barr.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=190}} The regiment did not again leave Suffolk until an expedition on January 29, 1863, again towards the Blackwater River. Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the [[Battle of Deserted House]] in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=164}} The 6th Massachusetts was sharply engaged and lost five killed and seven wounded.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=203}}\n\n===Siege of Suffolk===\nThe majority of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees in front of the defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|pp=79\u201380}} This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn early 1863, Major General [[James Longstreet]] was given command of the Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His objectives were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the [[Siege of Suffolk]] on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied a position on the right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the [[Nansemond River]]. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=164}}\n\nOn May 3, 1863, Longstreet abandoned the siege and began moving his forces north to rejoin the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The next day, the 6th Massachusetts was among the units sent in pursuit of the retreating Confederate force. Only minor skirmishing took place as the bulk of the Confederate force had already escaped beyond reach of the Union infantry. The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the [[Somerton Historic District|Somerton]] Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=184}}\n\n===Battle of Carrsville and Medal of Honor recipient===\nMajor General [[John Adams Dix|John A. Dix]], commanding Union forces at Suffolk, conducted several reconnaissances in force  to determine the disposition of Confederate forces remaining in the region. On May 13, the 6th Massachusetts joined another expedition to the Blackwater River. This was the final action of their second term of service. The column was commanded by Major General Foster and Colonel Follansbee was promoted to command of the [[brigade]] to which the 6th Massachusetts belonged.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=238}} A considerable Confederate force attacked the Union expedition in a sharp engagement on May 14\u201315, 1863, known as the [[Battle of Carrsville]] or the Battle of Holland House. During this fight, the 6th Massachusetts supported the 7th Massachusetts Battery and exchanged in heavy, prolonged firing with the Confederates. The 6th Massachusetts made an advance, driving the enemy into the woods, then were driven back and made a second counter-attack, reclaiming their position at the start of the battle. The regiment suffered casualties of five killed or mortally wounded, twelve wounded and five prisoners.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nIn the middle of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C perceived that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort to pull them out, he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. In this action, he earned the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, \"When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner.\" Sweatt was eventually released; the three men he endeavored to rescue did not survive.{{sfnp|Wills|2001|p=186}}\n\nOn May 18, the 6th Massachusetts and other regiments fell back to Deserted House outside of Suffolk. On May 20 they were posted in support of artillery at [[Windsor, Virginia]]. Finally, on May 23, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to return to Massachusetts. The regiment reached Boston by steamship on May 26 to be welcomed and addressed in front of the State House by Governor Andrew. The 6th Massachusetts then proceeded to Lowell, where they were received with enthusiastic festivities. The regiment reassembled on June 3, 1863, at Camp Wilson and were mustered out.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=165}} In all during their second enlistment, the regiment lost 13 men killed or mortally wounded in combat and 18 by disease.{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}}\n\n==100-day term of service==\n[[File:United States bonds; or Duress by federal authority- a journal of current events during an imprisonment of fifteen months, at Fort Delaware (1874) (14759557101).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|At Fort Delaware, Union guards (unit unidentified) \"perambulating\" a group of Confederate prisoners around the island|alt=A lithograph of a large column of soldiers without weapons in disorderly dress marching outside a large stone fort being guarded by a few soldiers in dark uniforms holding rifles]]In May 1864, Major General  [[Ulysses S. Grant]] removed fresh troops from the defensive fortifications of Washington and transferred them into the field to strengthen the [[Army of the Potomac]]. To man defenses around the capital in their place, and to relieve regiments at various northern fortifications, Lincoln issued a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days. This measure would allow enough time to raise longer-term regiments to occupy rearward defenses. The 6th Massachusetts was activated for a third time in response to this call for 100-day regiments.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=297}}\n\nThe regiment organized at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts]], just outside of Boston beginning July 13, 1864. Colonel Follansbee again commanded the regiment. The roster of field and staff officers was fundamentally the same as their previous nine-month term of service.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=166}} They departed on July 20 for Washington, reaching the city on July 22. They were posted on [[Arlington Heights Historic District|Arlington Heights]] in [[Fort C. F. Smith (Arlington, Virginia)|Fort C.F. Smith]]. Their month of service there was mundane, consisting of regular drills, inspections and fatigue duty.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=298}}\n\nOn August 21, 1864, the regiment was ordered to move. They traveled by rail to Philadelphia and by steamship to [[Fort Delaware]] on [[Pea Patch Island]] on the [[Delaware River]]. The regiment relieved the [[157th Ohio Infantry]] and commenced garrison and guard duty over the 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war held at Fort Delaware.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=167}} There had been widespread instances of mistreatment of prisoners by Union units that previously garrisoned the fort, including abuse and theft of prisoners' property. Members of the 6th Massachusetts condemned these practices and generally refrained from similar abuses.{{sfnp|Temple|2003|p=113}} Their duty consisted of standing post and escorting prisoners on various work details. The fort was large and in excellent condition. The barracks were newly constructed, comfortable, and included a library and other amenities. The field and staff officers as well as several company officers were joined by their wives and children at the post. The regimental historian recorded that many members of the unit remember their time at Fort Delaware as extremely pleasant.{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|p=301}}\n\nOn October 19, 1864, the 6th Massachusetts was relieved and began the journey back to Boston, which they reached on October 21. The regiment reported to Camp Meigs on October 27, 1864, and were mustered out for the third and last time. During their third term, the regiment lost 10 men to disease.{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1250}}\n\n==Sumner Needham memorial==\nOn the 3d of May, 1861 the body of Needham was conveyed to Lawrence by a Committee of the City Government, and placed in the City Hall, where it was appropriately draped; the seats were filled; and every inch of standing room was occupied. Seven Protestant ministers participated in his funeral.\nA memorial was erected in Bellevue Cemetery : \"A Loyal North, in common with his widow and an only child, mourn his loss.

An appropriation of $2,000 was secured from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a further $2,700 was provided by the city. The monument was constructed in front of the Lowell courthouse in what is now known as Monument Square. Ladd and Whitney had both been buried in the [[Lowell Cemetery]]. On April 28, 1865, their remains were re-interred in a vault beneath the monument. The monument was to be dedicated on April 19, 1865, on the anniversary of the Baltimore Riot, but the ceremonies were delayed due to the [[assassination of President Lincoln]]. It was instead dedicated on the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, a local holiday, June 17, 1865. The procession numbered more than 4,500 people. Governor Andrew gave the oration acknowledging the men whom he called \"the first martyrs of the great rebellion.\"{{sfnp|Hanson|1866|pp=343\u2013344}}\n\n==Later units==\nThe 6th Massachusetts continued as a peacetime militia unit following the Civil War, typically meeting for annual musters at various camps in Massachusetts. During reorganizations of the Massachusetts militia in 1866 and 1877, the 6th Massachusetts was consolidated and some of its companies disbanded or transferred, but the regimental organization remained intact.{{sfnp|Hall|1900|pp=198 and 203}} The regiment was again activated during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].

Originally released on October 24, 1991, by [[Walt Disney Records]], the album's first half \u2013 tracks 2 to 9 \u2013 generally contains the film's [[Number (music)|musical number]]<nowiki/>s, all of which were written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Howard Ashman]], while its latter half \u2013 tracks 10 to 14 \u2013 features its <nowiki/>[[Film score|musical score]], composed solely by Menken. While the majority of the album's content remains within the [[musical theatre]] genre, its songs have also been influenced by [[Music of France|French]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Broadway musical|Broadway music]]. Credited to Various Artists, ''Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' features performances by the film's main cast \u2013 [[Paige O'Hara]], [[Richard White (actor)|Richard White]], [[Jesse Corti]], [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Robby Benson]] \u2013 in order of appearance. Additionally, the album features recording artists [[Celine Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]], who perform a pop rendition of the film's [[theme song|title and theme song]], \"Beauty and the Beast\", which simultaneously serves as the soundtrack's only single.\n\nFollowing a difficult period during where [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release successful animated feature films, the studio, inspired by their most recent animated success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989), decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" into an [[Musical film|animated musical film]] after a non-musical adaptation had been attempted that failed to impress [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Katzenberg ordered that production on the film be started over from scratch, hiring songwriting team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had just recently completed scoring ''The Little Mermaid'', to write the film's songs. Dion and Bryson were hired to record a pop version of \u2013 and draw media attention to \u2013 the film's title song. Ashman, who was initially hesitant to join the project, died of [[AIDS]] before the film's completion and the album's release.\n\nMuch like ''Beauty and the Beast'', the soundtrack was a massive critical success, receiving universal praise and recognition from both film and music critics. The music featured on the album won several awards, including the [[49th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], the [[64th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Score]] and the [[35th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television]]. Its title track and only single, \"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\", achieved similar success, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and Grammy Awards for both [[Best song written for visual media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn December 2001, the soundtrack was re-released as a ''Special Edition'' to coincide with the [[IMAX]] re-issue of the film and the upcoming two-disc [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Soundtracks|Platinum Edition]]. The new release featured the film version of \"Transformation\", which had been replaced with an early unused version in some early pressings, the newly animated song \"Human Again\", the original instrumental intended for the \"Transformation\" scene, (titled \"Death of the Beast (Early Version)\" here) and demos for \"Be Our Guest\" and the title track. In September 2010, the soundtrack was re-released again as a [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Music releases|Diamond Edition]] soundtrack, to coincide with the successful Blu-ray and DVD Diamond Edition release of the film, the 1991 version of the soundtrack was released and included [[Jordin Sparks]]' cover of \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a bonus track. The soundtrack was [[reissue|reissued]] as the fourteenth entry in ''[[Walt Disney Records the Legacy Collection|The Legacy Collection]]'' on February 9, 2018 and includes previously unreleased score.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release animated feature films that achieved the levels of success of some of the studio's earlier productions did. In 1989, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]. ''An [[Musical film|animated musical]] that features songs written by lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]], ''The Little Mermaid'' was both a tremendous critical and commercial success. Hoping to release a film that achieved similar success, the studio decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" by [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] into an animated film.\n\nPrior to getting professionally involved with Disney, Ashman and Menken had collaborated on a [[Little Shop of Horrors (1960 film)|musical adaptation]] of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and its subsequent musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film adaptation]]. Following the studio's attempt to adapt the fairy tale into a non-musical animated film under the direction of Richard Purdum, Disney CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], dissatisfied by the direction in which the film was headed, ordered that it be scrapped and restarted from scratch, this time in the form of a musical. In addition to hiring a screenwriter, Katzenberg recruited Ashman and Menken to write the film's songs.\n\n===Ashman's health===\nAshman was initially reluctant to agree to work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' because he had just recently been diagnosed with [[AIDS]]. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ''(1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed ''The Little Mermaid''. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed to work on the film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in [[Burbank, California]] to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/beauty-and-the-plague|title = Beauty and the Plague|website = Vice|publisher = Vice|accessdate = 18 September 2013|last = Sunderland|first = Mitchell}}</ref><ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-lefou-howard-ashman</ref><ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-Hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-Ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie</ref>\n\n==Content and composition==\nLyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken intended for the songs in ''Beauty and the Beast'' to serve as [[plot device]]s and assist in the telling of its story.

Tavia Hobart of [[AllMusic]] awarded the soundtrack a nearly perfect overall score of 4.5/5 stars, describing Ashman and Menken's compositions as \"positively delightful.\" However, she felt that the album's orchestral score was not as good as ''[[The Little Mermaid (soundtrack)|The Little Mermaid]]''<nowiki/>. [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] <nowiki/>was very enthusiastic about the album, praising each of its songs and labeling them \"remarkably upbeat\". The reviewer also praised Ashman and Menken for avoiding \"stupid comedic performances to appeal to children.\" Unlike AllMusic's opinion, the reviewer felt that the score was \"a vast improvement\" over ''The Little Mermaid''<nowiki/>'s. [[Sputnikmusic|Sputnikmusik]]'s Irving Tan awarded the album a \"superb\" overall rating of 4.5/5. Praising the film's entire collection of songs in a detailed review, Tan accredited the overall appeal of the soundtrack with much the film's success.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url = https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/42895/Disney-Soundtracks-Beauty-and-the-Beast/|title = Disney Soundtracks - Beauty and the Beast|date = April 10, 2011|website = Sputnikmusic|publisher = IndieClick Music Network|last = Tan|first = Irving|accessdate = 18 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was released in October  1991, several film and entertainment critics awarded specific praise to its music, both songs and score. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''<nowiki/>'s [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] wrote, \"The songs unleash a chemical reaction of happiness.\"<ref name=\"EW:14\">{{Cite web|url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20483133_20556652,00.html|title = Beauty and the Beast 3D (2012)|date = January 12, 2012|last = Schwarzbaum|first = Lisa|publisher = Entertainment Weekly Inc|website = Entertainment Weekly|accessdate = 18 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nJust as the film made history by becoming the first animated film to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, so too the soundtrack made history by becoming the first animated film soundtrack to receive an Album of the Year Grammy nomination (to date, no other animated film soundtrack has been nominated in this category). The pop version of the title track \"Beauty and the Beast\" also received Grammy nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. In total, the soundtrack won 3 Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (Celine Dion & John Greenhalgh, Best Pop Instrumental Performance (Richard Kauffman), and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture (Alan Menken).<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1993/grammys.htm]</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nIn the movie track eight comes after track nine.\n{{tracklist\n| total_length      = 50:12\n| all_music         = [[Alan Menken]] with lyrics by [[Howard Ashman]].

Originally released on October 24, 1991, by [[Walt Disney Records]], the album's first half \u2013 tracks 2 to 9 \u2013 generally contains the film's [[Number (music)|musical number]]<nowiki/>s, all of which were written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Howard Ashman]], while its latter half \u2013 tracks 10 to 14 \u2013 features its <nowiki/>[[Film score|musical score]], composed solely by Menken. While the majority of the album's content remains within the [[musical theatre]] genre, its songs have also been influenced by [[Music of France|French]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Broadway musical|Broadway music]]. Credited to Various Artists, ''Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' features performances by the film's main cast \u2013 [[Paige O'Hara]], [[Richard White (actor)|Richard White]], [[Jesse Corti]], [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Robby Benson]] \u2013 in order of appearance. Additionally, the album features recording artists [[Celine Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]], who perform a pop rendition of the film's [[theme song|title and theme song]], \"Beauty and the Beast\", which simultaneously serves as the soundtrack's only single.\n\nFollowing a difficult period during where [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release successful animated feature films, the studio, inspired by their most recent animated success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989), decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" into an [[Musical film|animated musical film]] after a non-musical adaptation had been attempted that failed to impress [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Katzenberg ordered that production on the film be started over from scratch, hiring songwriting team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had just recently completed scoring ''The Little Mermaid'', to write the film's songs. Dion and Bryson were hired to record a pop version of \u2013 and draw media attention to \u2013 the film's title song. Ashman, who was initially hesitant to join the project, died of [[AIDS]] before the film's completion and the album's release.\n\nMuch like ''Beauty and the Beast'', the soundtrack was a massive critical success, receiving universal praise and recognition from both film and music critics. The music featured on the album won several awards, including the [[49th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], the [[64th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Score]] and the [[35th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television]]. Its title track and only single, \"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\", achieved similar success, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and Grammy Awards for both [[Best song written for visual media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn December 2001, the soundtrack was re-released as a ''Special Edition'' to coincide with the [[IMAX]] re-issue of the film and the upcoming two-disc [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Soundtracks|Platinum Edition]]. The new release featured the film version of \"Transformation\", which had been replaced with an early unused version in some early pressings, the newly animated song \"Human Again\", the original instrumental intended for the \"Transformation\" scene, (titled \"Death of the Beast (Early Version)\" here) and demos for \"Be Our Guest\" and the title track. In September 2010, the soundtrack was re-released again as a [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Music releases|Diamond Edition]] soundtrack, to coincide with the successful Blu-ray and DVD Diamond Edition release of the film, the 1991 version of the soundtrack was released and included [[Jordin Sparks]]' cover of \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a bonus track. The soundtrack was [[reissue|reissued]] as the fourteenth entry in ''[[Walt Disney Records the Legacy Collection|The Legacy Collection]]'' on February 9, 2018 and includes previously unreleased score.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release animated feature films that achieved the levels of success of some of the studio's earlier productions did. In 1989, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]. ''An [[Musical film|animated musical]] that features songs written by lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]], ''The Little Mermaid'' was both a tremendous critical and commercial success. Hoping to release a film that achieved similar success, the studio decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" by [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] into an animated film.\n\nPrior to getting professionally involved with Disney, Ashman and Menken had collaborated on a [[Little Shop of Horrors (1960 film)|musical adaptation]] of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and its subsequent musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film adaptation]]. Following the studio's attempt to adapt the fairy tale into a non-musical animated film under the direction of Richard Purdum, Disney CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], dissatisfied by the direction in which the film was headed, ordered that it be scrapped and restarted from scratch, this time in the form of a musical. In addition to hiring a screenwriter, Katzenberg recruited Ashman and Menken to write the film's songs.\n\n===Ashman's health===\nAshman was initially reluctant to agree to work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' because he had just recently been diagnosed with [[AIDS]]. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ''(1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed ''The Little Mermaid''. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed to work on the film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in [[Burbank, California]] to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/beauty-and-the-plague|title = Beauty and the Plague|website = Vice|publisher = Vice|accessdate = 18 September 2013|last = Sunderland|first = Mitchell}}</ref><ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-lefou-howard-ashman</ref><ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-Hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-Ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie</ref>\n\n==Content and composition==\nLyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken intended for the songs in ''Beauty and the Beast'' to serve as [[plot device]]s and assist in the telling of its story.
