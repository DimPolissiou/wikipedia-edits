The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's  Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward.

Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria | St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of[[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of an associate known to both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria |Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. The associate; Karl Zelinka had no criminal record, but was known to Reed and the Minogue brothers. Under police questioning, Zelinka denied that about his involvement in the bombing but admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive an Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. The associate also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney before the bombing with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue Brothers filling up a small  trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from the associate's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at Zelinka's home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor was well known to police, Taylor's first criminal charge occurred in 1949 when he was 12 for the theft of fresh fish from a market. In the early 1960s, Taylor committed at least seven bank robberies and had escaped prison twice. He served 17 years in [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division. During his time in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and did bit-parts in prison stage-shows. Taylor was released from prison in 1978 and became a social worker to help prevent young men from committing crime.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

This was done in celebration of the successful collection of more than 125,000 signatures, forcing the government to hold a [[2016 Swiss referendums#Basic income referendum|referendum]] in 2016 on whether or not to incorporate the concept of basic income in the federal constitution.

An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (at or above the [[poverty line]]) is sometimes called a full basic income while if it is less than that amount, it is sometimes called partial. A welfare system with some characteristics similar to those of a basic income is a [[negative income tax]] in which the government stipend is gradually reduced with higher labour income. Some welfare systems are sometimes regarded as steps on the way to a basic income, but because they have conditionalities attached they are not basic incomes. If they raise household incomes to specified minima they are called [[guaranteed minimum income]] systems. For example, [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil is restricted to poor families and the children are obligated to attend school.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mattei|first1=Lauro|last2=S\u00e1nchez-Ancochea|first2=Diego|title=Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, poverty and inequality: Political and economic effects in the short and long run|journal=Global Social Policy|volume=11|issue=2\u20133|date=2011|page=1|doi=10.1177/1468018111421297}}</ref>\n\nSeveral political discussions are related to the basic income debate. Examples include the debates regarding robotization, [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), and the future of work. A key issue in these debates is whether robotization and AI will significantly reduce the number of available jobs, additionally, whether a basic income would be sufficient enough to eliminate such problems.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Basic income around the world}}\nThe idea of a state-run basic income dates back to the early 16th century, when Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' depicted a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income.<ref>Bryce Covert, \"What Money Can Buy:  The promise of a universal basic income \u2013 and its limitations\", ''[[The Nation]]'', vol. 307, no. 6 (10 / 17 September 2018), p. 33.</ref> In the late 18th century, [[Radicals (UK)|English radical]] [[Thomas Spence]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American revolutionary]] [[Thomas Paine]] both declared their support for a welfare system that guaranteed all citizens a certain income. Nineteenth-century debate on basic income was limited, but during the early part of the 20th century a basic income called a \"state bonus\" was widely discussed, and in 1946 the United Kingdom implemented unconditional family allowances for the second and subsequent children of every family. In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and Canada conducted several experiments with negative income taxation, a related welfare system. From the 1980s and onward, the debate in Europe took off more broadly and since then it has expanded to many countries around the world. A few countries have implemented large-scale welfare systems that have some similarities to basic income, such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil. From 2008 onward, several experiments with basic income and related systems have taken place.\n\nGovernments can contribute to individual and household income maintenance strategies in three ways:\n \n# The government can establish a minimum income guarantee and not allow income to fall below levels set for various household types, maintaining these levels by paying [[means-tested benefit]]s.\n# [[Social insurance]] can pay benefits in the case of sickness, unemployment, or old age, on the basis of contributions paid\n#Universal unconditional payments, such as the United Kingdom's Child Benefit for children.<ref>{{cite book|title=How social security works|last=Spicker|first=Paul|date=19 January 2011|publisher=Bristol University Press|isbn=9781447342854|doi = 10.2307/j.ctt1t896gv}}</ref>\n\nIn more detail:\n\n# A means-tested benefit that raises a household's income to a guaranteed minimum level is unlike a basic income in that income delivered under a system of guaranteed minimum income is reduced proportionally as other sources of income increase whereas income received from a basic income is constant regardless of other sources of income. [[Juan Luis Vives|Johannes Ludovicus Vives]] (1492\u20131540), for example, proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents \"not on grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity\". However, Vives also argued that to qualify for poor relief the recipient must \"deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work\".<ref>[http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ \"History of Basic Income\"]. Basic Income Earth Network.</ref>\n# The first to develop the idea of a social insurance was [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743\u20131794). After playing a prominent role in the [[French Revolution]], he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. While in prison, he wrote the ''Esquisse d\u2019un tableau historique des progr\u00e8s de l\u2019esprit humain'' (published posthumously by his widow in 1795), whose last chapter described his vision of a social insurance and how it could reduce inequality, insecurity and poverty. Condorcet mentioned, very briefly, the idea of a benefit to all children old enough to start working by themselves and to start up a family of their own. He is not known to have said or written anything else on this proposal, but his close friend and fellow member of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] Thomas Paine (1737\u20131809) developed the idea much further, a couple of years after Condorcet's death.\n# The first social movement for Basic Income developed around 1920 in the United Kingdom. Its proponents included [[Bertrand Russell]], Dennis Milner (with his wife Mabel) and [[C. H. Douglas]].\n* Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.\n* Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple in the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled \"Scheme for a State Bonus\" (1918) that argued for the \"introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom\". They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.\n* C. H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system he called [[social credit]], a combination of monetary reform and basic income.\n\nIn 1944 and 1945, the [[Beveridge Committee]] led by the British economist [[William Beveridge]] developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance, means-tested benefits and unconditional allowances for children. Committee member Lady Rhys-Williams argued that the incomes for adults should be more like a basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.<ref name=sloman-2015>{{cite report |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/251445/Sloman%202015%20Contemporary%20British%20History.pdf |title=Beveridge's rival: Juliet Rhys-Williams and the campaign for basic income, 1942-55 |first=Peter |last=Sloman |publisher=New College, Oxford |year=2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tony|title=Freedom and Security: an introduction to the basic income debate|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-22313-7|page=42|edition= 1st publ.}}</ref> Her son Brandon Rhys Williams proposed a basic income to a parliamentary committee in 1982 and soon after that in 1984 the Basic Income Research Group, now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust, began to conduct and disseminate research on basic income.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizensincome.org/|title=Citizen's Income \u2013 An unconditional, nonwithdrawable income paid to every individual as a right of citizenship.|accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some welfare debates in the United States and Canada included discussions of basic income. Six pilot projects were also conducted with the [[negative income tax]]. Then President [[Richard Nixon]] once even proposed a negative income tax in a bill to the Congress, but Congress eventually only approved a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly and the disabled, not for all citizens, thus:<ref name=Nixon_UBI>{{cite web|title=American President: Richard Milhous Nixon: Domestic Affairs|work=MillerCenter.org|publisher=Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|accessdate=28 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407202356/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|archive-date=7 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Quote\n|Nixon proposed more ambitious programs than he enacted, including the National Health Insurance Partnership Program, which promoted health maintenance organizations (HMOs). He also proposed a massive overhaul of federal welfare programs. The centerpiece of Nixon's welfare reform was the replacement of much of the welfare system with a negative income tax, a favorite proposal of conservative economist Milton Friedman. The purpose of the negative income tax was to provide both a safety net for the poor and a financial incentive for welfare recipients to work.\n}}In the late 1970s and the 1980s, basic income was more or less forgotten in the United States, but it started to gain some traction in Europe. Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, was founded in 1986 and started to arrange international conferences every two years.<ref name=\"basicincome.org\" /> From the 1980s, some people outside party politics and universities took interest.

Basic income is currently discussed from a variety of perspectives\u2014including in the context of ongoing automation and robotisation, often with the argument that these trends mean less paid work in the future, which would create a need for a new welfare model. Several countries are planning for local or regional experiments with basic income or related welfare systems. For example, experiments in Canada, Finland, India and Namibia have received international media attention. The [[2016 Swiss referendums#Basic income referendum|first and only national referendum about basic income]] was held in Switzerland in 2016. The result was a rejection of the basic income proposal by a vote of 76.9% to 23.1%.\n\n== Perspectives in the basic income debate ==\n=== Automation ===\n{{main|Automation}}\n[[File:Andrew Yang by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Andrew Yang holding a microphone while making a speech|Entrepreneur and [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic candidate]] [[Andrew Yang]] has advocated for a basic income to counter [[Technological unemployment|job displacement through automation]].

One example is [[Chris Hughes]], co-founder of both [[Facebook]] and Economic Security Project. Automation has been happening for hundreds of years and while it has not permanently reduced the employment rate, it has constantly caused employment instability. It displaces workers who spend their lives learning skills that become outmoded and forces them into unskilled labor. [[Paul Vall\u00e9e]], a Canadian tech-entrepreneur and CEO of [[Pythian Group|Pythian]], argues that automation is at least as likely to increase poverty and reduce social mobility as it is to create ever-increasing unemployment rate. At the 2016 North American Basic Income Guarantee Congress in Winnipeg, Vall\u00e9e examined slavery as a historical example of a period in which capital (African slaves) could do the same things that paid labor (poor whites) could do. He found that slavery did not cause massive unemployment among poor whites, but instead it increased economic inequality and lowered social mobility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZbXto44n1sKTVgrfl8u_p9vrgoS7WXX0O_le39GyyM/edit#slide=id.p4|title=Paul Vallee, Basic Income, for publication|via=Google Docs|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Bad behavior ===\nCriticism of a basic income includes the argument that some recipients would spend a basic income on alcohol and other drugs.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\"/><ref>Koga, Kenya. \"Pennies From Heaven.\" Economist 409.8859 (2013): 67\u201368.

The degree of any disincentive to employment because of basic income would likely depend on how generous the basic income was.\n\nSome studies have looked at employment levels during the experiments with basic income and negative income tax and similar systems. In the negative income tax-experiments in United States in the 1970s, for example, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher. Participants in these experiments knew that the experiment was limited in time.<ref name=\"cangov94\" />\n\nIn the [[Mincome]] experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba also in the 1970s, there were also slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment. However, the only two groups who worked significantly less were new mothers and teenagers working to support their families. New mothers spent this time with their infant children, and working teenagers put significant additional time into their schooling.<ref>{{cite web |last = Belik |first = Vivian |url = http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/4100 |title = A Town Without Poverty?

The authors theorize that employment remained steady, because the extra income that let people buy more also increased demand for service jobs. This finding is consistent with the economic data of the time. No effect was seen when it came to jobs in manufacturing, which produce exports. Essentially, the authors argue, macro-economic effects of higher spending supported overall employment. To use an illustrative but hypothetical example, someone who uses the dividend to help with car payments can cut back on hours working as a cashier at a local grocery store. Because more people are spending more, the store must replace the worker who started working less. Meanwhile, distribution of the dividend doesn't affect the international demand for oil and the jobs connected to it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/|title=A universal basic income experiment in Alaska shows employment didn't drop |publisher=Quartz|website=qz.com|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10|title=Critics of universal basic income argue giving people money for nothing discourages working\u2014but a study of Alaska's 36-year-old program suggests that's not the case|work=Business Insider|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> Jones and Marinescu found instead that the larger scale of the program is what allows it to work and not dissuade people out of the work force.\n\nAnother study that contradicted such decline in work incentive was a pilot project implemented in 2008 and 2009 in the Namibian village of [[Omitara]].

Widerquist  |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref> which can be summarized as follows. If the resources necessary to an individual's survival are controlled by another group, that individual has no reasonable choice other than to do whatever the resource-controlling group demands. Before the establishment of governments and landlords, individuals had direct access to the resources they needed to survive. Today, resources necessary for the production of food, shelter and clothing have been privatized in such a way that some have gotten a share and others have not.\n\nTherefore, the argument goes that the owners of those resources owe compensation back to non-owners, sufficient at least for them to purchase the resources or goods necessary to sustain their basic needs. This redistribution must be unconditional because people can consider themselves free only if they are not forced to spend all their time doing the bidding of others simply to provide basic necessities to themselves and their families.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\" /> Under this argument, personal, political and religious freedom are worth little without the power to say no. In this view, basic income provides an economic freedom which\u2014combined with political freedom, freedom of belief and personal freedom\u2014establish each individual's status as a free person.\n\n=== Gender equality ===\nThe Scottish economist [[Ailsa McKay]] has argued that basic income is a way to promote [[gender equality]].<ref name=\"mckay1\" /><ref>{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Ailsa |year=2005 |title= The Future of Social Security Policy: Women, Work and a Citizens Basic Income |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |page= |isbn= 9781134287185 |author-link=Ailsa McKay }}</ref> She noted in 2001 that \"social policy reform should take account of all gender inequalities and not just those relating to the traditional labor market\" and that \"the citizens' basic income model can be a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights\".<ref name=\"mckay1\">{{cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |author-link1=Ailsa McKay |year=2001 |title= Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income |url= |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 97\u2013118 |doi=10.1080/13545700010022721 }}</ref>\n\nWomen perform the majority of unpaid care work around the world.

This program is also like Basic Income except that is restricted to children.\n*[[Conditional cash transfer]], a regular payment given to families, but only to the poor and usually dependent on basic conditions such as sending their children to school or having them vaccinated. Programs include [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil and a similar program in M\u00e9xico.\n*[[Guaranteed minimum income]] differs despite the name from a Basic Income because it is restricted to those in search of work. Example programs are [[unemployment benefits]] in the UK and the [[revenu de solidarit\u00e9 active]] in France.\n\n[[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] is a large social welfare program in Brazil that provides money to many poor families in the country. The system is related to basic income, but has more conditions, like asking the recipients to keep their children in school until graduation. Brazilian Senator [[Eduardo Suplicy]] championed a law that ultimately passed in 2004 that declared Bolsa Fam\u00edlia a first step towards a national basic income. However, the program has not yet been expanded in that direction.\n\nThe [[Rythu Bandhu scheme]] is a welfare scheme started on 10 May 2018 aimed towards helping farmers that is being implemented by the state of [[Telangana]] in India, where each farmland owner gets a fixed amount of money \u20b94,000 per acre twice a year for [[Rabi crop|rabi]] and [[Kharif crop|kharif]] harvests. A budget allocation of \u20b912,000 crores($138 billion at the time of conversion) was made in the 2018\u20132019 state budget. The scheme offers financial help of \u20b98,000 per year to each farmer (two crops), there is no cap on money disbursed to number of acres of land owned, and it does not discriminate between rich or poor land owners.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/telangana-proposes-rs-5l-insurance-cover-rs-12000-crore-support-scheme-for-farmers/articleshow/63319240.cms|title=Telangana proposes Rs 5L insurance cover, Rs 12,000 crore support scheme for farmers|date=15 March 2018|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> The [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] has been monitoring the program and is doing a study they have yet to published, but their preliminary results already show promising results in getting farmers funding they need to invest in farming\u2014procuring fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and other inputs\u2014which serves the purpose of the scheme. The first phase of the survey concluded that 85% of farmers received cheques for amounts ranging from \u20b91,000 to \u20b920,000 for farm land comprising less than an acre to about five acres and about 10% of farmers received cheques for amounts above \u20b920,000 to \u20b950,000 and only 1% of farmers got amounts more than \u20b950,000. The spending pattern revealed that a large chunk, 28.5% of farmers opted to buy seed, about 18% spent the money on fertilizer, 15.4% on new agricultural assets, including farm equipment, 8.6% on pesticides and some used it to engage farm labor and only 4.4% of beneficiaries said they utilized it for household consumption and a minuscule percentage for repayment of loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ryots-spent-rythu-bandhu-amount-judiciously-survey/article24235239.ece|title=Ryots spent Rythu Bandhu amount judiciously: survey|last=Maitreyi|first=M. l Melly|date=23 June 2018|work=The Hindu|accessdate=16 October 2018|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> The scheme received a high satisfaction rate of 92% from farmers since other forms of capital investment like welfare or loans had many strings attached to it and would not reach the farmers before the cropping season starts, many other states and countries are following the development of the program to see if they can implement it for their farmers.

Stout|Lynn Stout]] and her co-authors Tamara Belinfanti and Sergio Gramitto in their book ''Citizen Capitalism: How A Universal Fund Can Provide Influence and Income to All'' which was published in 2019. In the book, Stout and her co-authors propose the building of a not-for-profit universal fund composed of shares donated by corporations and philanthropic individuals in which every American would receive one share. These shares could not be sold, bequeathed, donated, or borrowed against, but each \"citizen shareholder\" would receive an even portion of the net dividends paid out by shares in the fund, therefore contributing to the amelioration of income inequality. Each shareholder would also receive additional influence in the form of a vote (corresponding to their shares in the fund), providing in theory for a significantly expanded degree of citizen engagement in the role that public corporations play in American society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizencapitalism.org/|title=Citizen Capitalism|website=Citizen Capitalism|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Basic income in crypto currencies and as part of social media apps ===\nNimses is a concept that offers universal basic income to every member of its system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://futurism.com/what-will-the-currency-of-a-workless-cashless-future-be|title=What Will the Currency of a Workless, Cashless Future Be?|website=Futurism|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> The idea of Nimses consists of [[time-based currency]] called Nim (1 nim = 1 minute of life).

An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (at or above the [[poverty line]]) is sometimes called a full basic income while if it is less than that amount, it is sometimes called partial. A welfare system with some characteristics similar to those of a basic income is a [[negative income tax]] in which the government stipend is gradually reduced with higher labour income. Some welfare systems are sometimes regarded as steps on the way to a basic income, but because they have conditionalities attached they are not basic incomes. If they raise household incomes to specified minima they are called [[guaranteed minimum income]] systems. For example, [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil is restricted to poor families and the children are obligated to attend school.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mattei|first1=Lauro|last2=S\u00e1nchez-Ancochea|first2=Diego|title=Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, poverty and inequality: Political and economic effects in the short and long run|journal=Global Social Policy|volume=11|issue=2\u20133|date=2011|page=1|doi=10.1177/1468018111421297}}</ref>\n\nSeveral political discussions are related to the basic income debate. Examples include the debates regarding robotization, [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), and the future of work. A key issue in these debates is whether robotization and AI will significantly reduce the number of available jobs, additionally, whether a basic income would be sufficient enough to eliminate such problems.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Basic income around the world}}\nThe idea of a state-run basic income dates back to the early 16th century, when Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' depicted a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income.<ref>Bryce Covert, \"What Money Can Buy:  The promise of a universal basic income \u2013 and its limitations\", ''[[The Nation]]'', vol. 307, no. 6 (10 / 17 September 2018), p. 33.</ref> In the late 18th century, [[Radicals (UK)|English radical]] [[Thomas Spence]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American revolutionary]] [[Thomas Paine]] both declared their support for a welfare system that guaranteed all citizens a certain income. Nineteenth-century debate on basic income was limited, but during the early part of the 20th century a basic income called a \"state bonus\" was widely discussed, and in 1946 the United Kingdom implemented unconditional family allowances for the second and subsequent children of every family. In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and Canada conducted several experiments with negative income taxation, a related welfare system. From the 1980s and onward, the debate in Europe took off more broadly and since then it has expanded to many countries around the world. A few countries have implemented large-scale welfare systems that have some similarities to basic income, such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil. From 2008 onward, several experiments with basic income and related systems have taken place.\n\nGovernments can contribute to individual and household income maintenance strategies in three ways:\n \n# The government can establish a minimum income guarantee and not allow income to fall below levels set for various household types, maintaining these levels by paying [[means-tested benefit]]s.\n# [[Social insurance]] can pay benefits in the case of sickness, unemployment, or old age, on the basis of contributions paid\n#Universal unconditional payments, such as the United Kingdom's Child Benefit for children.<ref>{{cite book|title=How social security works|last=Spicker|first=Paul|date=19 January 2011|publisher=Bristol University Press|isbn=9781447342854|doi = 10.2307/j.ctt1t896gv}}</ref>\n\nIn more detail:\n\n# A means-tested benefit that raises a household's income to a guaranteed minimum level is unlike a basic income in that income delivered under a system of guaranteed minimum income is reduced proportionally as other sources of income increase whereas income received from a basic income is constant regardless of other sources of income. [[Juan Luis Vives|Johannes Ludovicus Vives]] (1492\u20131540), for example, proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents \"not on grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity\". However, Vives also argued that to qualify for poor relief the recipient must \"deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work\".<ref>[http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ \"History of Basic Income\"]. Basic Income Earth Network.</ref>\n# The first to develop the idea of a social insurance was [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743\u20131794). After playing a prominent role in the [[French Revolution]], he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. While in prison, he wrote the ''Esquisse d\u2019un tableau historique des progr\u00e8s de l\u2019esprit humain'' (published posthumously by his widow in 1795), whose last chapter described his vision of a social insurance and how it could reduce inequality, insecurity and poverty. Condorcet mentioned, very briefly, the idea of a benefit to all children old enough to start working by themselves and to start up a family of their own. He is not known to have said or written anything else on this proposal, but his close friend and fellow member of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] Thomas Paine (1737\u20131809) developed the idea much further, a couple of years after Condorcet's death.\n# The first social movement for Basic Income developed around 1920 in the United Kingdom. Its proponents included [[Bertrand Russell]], Dennis Milner (with his wife Mabel) and [[C. H. Douglas]].\n* Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.\n* Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple in the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled \"Scheme for a State Bonus\" (1918) that argued for the \"introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom\". They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.\n* C. H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system he called [[social credit]], a combination of monetary reform and basic income.\n\nIn 1944 and 1945, the [[Beveridge Committee]] led by the British economist [[William Beveridge]] developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance, means-tested benefits and unconditional allowances for children. Committee member Lady Rhys-Williams argued that the incomes for adults should be more like a basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.<ref name=sloman-2015>{{cite report |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/251445/Sloman%202015%20Contemporary%20British%20History.pdf |title=Beveridge's rival: Juliet Rhys-Williams and the campaign for basic income, 1942-55 |first=Peter |last=Sloman |publisher=New College, Oxford |year=2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tony|title=Freedom and Security: an introduction to the basic income debate|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-22313-7|page=42|edition= 1st publ.}}</ref> Her son Brandon Rhys Williams proposed a basic income to a parliamentary committee in 1982 and soon after that in 1984 the Basic Income Research Group, now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust, began to conduct and disseminate research on basic income.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizensincome.org/|title=Citizen's Income \u2013 An unconditional, nonwithdrawable income paid to every individual as a right of citizenship.|accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some welfare debates in the United States and Canada included discussions of basic income. Six pilot projects were also conducted with the [[negative income tax]]. Then President [[Richard Nixon]] once even proposed a negative income tax in a bill to the Congress, but Congress eventually only approved a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly and the disabled, not for all citizens, thus:<ref name=Nixon_UBI>{{cite web|title=American President: Richard Milhous Nixon: Domestic Affairs|work=MillerCenter.org|publisher=Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|accessdate=28 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407202356/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|archive-date=7 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Quote\n|Nixon proposed more ambitious programs than he enacted, including the National Health Insurance Partnership Program, which promoted health maintenance organizations (HMOs). He also proposed a massive overhaul of federal welfare programs. The centerpiece of Nixon's welfare reform was the replacement of much of the welfare system with a negative income tax, a favorite proposal of conservative economist Milton Friedman. The purpose of the negative income tax was to provide both a safety net for the poor and a financial incentive for welfare recipients to work.\n}}In the late 1970s and the 1980s, basic income was more or less forgotten in the United States, but it started to gain some traction in Europe. Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, was founded in 1986 and started to arrange international conferences every two years.<ref name=\"basicincome.org\" /> From the 1980s, some people outside party politics and universities took interest. In West Germany, groups of unemployed people took a stance for the reform.<ref name=\"archiv-grundeinkommen.de\">Blaschke, Ronald (January 2010).

Basic income is currently discussed from a variety of perspectives\u2014including in the context of ongoing automation and robotisation, often with the argument that these trends mean less paid work in the future, which would create a need for a new welfare model. Several countries are planning for local or regional experiments with basic income or related welfare systems. For example, experiments in Canada, Finland, India and Namibia have received international media attention. The [[2016 Swiss referendums#Basic income referendum|first and only national referendum about basic income]] was held in Switzerland in 2016. The result was a rejection of the basic income proposal by a vote of 76.9% to 23.1%.\n\n== Perspectives in the basic income debate ==\n=== Automation ===\n{{main|Automation}}\n[[File:Andrew Yang by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Andrew Yang holding a microphone while making a speech|Entrepreneur and [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic candidate]] [[Andrew Yang]] has advocated for a basic income to counter [[Technological unemployment|job displacement through automation]].

One example is [[Chris Hughes]], co-founder of both [[Facebook]] and Economic Security Project. Automation has been happening for hundreds of years and while it has not permanently reduced the employment rate, it has constantly caused employment instability. It displaces workers who spend their lives learning skills that become outmoded and forces them into unskilled labor. [[Paul Vall\u00e9e]], a Canadian tech-entrepreneur and CEO of [[Pythian Group|Pythian]], argues that automation is at least as likely to increase poverty and reduce social mobility as it is to create ever-increasing unemployment rate. At the 2016 North American Basic Income Guarantee Congress in Winnipeg, Vall\u00e9e examined slavery as a historical example of a period in which capital (African slaves) could do the same things that paid labor (poor whites) could do. He found that slavery did not cause massive unemployment among poor whites, but instead it increased economic inequality and lowered social mobility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZbXto44n1sKTVgrfl8u_p9vrgoS7WXX0O_le39GyyM/edit#slide=id.p4|title=Paul Vallee, Basic Income, for publication|via=Google Docs|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Bad behavior ===\nCriticism of a basic income includes the argument that some recipients would spend a basic income on alcohol and other drugs.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\"/><ref>Koga, Kenya. \"Pennies From Heaven.\" Economist 409.8859 (2013): 67\u201368.

In the negative income tax-experiments in United States in the 1970s, for example, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher.

The researchers\u2014Damon Jones from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and [[Ioana Marinescu]] from the University of Pennsylvania School of Public Policy and Practice\u2014maintain that although there is a small decrease in work by recipients due to reasons like those in the Manitoba experiment, there has been a 17 percent increase in part-time jobs. The authors theorize that employment remained steady, because the extra income that let people buy more also increased demand for service jobs. This finding is consistent with the economic data of the time. No effect was seen when it came to jobs in manufacturing, which produce exports. Essentially, the authors argue, macro-economic effects of higher spending supported overall employment. To use an illustrative but hypothetical example, someone who uses the dividend to help with car payments can cut back on hours working as a cashier at a local grocery store. Because more people are spending more, the store must replace the worker who started working less. Meanwhile, distribution of the dividend doesn't affect the international demand for oil and the jobs connected to it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/|title=A universal basic income experiment in Alaska shows employment didn't drop |publisher=Quartz|website=qz.com|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10|title=Critics of universal basic income argue giving people money for nothing discourages working\u2014but a study of Alaska's 36-year-old program suggests that's not the case|work=Business Insider|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> Jones and Marinescu found instead that the larger scale of the program is what allows it to work and not dissuade people out of the work force.\n\nAnother study that contradicted such decline in work incentive was a pilot project implemented in 2008 and 2009 in the Namibian village of [[Omitara]].

If the resources necessary to an individual's survival are controlled by another group, that individual has no reasonable choice other than to do whatever the resource-controlling group demands. Before the establishment of governments and landlords, individuals had direct access to the resources they needed to survive. Today, resources necessary for the production of food, shelter and clothing have been privatized in such a way that some have gotten a share and others have not.\n\nTherefore, the argument goes that the owners of those resources owe compensation back to non-owners, sufficient at least for them to purchase the resources or goods necessary to sustain their basic needs. This redistribution must be unconditional because people can consider themselves free only if they are not forced to spend all their time doing the bidding of others simply to provide basic necessities to themselves and their families.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\" /> Under this argument, personal, political and religious freedom are worth little without the power to say no. In this view, basic income provides an economic freedom which\u2014combined with political freedom, freedom of belief and personal freedom\u2014establish each individual's status as a free person.\n\n=== Gender equality ===\nThe Scottish economist [[Ailsa McKay]] has argued that basic income is a way to promote [[gender equality]].<ref name=\"mckay1\" /><ref>{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Ailsa |year=2005 |title= The Future of Social Security Policy: Women, Work and a Citizens Basic Income |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |page= |isbn= 9781134287185 |author-link=Ailsa McKay }}</ref> She noted in 2001 that \"social policy reform should take account of all gender inequalities and not just those relating to the traditional labor market\" and that \"the citizens' basic income model can be a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights\".<ref name=\"mckay1\">{{cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |author-link1=Ailsa McKay |year=2001 |title= Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income |url= |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 97\u2013118 |doi=10.1080/13545700010022721 }}</ref>\n\nWomen perform the majority of unpaid care work around the world.

There have also been several basic income experiments held in various countries such as Namibia, Kenya and Canada as discussed elsewhere on this page. The policy was discussed by the Indian Ministry of Finance in an economic survey in 2017,<ref name=\"India Considers Fighting Poverty With a Universal Basic Income|author=Raymond Zhong\">https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2017/01/31/india-considers-fighting-poverty-with-a-universal-basic-income/</ref> and a green paper was commissioned on the topic by the [[Government of Ireland]] in 2002.<ref>https://www.socialjustice.ie/sites/default/files/attach/policy-issue-article/3304/16601.pdf</ref> There are also a number of countries such as Ireland and Mexico that have programs with elements reminiscent of UBI such as [[child benefit]], [[old age pension]]s or [[conditional cash transfer]]s, but these are usually not discussed in relation to Basic Income. So far no country has introduced an unconditional basic income as law.\n\n== Public opinion ==\nSupport for a universal basic income varies widely across Europe, as shown by a recent wave of the European Social Survey. A high share of the population tends to support the scheme in southern and central eastern European Union countries, while support tends to be lower in western European countries such as France and Germany, and even lower in Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Sweden. Individuals who face greater economic insecurity, for instance because of low income and unemployment tend to be more supportive of a basic income.<ref>Tim Vlandas, \"The Politics of the Basic Income Guarantee: Analysing Individual Support in Europe\", ''Basic Income Studies'', vol. 14, no. 1 (06 June 2019)  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2018-0021 </ref> Overall, support tends to be on average higher in countries where existing unemployment benefits are not generous and/or where the unemployed are activated in the sense that the receipt of benefits is conditional on certain job search behaviour <ref>Tim Vlandas, \"The Political Economy of Individual Level Support for the Basic Income in Europe\", ''[[Journal of European Social Policy]]'', forthcoming (2020)  https://vlandas.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/vlandas_jesp_basic-income_december2019_acceptedversion.pdf </ref>\n\nA poll conducted by the [[University of Chicago]] indicates that 51% of Americans from the ages of 18\u201336 support a monthly basic income of $1,000.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bowden |first1=John |title=Majority of young Americans support universal basic income, public healthcare: poll |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/490297-study-indicates-majority-of-young-americans-support-universal |accessdate=31 March 2020 |work=The Hill |date=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Petitions, polls and referendums ==\n* 2008: an official petition for basic income was started in [[Germany]] by [[Susanne Wiest]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.piratenpartei.de/2013/06/27/bundestag-will-petition-zum-bedingungslosen-grundeinkommen-ohne-diskussion-abschliesen/ |title = Bundestag will Petition zum bedingungslosen Grundeinkommen ohne Diskussion abschlie\u00dfen \u203a Piratenpartei Deutschland |publisher = Piratenpartei.de |date =  |accessdate = 5 June 2016 }}</ref> The petition was accepted and Susanne Wiest was invited for a hearing at the German parliament's Commission of Petitions.

His books are based largely on his observations of birds in the Essex countryside especially in the area from Chelmsford to the coast. He was unable to drive (despite working for [[The Automobile Association]]) and travelled by bicycle.
