Born in Connecticut, he moved to New York with his family, where he learned several [[Iroquoian languages]] and worked as an interpreter in the fur trade. He was well-equipped to work with [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and other Iroquois Confederacy warriors who became allies of the British during the rebellion. \n\nDuring the War, Butler led [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] forces in the [[Saratoga campaign]] in New York. He later raised and commanded a regiment of rangers, which included affiliated Mohawk and other Iroquois nations' warriors. They conducted raids in central New York west of Albany, including what became known among the rebels as the [[Cherry Valley Massacre]].\n\nAfter the war Butler resettled in [[Upper Canada]], where he was given a grant of land by the Crown for his services. Butler continued his leadership in the developing province, helping to found the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican Church]] and [[Freemasonry in Canada|Masonic Order]], and serving in public office.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Butler was born to Walter Butler and Deborah Dennison, n\u00e9e Ely, in [[New London, Connecticut]] in 1728.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/butler_john_1796_4E.html|title=Butler, John |volume=4|first=R. Arthur|last=Bowler|last2=Wilson |first2=Bruce G.}}</ref>  In 1742, his father moved the family to [[Fort Hunter]] on the frontier in the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk Valley]] near the modern village of [[Fonda, New York]].  In 1752, John Butler married Catharine (Catalyntje) Bradt, of Dutch ancestry. The couple raised five children (two others died in infancy).  Having learned several Iroquois and other Indigenous languages, Butler was employed as an interpreter, especially in the lucrative [[fur trade]].\n\n==French and Indian War==\nIn 1755, John Butler was appointed to the rank of Captain in the [[Indian Department]] of the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|British colonial government]]. He served in the [[French and Indian War]] under [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]].  In 1758, he saw action with [[James Abercrombie (British Army general)|James Abercromby]] at [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|Fort Ticonderoga]] and [[John Bradstreet]] at the [[Battle of Fort Frontenac]]. In 1759, he was made second in command of the Indians with Johnson at the [[Battle of Fort Niagara]]. In 1760, he continued as a second in command of the Indians in [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]]'s force at [[Montreal]].\n\n==Pre-American Revolution years==\nAfter the war Butler returned to the Mohawk Valley in New York. He acquired more land, building an estate of 26,000 acres (105&nbsp;km\u00b2) at Butlersbury near the major Mohawk village of [[Caughnawaga Indian Village Site|Caughnawaga]]. He was second only to [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]], British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as a wealthy frontier land owner, and worked under Johnson for the British. \n\nButler was also appointed a judge in the [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]] court and was commissioned Lt.-Colonel of [[Guy Johnson]]'s regiment of [[Tryon County militia]]. Butler was elected as one of the two members representing Tryon County in the [[Province of New York|New York]] assembly.\n\n==American Revolutionary War==\nJohn Butler returned to service, as a Loyalist, when the [[American Revolution]] turned to war in 1775. In May 1775, he left for Canada in the company of [[Daniel Claus]], [[Walter Butler (Loyalist)|Walter Butler]], [[Hon Yost Schuyler]] and [[Joseph Brant]], a Mohawk leader. On July 7, they reached [[Fort Oswego]] and in August, Montreal. Butler participated in the defense of Montreal against an attack led by [[Ethan Allen]]. In November, Carleton sent him to [[Fort Niagara]] with instructions to keep the Indians neutral.\n\nHis oldest son, Walter Butler served with him, but his wife and other children were detained by the American rebels.\n\nIn March 1776, John Butler sent a party of about 100 allied Indians to Montreal to force the Americans out of Quebec. In May, Butler received instructions to use a warrior party of the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] in an attack on New York. On June 5 he received instructions to send as many Indians as he could to Fort Oswego for an attack on [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|Fort Stanwix]] as a part of the Saratoga campaign. He was put second in command of the Indians, primarily warriors of bands of four nations of the Iroquois, under [[Daniel Claus]].\n\nJohn Butler led the Indians and a small number of Loyalists, in a successful [[ambush]], of rebel militia and [[Oneida people|Oneida]] warriors in the [[Battle of Oriskany]]. As a result, after this expedition he was commissioned a [[Lieutenant Colonel|lieutenant colonel]] and given authority to raise his own [[regiment]], which became known as Butler's Rangers, initially with a strength of eight [[company (military unit)|companies]].  He traveled back to Fort Niagara, and completed recruiting the first company in December.\n\nIn July 1778, John Butler led his rangers and Iroquois allies at the [[Battle of Wyoming]], in which he defeated [[Zebulon Butler]] and took [[Forty Fort]]. The Patriots suffered heavy losses, and after the battle Butler's Rangers burned many of the colonists' homes in the area. Later, the battle was referred to as the Wyoming Valley massacre because some of the victorious Loyalists and Iroquois were said to have executed and scalped prisoners and fleeing enemy soldiers.\n\nLater that year, after the burning of [[Tioga, New York|Tioga]], his son Captain Walter Butler led two companies of rangers and 300 Iroquois warriors in a raid which was later referred to as the [[Cherry Valley massacre]]. The name of Butler was thereafter anathema to the rebels.<ref>And to their supporters in England. On Dec. 7, 1778, Marquis Rockingham introduced a motion in the House of Lords condemning the atrocities. Earl Camden was the last speaker in the debate, and after describing some of the administration's actions and statements, asked, \"What was that hell-hound\u2014he asked pardon for the expression, but he could give him no other title\u2014colonel Butler, doing now?\" 20 Cobbett/Hansard, Parliamentary History, 43. He ended with a general denunciation of the administration's policy in America. Its policy was \"one of the most plain and palpable proofs of weakness, incapacity, and cowardice, that ever was seen. The fair inference from it was, \u2018We have tried our strength, we find ourselves incapable of conquest, and as we can't subdue, we are determined to destroy.\u2019\u201d Id.

Born in Connecticut, he moved to New York with his family, where he learned several [[Iroquoian languages]] and worked as an interpreter in the fur trade. He was well-equipped to work with [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and other Iroquois Confederacy warriors who became allies of the British during the rebellion. \n\nDuring the War, Butler led [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] forces in the [[Saratoga campaign]] in New York. He later raised and commanded a regiment of rangers, which included affiliated Mohawk and other Iroquois nations' warriors. They conducted raids in central New York west of Albany, including what became known among the rebels as the [[Cherry Valley Massacre]].\n\nAfter the war Butler resettled in [[Upper Canada]], where he was given a grant of land by the Crown for his services. Butler continued his leadership in the developing province, helping to found the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican Church]] and [[Freemasonry in Canada|Masonic Order]], and serving in public office.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Butler was born to Walter Butler and Deborah Dennison, n\u00e9e Ely, in [[New London, Connecticut]] in 1728.<ref>{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/butler_john_1796_4E.html|title=Butler, John |volume=4|first=R. Arthur|last=Bowler|last2=Wilson |first2=Bruce G.}}</ref>  In 1742, his father moved the family to [[Fort Hunter]] on the frontier in the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk Valley]] near the modern village of [[Fonda, New York]].  In 1752, John Butler married Catharine (Catalyntje) Bradt, of Dutch ancestry. The couple raised five children (two others died in infancy).  Having learned several Iroquois and other Indigenous languages, Butler was employed as an interpreter, especially in the lucrative [[fur trade]].\n\n==French and Indian War==\nIn 1755, John Butler was appointed to the rank of Captain in the [[Indian Department]] of the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|British colonial government]]. He served in the [[French and Indian War]] under [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]].  In 1758, he saw action with [[James Abercrombie (British Army general)|James Abercromby]] at [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|Fort Ticonderoga]] and [[John Bradstreet]] at the [[Battle of Fort Frontenac]]. In 1759, he was made second in command of the Indians with Johnson at the [[Battle of Fort Niagara]]. In 1760, he continued as a second in command of the Indians in [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]]'s force at [[Montreal]].\n\n==Pre-American Revolution years==\nAfter the war Butler returned to the Mohawk Valley in New York. He acquired more land, building an estate of 26,000 acres (105&nbsp;km\u00b2) at Butlersbury near the major Mohawk village of [[Caughnawaga Indian Village Site|Caughnawaga]]. He was second only to [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]], British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as a wealthy frontier land owner, and worked under Johnson for the British. \n\nButler was also appointed a judge in the [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]] court and was commissioned Lt.-Colonel of [[Guy Johnson]]'s regiment of [[Tryon County militia]]. Butler was elected as one of the two members representing Tryon County in the [[Province of New York|New York]] assembly.\n\n==American Revolutionary War==\nJohn Butler returned to service, as a Loyalist, when the [[American Revolution]] turned to war in 1775. In May 1775, he left for Canada in the company of [[Daniel Claus]], [[Walter Butler (Loyalist)|Walter Butler]], [[Hon Yost Schuyler]] and [[Joseph Brant]], a Mohawk leader. On July 7, they reached [[Fort Oswego]] and in August, Montreal. Butler participated in the defense of Montreal against an attack led by [[Ethan Allen]]. In November, Carleton sent him to [[Fort Niagara]] with instructions to keep the Indians neutral.\n\nHis oldest son, Walter Butler served with him, but his wife and other children were detained by the American rebels.\n\nIn March 1776, John Butler sent a party of about 100 allied Indians to Montreal to force the Americans out of Quebec. In May, Butler received instructions to use a warrior party of the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] in an attack on New York.  On June 5 he received instructions to send as many Indians as he could to Fort Oswego for an attack on [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|Fort Stanwix]] as a part of the Saratoga campaign. He was put second in command of the Indians, primarily warriors of bands of four nations of the Iroquois, under [[Daniel Claus]].\n\nJohn Butler led the Indians and a small number of Loyalists, in a successful [[ambush]], of rebel militia and [[Oneida people|Oneida]] warriors in the [[Battle of Oriskany]]. As a result, after this expedition he was commissioned a [[Lieutenant Colonel|lieutenant colonel]] and given authority to raise his own [[regiment]], which became known as Butler's Rangers, initially with a strength of eight [[company (military unit)|companies]].  He traveled back to Fort Niagara, and completed recruiting the first company in December.\n\nIn July 1778, John Butler led his rangers and Iroquois allies at the [[Battle of Wyoming]], in which he defeated [[Zebulon Butler]] and took [[Forty Fort]]. The Patriots suffered heavy losses, and after the battle Butler's Rangers burned many of the colonists' homes in the area. Later, the battle was referred to as the Wyoming Valley massacre because some of the victorious Loyalists and Iroquois were said to have executed and scalped prisoners and fleeing enemy soldiers.\n\nLater that year, after the burning of [[Tioga, New York|Tioga]], his son Captain Walter Butler led two companies of rangers and 300 Iroquois warriors in a raid which was later referred to as the [[Cherry Valley massacre]]. The name of Butler was thereafter anathema to the rebels.<ref>And to their supporters in England. On Dec. 7, 1778, Marquis Rockingham introduced a motion in the House of Lords condemning the atrocities. Earl Camden was the last speaker in the debate, and after describing some of the administration's actions and statements, asked, \"What was that hell-hound -- he asked pardon for the expression, but he could give him no other title -- colonel Butler, doing now?\" 20 Cobbett/Hansard, Parliamentary History, 43. He ended with a general denunciation of the admistration's policy in America. Its policy was \"one of the most plain and palpable proofs of weakness. incapacity, and cowardice, that ever was seen. The fair inference from it was, \u2018We have tried our strength, we find ourselves incapable of conquest, and as we can't subdue, we are determined to destroy.\u2019\u201d Id.

{"title_page": "Litigation funding", "text_new": "'''Litigation funding''', also known as '''[[legal financing]]''' and '''third-party litigation funding''' (TPLF), enables a party to [[Lawsuit|litigate]] or [[Arbitration|arbitrate]] without having to pay for it, whether because they are unable to pay for it or because they do not want to. A third party professional funder can pay some or all of the costs/expenses associated with a dispute in return for a share of the proceeds of the dispute if it is successful. If the litigation is not successful, the funder bears the costs it has agreed to fund. \n\n==Overview==\nLitigation funding has two major divisions: consumer financing, commonly referred to as pre-settlement funding or plaintiff advances, and commercial financing. Consumer financing generally consists of small advances between $500 and $2000. Prominent consumer financing companies include LawCash, Oasis Financial, and RD Legal Funding. Commercial financing for companies to pursue legal claims generally is dedicated towards payment of attorney fees and litigation costs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/business/17lawsuit.html?pagewanted=all|title=Lawsuit Loans Add New Risk for the Injured|last=Appelbaum|first=Benyamin|date=2011-01-16|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref>  Prominent commercial financing companies include Bentham IMF, Burford Capital, Lake Whillans Litigation Finance, Longford Capital Management, Therium Capital Management, Parabellum Capital, and Woodsford Litigation Funding<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chambers.com/guide/usa?publicationTypeId=58&practiceAreaId=2816&subsectionTypeId=1&locationId=12788|title=Chambers Rankings - Litigation Funding in USA - Nationwide|last=|first=|date=|website=Chambers and Partners|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>.\n\nVarious new websites are also promoting the use of litigation crowdfunding, in which case hundreds or tens of thousands of individuals can help to pay for a legal dispute, either investing in a case in return for part of a contingent fee, or offering donations to support a legal right that they believe in.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121144155/https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |archivedate=2015-11-21 }}</ref>\n\nLitigation funding can be broadly split into 4 different forms in the UK, [[Contingent fee|Conditional fee agreements]], [[Costs in English law#Damages-Based Agreements|Damages Based Agreements]], [[Costs in English law#Fixed costs and fees|Fixed Fees]] and '''Third Party Funding'''.\n\n==History==\nLitigation funding is not a new concept. It has been permitted in England and Wales since 1967. Modern commercial litigation funding arose in [[Australia]] in the late 1990s, with IMF Bentham becoming the world\u2019s first publicly listed litigation funder (ASX: IMF) in 2001.

The High Court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Civil Procedure Rules (the \u201cCPR\u201d) to compel the Claimants to produce the Agreement.  In addition to this, the Court found that the document was not relevant for the purpose of disclosure, and that, in any event, it attracted litigation privilege as it was individually negotiated between the solicitors for the Claimants and the Insurer.  The disclosure of the agreement was likely to prejudice the Claimants in the conduct of the litigation.\n \nCiting the Government\u2019s conclusions following its consultation in 2000 on \u201cConditional Fees: Sharing the Risks of Litigation\u201d, the Senior Master reiterated that in privately funded litigation there is no obligation on either party to disclose how a case is being funded.  However, in spite of this, the CPR does ensure that a losing party who may be subject to additional costs as a result of a funding arrangement should have access to certain specific information about that arrangement. The Court held that these requirements of the CPR balanced the \u201cinterests of the parties with funding arrangements and the interests of those who face the claims for additional costs which result from them\u201d and should therefore be considered sufficient without the necessity to disclose the entire agreement.\n\n'''2008'''\n\n'''''London & Regional (St George\u2019s Court) Ltd v Ministry of Defence'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/london___regional_v_ministry_of_defence.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2008] EWHC 526, full judgment</ref>\n\nStates that the modern authorities demonstrate a flexible approach where courts have generally declined to hold that an agreement under which a party provided assistance with litigation in return for a share of the proceeds was unenforceable.\n\n'''2007'''\n\n'''''Myatt v National Coal Board (No.2)'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/myatt___ors_v_national_coal_board__2007__ewca_civ_307_(16_march_2007).pdf]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2007] EWCA Civ 307, full judgment</ref>\n\nIn this case there had been an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Appeal against a decision holding that a CFA entered into by a particular firm of solicitors in 4 test cases was unenforceable. This had two consequences. The first was that the claimants themselves would have to bear the cost of the ATE insurance premium from the damages recovered by them. The second was that the solicitors would be unable to recover their profit costs in those cases and in other similar cases; the total sum at stake so far as the solicitors were concerned was in the region of \u00a3200,000. The solicitors had apparently agreed to fund the appeals at their own expense, and the successful respondent sought an order that they should pay the costs of the appeal as a non-party funder. The Court of Appeal made the order sought. They held that the court had jurisdiction to do so where litigation was pursued by the client for the benefit, or to a substantial degree, for the benefit of the solicitor, because in such circumstances the solicitor was a real party to the litigation. However, because the respondents had failed to give prior notice of their intention to make such an application, which they held was normally incumbent on a party seeking such an order so as to give the solicitor the opportunity to consider whether or not to continue in the light of the risk of such an order being made, and because the appeal had been pursued in part for the client\u2019s own interests, the fair order was that the solicitors should pay 50% of the costs.\n\n'''2005'''\n\n'''''Arkin v Borchard Lines Ltd & Ors'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/arkin.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2005] EWCA Civ 655, full judgment</ref>\n\nEnglish Court of Appeal decision explicitly endorses funding as part of its judgment.

It was relevant that it was the practice in this market to be remunerated on a similar basis.\n\n'''2001'''\n\n'''''Stocznia Gdanska v Latreefers'''''<ref>[2001] 2 SCLC 116 (CA)</ref>\n\nFunders agreed to finance commercial litigation in exchange for 55% of the proceeds.\n \nThey agreed to pay the between-the-parties costs if the litigation failed. They also had a prior commercial interest in the litigation because they were already owed money under an agreement which successful litigation would enable them to recover.\n \nThe defendants sought a stay of the proceedings on the ground of champerty. Although the Court of Appeal did not have to decide whether or not the agreement was champertous, it was strongly of the view that it was not, because the alleged disproportion was more theoretical than real, the funders were undertaking a very substantial potential costs liability, they had a pre-existing interest in the subject-matter of the claim and they would not be able to influence the conduct of the litigation because that, including any negotiations, was in the hands of experienced solicitors\n \n'''1994'''\n\n'''''Giles v Thompson [1994]'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/gulf_azov_v_idisi.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} UKHL 2, full judgment</ref>\n\nConsidered champerty and the correct question of whether in accordance with contemporary public policy, the funding agreement has in fact caused the corruption of public justice.\n\n'''1987'''\n\n'''''Guinness Peat Properties Ltd and G.M.

In this instance the third party was an insurance company, but the judgment bears relevance for all third parties because it sheds light on how the concept of the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of a document will be interpreted in such circumstances.  In this instance, the document was a notice of a potential claim under an insurance contract, sent to the insurer, who would then send it on to their legal advisors to obtain an opinion on the merits of the potential claim.\n \nThe Court of Appeal decided that the document attracted litigation privilege because at the time it was created, litigation had commenced and the document was created for the dominant purpose of obtaining advice in relation to that litigation.  It was held that, when looking at the dominant purpose of a document, it was necessary for the Courts to take a wider view; the entire context of the creation of the document should be considered.  In particular, the Court of Appeal held that it was important to look at the motivation of the party requiring the document to be created (which was that it would be used by the insurer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice) and not simply the intention of those composing or preparing the document (which was in order to fulfil its obligation to notify the insurer). The document prepared for the third party was therefore held to be privileged\n\n'''1982'''\n\n'''''Trendtex Trading Corp v Credit Suisse'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/trendtex_trading_corp_v_credit_suisse_(1982__eng_hl).pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327003708/http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/trendtex_trading_corp_v_credit_suisse_(1982__eng_hl).pdf |date=2014-03-27 }}[1982] AC 679 HL, full judgment</ref>\n\nAlthough there was a champertous element in the funding agreement it contained a clause giving the Swiss courts exclusive jurisdiction and there was room for the operation of this clause notwithstanding the element of champerty.\n\n'''1955'''\n\n'''''Martell v Consett Iron Company'''''<ref>[1955] 1 Ch 363</ref>\n\nStates that a defendant shall not be entitled to stay proceedings even if a funding agreement is deemed champertous.\n\n'''1880'''\n\n'''''Seear v Lawson'''''<ref>[1880] 15 Ch D 426</ref>\n\nFunding endorsed in the United Kingdom in the context of insolvencies.\n\n==Policy and regulation==\n\n'''2017'''\n\nThe Ministry of Justice for the United Kingdom confirmed that it would not impose statutory regulations on third party litigation funders, opting instead to allow funders to continue functioning under the current voluntary scheme<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/moj-not-minded-to-regulate-third-party-litigation-funding/5059536.article|title=MoJ not minded to regulate third-party litigation funding|work=Law Society Gazette|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}</ref>.\n\n'''[[Singapore]]''' passed legislation permitting funding in support of international arbitrations and related proceedings.

The High Court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Civil Procedure Rules (the \u201cCPR\u201d) to compel the Claimants to produce the Agreement.  In addition to this, the Court found that the document was not relevant for the purpose of disclosure, and that, in any event, it attracted litigation privilege as it was individually negotiated between the solicitors for the Claimants and the Insurer.  The disclosure of the agreement was likely to prejudice the Claimants in the conduct of the litigation.\n \nCiting the Government\u2019s conclusions following its consultation in 2000 on \u201cConditional Fees: Sharing the Risks of Litigation\u201d, the Senior Master reiterated that in privately funded litigation there is no obligation on either party to disclose how a case is being funded.  However, in spite of this, the CPR does ensure that a losing party who may be subject to additional costs as a result of a funding arrangement should have access to certain specific information about that arrangement. The Court held that these requirements of the CPR balanced the \u201cinterests of the parties with funding arrangements and the interests of those who face the claims for additional costs which result from them\u201d and should therefore be considered sufficient without the necessity to disclose the entire agreement.\n\n'''2008'''\n\n'''''London & Regional (St George\u2019s Court) Ltd v Ministry of Defence'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/london___regional_v_ministry_of_defence.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2008] EWHC 526, full judgment</ref>\n\nStates that the modern authorities demonstrate a flexible approach where courts have generally declined to hold that an agreement under which a party provided assistance with litigation in return for a share of the proceeds was unenforceable.\n\n'''2007'''\n\n'''''Myatt v National Coal Board (No.2)'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/myatt___ors_v_national_coal_board__2007__ewca_civ_307_(16_march_2007).pdf]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2007] EWCA Civ 307, full judgment</ref>\n\nIn this case there had been an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Appeal against a decision holding that a CFA entered into by a particular firm of solicitors in 4 test cases was unenforceable. This had two consequences. The first was that the claimants themselves would have to bear the cost of the ATE insurance premium from the damages recovered by them. The second was that the solicitors would be unable to recover their profit costs in those cases and in other similar cases; the total sum at stake so far as the solicitors were concerned was in the region of \u00a3200,000. The solicitors had apparently agreed to fund the appeals at their own expense, and the successful respondent sought an order that they should pay the costs of the appeal as a non-party funder. The Court of Appeal made the order sought. They held that the court had jurisdiction to do so where litigation was pursued by the client for the benefit, or to a substantial degree, for the benefit of the solicitor, because in such circumstances the solicitor was a real party to the litigation. However, because the respondents had failed to give prior notice of their intention to make such an application, which they held was normally incumbent on a party seeking such an order so as to give the solicitor the opportunity to consider whether or not to continue in the light of the risk of such an order being made, and because the appeal had been pursued in part for the client\u2019s own interests, the fair order was that the solicitors should pay 50% of the costs.\n\n'''2005'''\n\n'''''Arkin v Borchard Lines Ltd & Ors'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/arkin.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[2005] EWCA Civ 655, full judgment</ref>\n\nEnglish Court of Appeal decision explicitly endorses funding as part of its judgment.

Although the Court of Appeal did not have to decide whether or not the agreement was champertous, it was strongly of the view that it was not, because the alleged disproportion was more theoretical than real, the funders were undertaking a very substantial potential costs liability, they had a pre-existing interest in the subject-matter of the claim and they would not be able to influence the conduct of the litigation because that, including any negotiations, was in the hands of experienced solicitors\n \n'''1994'''\n\n'''''Giles v Thompson [1994]'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/gulf_azov_v_idisi.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} UKHL 2, full judgment</ref>\n\nConsidered champerty and the correct question of whether in accordance with contemporary public policy, the funding agreement has in fact caused the corruption of public justice.\n\n'''1987'''\n\n'''''Guinness Peat Properties Ltd and G.M.

In this instance the third party was an insurance company, but the judgment bears relevance for all third parties because it sheds light on how the concept of the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of a document will be interpreted in such circumstances.  In this instance, the document was a notice of a potential claim under an insurance contract, sent to the insurer, who would then send it on to their legal advisors to obtain an opinion on the merits of the potential claim.\n \nThe Court of Appeal decided that the document attracted litigation privilege because at the time it was created, litigation had commenced and the document was created for the dominant purpose of obtaining advice in relation to that litigation.  It was held that, when looking at the dominant purpose of a document, it was necessary for the Courts to take a wider view; the entire context of the creation of the document should be considered.  In particular, the Court of Appeal held that it was important to look at the motivation of the party requiring the document to be created (which was that it would be used by the insurer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice) and not simply the intention of those composing or preparing the document (which was in order to fulfil its obligation to notify the insurer). The document prepared for the third party was therefore held to be privileged\n\n'''1982'''\n\n'''''Trendtex Trading Corp v Credit Suisse'''''<ref>[http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/trendtex_trading_corp_v_credit_suisse_(1982__eng_hl).pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327003708/http://www.harbourlitigationfunding.com/pdfs/trendtex_trading_corp_v_credit_suisse_(1982__eng_hl).pdf |date=2014-03-27 }}[1982] AC 679 HL, full judgment</ref>\n\nAlthough there was a champertous element in the funding agreement it contained a clause giving the Swiss courts exclusive jurisdiction and there was room for the operation of this clause notwithstanding the element of champerty.\n\n'''1955'''\n\n'''''Martell v Consett Iron Company'''''<ref>[1955] 1 Ch 363</ref>\n\nStates that a defendant shall not be entitled to stay proceedings even if a funding agreement is deemed champertous.\n\n'''1880'''\n\n'''''Seear v Lawson'''''<ref>[1880] 15 Ch D 426</ref>\n\nFunding endorsed in the United Kingdom in the context of insolvencies.\n\n==Policy and regulation==\n\n'''2017'''\n\nThe Ministry of Justice for the United Kingdom confirmed that it would not impose statutory regulations on third party litigation funders, opting instead to allow funders to continue functioning under the current voluntary scheme<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/moj-not-minded-to-regulate-third-party-litigation-funding/5059536.article|title=MoJ not minded to regulate third-party litigation funding|work=Law Society Gazette|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}</ref>.\n\n'''[[Singapore]]''' passed legislation permitting funding in support of international arbitrations and related proceedings.
