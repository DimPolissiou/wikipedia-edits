All [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]] were killed in the operation, with no fatalities amongst the passengers and crew.\n\n* 31 October 2000 \u2013 [[Singapore Airlines Flight 006]], a [[Boeing 747-400]], attempted to take off on the wrong runway at [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] (previously Chiang Kai-shek International Airport) while departing for [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. It collided with the construction equipment that was parked on a closed runway, killing 83 of the 179 onboard and injuring a further 71 people. This was the first and only fatal accident of a Singapore Airlines aircraft to date. The aircraft 9V-SPK was painted in a \"Tropical\" promotional livery at the time of the accident.

The only other aircraft painted with the promotional [[livery]], another 747-400 registered 9V-SPL, was immediately removed from service and repainted with standard Singapore Airlines livery.\n\n* 12 March 2003 - A [[Boeing 747-400]] operating as Singapore Airlines Flight 286 from [[Auckland International Airport]] to [[Changi Airport]] was involved in a tailstrike while taking off from Auckland's Runway 23L, causing severe damage to the aircraft's tail and damaging the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit), causing in-flight APU fire warnings. The flight returned to Auckland with no fatalities or injuries onboard. The cause was later determined to be an error in the pilots' calculations of the aircraft's takeoff weight and reference speeds, which caused the pilots to [[Rotation (aeronautics)|rotate]] the aircraft prematurely.\n\n* 27 June 2016 \u2013 [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], with 222 passengers and 19 crew onboard, suffered an engine oil-leak during a flight from Singapore to Milan.

The use of an honor code depends on the notion that people (at least within the community) can be [[Trust (sociology)|trusted]] to act honorably.  Those who are in violation of the honor code can be subject to various [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]], including [[expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] from the institution.  Honor codes are used to deter [[academic dishonesty]] and should be taken seriously at all times.\n\n==History==\nThe documented history of an academic honor code dates back to 1736 at [[The College of William and Mary]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/honorcodeandstudentconduct/honorcode/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324161444/http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/honorcodeandstudentconduct/honorcode/ |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref> and is the oldest honor code in the United States. Still a tradition, students administer the honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the College. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs. The [[College of William and Mary]] founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an honor code of conduct for students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|title=History & Traditions - William & Mary|website=www.wm.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203155247/http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|archivedate=December 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is based upon the premise that honor is one's most cherished attribute.\n\nIn a community devoted to learning, a foundation of honor among individuals must exist if that community is to thrive with respect and harmony among its members. An honor system is an ideal mechanism to ensure such a state of affairs. With it, students and faculty are afforded a freedom that otherwise may not be available. With that freedom comes each individual's responsibility to conduct oneself in such a way that the spirit of mutual trust which sustains the system is not compromised.\n\nThe Honor Code applies to alleged acts of lying, stealing or cheating that adversely affect the College community committed by a student on campus or elsewhere.\n\n==US military service academies==\n{{Main|Cadet Honor Code|Honor Concept}}\nPresently, some of the most notable and most stringent honor codes exist at the [[United States service academies|Federal Service Academies]] and [[United States senior military college|Senior Military Colleges]].\n\nThe military academy honor codes not only govern the [[Officer cadet|cadets']] and [[midshipman|midshipmen's]] lives at the academies but also are deemed essential to the development of military officers who are worthy of the public trust. As such, the codes are not limited merely to academic situations or to conduct on campus; cadets and midshipmen are expected to live by the codes' ethical standards at all times.  The codes are as old as the academies themselves and simply state that cadets and midshipmen do not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do. A single-sanction Honor Code, in which any offense results in expulsion regardless of severity, exists at [[Virginia Military Institute]], which features a \"drum out\" ceremony which is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal. Outside of the military, [[Washington and Lee University]] and the [[University of Virginia]] also have single sanction codes.\n\nAt three of the service academies and at [[Virginia Military Institute]], anyone who learns of an honor code violation is required to report it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|title=VMI Honor System History - VMI Archives - Virginia Military Institute|website=www.vmi.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803180952/http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|archivedate=August 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Failure to do so is considered \"toleration,\" which itself violates the code. That also holds true at schools with combined cadet and traditional student programs, such as [[Norwich University]], [[Texas A&M]], and [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], whose honor codes specifically provide that all students, both cadets and civilians, do not \"tolerate those who do.\" It is notable that the three [[Senior Military Colleges]] have two honor codes, one for cadets and one for civilians, whether on-campus or through distance online programs, etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203841/http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archivedate=September 14, 2016|df=mdy-all|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920090937/http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|archivedate=September 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy allows the observer of an honor violation to confront the accused without formally reporting. It was found that it was more constructive at developing the honor of midshipmen.  A non-toleration clause, on the other hand, is believed to make enemies of classmates. Additionally, it is thought that one's true honor, if other than utmost, was not able to be formally remediated when hidden from public view. Under the academies' honor codes, violators can face severe punishment, up to being forwarded for expulsion by the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |title=DoD Directive 1332.23, \"Service Academy Disenrollment\", February 19, 1988 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133445/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nStringent honor codes, however, are not limited to military institutions. The all-male [[Hampden\u2013Sydney College]] is reputed for an honor code system on a par with military systems,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} which extends to all student activities both on and off campus (off-campus violations can be prosecuted), and also like the military system, it considers tolerance of a violation itself a violation.

Still a tradition, students administer the honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the College. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs. The [[College of William and Mary]] founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an honor code of conduct for students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|title=History & Traditions - William & Mary|website=www.wm.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203155247/http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|archivedate=December 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is based upon the premise that honor is one's most cherished attribute.\n\nIn a community devoted to learning, a foundation of honor among individuals must exist if that community is to thrive with respect and harmony among its members. An honor system is an ideal mechanism to ensure such a state of affairs. With it, students and faculty are afforded a freedom that otherwise may not be available. With that freedom comes each individual's responsibility to conduct oneself in such a way that the spirit of mutual trust which sustains the system is not compromised.\n\nThe Honor Code applies to alleged acts of lying, stealing or cheating that adversely affect the College community committed by a student on campus or elsewhere.\n\n==US military service academies==\n{{Main|Cadet Honor Code|Honor Concept}}\nPresently, some of the most notable and most stringent honor codes exist at the [[United States service academies|Federal Service Academies]] and [[United States senior military college|Senior Military Colleges]].\n\nThe military academy honor codes not only govern the [[Officer cadet|cadets']] and [[midshipman|midshipmen's]] lives at the academies but also are deemed essential to the development of military officers who are worthy of the public trust. As such, the codes are not limited merely to academic situations or to conduct on campus; cadets and midshipmen are expected to live by the codes' ethical standards at all times.  The codes are as old as the academies themselves and simply state that cadets and midshipmen do not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do. A single-sanction Honor Code, in which any offense results in expulsion regardless of severity, exists at [[Virginia Military Institute]], which features a \"drum out\" ceremony which is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal. Outside of the military, [[Washington and Lee University]] and the [[University of Virginia]] also have single sanction codes.\n\nAt three of the service academies and at [[Virginia Military Institute]], anyone who learns of an honor code violation is required to report it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|title=VMI Honor System History - VMI Archives - Virginia Military Institute|website=www.vmi.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803180952/http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|archivedate=August 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Failure to do so is considered \"toleration,\" which itself violates the code. That also holds true at schools with combined cadet and traditional student programs, such as [[Norwich University]], [[Texas A&M]], and [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], whose honor codes specifically provide that all students, both cadets and civilians, do not \"tolerate those who do.\" It is notable that the three [[Senior Military Colleges]] have two honor codes, one for cadets and one for civilians, whether on-campus or through distance online programs, etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203841/http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archivedate=September 14, 2016|df=mdy-all|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920090937/http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|archivedate=September 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy allows the observer of an honor violation to confront the accused without formally reporting. It was found that it was more constructive at developing the honor of midshipmen.  A non-toleration clause, on the other hand, is believed to make enemies of classmates. Additionally, it is thought that one's true honor, if other than utmost, was not able to be formally remediated when hidden from public view. Under the academies' honor codes, violators can face severe punishment, up to being forwarded for expulsion by the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |title=DoD Directive 1332.23, \"Service Academy Disenrollment\", February 19, 1988 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133445/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nStringent honor codes, however, are not limited to military institutions.

A plaque of the honor code is engraved in the student life center with a quote by once-Chancellor Madison Sarratt, \"Today I give you two examinations, one in [[trigonometry]] and one in [[honesty]]. I hope you pass them both, but if you must fail one, let it be trigonometry for there are many good men in this world today who cannot pass an examination in trigonometry, but there are no good men in the world who cannot pass an examination in honesty.\" \n*[[The University of Texas School of Law]] sets its Honor Code as a first step in the obligation of its students to the legal profession: \"All law students are harmed by unethical behaviour by any student. A student who deals dishonestly with fellow law students may be dishonest in the future and harm both future clients and the legal profession.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/law06-08/ch3/ch3a.html#School.of.Law.Honor.Code|title= School of Law Honour Code|publisher= University of Texas|accessdate= 2008-03-05|work= Office of the Registrar|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080220085948/http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/law06-08/ch3/ch3a.html#School.of.Law.Honor.Code|archivedate= February 20, 2008|df= mdy-all}}</ref> In keeping with this approach to the honor code in the grand scheme of the legal profession, honor code violations are reported to the State Bar of Texas and the violator's home state bar, thus creating an impediment to licensure. UT Law School is unique in that regard. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} \n*[[James Madison University]] holds its students to an Honor Code overseen by the Honor Council.  The honor code at JMU was founded in 1909 and the Honor Council is an organisation run by students.  A student who violates the code, if found \"responsible\", may receive anywhere from a letter grade reduction to expulsion from the university for a first time offense, while second time offenders are either suspended from the university for a semester or expelled. \"The Honor Council at James Madison University is committed to instilling, promoting, and upholding individual and collective academic integrity.\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jmu.edu/honor/index.shtml|title= James Madison University Honor Code|publisher= JMU|accessdate= 2010-06-28|work= JMU Honour Council|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528100951/http://www.jmu.edu/honor/index.shtml|archivedate= May 28, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n*At [[Meredith College]], an all-women's institution, all first year students attend an Honor Code ceremony, where they sign a statement promising to uphold the values of the Code.  The Code places a high emphasis on integrity and good judgement.  Meredith College is unique in the fact that its judicial board (the Honor Council) is primarily governed by students, including the Chair who also sits on the Student Government Association executive board, and the Solicitor General, who facilitates and investigates all incoming reports.<ref name=\"Meredith College Student Handbook\">{{cite web|title=Meredith College Student Handbook|url=http://www.meredith.edu/images/uploads/honor_system_section_for_website.pdf|website=Meredith College|publisher=Meredith College|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193843/http://www.meredith.edu/images/uploads/honor_system_section_for_website.pdf|archivedate=April 27, 2017|df=mdy-all|access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> Rumors about the Honor Code at Meredith include that students are not allowed to walk on the grass and must remain on the sidewalks.  Male visitation hours, or \"boy hours,\" are a common violation at a school that does not allow men to stay overnight in the residence halls.  However criticized it may be for being outdated, Meredith's Honor Code has evolved with the times and can be seen in the school's archives. \n*[[Washington and Lee University]] and its [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|Law School]] feature an honor system in which all students are expected to act as gentlemen and women. The system governs both academic and social aspects of the university and is administered by the Executive Committee which includes the student body president.

Street Pali Hill is the address of one of Mumbai's most affluent families. Three friends share the same address. Money, power, fame, success - there's nothing that they do not have. They share everything including a secret, a secret so dark that it is casting shadows on their future.\n\nBikram Kaul, Aditya Khandelwal, Arindam Keshab are the premier business moguls of India. They live together in a sprawling mansion with their families. There is perfect harmony in the household, their kids love each other and the wives get along as well.\nBut in this perfect world, if there's anything that is amiss, it is the old dilapidated outhouse that casts its evil shadow on the mansion. The outhouse is the foundation of their success and the keeper of their secret. Only the three friends know its past. It is like Pandora's box- silent until opened.\n\n== Plot ==\n'''Part One'''<br />\nArindam Keshab ([[Mukul Dev]]), Aditya Khandelwal (Rituraj) and Bikram Kaul (Vikram Kapadia) are three wealthy businessmen who have been close  friends for 20 years. They share a secret that can destroy their lives. Their families live in the huge K-Mansion on K Street, Pali Hill. They keep the secret buried in the old outhouse behind the mansion and never unlock it. Smriti ([[Jasveer Kaur]]) enters the K Mansion as an interior decorator and bonds with the family members. Unusual haunting incidents begins to happen with everyone in the house. Somebody tries to create a rift among these three pals. Smriti is revealed to be the one behind all this. Her intention is to find out who among the three men is her father. Her mother, Meenakshi Gupta was raped by one of these friends. She tries all the possible ways to find out the culprit. The three friends feel disturbed about their secret being leaked. They check the outhouse where the rape happened but find nothing that can unveil their secret. Smriti tries to check out samples taken from the three friends, including hair samples, smoke samples and blood samples. Finally she discovers that Bikram is her father. Bikram reveals his secret story. He confesses that he raped Smriti's mother who used to be very loyal to his company and was a very innocent lady. After the secret is revealed, Bikram's wife Misha ([[Ashwini Kalsekar]]) goes against him and sends him out of the mansion. Smriti brings her mother to the mansion, but Bikram kills her in anger. Bikram calls his sister Gayatri Kaul a.k.a. GK ([[Sudha Chandran]]) and asks for her help. Gayatri enters K Mansion and starts plotting against the members of the household.\n\n'''Part Two'''<br />\nDrone Keshab ([[Vipul Gupta]]), Arindam's eldest son, falls in love with Smriti ([[Jasveer Kaur]]). She does not reciprocate at first but later admits her attraction, and they decide to get married. Gayatri sends Drone out of K mansion for some business, and behind his back, she started instigating Aditya's wife Ishita to get her son Raunaq married with Smriti. Deboshree ([[Nivedita Bhattacharya]]), Drone's mother, feels that Drone and Smriti must get married Meanwhile, Raunaq (Alok Arora) falls in love with Smriti, but she only considers him a friend. When Raunaq comes to know about Drone and Smriti, he feels jealous but accepts this truth. Preparations for Drone and Smriti's marriage start but unusual incidents start happening with her. Someone sends a card to Smriti; the card contains a drawing in blood, a knife and a word \"SURPRISE\". From that day, knives start appearing around her, sometimes in her bedroom, sometimes as a delivered gift, sometimes inside her purse. This creates a rift between Drone and Smriti, so they get separated. After their breakup, Ishita picks up the topic of Smriti's marriage with Raunaq. Drone is beside himself when he hears about Smriti and Raunaq's upcoming marriage. He tries to convince Smriti that she did not understand what had really happened between them. But Smriti accepts Raunaq's proposal and marries him. Raunaq is then revealed to be the one behind all the threatening incidents as he is obsessively in love with Smriti and wanted to break up her relationship with Drone. Gayatri helps Raunaq in his plans because she wants to destroy Smriti. Drone, still in love with Smriti, marries Bikram's and Misha's Daughter, Dweep Kaul (Nisha Sareen). Smriti finds the SURPRISE posters in her husband Raunaq's wardrobe and realizes the truth. She breaks off all relations with Raunaq, though she does not break their marriage, as she does not want to hurt the other family members.\n\n'''Part Three'''<br />\nRaunaq gets into a car accident and is badly wounded. He needs B- blood group for his operation to be successful. Arindam's blood matches with Raunaq's blood and he saves Raunaq's life. Gayatri and Bikram find out that Ishita (Raunaq's mother) and Arindam (Drone's dad) had an affair 20 years ago, and Raunaq is not Aditya's son but Arindam's. They expose this secret to everyone and it creates a rift between Arindam and Aditya as also Deboshree and Ishita. Arindam tries to make Aditya understand that he did not do it on purpose. 20 years ago he loved Ishita but sacrificed his love for his friend Aditya who was also in love with her. Aditya refuses to listen to any of this and breaks off all relations with Arindam. Raunaq recovers and starts treating Ishita and Arindam very badly. Everybody starts quarreling with each other and the entire family disperses. Smriti tries her best to solve the problem and reunite the family. She also starts to forgive her husband Raunaq for his past misdeeds with her, and keeps an eye on Bikram and Gayatri to know their next move.\n\n'''Part Four'''<br />\nOne day, Bikram and Gayatri start acting suspicious and go out. Smriti starts following their car. Gayatri and Bikram have planned this to lure Smriti and get her killed. They bribe a hit man to crash into Smriti's car with a truck. The car falls to the bottom of the cliff and explodes. However, Smriti is saved by Dr. Vansh ([[Sachin Sharma]]) and he gives her a new face via plastic surgery as her face was burned badly in the accident. As the days pass, she hooks up with him and bonds with his sister, Netra, a fashion designer. Smriti (now played by [[Riva Bubber]]) then remembers how Gayatri and Bikram had tried to kill her and decides to take revenge. She changes her name to Simran and enters K Mansion, which is in chaos. She is shocked to come face to face with a woman having her original face and living in the mansion as Raunak's wife Smriti. Aditya drinks excessively and usually fights with Ishita as he still hasn't forgiven her for her infidelity. Arindam and Deboshree are unhappy with each other. Misha was declared dead but later it was revealed that Bikram and Gayatri turned her mental by giving her pills and was admitted to mental asylum. Through the help of Netra, Simran approached Misha and discharged her from the asylum and Vansh helped Misha in recovery. Simran investigates and finds out that the fake Smriti is actually a woman named Anju. Gayatri has found her somewhere and trained her to act as Smriti to get all the K Mansion property for herself. Soon Anju and Simran form alias and sort out all the disputes of Arindum, Aditya, Ishita and Deboshree. Simran and Anju creates a rift between Bikram and Gayatri, later Bikram kidnapped Gayatri and dishonestly blames Gayatri's murder on Simran. Advocate Arya helped Simran escape this situation by revealing that she is actually Smriti and Gayatri went against Bikram which sentenced him to jail. Anju and Raunaq decide to get married. Drone, by now, has started to love his wife Dweep. Smriti a.k.a. Simran marries Dr. Vansh, but he dies soon after in a tragic mishap. Heartbroken, Simran/ Smriti learns that his death was no accident but was caused by someone in K-Mansion. She wages a long war to find her husband's killer and eventually discovers that it is none other than Raunaq, who is still obsessed with her. She has a hard time convincing Anju about this. Simran (Smriti) finally settles down with a good friend of hers, a lawyer named Arya Kapoor (Siddharth), who has supported her throughout her struggle.\n\nGayatri kidnaps Dweep. She calls Anju and directs her to bring the property transfer papers. Anju arrives at Gayatri's hideout and gives her the property papers. Gayatri tries to kill Anju but police arrives on the scene and arrests her. Court announces its verdict: Gayatri gets life-imprisonment, Bikram gets six month imprisonment and Raunak is relieved for testifying against them. Raunaq requests Anju to forgive him for all his misdeeds and give him a last chance. Finally, Anju forgives him and they lived happily thereafter with others in K Mansion.\n\n== Characters ==\n* Vikram Kapadia ... Bikram Kaul\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] ...

She breaks off all relations with Raunaq, though she does not break their marriage, as she does not want to hurt the other family members.\n\n'''Part Three'''<br />\nRaunaq gets into a car accident and is badly wounded. He needs B- blood group for his operation to be successful. Arindam's blood matches with Raunaq's blood and he saves Raunaq's life. Gayatri and Bikram find out that Ishita (Raunaq's Mom) and Arindam (Drone's dad) had an affair 20 years ago, and Raunaq is not Aditya's son but Arindam's. They expose this secret to everyone and it creates a rift between Arindam and Aditya as also Deboshree and Ishita. Arindam tries to make Aditya understand that he did not do it on purpose. 20 years ago he loved Ishita but sacrificed his love for his friend Aditya who was also in love with her. Aditya refuses to listen to any of this and breaks off all relations with Arindam. Raunaq recovers and starts treating Ishita and Arindam very badly. Everybody starts quarreling with each other and the entire family disperses. Smriti tries her best to solve the problem and reunite the family. She also starts to forgive her husband Raunaq for his past misdeeds with her, and keeps an eye on Bikram and Gayatri to know their next move.\n\n'''Part Four'''<br />\nOne day, Bikram and Gayatri start acting suspicious and go out. Smriti starts following their car. Gayatri and Bikram have planned this to lure Smriti and get her killed. They bribe a hit man to crash into Smriti's car with a truck. The car falls to the bottom of the cliff and explodes. However, Smriti is saved by Dr. Vansh ([[Sachin Sharma]]) and he gives her a new face via plastic surgery as her face was burned badly in the accident. As the days pass, she hooks up with him and bonds with his sister, Netra, a fashion designer. Smriti (now played by [[Riva Bubber]]) then remembers how Gayatri and Bikram had tried to kill her and decides to take revenge. She changes her name to Simran and enters K Mansion, which is in chaos. She is shocked to come face to face with a woman having her original face and living in the mansion as Raunak's wife Smriti. Aditya drinks excessively and usually fights with Ishita as he still hasn't forgiven her for her infidelity. Arindam and Deboshree are unhappy with each other. Misha was declared dead but later it was revealed that Bikram and Gayatri turned her mental by giving her pills and was admitted to mental asylum. Through the help of Netra, Simran approached Misha and discharged her from the asylum and Vansh helped Misha in recovery. Simran investigates and finds out that the fake Smriti is actually a woman named Anju. Gayatri has found her somewhere and trained her to act as Smriti to get all the K Mansion property for herself. Soon Anju and Simran form alias and sort out all the disputes of Arindum, Aditya, Ishita and Deboshree. Simran and Anju creates a rift between Bikram and Gayatri, later Bikram kidnapped Gayatri and put a fake blame of gayatri's murder on Simran. Advocate Arya helped Simran escape this situation by revealing that she is actually Smriti and Gayatri went against Bikram which sentenced him to jail. Anju and Raunaq decide to get married. Drone, by now, has started to love his wife Dweep. Smriti a.k.a. Simran marries Dr. Vansh, but he dies soon after in a tragic mishap. Heartbroken, Simran/ Smriti learns that his death was no accident but was caused by someone in K-Mansion. She wages a long war to find her husband's killer and eventually discovers that it is none other than Raunaq, who is still obsessed with her. She has a hard time convincing Anju about this. Simran (Smriti) finally settles down with a good friend of hers, a lawyer named Arya Kapoor (Siddharth), who has supported her throughout her struggle.\nGayatri kidnaps Dweep. She calls Anju and directs her to bring the property transfer papers. Anju arrives at Gayatri's hideout and gives her the property papers. Gayatri tries to kill Anju but police arrives on the scene and arrests her. Court announces its verdict: Gayatri gets life-imprisonment, Bikram gets six month imprisonment and Raunak is relieved for testifying against them. Raunaq requests Anju to forgive him for all his misdeeds and give him a last chance. Finally, Anju forgives him and they lived happily thereafter with others in K Mansion.\n\n== Characters ==\n* Vikram Kapadia ... Bikram Kaul\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] ...

Harmonic Drive Systems, Inc., Japan is headquartered in Tokyo with its primary manufacturing location in Hotaka, Japan. Harmonic Drive SE has its European headquarters and manufacturing in Limburg/Lahn,Germany. \n\n==Mechanics==\n[[File:Harmonic drive cross Legend.svg|thumb|Cross section of a harmonic gear. {{ordered list\n    |1=input shaft\n    |2=wave generator\n    |3=flexspline\n    |4=circular spline\n    |5=output shaft\n    |6=housing\n}}]]\n[[File:HarmonicDriveAni.gif|thumb|Blue (outer circle): circular spline (fixed)<br/>Red (middle flexible circle): flex spline (attached to output shaft, which is not shown)<br/>Green (inner oval): wave generator (attached to input shaft; inner ball bearing and shaft are not shown)]]\n\nThe strain wave gearing theory is based on elastic dynamics and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator (2 / green), a flex spline (3 / red), and a circular spline  (4 / blue). More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.\n\nThe wave generator is made up of two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a ''wave generator plug'' and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well. \n\nThe flex spline is shaped like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is relatively rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, and in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the flex spline. The flex spline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flex spline deforms to the shape of a rotating [[ellipse]] and does not slip over the outer elliptical ring of the ball bearing. The ball bearing lets the flex spline rotate independently to the wave generator's shaft. \n\nThe circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flex spline and wave generator are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flex spline and the circular spline. Because the flex spline is deformed into an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions on opposite sides of the flex spline (located on the major axis of the ellipse). \n\nAssume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline ''in the opposite direction''. \n\nFor a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear:\n\n:<math>\\text{reduction ratio} = \\frac {\\text{flex spline teeth} - \\text{circular spline teeth}} {\\text{flex spline teeth}}</math>\n\nFor example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flex spline, the reduction ratio is&nbsp;(200&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;202)/200&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;0.01\n\nThus the flex spline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. Different reduction ratios are set by changing the number of teeth. This can either be achieved by changing the mechanism's diameter or by changing the size of the individual teeth and thereby preserving its size and weight. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\nThe advantages include: no [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]], high compactness and light weight, high gear ratios, reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing, good resolution and excellent repeatability (linear representation) when repositioning inertial loads,<ref name=Sourcebook>{{cite book|title=Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook|first1= Nicholas |last1=Chironis|first2=Neil|last2=Sclater|isbn=0-07-146761-0|year=2007}}</ref> high torque capability, and coaxial input and output shafts.<ref name=\"lauletta\" />  High gear reduction ratios are possible in a small volume (a ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gears]] typically only produce a 10:1 ratio).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cycloidal drive]]\n* [[Peristaltic pump]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Harmonic drives}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02jxx2sjaXs Harmonic drive function demonstration (Youtube, 0:21)]\n\n\n{{Gears}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Gears]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge to |Strain wave gearing|date=February 2019|discuss=Talk:Strain wave gearing#Proposed merger}}\n'''Harmonic Drive''' is the brand name of  [[strain wave gearing|strain wave gear]] trademarked by the Harmonic Drive company, and invented in 1957 by [[Walton Musser|C.W.

The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator (2 / green), a flex spline (3 / red), and a circular spline  (4 / blue). More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.\n\nThe wave generator is made up of two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a ''wave generator plug'' and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well. \n\nThe flex spline is shaped like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is relatively rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, and in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the flex spline. The flex spline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flex spline deforms to the shape of a rotating [[ellipse]] and does not slip over the outer elliptical ring of the ball bearing. The ball bearing lets the flex spline rotate independently to the wave generator's shaft. \n\nThe circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flex spline and wave generator are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flex spline and the circular spline. Because the flex spline is deformed into an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions on opposite sides of the flex spline (located on the major axis of the ellipse). \n\nAssume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline ''in the opposite direction''. \n\nFor a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear:\n\n:<math>\\text{reduction ratio} = \\frac {\\text{flex spline teeth} - \\text{circular spline teeth}} {\\text{flex spline teeth}}</math>\n\nFor example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flex spline, the reduction ratio is&nbsp;(200&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;202)/200&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;0.01\n\nThus the flex spline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. Different reduction ratios are set by changing the number of teeth. This can either be achieved by changing the mechanism's diameter or by changing the size of the individual teeth and thereby preserving its size and weight. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\nThe advantages include: no [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]], high compactness and light weight, high gear ratios, reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing, good resolution and excellent repeatability (linear representation) when repositioning inertial loads,<ref name=Sourcebook>{{cite book|title=Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook|first1= Nicholas |last1=Chironis|first2=Neil|last2=Sclater|isbn=0-07-146761-0|year=2007}}</ref> high torque capability, and coaxial input and output shafts.<ref name=\"lauletta\" />  High gear reduction ratios are possible in a small volume (a ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gears]] typically only produce a 10:1 ratio).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cycloidal drive]]\n* [[Peristaltic pump]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Harmonic drives}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02jxx2sjaXs Harmonic drive function demonstration (Youtube, 0:21)]\n\n\n{{Gears}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Gears]]\n", "name_user": "Walderdorff", "label": "safe", "comment": "company name from Harmonic Drive AG to Harmonic Drive SE, see company's wikipedia entry.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_drive"}

Bethel was home to numerous hotels that were part of the \"[[Borscht Belt]]\" and numerous sleepaway camps for most of the 20th century, including [[Camp Ma-Ho-Ge]], Camp Chipinaw, and [[Camp Ranger]] &ndash; all on Silver Lake.  In 1961, [[Son of Sam]] mass murderer [[David Berkowitz]] was a camper at a now defunct summer camp in Bethel. Berkowitz left the camp after a suspicious fire occurred in his cabin.\n\nThe Town of Bethel was brought to the world's attention in 1969, when nearly 500,000 people gathered at [[Max Yasgur]]'s Farm for \"Three Days of Peace and Music\".<ref name=\"Nason\">{{cite news |last1=Nason |first1=Robert |title=When the Boy Scouts met the hippies at Woodstock |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-15/woodstock-anniversary-hendrix-baez |accessdate=2019-08-16 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2019-08-16}}</ref> [[Woodstock (film)|The documentary]] made about [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] released in 1970 showed interviews with numerous Bethel residents, including Art Vassmer, co-owner of Vassmers General Store in Kauneonga Lake. A movie called ''[[Taking Woodstock]]'' was released in August 2009 based on the book of the same title by [[Elliot Tiber]], whose parents owned the nearby El Monaco Motel in White Lake and played a pivotal role in bringing the Woodstock nation to Bethel.\n\nIn 2006, [[Bethel Woods]] opened on the original Woodstock site as a state-of-the-art performing arts venue. In early 2008, a multi-media Woodstock \"interpretive\" museum opened near the old Yasgur's Farm to complement the concert space, which hosted the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Diane Reeves]], [[Chris Botti]], the [[Goo Goo Dolls]], the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] in its inaugural season. Highlights of the Center's 2007 season were performances by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]/[[Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Richie Havens]]/[[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], and repeat performances of the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]]. 2008's season featured The [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], [[Steely Dan]], the [[Allman Brothers]], and sold-out performances by the [[Jonas Brothers]] and the last concert of the season, featuring [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], and [[Cheap Trick]].  The 2009 season was headlined by [[Brad Paisley]] and his band \"The Drama Kings\".\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|90.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|85.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|4.6|sqmi|km2}} (5.13%) is water. One of the most attractive features of Bethel is its access to numerous lakes, all within a five-minute drive of each other.

Bethel was home to numerous hotels that were part of the \"[[Borscht Belt]]\" and numerous sleepaway camps for most of the 20th century, including [[Camp Ma-Ho-Ge]], Camp Chipinaw, and [[Camp Ranger]] &ndash; all on Silver Lake.  In 1961, [[Son of Sam]] mass murderer [[David Berkowitz]] was a camper at a now defunct summer camp in Bethel. Berkowitz left the camp after a suspicious fire occurred in his cabin.\n\nThe Town of Bethel was brought to the world's attention in 1969, when nearly 500,000 people gathered at [[Max Yasgur]]'s Farm for \"Three Days of Peace and Music\".<ref name=\"Nason\">{{cite news |last1=Nason |first1=Robert |title=When the Boy Scouts met the hippies at Woodstock |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-15/woodstock-anniversary-hendrix-baez |accessdate=2019-08-16 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2019-08-16}}</ref> [[Woodstock (film)|The documentary]] made about [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] released in 1970 showed interviews with numerous Bethel residents, including Art Vassmer, co-owner of Vassmers General Store in Kauneonga Lake. A movie called ''[[Taking Woodstock]]'' was released in August 2009 based on the book of the same title by [[Elliot Tiber]], whose parents owned the nearby El Monaco Motel in White Lake and played a pivotal role in bringing the Woodstock nation to Bethel.\n\nIn 2006, [[Bethel Woods]] opened on the original Woodstock site as a state-of-the-art performing arts venue. In early 2008, a multi-media Woodstock \"interpretive\" museum opened near the old Yasgur's Farm to complement the concert space, which hosted the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Diane Reeves]], [[Chris Botti]], the [[Goo Goo Dolls]], the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] in its inaugural season. Highlights of the Center's 2007 season were performances by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]/[[Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Richie Havens]]/[[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], and repeat performances of the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]]. 2008's season featured The [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], [[Steely Dan]], the [[Allman Brothers]], and sold-out performances by the [[Jonas Brothers]] and the last concert of the season, featuring [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], and [[Cheap Trick]].  The 2009 season was headlined by [[Brad Paisley]] and his band \"The Drama Kings\".\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|90.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|85.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|4.6|sqmi|km2}} (5.13%) is water. One of the most attractive features of Bethel is its access to numerous lakes, all within a five-minute drive of each other. They include White Lake, its northern portion known as Kauneonga Lake, Silver Lake, and Lake Superior, which is part of the state park with the same name.\n\nThe Town of Bethel, which is primarily rural in character, was part of the old [[Borscht Belt]] [[Catskills]] resort area.

The arena was demolished between November 2010 and May 2011.\n\n==History==\nOpened as the Spectrum in fall 1967, Philadelphia's first modern indoor sports [[arena]] was built to be the home of the expansion [[Philadelphia Flyers]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], and also to accommodate the existing [[Philadelphia 76ers]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].

The NBA's 76ers also moved there from [[Philadelphia Civic Center|Convention Hall]] as a second major league sports tenant. Lou Scheinfeld, former President of the Spectrum, explained that the name \"Spectrum\" was selected to evoke the broad range of events to be held there. \"The 'SP' for 'sports' and 'South Philadelphia,' 'E' for 'entertainment,' 'C' for 'circuses,' 'T' for 'theatricals,' 'R' for 'recreation,' and 'UM' as 'um, what a nice building!\"  Scheinfeld also said that a seat in the city's first superbox initially cost $1,000 a year: \"For every Flyers game, Sixers game, circus, you name it, you got 250 events for $1,000.\"<ref>October 19, 2009, Talk Philly, CBS3.</ref> The Flyers won their first ever home game in this arena by defeating the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], 1\u20130. [[Bill Sutherland]] scored the arena's first goal.\n\nOn March 1, 1968, wind blew part of the covering off the Spectrum's roof during a performance of the [[Ice Capades]], forcing the building to close for a month while Mayor Tate fought with then-Philadelphia County District Attorney [[Arlen Specter]] over responsibility for the construction of the roof, and the damage was repaired.<ref>{{cite news |first=William|last=Johnson|title=A Heavy Blow In A Windy City|date=April 1, 1968|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1081004/1/index.htm|accessdate=March 18, 2009}}</ref> The 76ers moved their home games to Convention Hall and to the [[Palestra]], but neither of those arenas had ice rinks at the time, and there were no other NHL-quality sites in the Philadelphia area. Thus the Flyers hurriedly moved their next home game (against the [[Oakland Seals]]) to [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City|New York]] followed by a meeting with the [[Boston Bruins]] played at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in [[Toronto]] before establishing a base at [[Colis\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec|Le Colis\u00e9e]] in [[Quebec City]], home of their top minor league team, the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] [[Quebec Aces]], for the remainder of their regular season, marking the first NHL games in Quebec City in over four decades, and years before the [[Quebec Nordiques]] joined the NHL. (The roof was repaired in time to permit the Flyers to return to the Spectrum to open their first [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs against the [[St. Louis Blues]] on April 4, 1968; the opening faceoff came just as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=434641|title=This Date In Flyers History&nbsp;...

A piece of flying debris smashed out one of the concourse windows, cancelling the game just after the first period.\n\nIn the 1970s, the venue's location on Broad Street and the reputation for [[Bare-knuckle boxing|fisticuffs]] that the Flyers had developed led to the nickname \"Broad Street Bullies.\"\n\nA plaque inside The Spectrum stated that it held the world record for the fastest conversion from Hockey to Basketball.\n\nThe Spectrum, along with the [[Met Center]] and [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], was one of the first sports arenas to have a scoreboard with a messageboard. Furthermore, the messageboards on the Spectrum scoreboard were the first dot matrix screens in pro hockey or basketball, capable of photos, animation, and replays as well as messages. This was replaced in 1986 with ArenaVision, which consisted of six {{convert|9|by|12|foot|adj=on}} [[rear-projection television|rear-projection videoscreens]] at the top and a four-sided American Sign and Indicator scoreboard at the bottom.

[http://www.cska-hockey.ru/] Two games in the inaugural [[1976 Canada Cup|Canada Cup]] hockey tournament were also held at the Spectrum in September of that year, as the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|U.S.]] took on [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and the [[USSR national ice hockey team|USSR]].\n\nTen NHL or NBA playoff championship series were hosted at the Spectrum. The Flyers competed in the [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] in {{scfy|1974}}, {{scfy|1975}}, {{scfy|1976}}, {{scfy|1980}}, {{scfy|1985}}, and {{scfy|1987}}. The 76ers played in the [[NBA Finals]] in {{nbafy|1977}}, {{nbafy|1980}}, {{nbafy|1982}}, and {{nbafy|1983}}. The 1976 and 1992 [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL]], and 1970 and 1976 [[NBA All-Star Game]]s were also held here. The AHL Phantoms also won their first [[Calder Cup]] title on Spectrum ice before a sellout crowd of 17,380 on June 10, 1998, by defeating the [[Saint John Flames]], 6&ndash;1.\n\nThe only visitors to win the Stanley Cup and NBA championship at the Spectrum were the [[Montreal Canadiens]] (1976) and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (1980) respectively.\n\nThe Spectrum is the only venue to host the NBA and NHL All-Star Games in the same season, doing so in 1976, when it also hosted that year's [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]]. It is also one of a handful of venues to host the Stanley Cup and NBA Finals at the same time, doing so in 1980 (all four major Philadelphia teams would reach the championship round of their respective sport in the 1980 season).\n\n===College basketball tournaments===\nThe Spectrum was used for many basketball tournaments, including [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big Five]] games, eight [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] tournaments (1977, 1983, 1997\u20132002), the 1975, 1980 and 1992 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] East Regional (site of the famous last-second shot by [[Christian Laettner]] of [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] to beat [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]), and the 1976 and 1981 [[Final Four]]s (both won by [[Bobby Knight]]'s [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]]). Smaller conferences preferred holding tournament games at this venue over the larger Center nearby.\n\n===Bull riding===\nIn 2003 and 2004, the [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] brought their [[Built Ford Tough Series]] tour to the Spectrum.\n\n===Notable concerts===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Spectrum 1974edited.jpg|thumb|''Billboard'' ad for the arena, 1974.]]\nMany concerts were been staged at the Spectrum beginning 1960s, often praised for its acoustic properties.

On the second night (June 29, 1977), Floyd member [[Roger Waters]] fell ill and did most of the show after a painkiller injection. However, the painkiller wore off and was taken to the hospital and missed the final encore of [[Us and Them (song)|\"Us and Them\"]] where second guitarist [[Snowy White]] had to fill in on bass guitar. Unbeknownst to the crowd, this was the first time that the rest of Pink Floyd (guitarist/vocalist [[David Gilmour]], drummer [[Nick Mason]] and keyboard player [[Rick Wright]]) performed a song live without Waters (they would go on without Waters as of 1986). Waters' experience performing while ill at this venue would be documented on \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\".\n*[[The Who]] performed at the Spectrum throughout the 1970s. The 1973 show was documented in a famous audio bootleg of their [[Quadrophenia]] performance.

Axl cursed out the fan, and challenged him to a fight. After the fan was ejected from the concert, the show continued.\n*On the night of December 9, 1980, after learning of the assassination of [[John Lennon]] following a performance there the night before, [[Bruce Springsteen]] opened the show with a statement regarding Lennon and said, \"It's a hard thing to come out and play but there's just nothing else you can do.\"  With members of the [[E Street Band]] in tears, Springsteen and his band put on a 34-song marathon which ended nearly 3\u00bd hours later, with a cover of \"[[Twist and Shout]]\". The Spectrum was the first arena Springsteen ever played at in 1976. In the following years, Springsteen would become one of the Spectrum's most popular concert acts, performing 42 shows between 1976 and 2009, thanks in part to the singer's large and devoted fan base in Pennsylvania. For these reasons, the Spectrum is often considered one of Springsteen's iconic venues.\n*[[Rush (band)|Rush]] performed at the Spectrum as part of their ''Grace Under Pressure'' tour on November 5, 1984.\n*[[Van Halen]] performed at the Spectrum with [[Gary Cherone]] on May 24, 1998.\n*[[Whitney Houston]] performed at the arena on June 23, 1994, during her successful 1993\u201394 [[The Bodyguard World Tour]].

Both recording artists are Philadelphia-area natives.\n*The last public events at the legendary arena took place on October 27\u201328 and 30\u201331, 2009, by [[Pearl Jam]]. The band came to the stage each night after a video montage of memorable Spectrum moments followed by the ''[[Rocky]]'' theme music. Over the four nights, Pearl Jam performed 103 different songs, with its final night on [[Halloween]] lasting over 3 hours and 35 minutes and including 41 songs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/reviewsNews/idUSTRE5A25FC20091103|title=Pearl Jam closes Philly Spectrum with epic set|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=November 3, 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n*The final event was a large private cocktail party thrown by [[Comcast Spectacor]] chairman [[Ed Snider]] on January 16, 2010.

The [[O'Jays]] (they were signed to [[Philadelphia International]]) performed there in '73, and [[Lou Rawls]] (also signed to Philly International) performed there in '69. [[Boyz II Men]] from Philly performed there in '95.\n\n===Spectrum Theater===\nThe Spectrum Theater was a venue for acts not big enough to fill the entire Spectrum arena. The stage was placed in the middle of the Spectrum floor, and the other half of the arena behind the stage was closed off with curtains, creating a theater-like environment. Some of the acts that played in this configuration included [[Frank Zappa]] in 1973, 1976 and 1977; David Bowie's [[Diamond Dogs Tour]] in 1974; [[The Kinks]]' Soap Opera Tour in May 1975, [[Bob Marley]]'s [[Natty Dread Tour]] in 1975 and [[Kaya Tour]] in 1978; [[Bruce Springsteen]] in 1976; The [[Bee Gees]] in 1979; [[Peter Gabriel]]'s tour in 1982, [[Julian Lennon|Jullian Lennon]] with Chris Bliss on June 20, 1986, and [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]] in 1987.\n\n===The Flyers and 76ers' move===\nThe 1995\u201396 [[1995\u201396 NHL season|NHL]] and [[1995\u201396 NBA season|NBA]] seasons were the final ones for the Flyers and the 76ers at the Spectrum. The 76ers' last game was a 112\u201392 loss to the [[Orlando Magic]] on April 19; on May 12, [[Eric Lindros]] scored the arena's final Flyers goal in the 2nd period, and [[Mike Hough]] of the [[Florida Panthers]] scored the arena's final official NHL goal in the 2nd overtime of Game 5 of the [[1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1996 Eastern Conference Semifinals]], a 2-1 Flyers loss. Although both the Flyers and 76ers moved across the parking lot to the new and larger [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] (then CoreStates Center), the arena remained in place and was used by the [[Philadelphia Phantoms]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], the [[Philadelphia Kixx]] of the [[National Indoor Soccer League|NISL]], the [[Philadelphia Soul]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]] for Saturday home games, and a variety of other sporting events and concerts.\n\nThe Flyers and 76ers had been in need of a new facility for some time. One reason was the need for more revenue streams to meet skyrocketing operating costs <sup>{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}</sup>. The Spectrum had relatively few luxury suites or other amenities common in newer arenas.\n\nIn addition, the arena's sight lines left much to be desired. Some seats in both the hockey and basketball configurations (especially those added in the upper level over the years) had badly obstructed views. There was only one [[concourse]] for all three levels, making for somewhat cramped conditions whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity.\n\n===Final season===\n[[File:Spectrum remember.jpg|thumb|right|A special logo was used for the final season of the Spectrum's use, featuring the arena's original pre-1994 logo and nickname.]]\nOn July 14, 2008, [[Comcast Spectacor]] Chairman [[Ed Snider]] officially announced that the Spectrum would be shuttered and torn down to make way for ''[[Xfinity Live! Philadelphia|Philly Live!]]'', a proposed retail, dining and entertainment hub. \"This has been one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make,\" said Snider. \"The Spectrum is my baby. It's one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me.\"\n\nThe Phantoms commemorated the final season of the Spectrum by wearing a special patch on their uniforms, as illustrated on the right. The team also celebrated some of the building's memorable moments throughout the season. The Flyers marked the last season by playing two pre-season games at the Spectrum. They played the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in an NHL pre-season game on September 27, 2008, and the Phantoms on October 7 of that same year. Before the game against Carolina, the Flyers honored the team captains in the franchise's history. Those honored in the pre-game ceremony were [[Lou Angotti]], [[Ed Van Impe]], [[Bobby Clarke|Bob Clarke]], [[Mel Bridgman]], [[Bill Barber]], [[Dave Poulin]], [[Ron Sutter]], [[Kevin Dineen]], [[\u00c9ric Desjardins]], [[Keith Primeau]] and [[Derian Hatcher]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam|last=Carchidi|title=Flyers Captains Bid Farewell to Spectrum|date=September 28, 2008|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080928_Flyers_captains_bid_farewell_to_Spectrum.html|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Spectrum during Demolition.jpg|thumb|Wachovia Spectrum during demolition in 2010.]]\n\nThe last NCAA basketball game the Spectrum hosted saw the [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova Wildcats]] defeat the [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pittsburgh Panthers]] on January 28, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Kern |title=Nice Parting Gift for Spectrum: Villanova Beats No. 3 Pitt |date=January 29, 2009 |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/sports/20090129_Nice_parting_gift_for_Spectrum__Villanova_beats_No__3_Pitt.html |accessdate=March 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130122510/http://www.philly.com/dailynews/sports/20090129_Nice_parting_gift_for_Spectrum__Villanova_beats_No__3_Pitt.html |archivedate=January 30, 2009 }}</ref> The Sixers played one regular season game against [[Chicago Bulls]] on March 13, 2009, winning by a score of 104\u2013101 in the final NBA game in the Spectrum.<ref name=76erscloseSpectrum>{{cite news |first=Dan|last=Gelston|title=76ers Close Spectrum With Win Over Bulls|date=March 13, 2009|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20090313/CHIPHI/recap.html|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name=Sayinggoodbye>{{cite news |title=Saying goodbye to the Spectrum|date=March 14, 2009|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/03/13/ata.0313/index.html|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref> The game was sold-out and attendance was 17,563.<ref name=76erscloseSpectrum/><ref>{{cite news|first=Bernard |last=Fernandez |title=Sixers Edge Bulls for Thrilling Spectrum Finale |date=March 14, 2009 |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/sixers/20090314_Sixers_edge_Bulls_for_thrilling_Spectrum_finale.html |accessdate=March 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317065947/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/sixers/20090314_Sixers_edge_Bulls_for_thrilling_Spectrum_finale.html |archivedate=March 17, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Spectrum Final Game April 10, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|300px]]The Phantoms' last regular season game at the Spectrum was played April 10, 2009, against the [[Hershey Bears]], as the Phantoms won the game, 5\u20132, while the last Kixx game was against the [[Massachusetts Twisters]] on March 22. The Kixx moved onto the [[Temple University]] campus and played the 2009\u201310 season at the [[Liacouras Center]].

Springsteen debuted a specially-written version of the song [[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|\"Wrecking Ball\"]], which he had written in honor of the demolition of [[Giants Stadium]], with revised lyrics to honor the Spectrum. Springsteen's performances were followed by [[Pearl Jam]] on October 27, 28, 30 and 31 to close the building; their opening acts included [[Social Distortion]] on the 27th and 28th and [[Bad Religion]] on the 30th and 31st.\n\nA scheduled concert with [[Leonard Cohen]] on October 22 was moved to the [[Tower Theatre (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theatre]] in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]], instead.

The Dead closed the show of May 2 with the song \"[[Samson and Delilah (song)|Samson and Delilah]]\". The song contains the fitting refrain \"If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.\" The lyric was changed by the band's singer [[Bob Weir]] to say \"I wouldn't tear this old building down.\" With the demolition of The Spectrum, all venues at which The Grateful Dead played through their career within the City Of Philadelphia, except for the Irvine Auditorium, have succumbed to the wrecking ball.\n\n==The Spectrum & the South Philadelphia Sports Complex==\n[[File:South Philadelphia Sports Complex 2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An overhead view of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.

The complex's total area expanded with the addition of each new facility and now takes up the entire SE quadrant of the [http://www.phillyhistory.org/photoarchive/newsletter/08dec/phillyhistory_newsletter_dec_08.htm grounds] occupied in 1926 by Philadelphia's [[Sesquicentennial Exposition|Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition]], a massive 184-day [[World's fair]] built on 700+ acres of until then largely undeveloped city owned swamp and park land (including [[League Island Park]]) adjacent to the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|U.S. Navy Yard]] bounded by 10th Street, Packer Ave., 23rd Street, and Terminal Avenue.

With the demolition of the Spectrum, the Wells Fargo Center has now become the oldest of the complex's three current venues.\n\nThe Spectrum's closest sports complex neighbor was [[Veterans Stadium]] (opened 1971, closed 2003, demolished 2004) which was located north of the arena directly across Pattison Avenue. The 60,000-plus-seat \"Vet\" accommodated [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]] for just over three decades before it was itself replaced by two new facilities. In 2003 the Eagles moved to [[Lincoln Financial Field]], a purpose built football/soccer stadium located SE of the Spectrum site directly across 11th Street from the Wells Fargo Center. The following year, the Phillies relocated to [[Citizens Bank Park]], a dedicated baseball stadium completed in 2004 and located diagonally across from the Spectrum site at the northeast corner of Pattison Ave and Citizens Bank Way (11th St.), immediately east of the former Veterans Stadium site which now serves as a parking lot for the entire complex.

won their first [[Stanley Cup]] at the Spectrum on May 19, 1974, defeating the [[Boston Bruins]], 1\u20130, in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals in front of a then-capacity crowd of 17,007. Perhaps the most important and emotional hockey game\u2014or sporting event of any kind\u2014ever held there, however, came at the height of the [[Cold War]] on January 11, 1976, when the Flyers became the first NHL team to defeat (by 4\u20131) the vaunted hockey team of the [[HC CSKA Moscow|Soviet Central Red Army]] (\u0426\u0421\u041a\u0410). [http://www.cska-hockey.ru/] Two games in the inaugural [[1976 Canada Cup|Canada Cup]] hockey tournament were also held at the Spectrum in September of that year, as the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|U.S.]] took on [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]] and the [[USSR national ice hockey team|USSR]].\n\nTen NHL or NBA playoff championship series were hosted at the Spectrum. The Flyers competed in the [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] in {{scfy|1974}}, {{scfy|1975}}, {{scfy|1976}}, {{scfy|1980}}, {{scfy|1985}}, and {{scfy|1987}}. The 76ers played in the [[NBA Finals]] in {{nbafy|1977}}, {{nbafy|1980}}, {{nbafy|1982}}, and {{nbafy|1983}}. The 1976 and 1992 [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL]], and 1970 and 1976 [[NBA All-Star Game]]s were also held here. The AHL Phantoms also won their first [[Calder Cup]] title on Spectrum ice before a sellout crowd of 17,380 on June 10, 1998, by defeating the [[Saint John Flames]], 6&ndash;1.\n\nThe only visitors to win the Stanley Cup and NBA championship at the Spectrum were the [[Montreal Canadiens]] (1976) and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] (1980) respectively.\n\nThe Spectrum is the only venue to host the NBA and NHL All-Star Games in the same season, doing so in 1976, when it also hosted that year's [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]]. It is also one of a handful of venues to host the Stanley Cup and NBA Finals at the same time, doing so in 1980 (all four major Philadelphia teams would reach the championship round of their respective sport in the 1980 season).\n\n===College basketball tournaments===\nThe Spectrum was used for many basketball tournaments, including [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big Five]] games, eight [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] tournaments (1977, 1983, 1997\u20132002), the 1975, 1980 and 1992 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] East Regional (site of the famous last-second shot by [[Christian Laettner]] of [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] to beat [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]), and the 1976 and 1981 [[Final Four]]s (both won by [[Bobby Knight]]'s [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]]). Smaller conferences preferred holding tournament games at this venue over the larger Center nearby.\n\n===Bull riding===\nIn 2003 and 2004, the [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] brought their [[Built Ford Tough Series]] tour to the Spectrum.\n\n===Notable concerts===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Spectrum 1974edited.jpg|thumb|''Billboard'' ad for the arena, 1974.]]\nMany concerts were been staged at the Spectrum beginning 1960s, often praised for its acoustic properties.

They last played two shows there on June 28\u201329, 1977, during their ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals/In the Flesh]]'' Tour. On the second night (June 29, 1977), Floyd member [[Roger Waters]] fell ill and did most of the show after a painkiller injection. However, the painkiller wore off and was taken to the hospital and missed the final encore of [[Us and Them (song)|\"Us and Them\"]] where second guitarist [[Snowy White]] had to fill in on bass guitar. Unbeknownst to the crowd, this was the first time that the rest of Pink Floyd (guitarist/vocalist [[David Gilmour]], drummer [[Nick Mason]] and keyboard player [[Rick Wright]]) performed a song live without Waters (they would go on without Waters as of 1986). Waters' experience performing while ill at this venue would be documented on \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\".\n*[[The Who]] performed at the Spectrum throughout the 1970s. The 1973 show was documented in a famous audio bootleg of their [[Quadrophenia]] performance. A CD has been released of [[John Entwistle]]'s performance on March 15, 1975, when he opened for [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]].\n*1978 saw the last tour of the original [[Black Sabbath]] lineup. Opening for them was [[Van Halen]].\n*[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] regularly played the venue during the [[Phil Collins]] era from 1977 to 1986 (they would play [[Veterans Stadium]] on their 1992 ''[[We Can't Dance]]'' tour and the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] on their 2007 [[Turn it on Again]] reunion tour). Their three November 1983 performances on the band's [[Genesis (Genesis album)|Mama Tour]] were recorded for a US FM radio broadcast and was released as a bootleg entitled \"Three Nights in Philly\".\n*[[Queen (band)|Queen]] performed at The Spectrum on August 22, 1980, during The Game Tour.\n*[[The Jacksons]] performed at The Spectrum on August 15, 1981, during their Triumph Tour.<ref>[[Triumph Tour]]</ref>\n*[[Dio (band)|Dio]] performed at The Spectrum in 1984, with [[Twisted Sister]] as opener.

Axl cursed out the fan, and challenged him to a fight. After the fan was ejected from the concert, the show continued.\n*On the night of December 9, 1980, after learning of the assassination of [[John Lennon]] following a performance there the night before, [[Bruce Springsteen]] opened the show with a statement regarding Lennon and said, \"It's a hard thing to come out and play but there's just nothing else you can do.\"  With members of the [[E Street Band]] in tears, Springsteen and his band put on a 34-song marathon which ended nearly 3\u00bd hours later, with a cover of \"[[Twist and Shout]]\". The Spectrum was the first arena Springsteen ever played at in 1976. In the following years, Springsteen would become one of the Spectrum's most popular concert acts, performing 42 shows between 1976 and 2009, thanks in part to the singer's large and devoted fan base in Pennsylvania. For these reasons, the Spectrum is often considered one of Springsteen's iconic venues.\n*[[Rush (band)|Rush]] performed at the Spectrum as part of their ''Grace Under Pressure'' tour on November 5, 1984.\n*[[Van Halen]] performed at the Spectrum with [[Gary Cherone]] on May 24, 1998.\n*[[Whitney Houston]] performed at the arena on June 23, 1994, during her successful 1993\u201394 [[The Bodyguard World Tour]].

Both recording artists are Philadelphia-area natives.\n*The last public events at the legendary arena took place on October 27\u201328 and 30\u201331, 2009, by [[Pearl Jam]]. The band came to the stage each night after a video montage of memorable Spectrum moments followed by the ''[[Rocky]]'' theme music. Over the four nights, Pearl Jam performed 103 different songs, with its final night on [[Halloween]] lasting over 3 hours and 35 minutes and including 41 songs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/reviewsNews/idUSTRE5A25FC20091103|title=Pearl Jam closes Philly Spectrum with epic set|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=November 3, 2009|agency=Reuters|accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n*The final event was a large private cocktail party thrown by [[Comcast Spectacor]] chairman [[Ed Snider]] on January 16, 2010.

The [[O'Jays]] (they were signed to [[Philadelphia International]]) performed there in '73, and [[Lou Rawls]] (also signed to Philly International) performed there in '69. [[Boyz II Men]] from Philly performed there in '95.\n\n===Spectrum Theater===\nThe Spectrum Theater was a venue for acts not big enough to fill the entire Spectrum arena. The stage was placed in the middle of the Spectrum floor, and the other half of the arena behind the stage was closed off with curtains, creating a theater-like environment. Some of the acts that played in this configuration included [[Frank Zappa]] in 1973, 1976 and 1977; David Bowie's [[Diamond Dogs Tour]] in 1974; [[The Kinks]]' Soap Opera Tour in May 1975, [[Bob Marley]]'s [[Natty Dread Tour]] in 1975 and [[Kaya Tour]] in 1978; [[Bruce Springsteen]] in 1976; The [[Bee Gees]] in 1979; [[Peter Gabriel]]'s tour in 1982, [[Julian Lennon|Jullian Lennon]] with Chris Bliss on June 20, 1986, and [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]] in 1987.\n\n===The Flyers and 76ers' move===\nThe 1995\u201396 [[1995\u201396 NHL season|NHL]] and [[1995\u201396 NBA season|NBA]] seasons were the final ones for the Flyers and the 76ers at the Spectrum. The 76ers' last game was a 112\u201392 loss to the [[Orlando Magic]] on April 19; on May 12, [[Eric Lindros]] scored the arena's final Flyers goal in the 2nd period, and [[Mike Hough]] of the [[Florida Panthers]] scored the arena's final official NHL goal in the 2nd overtime of Game 5 of the [[1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1996 Eastern Conference Semifinals]], a 2-1 Flyers loss. Although both the Flyers and 76ers moved across the parking lot to the new and larger [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] (then CoreStates Center), the arena remained in place and was used by the [[Philadelphia Phantoms]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], the [[Philadelphia Kixx]] of the [[National Indoor Soccer League|NISL]], the [[Philadelphia Soul]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]] for Saturday home games, and a variety of other sporting events and concerts.\n\nThe Flyers and 76ers had been in need of a new facility for some time. One reason was the need for more revenue streams to meet skyrocketing operating costs <sup>{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}</sup>. The Spectrum had relatively few luxury suites or other amenities common in newer arenas.\n\nIn addition, the arena's sight lines left much to be desired. Some seats in both the hockey and basketball configurations (especially those added in the upper level over the years) had badly obstructed views. There was only one [[concourse]] for all three levels, making for somewhat cramped conditions whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity.\n\n===Final season===\n[[File:Spectrum remember.jpg|thumb|right|A special logo was used for the final season of the Spectrum's use, featuring the arena's original pre-1994 logo and nickname.]]\nOn July 14, 2008, [[Comcast Spectacor]] Chairman [[Ed Snider]] officially announced that the Spectrum would be shuttered and torn down to make way for ''[[Xfinity Live! Philadelphia|Philly Live!]]'', a proposed retail, dining and entertainment hub. \"This has been one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make,\" said Snider. \"The Spectrum is my baby. It's one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me.\"\n\nThe Phantoms commemorated the final season of the Spectrum by wearing a special patch on their uniforms, as illustrated on the right. The team also celebrated some of the building's memorable moments throughout the season. The Flyers marked the last season by playing two pre-season games at the Spectrum. They played the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in an NHL pre-season game on September 27, 2008, and the Phantoms on October 7 of that same year. Before the game against Carolina, the Flyers honored the team captains in the franchise's history.

The Kixx moved onto the [[Temple University]] campus and played the 2009\u201310 season at the [[Liacouras Center]].

Springsteen debuted a specially-written version of the song [[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|\"Wrecking Ball\"]], which he had written in honor of the demolition of [[Giants Stadium]], with revised lyrics to honor the Spectrum. Springsteen's performances were followed by [[Pearl Jam]] on October 27, 28, 30 and 31 to close the building; their opening acts included [[Social Distortion]] on the 27th and 28th and [[Bad Religion]] on the 30th and 31st.\n\nA scheduled concert with [[Leonard Cohen]] on October 22 was moved to the [[Tower Theatre (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theatre]] in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]], instead.

The Dead closed the show of May 2 with the song \"[[Samson and Delilah (song)|Samson and Delilah]]\". The song contains the fitting refrain \"If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.\" The lyric was changed by the band's singer [[Bob Weir]] to say \"I wouldn't tear this old building down.\" With the demolition of The Spectrum, all venues at which The Grateful Dead played through their career within the City Of Philadelphia, except for the Irvine Auditorium, have succumbed to the wrecking ball.\n\n==The Spectrum & the South Philadelphia Sports Complex==\n[[File:South Philadelphia Sports Complex 2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An overhead view of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The Spectrum is at center left.]]\nOpened in 1967 as the first of the five modern facilities to be built at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex between 1967 and 2004, by the time it closed in 2009 the Spectrum was the oldest of the four venues still standing of the two indoor arenas and four outdoor stadiums built at the South end of Broad Street since 1926. The complex's total area expanded with the addition of each new facility and now takes up the entire SE quadrant of the [http://www.phillyhistory.org/photoarchive/newsletter/08dec/phillyhistory_newsletter_dec_08.htm grounds] occupied in 1926 by Philadelphia's [[Sesquicentennial Exposition|Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition]], a massive 184-day [[World's fair]] built on 700+ acres of until then largely undeveloped city owned swamp and park land (including [[League Island Park]]) adjacent to the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard|U.S. Navy Yard]] bounded by 10th Street, Packer Ave., 23rd Street, and Terminal Avenue. The Spectrum itself occupied the portion of the Exposition's grounds on the south side of Pattison Avenue between Broad and 11th Streets that in 1926 served as the fair's main trolley terminal operated by the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority#History|Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Austin|first=E.L.|author2=Odell Hauser |title=The Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition|year=1929|location=Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Philadelphia Sports Complex 1973.jpg|thumb|right|The Spectrum, with [[John F.

Known earlier as the \"CoreStates Center\" (1996\u20131998), the \"First Union Center\" (1998\u20132003), and the \"Wachovia Center\" (July 2003 \u2013 June 2010), the 20,000-plus-seat indoor arena replaced the Spectrum as the home of the Flyers, 76ers, and [[Philadelphia Wings (1987\u20132014)|Philadelphia Wings]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] beginning with each club's 1996\u201397 season. With the demolition of the Spectrum, the Wells Fargo Center has now become the oldest of the complex's three current venues.\n\nThe Spectrum's closest sports complex neighbor was [[Veterans Stadium]] (opened 1971, closed 2003, demolished 2004) which was located north of the arena directly across Pattison Avenue. The 60,000-plus-seat \"Vet\" accommodated [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]] for just over three decades before it was itself replaced by two new facilities. In 2003 the Eagles moved to [[Lincoln Financial Field]], a purpose built football/soccer stadium located SE of the Spectrum site directly across 11th Street from the Wells Fargo Center. The following year, the Phillies relocated to [[Citizens Bank Park]], a dedicated baseball stadium completed in 2004 and located diagonally across from the Spectrum site at the northeast corner of Pattison Ave and Citizens Bank Way (11th St.), immediately east of the former Veterans Stadium site which now serves as a parking lot for the entire complex. In 2017, the Phillies' spring training complex in [[Clearwater, Florida]] was renamed [[Spectrum Field]] after [[Bright House Networks]] was purchased by [[Charter Communications, Inc.|Charter Communications]].

It is the oldest of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]]. A total of 30 teams play in Major League Baseball: 15 teams in the [[National League]] (NL) and 15 in the [[American League]] (AL). The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901, respectively. Beginning in 1903, the two leagues cooperated but remained legally separate entities. In 2000 the leagues merged into a single organization led by the [[Commissioner of Baseball]].<ref name=2000nl>{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 2000 National League|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2000n.shtml|website=Baseball-Almanac.com|accessdate=September 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=BASEBALL; League Presidents Out As Baseball Centralizes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/16/sports/baseball-league-presidents-out-as-baseball-centralizes.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 16, 1999|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMLB also oversees [[Minor League Baseball]], which comprises 256 teams affiliated with the major league clubs. MLB and the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] jointly manage the international [[World Baseball Classic]] tournament.\n\nBaseball's first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings founded in 1869. Before that, some teams had [[secret]]ly paid some players. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another.\n\nThe period before 1920 is known as the [[dead-ball era]], during which players would rarely hit [[home run]]s. Professional baseball in the [[United States]] survived a conspiracy to [[match fixing|fix]] the [[1919 World Series]], which came to be known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II. Shortly after the war, [[Jackie Robinson]] broke [[baseball color line|baseball's color barrier]].\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of [[anabolic steroid]]s among MLB players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the [[Mitchell Report]], which implicated many players in the use of [[performance-enhancing drugs|performance-enhancing substances]], including at least one player from each team.\n\nToday, MLB is composed of [[Current Major League Baseball franchises|30 teams]]: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Teams play 162 games each season and 5 teams in each league advance to a four-round [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason tournament]] that culminates in the [[World Series]], a [[best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired on television, radio, and the Internet throughout North America and in several other countries.

Two teams (the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]) were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. In 1993, the National League expanded with two teams, the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies, to even up the number of teams in both leagues.  A third division, the Central Division, was formed in each league in 1994. Until 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the [[World Series]] and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]].

This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with five in each division), but in order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams; one existing club would have to switch leagues. The [[Milwaukee Brewers#1994\u201398: Realignment / \"We're taking this thing National\"|Milwaukee Brewers]] agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league.

The NABBP existed as an amateur league for 12 years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern U.S. For [[professional baseball]]'s founding year, MLB uses the year 1869\u2014when the first professional team, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1869reds.com/history/|title=Legend of the Cincinnati Red Stockings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175805/http://www.1869reds.com/history|archivedate=July 24, 2008|website=1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings Vintage Base Ball Team|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nA schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club.

Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.

Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1882\u20131891), sometimes called the \"beer and whiskey league\" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series\u2014the first attempt at a [[World Series]]. The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the [[American League]] in 1901 under AL president [[Ban Johnson]], and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.\n\nThe war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. A new National Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues.<ref name=\"hotel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/|title=Minor League Baseball History|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[MiLB.com]]}}</ref> While the NA continues to this day (known as [[Minor League Baseball]]), at the time Ban Johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.\n\nAfter 1902, the NL, AL, and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause contracts. The agreement also set up a formal classification system for minor leagues, the forerunner of today's system that was refined by [[Branch Rickey]].<ref name=\"nabpl\">{{cite web|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|title=1903 National Agreement|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other early defunct baseball leagues are officially considered major leagues, and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current major leagues.

During this era, a baseball cost three dollars, equal to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3|1919|r=2}}}} today (in [[inflation]]-adjusted [[U.S. dollars]]), and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to throw back fouls and (rare) home runs.

(In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a [[grandfather clause]]).

Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter.

The 1920 season was notable for the death of [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the \"dead-ball\" era to an end.

Baseball owners cut their [[Major League Baseball rosters|rosters]] from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts.

Many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific. MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men, older players, and those with a military classification of [[4F (military conscription)|4F]], indicating mental, physical, or moral unsuitability for service.

President Roosevelt responded, \"I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going.

He selected [[Jackie Robinson]] from a list of promising Negro league players. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to \"turn the other cheek\" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred to as \"The Noble Experiment\", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the [[Montreal Royals]], for the 1946 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php|title=The Jackie Robinson Foundation|publisher=[[Jackie Robinson Foundation]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628015406/http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php|archivedate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, the Dodgers called up Robinson to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspaper writers and white major league players. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed his team, \"I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays.

The Astros (known as the \"Colt .45s\" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the [[Louisville Colonels]] folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the [[Gulf Coast]].

In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the [[Oakland Athletics]].

Because of climate and economic issues, many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from [[artificial turf]], as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|title=Timeline: Artificial turf in Major League Baseball|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=October 13, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024070428/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|archivedate=October 24, 2013|df=}}</ref> This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more [[foul territory]] than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.\n\nTeams began to be built around pitching\u2014particularly their bullpens\u2014and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit [[ground ball]]s \"[[in the hole]]\" between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw [[complete game]]s; it was enough for a starter to pitch 6\u20137 innings and turn the game over to the team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]], a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After [[Willie Mays]] hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player ([[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]]) reached that mark until the 1990s.\n\n===Scandals and a changing game===\nDuring the 1980s, baseball experienced a number of significant changes the game had not seen in years. Home runs were on the decline throughout the decade, with players hitting only 40 home runs just 13 times and no one hitting more than 50 home runs in a season for the first time since the Dead-ball era (1900\u20141919).<ref name=\"parade\">{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/408556/parade/1980s-the-decade-baseballs-innocence-ended/|title=1980s: The Decade Baseball's Innocence Ended|date=July 3, 2015|publisher=Parade Magazine|author=Gammons, Peter|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SABR80s\">{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/research/baseball-s-forgotten-era-80s|title=1Baseball's Forgotten Era: The '80s|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)|author=D\u2019Addona, Dan|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref> Teams instead focused on building their rosters around speed and defense.\n\nThe [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]] from June 12 until July 31 forced the cancellation of 713 total games and resulted in a split-season format.\n\nIn 1985, [[Pete Rose]] broke [[Ty Cobb]]'s all-time hits record with his 4,192nd hit, and in 1989 Rose received a lifetime ban from baseball as a result of betting on baseball games while manager of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

It has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using [[Doping in baseball|steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs]].\n\nIn 1993, the NL added the [[Florida Marlins]] in the [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami area]] and the [[Colorado Rockies]] in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League and two new teams were added: the NL's [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in Phoenix and the American League's [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].\n\nAfter the 2001 season, the team owners [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|voted in favor of contraction]]. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium.

This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to Washington after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been previously abandoned.

camp in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], Florida]]\n[[Spring training]] is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season. Teams hold training camps in the states of Arizona and Florida, where the early warm weather allows teams to practice and play without worrying about late winter cold. Spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams that hold spring training in Arizona are grouped into the [[Cactus League]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cactusleague.com/|title=Cactus League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> while teams that hold camp in Florida are known as the [[Grapefruit League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridagrapefruitleague.com/|title=Florida's Grapefruit League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with [[spring break]] for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.\n\nSpring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day, traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/spring-training|title=MLB: Spring Training|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Regular season===\nEach team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, with occasional two- or four-game series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_schedule#date=10/14/2013|title=MLB Schedule|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}</ref> Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled at [[Night game#Baseball|night]]. Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway days.\n\nEach team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one away series, amounting to six or seven games, against the 10 other teams in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, rotating each year, with two opponents in a three-game home series, two in a three-game away series, and one with four games split between home and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague \"natural rival\" (in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays two home games and two away games each year.\n\nWith an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May all teams will participate in an interleague series. Use of the DH rule is determined by the [[home advantage|home team's]] league rules. Before 2013, interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates. (Before 2013, season-long interleague play was not necessary, because each league had an even number of teams. In 2013, the Houston Astros moved to the American League, so that each league would have [[#League organization|15 teams]].)\n\nOver the course of a season, teams compete for the five [[Playoffs|playoff]] berths in their respective leagues. In order to secure a berth, a team must either win its [[MLB#League organization|division]], or capture a [[MLB Wild Card|wild card spot]] by having one of the two best records among the non-winners in its entire league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings#20130930|title=MLB: Regular Season|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 162-game season, an additional [[One-game playoff|tie-breaking]] game (or games) may be needed to determine [[MLB postseason|postseason]] participation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130904&content_id=59527184&c_id=mlb|title=How to determine playoff tiebreakers|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=|date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===All-Star Game===\n{{Main|Major League Baseball All-Star Game}}\n[[File:President attends the 32nd All-Star Baseball Game, throws out first ball.

The All-Star Game features a team of players from the American League (AL)\u2014led by the manager of the previous AL World Series team\u2014and a team of players from the National League (NL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. From 1959 to 1962, two games were held each season, one was held in July and one was held in August. The designated-hitter rule was used in the All-Star Game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark. Since 2010, the DH rule has been in effect regardless of venue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/sports/baseball/29bats.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Rosters Expanded For the All-Star Game|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first official All-Star Game was held as part of the [[Century of Progress|1933 World's Fair]] in Chicago, Illinois, and was the idea of [[Arch Ward]], then sports editor for ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref name = asgmenu>{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml|title=All-Star Game History|accessdate=|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]}}</ref> Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual one.

In 2002, it was renamed the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award]].)\n\nBeginning in 1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans.<ref name = asgmenu/> The fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots originally went to [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] players, two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and [[Hank Aaron]]. Fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including Internet voting in recent years.\n\nThe [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 contest in Milwaukee]] controversially ended in an 11-inning tie when both managers ran out of pitchers. In response, starting in 2003 the league which wins the All-Star game received home-field advantage in the World Series: the league champion hosted the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary). The National League did not win an All-Star game and thus gain home-field advantage until 2010; it was able to overcome this disadvantage and win in three of the seven World Series from 2003 to 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2003_WS.shtml|title=2003 World Series (4\u20132): Florida Marlins (91\u201371) over New York Yankees (101\u201361)|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2008|work=baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/20036WS.shtml|title=2006 World Series (4\u20131): St. Louis Cardinals (83\u201378) over Detroit Tigers (95\u201367)|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> This was discontinued after the 2016 season.\n\nMLB All-Stars from both leagues have worn uniforms from their respective teams at the game with one exception.

It is the oldest of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]]. A total of 30 teams play in Major League Baseball: 15 teams in the [[National League]] (NL) and 15 in the [[American League]] (AL). The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901, respectively. Beginning in 1903, the two leagues cooperated but remained legally separate entities. In 2000 the leagues merged into a single organization led by the [[Commissioner of Baseball]].<ref name=2000nl>{{cite web|title=Year In Review: 2000 National League|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2000n.shtml|website=Baseball-Almanac.com|accessdate=September 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=BASEBALL; League Presidents Out As Baseball Centralizes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/16/sports/baseball-league-presidents-out-as-baseball-centralizes.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 16, 1999|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}</ref> \n\nMLB also oversees [[Minor League Baseball]], which comprises 256 teams affiliated with the major league clubs. MLB and the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] jointly manage the international [[World Baseball Classic]] tournament.\n\nBaseball's first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings founded in 1869. Before that, some teams had [[secret]]ly paid some players. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another.\n\nThe period before 1920 is known as the [[dead-ball era]], during which players would rarely hit [[home run]]s. Professional baseball in the [[United States]] survived a conspiracy to [[match fixing|fix]] the [[1919 World Series]], which came to be known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]]. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II. Shortly after the war, [[Jackie Robinson]] broke [[baseball color line|baseball's color barrier]].\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of [[anabolic steroid]]s among MLB players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the [[Mitchell Report]], which implicated many players in the use of [[performance-enhancing drugs|performance-enhancing substances]], including at least one player from each team.\n\nToday, MLB is composed of [[Current Major League Baseball franchises|30 teams]]: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Teams play 162 games each season and 5 teams in each league advance to a four-round [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason tournament]] that culminates in the [[World Series]], a [[best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired on television, radio, and the Internet throughout North America and in several other countries. MLB has the [[List of attendance figures at domestic professional sports leagues|highest season attendance]] of any sports league in the world with more than 69.6 million spectators in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2018/10/03/how-mlb-attendance-dropped-below-70-million-for-first-time-in-15-years/#7b44d74d61bf|title=Why MLB Attendance Dropped Below 70 Million For The First Time In 15 Years|last1=Brown|first1=Maury|date=October 3, 2018|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Organizational structure==\nMLB is governed by the [[Major League Baseball Constitution]].

MLB maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of [[Minor League Baseball]]. This is due in large part to the 1922 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', which held that baseball is not [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] and therefore not subject to federal [[antitrust]] law. This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years.<ref name=\"Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?\" /> The weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing at double-digit rates.<ref name=\"Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.swlearning.com/economics/policy_debates/baseball.html|title=Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?|accessdate=September 4, 2008|publisher=www.swlearning.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective|title=The Role of Antitrust Laws in the Professional Sports Industry From a Financial Perspective|accessdate=September 4, 2008|work=Howard Bartee, Jr|publisher=The Sport Journal |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094652/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective|archivedate=June 7, 2008}}</ref> There were several challenges to MLB's primacy in the sport between the 1870s and the [[Federal League]] in 1916; the last attempt at a new major league was the aborted [[Continental League]] in 1960.<ref name=\"Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?\" />\n\nThe chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, currently [[Rob Manfred]]. The [[chief operating officer]] is [[Tony Petitti]]. There are five other executives: president (business and media), chief communications officer, chief legal officer, chief financial officer, and chief baseball officer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8023312/major-league-baseball-executive-jimmie-lee-solomon-resigns-21-years|title=Manfred promoted; Jimmie Lee Solomon resigns|publisher=ESPN|date=June 7, 2012|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name=execs>{{cite web|title=MLB Executives|website=[[MLB.com]]|year=2013|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/executives.jsp|accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe multimedia branch of MLB, which is based in [[Manhattan]], is [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]]. This branch oversees [[MLB.com]] and each of the 30 teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds [[editorial independence]] from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns 67 percent of [[MLB Network]], with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider [[DirecTV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network|title=MLB Network|website=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}</ref> It operates out of studios in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], and also has editorial independence from the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network/about/|title=About MLB Network|website=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==League organization==\nIn 1920, the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner of Baseball, who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Commissionership: A Historical Perspective|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_people.jsp?story=com|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> From 1901 to 1960, the American and National Leagues fielded eight teams apiece.\n\nIn the 1960s, MLB expansion added eight teams, including the first non-U.S. team (the [[Montreal Expos]]). Two teams (the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]) were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. In 1993, the National League expanded with two teams, the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies, to even up the number of teams in both leagues.  A third division, the Central Division, was formed in each league in 1994. Until 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the [[World Series]] and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Regular-season [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997.<ref name=Interleague>{{cite news|title=Interleague play ho-hum to some|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HjMfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=388EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2778,783864|accessdate=November 24, 2013|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|date=June 4, 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1995 two new franchises, the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now known as the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]), were awarded by MLB, to begin play in 1998. This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with five in each division), but in order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams; one existing club would have to switch leagues. The [[Milwaukee Brewers#1994\u201398: Realignment / \"We're taking this thing National\"|Milwaukee Brewers]] agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league.

The NABBP existed as an amateur league for 12 years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern U.S. For [[professional baseball]]'s founding year, MLB uses the year 1869\u2014when the first professional team, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1869reds.com/history/|title=Legend of the Cincinnati Red Stockings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175805/http://www.1869reds.com/history|archivedate=July 24, 2008|website=1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings Vintage Base Ball Team|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nA schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club.

The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results in doubt. The first game in the NL\u2014on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the [[Jefferson Street Grounds]], Philadelphia)\u2014is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.<ref name=noble>{{cite news|first=Marty|last=Noble|title=MLB carries on strong, 200,000 games later: Look what they started on a ballfield in Philadelphia in 1876|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110922&content_id=25060814&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb&partnerId=ed-5337375-55428157|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|date=September 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201192845/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110922&content_id=25060814&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb&partnerId=ed-5337375-55428157|archivedate=February 1, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1876/04221876.htm Events of Saturday, April 22, 1876].

Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1882\u20131891), sometimes called the \"beer and whiskey league\" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series\u2014the first attempt at a [[World Series]]. The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the [[American League]] in 1901 under AL president [[Ban Johnson]], and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.\n\nThe war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. A new National Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues.<ref name=\"hotel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/|title=Minor League Baseball History|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=[[MiLB.com]]}}</ref> While the NA continues to this day (known as [[Minor League Baseball]]), at the time Ban Johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.\n\nAfter 1902, the NL, AL, and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause contracts.

During this era, a baseball cost three dollars, equal to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3|1919|r=2}}}} today (in [[inflation]]-adjusted [[U.S. dollars]]), and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to throw back fouls and (rare) home runs.

(In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a [[grandfather clause]]).

Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter.

The 1920 season was notable for the death of [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the \"dead-ball\" era to an end.

By 1932, only two MLB teams turned a profit. Attendance had fallen, due at least in part to a 10% federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices. Baseball owners cut their [[Major League Baseball rosters|rosters]] from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts. Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive, creating night games, broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women.

After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to \"turn the other cheek\" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred to as \"The Noble Experiment\", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the [[Montreal Royals]], for the 1946 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php|title=The Jackie Robinson Foundation|publisher=[[Jackie Robinson Foundation]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628015406/http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php|archivedate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, the Dodgers called up Robinson to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspaper writers and white major league players. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed his team, \"I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays.

Because of climate and economic issues, many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from [[artificial turf]], as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|title=Timeline: Artificial turf in Major League Baseball|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=October 13, 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024070428/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|archivedate=October 24, 2013|df=}}</ref> This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more [[foul territory]] than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.\n\nTeams began to be built around pitching\u2014particularly their bullpens\u2014and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit [[ground ball]]s \"[[in the hole]]\" between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw [[complete game]]s; it was enough for a starter to pitch 6\u20137 innings and turn the game over to the team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]], a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After [[Willie Mays]] hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player ([[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]]) reached that mark until the 1990s.\n\n===Scandals and a changing game===\nDuring the 1980s, baseball experienced a number of significant changes the game had not seen in years. Home runs were on the decline throughout the decade, with players hitting only 40 home runs just 13 times and no one hitting more than 50 home runs in a season for the first time since the Dead-ball era (1900\u20141919).<ref name=\"parade\">{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/408556/parade/1980s-the-decade-baseballs-innocence-ended/|title=1980s: The Decade Baseball's Innocence Ended|date=July 3, 2015|publisher=Parade Magazine|author=Gammons, Peter|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"SABR80s\">{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/research/baseball-s-forgotten-era-80s|title=1Baseball's Forgotten Era: The '80s|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)|author=D\u2019Addona, Dan|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref> Teams instead focused on building their rosters around speed and defense.\n\nThe [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]] from June 12 until July 31 forced the cancellation of 713 total games and resulted in a split-season format.\n\nIn 1985, [[Pete Rose]] broke [[Ty Cobb]]'s all-time hits record with his 4,192nd hit, and in 1989 Rose received a lifetime ban from baseball as a result of betting on baseball games while manager of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

It has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using [[Doping in baseball|steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs]].\n\nIn 1993, the NL added the [[Florida Marlins]] in the [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami area]] and the [[Colorado Rockies]] in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League and two new teams were added: the NL's [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in Phoenix and the American League's [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].\n\nAfter the 2001 season, the team owners [[2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan|voted in favor of contraction]]. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium. MLB owners agreed to hold off on reducing the league's size until at least 2006.<ref name=Plans>{{cite web|title=Plans involving Angels and A's never seriously considered|url=http://a.espncdn.com/mlb/news/2003/0311/1522058.html|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Montreal Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2005. This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to Washington after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal is the only city granted an MLB franchise since 1901 that does not currently host a team.\n\n==Uniforms==\n{{Main|Major League Baseball uniforms|Baseball uniform}}\n[[File:Baseball1870s.jpg|thumb|A baseball team and its uniforms in the 1870s.

camp in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], Florida]]\n[[Spring training]] is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season. Teams hold training camps in the states of Arizona and Florida, where the early warm weather allows teams to practice and play without worrying about late winter cold. Spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams that hold spring training in Arizona are grouped into the [[Cactus League]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cactusleague.com/|title=Cactus League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> while teams that hold camp in Florida are known as the [[Grapefruit League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridagrapefruitleague.com/|title=Florida's Grapefruit League|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with [[spring break]] for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.\n\nSpring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day, traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/spring-training|title=MLB: Spring Training|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Regular season===\nEach team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, with occasional two- or four-game series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_schedule#date=10/14/2013|title=MLB Schedule|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}</ref> Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled at [[Night game#Baseball|night]]. Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway days.\n\nEach team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one away series, amounting to six or seven games, against the 10 other teams in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, rotating each year, with two opponents in a three-game home series, two in a three-game away series, and one with four games split between home and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague \"natural rival\" (in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays two home games and two away games each year.\n\nWith an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May all teams will participate in an interleague series. Use of the DH rule is determined by the [[home advantage|home team's]] league rules. Before 2013, interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates. (Before 2013, season-long interleague play was not necessary, because each league had an even number of teams. In 2013, the Houston Astros moved to the American League, so that each league would have [[#League organization|15 teams]].)\n\nOver the course of a season, teams compete for the five [[Playoffs|playoff]] berths in their respective leagues.

Some Welsh people complained about this accusing her of [[xenophobia]]. However, Robinson said she was putting them into ''Room 101'' out of jealousy, as they always seemed to succeed in everything they did. The Broadcasting Standards Commission investigated and found her comments \"came close to bordering on racism\".  Merton has since explained that before each show he hosted, he took his guests for lunch in order to discuss their nominations. The one guest who didn't go was Anne Robinson and as a result Merton had no idea that she had chosen the Welsh to go into Room 101.  This was satirised in the British comic [[Viz (comics)|Viz]], where fictional TV celebrity [[Roger Mellie]] tried to put [[black people|\"The Blacks\"]] into Room 101.\n* In 2007 English actress [[Jessica Hynes]] (Jessica Stevenson at the time) put [[Anne Robinson]] in to Room 101 under host [[Paul Merton]]. In 2014 under host [[Frank Skinner]] the Welsh television presenter and model [[Steve Jones (Welsh presenter)|Steve Jones]] put Robinson in to Room 101 for a second time.\n*The first item ever put into ''Room 101'' was the [[French people|French]], as suggested by [[Bob Monkhouse]]. Monkhouse said of France: \"I would like to tilt the [[Channel Tunnel]] downwards and turn it into a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]\".\n*[[Nick Hancock]], a big fan of [[cricket]], did not initially put the sport into ''Room 101'' as suggested by [[Angus Deayton]]. When Deayton was told he could put another item into the room, he chose cricket again (led on by the rapturous cries of the studio audience) which Nick, reluctantly, put into the room.\n*Hancock and [[Neil Morrissey]] went into a rant about [[American football]], including Nick's observation: \"They blow a whistle and then they just go everywhere. I think it's based on ''[[Runaround (UK game show)|Runaround]]''\".\n*[[Jonathan Ross]] wanted to put his dress sense into the room. However, he was presented with a hat he said he liked, but never bought. He was told he could put his dress sense in, but the hat would have to go in also. After a brief think, Ross told Paul, \"I'm keeping my clothes.\"\n*[[Stephen Fry]] attempted to put ''Room 101'' into ''Room 101'' (mainly because it was about people talking about things they hate). Merton found it hard to decide what to do because if he did put ''Room 101'' into ''Room 101'', he said, it would be like committing \"professional suicide\", and if he didn't put it into ''Room 101'', he would have to give it to Stephen and it would then become his. Merton did put it into the room, which made the picture go blank followed by Merton saying \"I wish I hadn't done that\". In the run up to ''Room 101'' going into ''Room 101'', ''Room Lovely'' involved Stephen nominating things he liked, such as [[Kathy Burke]] and public libraries.\n*To show the unflinchingly bad content of [[Children in Need]] [[telethons]] during [[Ricky Gervais]]' episode, Paul and Ricky were subjected to [[Lesley Joseph]] dancing and what looked liked her being \"kicked up the arse by [[the Invisible Man]]\" or being attracted to someone in the audience \"who had a very powerful [[vagina]] [[magnet]].\" Ricky also told a story (which he declared would never make the broadcast) of a friend of his who on moving out to the country was presented with a rice pudding made with his new neighbour's leftover human breast milk. He claimed that if it had been presented to himself, he would have offered to make her a \"[[sperm|spunk]] sandwich.\"\n*[[Harry Hill]] wanted to put [[ice cream van]]s into ''Room 101'', saying the tune they always play is [[Greensleeves]] and \"it ruins [[Tea (meal)|tea]]\". Paul suggested a savoury ice-cream made of [[mashed potato]], [[ketchup]] (instead of raspberry sauce) and a [[sausage]] (instead of a [[Flake (chocolate)|Flake]]).\n*At the end of the 11th series, to mark his departure from the show, Merton cast himself into ''Room 101'', having been nominated by [[Ian Hislop]], his rival on TV show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', but with a slight twist. Just before pulling the lever to put himself into ''Room 101'', Merton flipped round the image of himself to reveal Hislop, hence putting himself and Hislop in together, as the final people to go into ''Room 101'' with Paul Merton as host. Another item chosen by Hislop, [[Piers Morgan]], was put into ''Room 101'', but the room rejected him because he was \"too toxic\", so he was not allowed in.\n*In the 6th series (2001) [[Mel and Sue]] put the town of [[Leighton Buzzard]] into ''Room 101'' because of a particularly disastrous gig they once did there. This caused controversy in the local papers of the [[Bedfordshire]] town, with the council claiming that they did not have permission to use the arms of the town in the programme.\n*Comedian [[Rhod Gilbert]] tried to put himself in Room 101, because of his laziness. However, he was denied.\n*UK-based German comedian [[Henning Wehn]] successfully put fundraising into Room 101, because \"someone going on a run shouldn't set him back\". Shortly afterwards he attempted to put the Royals into Room 101, yet this time his suggestion was denied.\n*[[Sheila Hancock]] also tried to put herself into ''Room 101''.\n* Comedian [[Josh Widdicombe|Josh Widdecombe]] tried to put the English county of Devon in to Room 101 under host Frank Skinner, but he was denied by the host.\n*[[Sara Cox]] attempted to put [[death metal]] into Room 101 during the third series of the rebooted show. To demonstrate the genre, Skinner played [[Shadow Moses (song)|Shadow Moses]] from the then [[metalcore]] band [[Bring Me the Horizon]]. This courted controversy from a number of death metal fans, who felt that the decision to use Bring Me the Horizon to represent death metal exemplified the mainstream's lack of understanding of the genre.\n\n==Transmissions==\n{{Main|List of Room 101 episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"textalign:center;\"\n|-\n!

Merton's first guest was Nick Hancock and his last was his fellow regular team captain on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', [[Ian Hislop]]. Usually, there were five nominations discussed in each show \u2013 represented by several surreal props.

He claimed that if it had been presented to himself, he would have offered to make her a \"[[sperm|spunk]] sandwich.\"\n*[[Harry Hill]] wanted to put [[ice cream van]]s into ''Room 101'', saying the tune they always play is [[Greensleeves]] and \"it ruins [[Tea (meal)|tea]]\". Paul suggested a savoury ice-cream made of [[mashed potato]], [[ketchup]] (instead of raspberry sauce) and a [[sausage]] (instead of a [[Flake (chocolate)|Flake]]).\n*At the end of the 11th series, to mark his departure from the show, Merton cast himself into ''Room 101'', having been nominated by [[Ian Hislop]], his rival on TV show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', but with a slight twist. Just before pulling the lever to put himself into ''Room 101'', Merton flipped round the image of himself to reveal Hislop, hence putting himself and Hislop in together, as the final people to go into ''Room 101'' with Paul Merton as host. Another item chosen by Hislop, [[Piers Morgan]], was put into ''Room 101'', but the room rejected him because he was \"too toxic\", so he was not allowed in.\n*In the 6th series (2001) [[Mel and Sue]] put the town of [[Leighton Buzzard]] into ''Room 101'' because of a particularly disastrous gig they once did there. This caused controversy in the local papers of the [[Bedfordshire]] town, with the council claiming that they did not have permission to use the arms of the town in the programme.\n*Comedian [[Rhod Gilbert]] tried to put himself in Room 101, because of his laziness. However, he was denied.\n*UK-based German comedian [[Henning Wehn]] successfully put fundraising into Room 101, because \"someone going on a run shouldn't set him back\". Shortly afterwards he attempted to put the Royals into Room 101, yet this time his suggestion was denied.\n*[[Sheila Hancock]] also tried to put herself into ''Room 101''.\n* Comedian [[Josh Widdicombe|Josh Widdecombe]] tried to put the English county of Devon in to Room 101 under host Frank Skinner, but he was denied by the host.\n*[[Sara Cox]] attempted to put [[death metal]] into Room 101 during the third series of the rebooted show. To demonstrate the genre, Skinner played [[Shadow Moses (song)|Shadow Moses]] from the then [[metalcore]] band [[Bring Me the Horizon]]. This courted controversy from a number of death metal fans, who felt that the decision to use Bring Me the Horizon to represent death metal exemplified the mainstream's lack of understanding of the genre.\n\n==Transmissions==\n{{Main|List of Room 101 episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"textalign:center;\"\n|-\n!
