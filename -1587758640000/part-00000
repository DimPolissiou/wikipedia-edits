By 1923 Maas was story editor for Universal and head of the department.  A year later in 1924, Maas had become dissatisfied with her position and left Universal to move to Hollywood.<ref name=\"maas\" />\n\n==Hollywood years==\nOnce in Hollywood, Maas negotiated a contract with [[Preferred Pictures]] to adapt [[Percy Marks]]'s novel ''[[The Plastic Age (film)|The Plastic Age]]'' for film. Based on this, she was signed to a three-year contract with [[MGM]] for $350 per week, though in her words: \"I had the peculiar feeling that wily [[Louis B. Mayer|Louis B.

During 1925&ndash;1926 she wrote treatments and screenplays for [[Tiffany Productions]], including the well-received [[flapper]] comedies ''[[That Model from Paris]]'' and ''[[The First Night (1927 film)|The First Night]]''.<ref name=\"maas\" />\n\nAlready before she married [[Ernest Maas]], a screenwriter and producer at [[Fox Studios]], on August 5, 1927, they sold story ideas such as ''[[Silk Legs]]'' to studios.

The couple returned to unsteady work in California in October 1929.<ref name=\"maas\" /> According to her memoirs, \"[b]y the fall of 1934, it was plain that we were not a success in Hollywood.

It was in 1941 that they wrote ''Miss Pilgrim's Progress'', the story that would become'' [[The Shocking Miss Pilgrim]]''. Bad representation caused the story to sell for a pittance, and it would not be produced until 1947 when it was rendered almost unrecognizable in an adaptation by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]'s [[20th Century Fox]] for [[Betty Grable]].<ref name=\"maas\" />\n\nThe Maas couple continued to live a hand-to-mouth existence struggling in Hollywood. During this time they were even interrogated by the FBI for having subscribed to two allegedly Communist publications. \"I'm something of a Bolshevik.

She asks to be with him, which he accepts, but she becomes an [[inker]] for Nozaki's manga. It turns out he is a popular shojo manga artist named Sakiko Yumeno. Sakura and Nozaki discuss how to portray delinquents. When a scenario comes up where the main manga couple wants to share a bicycle ride home, Nozaki ponders how to do it without breaking the law, and to realize the scene, he invites Sakura to ride with him on a [[tandem bicycle]]. Nozaki introduces Sakura to his friend Mikoto Mikoshiba, nicknamed \"Mikorin\", who does background floral illustrations. Mikorin appears to be a popular and flirtatious ladies' man, but is actually painfully shy and easily embarrassed. Nozaki wants to introduce a new character to his manga, so Sakura introduces him to her friend Yuzuki Seo, an outgoing girl with a loud personality but is rather insensitive and cannot read the room. Mikorin introduces Sakura and Nozaki to his friend, Yuu Kashima, a tall girl who acts more like a charismatic school prince in attracting a number of girls. Kashima acts goofy around her upperclassman Masayuki Hori, who is president of the Drama Club and who later turns out be Nozaki's assistant on backgrounds. Nozaki's editor Ken Miyamae visits. Mikorin stays over at Nozaki's place to play a dating sim game. Sakura meets Yukari Miyako, Nozaki's neighbor who is also a manga artist. She also meets Mitsuya Maeno, Nozaki's narcissistic yet clueless former editor. As Hori works with Nozaki on some new stories, Kashima shares with Sakura about Hori's background. Sakura and Hori role-play some parts that Nozaki wrote up; Mikorin joins in on the fun.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 2\n | OriginalRelDate = November 22, 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757537774.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 \uff12\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 2 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-3777-4\n | LicensedRelDate = February 23, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-2/9780316391573/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 2 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064938/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-2/9780316391573/?yen |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639157-3\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 11-20.\n | Summary = \n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 3\n | OriginalRelDate = June 22, 2013<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757539853.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 3\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 3 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-3985-3\n | LicensedRelDate = May 24, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-3/9780316391580/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 3 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064935/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-3/9780316391580/?yen |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639158-0\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 21-30.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 4\n | OriginalRelDate = January 22, 2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757542037.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 4\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 4 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-4203-7\n | LicensedRelDate = August 30, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-4/9780316391603/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 4 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919204925/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-4/9780316391603/?yen |archive-date=September 19, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639160-3\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 31-40.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 5\n | OriginalRelDate = July 22, 2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757543539.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 5\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 5 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-4353-9\n | LicensedRelDate = November 22, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-5/9780316391610/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 5 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919203613/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-5/9780316391610/?yen |archive-date=September 19, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639161-0\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 41-50.\n | Summary = Sakura realizes she has not made any progress with Nozaki; her friends suggest she act like a little tease, so she acts like Seo.

While helping Miyako with some background characters, Nozaki ponders some artist copying techniques. His brother Mayu wants to create some manga-style visual posters for his judo club. While they take the train, Wakamatsu tells Mikorin that he is in love with Lorelai, when Seo arrives and Mikorin discovers from Sakura that Seo is Lorelai. Nozaki ponders an animal mascot for his manga, and goes to the art club to experiment with clay while Sakura's club-mates observe how the two interact. Hori is having a Drama Club overnight trip, and the whole gang joins in. As the girls shop for swimsuits, Wakamatsu gets more concerned about Kashima's relationship with Seo. The gang has fun at the beach, even when Seo causes the guys to lose their swim trunks in the water. Afterwards, they have a hot springs soak and hang out in each other's rooms. Miyako and Nozaki discuss magazine cover art layouts while their editor counterparts go out drinking. Sakura recalls the time when she and Nozaki first met.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 6\n | OriginalRelDate = February 21, 2015<ref>{{cite web

Hori collapses at school, tired from drawing for Nozaki all night, so Kashima carries him like a horse to the nurse\u2019s office while wearing a bull mask.

She asks to be with him, which he accepts, but she becomes an [[inker]] for Nozaki's manga. It turns out he is a popular shojo manga artist named Sakiko Yumeno. Sakura and Nozaki discuss how to portray delinquents. When a scenario comes up where the main manga couple wants to share a bicycle ride home, Nozaki ponders how to do it without breaking the law, and to realize the scene, he invites Sakura to ride with him on a [[tandem bicycle]]. Nozaki introduces Sakura to his friend Mikoto Mikoshiba, nicknamed \"Mikorin\", who does background floral illustrations. Mikorin appears to be a popular and flirtatious ladies' man, but is actually painfully shy and easily embarrassed. Nozaki wants to introduce a new character to his manga, so Sakura introduces him to her friend Yuzuki Seo, an outgoing girl with a loud personality but is rather insensitive and cannot read the room. Mikorin introduces Sakura and Nozaki to his friend, Yuu Kashima, a tall girl who acts more like a charismatic school prince in attracting a number of girls. Kashima acts goofy around her upperclassman Masayuki Hori, who is president of the Drama Club and who later turns out be Nozaki's assistant on backgrounds. Nozaki's editor Ken Miyamae visits. Mikorin stays over at Nozaki's place to play a dating sim game. Sakura meets Yukari Miyako, Nozaki's neighbor who is also a manga artist. She also meets Mitsuya Maeno, Nozaki's narcissistic yet clueless former editor. As Hori works with Nozaki on some new stories, Kashima shares with Sakura about Hori's background. Sakura and Hori role-play some parts that Nozaki wrote up; Mikorin joins in on the fun.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 2\n | OriginalRelDate = November 22, 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757537774.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 \uff12\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 2 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-3777-4\n | LicensedRelDate = February 23, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-2/9780316391573/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 2 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064938/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-2/9780316391573/?yen |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639157-3\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 11-20.\n | Summary = \n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 3\n | OriginalRelDate = June 22, 2013<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757539853.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 3\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 3 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-3985-3\n | LicensedRelDate = May 24, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-3/9780316391580/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 3 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064935/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-3/9780316391580/?yen |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639158-0\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 21-30.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 4\n | OriginalRelDate = January 22, 2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757542037.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 4\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 4 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-4203-7\n | LicensedRelDate = August 30, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-4/9780316391603/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 4 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919204925/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-4/9780316391603/?yen |archive-date=September 19, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639160-3\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 31-40.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 5\n | OriginalRelDate = July 22, 2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/9784757543539.html |script-title=ja:\u6708\u520a\u5c11\u5973\u91ce\u5d0e\u304f\u3093 5\u5dfb |trans-title=''Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun'' Volume 5 |website=[[Square Enix]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=September 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-7575-4353-9\n | LicensedRelDate = November 22, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-5/9780316391610/?yen |title=Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, Vol. 5 |website=[[Hachette Book Group]] |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919203613/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/izumi-tsubaki/monthly-girls-nozaki-kun-vol-5/9780316391610/?yen |archive-date=September 19, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-0-31639161-0\n | ChapterList = This volume covers chapters 41-50.\n | Summary = Sakura realizes she has not made any progress with Nozaki; her friends suggest she act like a little tease, so she acts like Seo.

Hori collapses at school, tired from drawing for Nozaki all night, so Kashima carries him like a horse to the nurse\u2019s office while wearing a bull mask.

He began studying piano at the age of five and studied under Boston piano teacher Margaret Chaloff, mother of jazz baritone saxophonist [[Serge Chaloff]], who taught him the \"Russian style\" of piano playing. At an early age he began improvising [[classical music]]. As a teenager he appeared in jazz clubs in the Boston area with [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Vic Dickenson]], [[Chet Baker]], and Serge Chaloff.\n\nAfter graduating from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], he attended the [[Lenox School of Jazz|Lenox School of Music]] where he was associated with [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], and [[Gary McFarland]].<ref>[http://www.factmag.com/2014/.../forgotten-classics-steve-kuhn-tranc...] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> The school's faculty included [[Bill Evans]], [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], [[Gunther Schuller]], and the members of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]. This allowed Kuhn to play, study, and create with some of the most forward-thinking innovators of jazz improvisation and composition; it culminated with his joining trumpeter [[Kenny Dorham]]'s group for an extended time and (briefly) [[John Coltrane]]'s quartet at New York's Jazz Gallery club.\n\nKuhn also has appeared with [[Stan Getz]], [[Art Farmer]], [[Oliver Nelson]], [[Gary McFarland]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Scott LaFaro]], [[Harvie Swartz]], vocalist [[Shelia Jordan]], [[Billy Drummond]], [[David Finck]], and [[Miroslav Vitous]]. From 1967 to 1971 Kuhn moved to [[Stockholm]], Sweden where he worked with his own trio throughout Europe. In 1971 Kuhn moved back to [[New York City]] and formed a [[quartet]] but continued doing European gigs and appearing at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nIn his early years, Kuhn was known as an [[avant-garde jazz]] pianist. He was associated with bassist [[Steve Swallow]] and drummer [[Pete La Roca]] during the 1960s on several notable recordings: ''Three Waves'', under Kuhn's leadership; ''Basra'', under La Roca's leadership, which also featured [[Joe Henderson]]; and ''Sing Me Softly of the Blues'' under flugelhornist [[Art Farmer]]'s leadership. Also notable was Kuhn's inclusion in the quartet on the landmark recording ''Sound Pieces'' led by saxophonist, composer, and arranger Oliver Nelson and including Ron Carter on bass and [[Grady Tate]] on drums. Among other critically acclaimed recordings there was ''The October Suite'' composed by Gary McFarland for Kuhn and an ensemble which included strings, woodwinds, and reeds. The ''Promises Kept'' album features Kuhn's compositions, piano, and strings.\n\nFor decades, Steve Kuhn has led all-star trios that have included such players as bassists Ron Carter and David Finck, and drummers [[Al Foster]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], and [[Joey Baron]]. He has had several live recordings made in some of New York's leading jazz clubs. Kuhn is also the composer of the jazz standard \"The Saga of Harrison Crabfeathers\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Steve Kuhn among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader/co-leader===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year recorded\n!Title\n!Label\n!Notes\n|-\n|1963?\n|''[[The Country and Western Sound of Jazz Pianos]]''\n|Dauntless\n|With [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (piano, cello), [[Barry Galbraith]] (guitar), [[David Izenzon]] and John Neves (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\">{{cite web |last=Fitzgerald |first=Michael |date=May 13, 2013 |title=Steve Kuhn Discography |publisher= |url=https://jazzdiscography.com/Artists/Kuhn/sk-disc.php |website=jazzdiscography.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|1966?\n|''Three Waves''\n|Contact\n|Trio, with [[Steve Swallow]] (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\" />\n|-\n|1966\n|''[[The October Suite]]''\n|[[Impulse!

He was associated with bassist [[Steve Swallow]] and drummer [[Pete La Roca]] during the 1960s on several notable recordings: ''Three Waves'', under Kuhn's leadership; ''Basra'', under La Roca's leadership, which also featured [[Joe Henderson]]; and ''Sing Me Softly of the Blues'' under flugelhornist [[Art Farmer]]'s leadership. Also notable was Kuhn's inclusion in the quartet on the landmark recording ''Sound Pieces'' led by saxophonist, composer, and arranger Oliver Nelson and including Ron Carter on bass and [[Grady Tate]] on drums. Among other critically acclaimed recordings there was ''The October Suite'' composed by Gary McFarland for Kuhn and an ensemble which included strings, woodwinds, and reeds. The ''Promises Kept'' album features Kuhn's compositions, piano, and strings.\n\nFor decades, Steve Kuhn has led all-star trios that have included such players as bassists Ron Carter and David Finck, and drummers [[Al Foster]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], and [[Joey Baron]]. He has had several live recordings made in some of New York's leading jazz clubs. Kuhn is also the composer of the jazz standard \"The Saga of Harrison Crabfeathers\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Steve Kuhn among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader/co-leader===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year recorded\n!Title\n!Label\n!Notes\n|-\n|1963?\n|''[[The Country and Western Sound of Jazz Pianos]]''\n|Dauntless\n|With [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (piano, cello), [[Barry Galbraith]] (guitar), [[David Izenzon]] and John Neves (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\">{{cite web |last=Fitzgerald |first=Michael |date=May 13, 2013 |title=Steve Kuhn Discography |publisher= |url=https://jazzdiscography.com/Artists/Kuhn/sk-disc.php |website=jazzdiscography.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|1966?\n|''Three Waves''\n|Contact\n|Trio, with [[Steve Swallow]] (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\" />\n|-\n|1966\n|''[[The October Suite]]''\n|[[Impulse!

{"title_page": "Freedom of religion in Russia", "text_new": "dsman [[Vladimir Lukin]]'s annual report, the Ministry of Justice had registered 22,956 religious organizations as of January 1, 2007, 443 more than in January 2006. Among the registered religious groups are Russian Orthodox, Orthodox Old Believers, Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish, Evangelical Christians, Catholic, and other denominations.\n\n==Status of religious freedom==\n===Legal and policy framework===\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice; however, in some cases the authorities imposed restrictions on certain groups, most often through the registration process. The Constitution also provides for the equality of all religions before the law and the separation of church and state; however, the Government did not always respect this provision.\n\nIn November 2006, the Government eliminated the value-added tax on religious products sold by religious organizations.\n\n===The 1997 Law===\nThe [[Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations]] ({{a.k.a.}} the 1997 Law) declares all religions equal before the law, prohibits government interference in religion, and establishes simple registration procedures for religious groups. The country is by law a secular state without a state religion. The preamble to the 1997 Law, however, acknowledges Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and other religions as constituting an inseparable part of the country's historical heritage and also recognized the \"special contribution\" of Orthodoxy to the country's history and to the establishment and development of its spirituality and culture.\n\nThe 1997 Law creates three categories of religious communities (groups, local organizations, and centralized organizations) with different levels of legal status and privileges.\n\nThe most basic unit is the \"religious group\" which has the right to conduct worship services and rituals and to teach religion to its members. A group is not registered with the Government and consequently does not have the legal status to open a bank account, own property, issue invitations to foreign guests, publish literature, receive tax benefits, or conduct worship services in [[prison]]s, state-owned hospitals, and the armed forces. However, individual members of a group may buy property for the group's use, invite personal guests to engage in religious instruction, and import religious material. In principle, members of unregistered groups are thus able to rent public spaces and hold services, but in practice, they sometimes encountered significant difficulty in doing so.\n\nThe next level is the \"local religious organization\", which can be registered if it has at least 10 citizen members and is either a branch of a centralized organization or has existed in the locality as a religious group for at least 15 years. Local religious organizations have legal status and may open bank accounts, own property, issue invitation letters to foreign guests, publish literature, enjoy tax benefits, and conduct worship services in prisons, state-owned hospitals, and the armed forces.\n\n\"Centralized religious organizations\" can be registered by joining at least three local organizations of the same denomination. In addition to all the legal rights enjoyed by local organizations, centralized organizations also have the right to open new local organizations without any waiting period. Centralized organizations that have existed in the country for more than 50 years have the right to use the words \"Russia\" or \"Russian\" in their official names.\n\nThe 1997 Law gives officials the authority to ban religious groups and thereby prohibit all of the activities of a religious community. Following the passage of the law, groups that failed to re-register by December 31, 2000, became subject to legal dissolution (often translated as \"liquidation\"), i.e., deprivation of juridical status.\n\n====NGO Law====\nThe 2006 Law on Public Associations (NGO or NPO Law) contains a few provisions that apply to religious organizations.\n\nThe NGO law grants the Ministry of Justice the authority to obtain certain documents, to send its representatives (with advance notice) to attend religious organization events, and to conduct an annual review of the organization's compliance with its registered mission statement. Religious organizations are required to inform the Federal Registration Service (FRS) of changes in leadership or address within 3 days of the changes taking effect. The law allows FRS to file suit against organizations that fail to comply with the law's requirements. If a court finds in favor of FRS, then the organization may be closed down. In addition, a contemporaneous amendment to the Civil Code may affect religious organizations, but the effect of this amendment and all other amendments remains to be seen. Some denominations with numerous local organizations feared that compliance with these changes would be highly burdensome.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses reported that federal officials used the NGO Law to investigate their headquarters, and that government officials told them the investigation was launched on the basis of this law.\n\nUnder the NGO law, religious organizations have new reporting requirements. These reporting requirements are extensive, and many NGOs and religious groups complained about the time and effort needed to complete them. The required reporting includes information about \"organized events and activities\" and accounts of funds received from international and foreign organizations, foreign citizens, and stateless persons. This generates difficulties for reporting anonymous donors. Failure to file reports and complete them adequately can result in warnings that may lead to the organization being closed down.\n\nAfter lobbying by many religious groups, including the ROC, the Government reduced the reporting requirements for all religious organizations and extended the financial reporting deadline of the NGO Law to June 1. Russian organizations are no longer asked whether they receive income from Russian individuals or the Russian state. Although each organization must still supply full names, addresses, and passport details of members belonging to its governing body, they no longer have to provide details of religious congresses, conferences or governing body meetings, including the number of participants. The accounting procedures have been significantly simplified.\n\nWhile neither the constitution nor the 1997 Law grants explicit privileges or advantages to the four \"traditional\" religions, in practice the ROC cooperates more closely with the Government than do other faiths. The ROC has entered into a number of formal and informal agreements with various government ministries that give the ROC far greater access than other religious groups to public institutions such as schools, hospitals, prisons, the police, and the army. ROC activities with the Government include support for the psychological rehabilitation of servicemen returning from conflict zones, the holding of religious services for those serving in conflict zones, and cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs to combat extremism.\n\nThe ROC has special arrangements with government agencies to conduct religious education and to provide spiritual counseling. These include agreements with the Ministries of Education, Defense, Health, Internal Affairs, and Emergency Situations, and other bodies, such as the Federal Tax Service, Federal Border Service, and Main Department of Cossack Forces. Not all of the details of these agreements were accessible, but available information indicated that the ROC received preferential treatment.\n\nOfficials in [[law enforcement]] and the legislative branches spoke of protecting the \"spiritual security\" of the country by discouraging the growth of \"[[sect]]s\" and \"[[cult]]s\", usually understood to include some Protestant and newer religious movements. In January 2007, the Moscow City Prosecutor warned of the danger posed by extremist and dangerous new religious movements entering the country, and promised tough measures to stop their activities. To date, no such measures have been proposed or implemented.\n\nThe National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, last updated in 2000, states that \"ensuring national security includes countering the negative influence of foreign religious organizations and missionaries.\"\n\nRepresentative offices of foreign religious organizations are required to register with state authorities, and they may not conduct services or other religious activities unless they have acquired the status of a group or organization. In practice, many foreign religious representative offices opened without registering or were accredited to a registered religious organization.\n\n[[Moscow City Duma|The Moscow City Duma]] is proposing a law that would prohibit \"religion agitation\" in public. Administrative punishment for violations under this article would be approximately $4\u201320 (100-500 rubles).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe regions of [[Kabardino-Balkariya]] and [[Dagestan]] have laws banning extremist Islamic \"[[Wahhabism]]\", but there were no reports that authorities invoked these laws to deny registration to Muslim groups. However, the former president of the Kabardino-Balkaria republic ordered the closure of six of seven [[mosques]] in [[Nalchik]], the region's capital. The new president of the region has reopened one mosque and announced plans to reopen another.\n\nOfficials of the Presidential Administration, regions, and localities maintain consultative mechanisms to facilitate government interaction with religious communities and to monitor application of the 1997 Law. At the national level, groups interact with a special governmental commission on religion, which includes representatives from law enforcement bodies and government ministries. On broader policy questions, religious groups continued to deal with the Presidential Administration through the Presidential Council on Cooperation with Religious Associations. The broad-based Council is composed of members of the Presidential Administration, secular academic specialists on religious affairs, and representatives of traditional and major nontraditional groups. Other governmental bodies for religious affairs include a Governmental Commission for the Affairs of Religious Associations, headed by the Minister of Culture and Mass Communications.\n\nAvenues for interaction with regional and local authorities also exist. The offices of some of the seven Plenipotentiary Presidential Representatives (Polpreds) include suboffices that address social and religious issues. Regional administrations and many municipal administrations also have designated officials for liaison with religious organizations. Religious minorities most often encounter problems at the regional level.\n\nThe Russian Academy of State Service works with religious freedom advocates, such as the Slavic Center for Law and Justice, to train regional and municipal officials in properly implementing the 1997 Law. The Academy opens many of its conferences to international audiences.\n\nThe Office of Federal Human Rights Ombudsman [[Vladimir Lukin]] has a department for religious freedom issues, which receives and responds to complaints. The Ombudsman's Office receives 200\u2013250 religious freedom complaints annually, which represents thousands of alleged individual violations. The Office has determined that approximately 75 percent of these cases represent genuine violations of religious freedoms guaranteed under the law.\n\nContradictions between federal and local laws, and varying interpretations of the law, were used by some regional officials to restrict the activities of religious minorities. According to many observers, local governments are more susceptible to pressure from the local religious majority and therefore are more likely to discriminate against local minority religious communities. Many localities appeared to implement their own policies with very little federal interference. When the federal Government intervenes in local cases, it works through the Procuracy, Ministry of Justice, Presidential Administration, and the courts. The federal Government only occasionally intervened to prevent or reverse discrimination at the local level.\n\nIn July 2006, the country hosted the World Summit of Religious Leaders, where [[Vladimir Putin|President Putin]] spoke to the participants about increasing religious tolerance. Officials met regularly during the reporting period with leaders of several faiths, including Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities.\n\nThe federal Government does not require religious instruction in schools, but it continues to allow public use of school buildings after hours for the ROC to provide religious instruction on a voluntary basis. Several regions offer a course on Orthodoxy in public schools, and five regions ([[Kaluga]], [[Tver]], [[Bryansk]], [[Smolensk]], and [[Voronezh]]) have a mandatory class on the Fundamentals of Orthodox Culture. The [[Belgorod Oblast]] voluntary course can be avoided only if the parents themselves provide and pay for an alternative course. The course is offered as an elective in several other regions. In regions where the class is not mandatory, in practice students may be compelled to take it where schools do not provide alternatives. Minister of Education [[Andrei Fursenko|Andrey Fursenko]] warned against these lessons, and he proposed instead a course on \"world religions\" or on Orthodoxy. Fursenko's proposal remained controversial among some experts, including some in the ROC. Some regions offer a class on \"History of Religion\", a proposal that Fursenko suggested but did not introduce nationally. The Ministry of Education rejected continued publication and dissemination of a textbook that detailed Orthodox Christianity's contribution to the country's culture, with descriptions of some minority religions that members of those religions found objectionable; for example, the text's stance on Jews, certain non-traditional denominations, and foreigners is considered problematic by some. Some schools continued to use the text.\n\nThere is a universal [[military draft]] for men, but the Constitution provides for alternative service for those who refuse to bear arms for reasons of conscience. The length of alternative service is longer than the standard military service. The standard length of military service is 18 months, alternative service in a Ministry of Defense agency is 27 months, and alternative service in a nondefense agency is 31.5 months. Some human rights groups have complained that the extended length of service for draftees requesting alternative assignments acts as a punishment for those who exercise their convictions.\n\nIn July 2006, a new law came into effect that repeals deferrals for students of religious training institutions. The law was protested by many religious groups, including the ROC.\n\n====Extremism laws====\n\nThe 2002 Law on Extremism, amended in July 2006, can affect religious groups, particularly Muslim groups, by criminalizing a broad spectrum of activities. For example, Mansur Shangareev was convicted of extremism and sentenced to 2 years in prison for \"actively adhering to a radical trend of Islam\" that claimed superiority over mainstream Islam, and for making \"remarks to Muslim girls about their immodest dress\", among other things.\n\nThe 2006 amendments allow some charges of extremism where people are alleged to have defended or expressed sympathy with other individuals already charged with extremism.\n\nLaws against extremism have been tightened over time. The 2016 [[Yarovaya Law]], named after politician [[Irina Yarovaya]], extends the legal restrictions against extremism to include evangelism by minority faiths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-yarovaya-law-religious-freedom-restrictions/27852531.html|title=Russia's 'Yarovaya Law' Imposes Harsh New Restrictions On Religious Groups|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-to-bolster-russian-surveillance-angering-edward-snowden/2016/07/07/4d307aca-443e-11e6-a76d-3550dba926ac_story.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2016/july/russia-ban-evangelism-effect.html|title=Russia's Ban on Evangelism Is Now in Effect|first=Sarah Eekhoff|last=Zylstra|website=News & Reporting|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://religionnews.com/2016/07/11/u-s-churches-to-russia-were-not-leaving/|title=Churches to Russia: We\u2019re not leaving|date=July 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn May 5, 2015, customs authorities in Russia seized a shipment of religious literature containing Ossetian-language Bibles published by Jehovah's Witnesses.

In the first three cases, religious communities rely upon government officials to grant them permission to assemble, own, or build property, or allow people into the country.\n\nMany of the difficulties that religious communities face are rooted in bureaucratic obstacles and [[corruption]], not religious bigotry. While it is nearly impossible to discern if groups are being targeted because of their religious beliefs or because they are vulnerable to demands by corrupt officials, the net effect is a restriction on their ability to worship.\n\n====Registration====\nFollowing the 1997 Law's registration deadline of December 31, 2001, the Ministry of Justice began to legally dissolve approximately 2,000 organizations that had not re-registered, sometimes over the complaints of groups who claimed that they were still active. Complaints of involuntary dissolution have decreased as this wave of dissolutions has passed, and only a few remain to be contested in court.{{update inline|date=September 2018}}\n\nDue to legal restrictions, poor administrative procedures on the part of some local authorities or disputes between religious organizations, an unknown number of groups have been unable to register. Some religious groups registered as social organizations because they were unable to do so as religious organizations.\n\nIn June 2007, a St. Petersburg Court suspended and ordered The Scientology Centre in St. Petersburg to close. The Centre had refused to allow government officials to sit in on confidential \"auditing\" sessions and did not hand over confidential documents from these sessions when requested. Government authorities claimed to have a right to these inspections and documents under the new NGO law. The Centre continued to operate at the end of the period covered by this report.{{clarify|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe [[Unification Church]] was contesting the refusal of officials to re-register three local organizations. The Unification Church alleged that its registration process had been complicated by the requirements imposed by a broad range of government agencies, including the fire safety office, tax inspectors, and epidemiological inspectors. The Church also reported that federal authorities investigated its compliance with visa rules, and scrutinized missionaries' activities and property holdings.\n\nLocal authorities continued an investigation of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center\u2014their national headquarters in St. Petersburg\u2014in what the Jehovah's Witnesses described as a search for an excuse to shut down their operations. The authorities indicated to the Jehovah's Witnesses that any irregularity they found would be used as grounds to close the center. On February 16, 2007, the center wrote to the Prosecutor General's Office expressing concern over the investigations, which had continued for more than 2 years. The St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman of the Russian Federation sent replies stating that the investigators had not exceeded their authority and had not violated the law.\n\nAs of December 2006, the Federal Registration Service had registered 407 Jehovah's Witnesses local organizations in 72 regions, but problems with registration continued in some areas, notably Moscow, where the Moscow Golovinskiy Intermunicipal District Court and the Moscow City Court (of appeal) have banned them since 2004. The Moscow community appealed the ban to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR).\n\nIn June 2006, the FRS branch in [[Novosibirsk]] used the NGO law and found that a local [[Pentecostal church]], the Word of Life, violated its charter by organizing a show in a Siberian military unit. The FRS sent a written notification to the church stating that if they violated their charter again, the FRS would file a suit to close the church.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) unanimously ruled against the Government on three religious freedom cases involving the registration of the [[Salvation Army]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and the [[Church of Scientology]]. In all three cases, the court unanimously determined that the Government violated its international obligations under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Other religious freedom cases against the Government were pending at the ECHR.\n\nIn ''Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia'', the ECHR ruled in October 2006 that the Government's refusal to re-register the Moscow branch of the organization violated the right of assembly and freedom of religion of the Salvation Army. The Government paid $13,418 (10,000 euros) in damages and legal fees to the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army cannot re-register its Moscow branch, as the deadline for re-registration under the 1997 Religions Law was May 2000. They may only be re-registered by the Moscow Chief Directorate of the Ministry of Justice. It was the Chief Directorate that designated the Salvation Army as a paramilitary organization, and successfully argued in court that this prevented re-registration. The Supreme Court did not address this designation, nor did they remove it.\n\nIn the Jehovah's Witnesses case, Kuznetsov and Others v. Russia, the ECHR ruled in January 2007 that Chelyabinsk authorities had violated the rights of the Chelyabinsk Jehovah's Witnesses when they disrupted a worship meeting in 2000. The court ordered the Government to pay $121,486 (90,544 euros) to the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nIn the Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia, the ECHR ruled that Moscow authorities violated the religious freedom rights of the Church of Scientology under the European Convention on Human Rights by refusing to re-register their Moscow church. The Scientologists had applied to re-register 11 times with no success. The Government did not appeal, and the decision is final.\n\nLocal authorities refused to register Scientology centers as religious organizations in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia|Dmitrovgrad]], [[Izhevsk]], and other localities. Since these centers have not been in existence for 15 years, they are by law ineligible to register as religious organizations and cannot perform religious services (although they were allowed to hold meetings and seminars). The Churches of Scientology in Surgut City and [[Nizhnekamsk]] (Tatarstan) filed suits with the ECHR contesting the refusal of officials to register the churches based on the 15-year rule. The ECHR found the suits admissible in June 2005 and combined the cases. The case awaited a final decision, which the Church of Scientology expected by the end of 2007.{{update inline|date=September 2018}}\n\nAccording to FRS statistics, there are 22,956 registered religious groups operating in the country, approximately half of which are affiliated with the ROC. In 2005, the last year for which statistics are available, authorities investigated the activities of 3,526 religious organizations during the 2005 calendar year. The Ministry of Justice sent notifications of violations to 2,996 religious organizations. The courts made decisions to liquidate 59 local organizations for violations of constitutional norms and federal legislation during that period.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses alleged in some cases that authorities had consulted with the ROC in determining whether to approve their requests for registration.\n\nMany religious groups had difficulty acquiring land or permits to build houses of worship. Some local governments prevented religious groups from using venues suitable for large gatherings such as cinemas and government facilities.\n\nSome religious groups, particularly Jehovah's Witnesses, but also the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), Pentecostal congregations, and the Evangelical Christian Missionary Union, reported that local authorities in recent years denied them permission to acquire land on which to construct places of worship. Authorities continued to deny construction permits to several groups.\n\nMany non-traditional denominations frequently complained that they were unable to obtain venues for worship. Because they are small and often newly established, they often lacked the necessary resources to buy or rent facilities on the open market and must rely on government assistance. Because they are nontraditional, they frequently met opposition from the traditional communities and often were unable to find government officials who were willing to assist them in renting state-owned property. There were multiple reports of religious organizations who were not allowed to renew leases on public and private buildings. Increased competition for space in a growing economy and increasing real estate prices led many owners (public and private) to lease property to higher-paying clients, and in some cases, religious groups were refused outright at any price.\n\nRepresentatives of multiple Protestant groups spoke about increasing difficulty in extending existing leases or signing new leases for worship premises, the majority of which are still state-controlled. For example, administrations in Tikhoretsk and Volgograd refused to extend rental agreements with member churches of the Union of Christian Evangelical Missionaries, which used the spaces for worship.\n\nThe Word of Life Christian Church in Kaluga region faced great difficulties trying to build its church. The Church had been frequently visited by tax, fire, and other government inspectors. In December 2006, the mayor issued a decree to confiscate the Church's building and land, which would then be given to a foreign commercial developer. The Church's appeals to the governor, prosecutor, and police were unsuccessful, although the property had not been confiscated.\n\nThe NGO Sova Center reported at the end of the reporting period{{when|date=September 2018}} that the Vladimir Muslim community still was not able to obtain public land to build a mosque. In 2004, despite interference from the Vladimir city authorities, the congregation constructed a mosque on private land near a house that community members bought and used as a temporary prayer house. The mosque was called a community house and was used by the local community of Muslims even though it did not have room for all 25,000 members.\n\nThe [[Sochi]] mayor's office continued to deny the Muslim community authorization to build a new mosque; the current premises insufficiently accommodate the membership. Officials allotted land several times but never transferred it to the Muslim community. According to the regional government, authorities can allocate land for a mosque only after a public opinion survey indicates that the proposed location would not cause conflict. In March 2007 [[Abdul-Vahed Niyazov|Abdul-Vakhed Niyazov]], Chairman of the Sochi Russian Islamic Cultural Center, asked Presidential Representative to the Southern Federal District [[Dmitry Kozak|Dmitriy Kozak]] to investigate.\n\nOn 14 May, 2007, at a public hearing in the city of [[Murmansk]], residents of the central city district voted to refuse the Jehovah's Witnesses permission to build a church in the city's downtown area. Mayor [[Mikhail Savchenko]] issued a statement noting that even though it was his preference that new places of worship be built outside of the city center, he regretted the lack of tolerance shown at the public hearing. Jehovah's witnesses in [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dezershinsk]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] failed to obtain land for constructing a building of worship.\n\nReligious news sources claimed that authorities acting on behalf of the ROC sometimes prevented Orthodox churches not belonging to the ROC, including the True Orthodox, from obtaining or maintaining buildings for worship. In 2005 a church reconstructed and renovated by the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church (ROAC) was transferred to the ROC Diocese of Stavropol. The subsequent protest by the ROAC culminated in the beating of Metropolitan Valentin (see the Abuse section) and threats to other ROAC clergy. The Zheleznogorsk City Administration subsequently promised to allot a new building to the ROAC, but had not done so by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThere was an ongoing conflict between the Moscow [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] and the Government regarding allocating a plot of land for worship. In the first half of 2007, Moscow City authorities rescinded their allotment of land for the construction of a Krishna temple in the Moscow city center and instead allotted the Krishnas {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land in the Moscow suburbs.\n\nSince Richen Ling, a Tibetan Buddhist community, lost its Moscow city center premises in 2004 due to a municipal construction project, it continued to rent facilities since it has been unable to secure a permanent house of worship.\n\nThe Unification Church reported difficulties in establishing a Eurasian Church Center in Moscow to coordinate church activities in the region. The authorities would not allow the church building to be occupied until an annex illegally built by the former owner was legalized. The church estimated that the building would remain closed for 2 years until all the necessary documentation was done.\n\nLocal officials have refused permission to build to a Catholic parish in [[Barnaul]] (Altai Region) and to a Muslim community in Sochi for more than 10 years.\n\nThe Church of Scientology reported that it sometimes had difficulties getting permits for large events in Moscow.\n\nIn October 2006 local authorities in [[Tyumen]] destroyed a building that was intended to house a mosque. The Muslim community had spent years working to receive ownership of the building, which had been a mosque before the 1917 revolution. The authorities had decided to give the building to the Muslim community earlier that year.\n\nIn June 2006, the city of [[Krasnodar]] demanded the demolition of a private home intended to host worship for an Evangelical group. The lower court upheld the city's decision. A court appeal was pending.\n\nIn January 2006, the district court in [[Astrakhan]] ordered the demolition of a mosque on an access road to the city. The construction of the mosque had been allowed by the mayor in 1998, but officials argued in 2006 that the land was zoned residential, that the mosque was illegally built, and that the community must demolish it. Following the failure of their appeal to the Russian Supreme Court, which upheld the demolition order and held the Muslim community must pay for the demolition itself, the Muslim community appealed to the ECHR, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nThe Emmanuel Pentecostal Church continued to face difficulties building its church in Moscow. The old House of Culture, which the Emmanuel church wants to convert into a prayer house and office building, sits on land that the local land committee agreed to rent to the church. Other local authorities opposed to that location for the church have up the registration of the land title, some on grounds that local public opinion is against the religious community involved. They refused to allow the building to be reconstructed as a church. On March 26, 2007, arsonists set the building on fire.\n\nThe 1997 Law appeared to change the visa regime for religious and other foreign workers. Immediately after its implementation, nontraditional groups reported problems receiving long-term visas.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the number of foreign religious personnel experiencing visa and customs difficulties while entering or leaving the country decreased, although some problems continued. Authorities have deported or denied entry to religious workers with valid visas in the past. The Unification Church in Moscow appealed the January 2006 deportation of its founder and legal/spiritual advisor, Jack Corley, to the ECHR. By law he must remain outside of the country for at least 5 years, at which point he can reapply for residence. The ECHR appeal joined two similar cases involving deportations of Unification Church foreign missionaries. A member of the Japanese Unification Church invited to Ufa to make a presentation was detained by FSB officers and forced to buy tickets to Moscow for himself and an FSB officer for onward deportation to Japan. He appealed the deportation and won the right to re-enter.\n\nIn June 2007 the Government threatened to deport three Falun Gong followers to c, where they could face official persecution. The UN High Commission on Refugees arranged to have these practitioners resettled to other countries. On March 28, 2007, officials deported a Falun Gong follower and her young daughter to [[China]].\n\nIn December 2006, a Moscow court rejected the appeal against deportation of [[Sunday Adelaja]], a leader of the Ukrainian \"Embassy of God.\" The court found Adelaja's deportation to be \"in the interests of state security.\" In May 2006, while traveling to Moscow in order to participate in a television program, Adelaja had been denied entry at a Moscow airport, despite having a multiple-entry visa.\n\nVisa problems decreased for some groups. Groups such as the LDS and Roman Catholic churches, among others, reported that the Government issued most of their clergy 1-year visas that may be extended to 5-year visas after they have entered the country. They reported that the administration of the visas had improved since the last reporting period. Foreign clergy are particularly important for the Roman Catholic Church, since there are few ordained Russian priests. Catholic authorities reported a decrease in visa problems for priests during the period covered by this report.\n\nMany religious groups were unable to regain property confiscated in the Soviet era and to acquire new property. The SOVA Center said the property problem was most prevalent among Muslims and Protestants.\n\nAlthough authorities have returned many properties used for religious services, including churches, [[synagogues]], and mosques, all four traditional religions continued to pursue restitution cases. As of May 2007, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade was preparing legislation on returning most religious property (except for a few cultural and historical treasures) to its pre-1917 owners.\n\nThe ROC appeared to have greater success reclaiming prerevolutionary property than other groups, although it still had disputed property claims. At the end of the reporting period, the Moscow Diocese of the ROC owned more than 1,400 buildings, up from 130 in 1998.\n\nProperty claims for the ROC are legally complicated, since there was no separation of church and state before the revolution. Most of the Orthodox church buildings that were returned to the ROC were not considered ROC property before 1917. The ROC was only entitled to use these buildings and theoretically could have been evicted, but there was no attempt to do so. The ROC fully owned only churches built, bought, or received after 1991.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Community reported 44 disputed properties, including the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Cathedral in Moscow. While most state-owned property was returned, the community had no success with buildings that had been privatized. The community continued to work with authorities in the federal and local levels to resolve these issues.\n\nMuslims in Beslan appealed to the Presidential Council for Cooperation with Religious Associations for the return of its Cathedral Mosque.\n\nThe Jewish community was still seeking the return of a number of synagogues and cultural and religious artifacts. The Federation of Jewish Communities reported that federal officials had been cooperative in the community's efforts to seek restitution of former synagogues, as had some regional officials, although some Jews asserted that the Government had returned only a small portion of the total properties confiscated during the Soviet period. The international Chabad Lubavitch organization repeatedly sought return of the Schneerson Collection, a large collection of revered religious books and documents of the Lubavitcher rebbes, which the authorities consider part of the country's cultural heritage.\n\nSome human rights groups and religious minorities accused the Procurator General of encouraging legal action against a number of minority religions and of giving official support to materials that are biased against Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, the LDS, and others. There were credible reports that individuals within the federal security services and other law enforcement agencies harassed certain minority religious groups, investigated them for purported criminal activity and violations of tax laws, and pressured landlords to renege on contracts. In some cases the security services were thought to have influenced the Ministry of Justice to reject registration applications.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Kabardino-Balkariya reportedly kept lists of students who said Muslim prayers, had Muslim middle names, or who sent clips with Islamic themes through their mobile phones. During the reporting period, the Sova Center reported that in general the pressure on Muslims in Kabardino-Balkariya dropped with the appointment of the republic's new leadership.\n\nA school principal in [[Argayashsky District|Argayash]] allegedly forced a member of the Pentecostal church to resign from her kindergarten teaching post or else face criminal charges of maltreating children. Local news reports cited complaints from parents that implied that the teacher had been teaching about religion and alleged that she had physically mistreated them. Church officials maintained that these charges were fabricated and that she was actually removed due to her religious beliefs.\n\nIn June 2007 officials in the city of [[Uzlovaya]] banned a [[Christian music festival]] organized by local [[Baptist churches]]. The officials originally gave permission for the festival but revoked it after reportedly receiving phone calls from the local FSB. The mayor reportedly claimed not to have known that the festival was a religious event.\n\nIn May 2007 local authorities in the town of [[Revda, Murmansk Oblast]] ordered the closure of a Pentecostal drug and alcohol rehabilitation center for the homeless. Two members of the town council and a local Russian Orthodox priest first organized public opposition to the center and held a screening of a negative film about Pentecostals. Pentecostals were not invited to the public hearing that decided the issue; they showed up nonetheless and were booed by the approximately 800 participants. The town council then voted to close the center. The Pentecostals planned to appeal the matter to a court.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, a court found Viktor Tanakov, high priest of the ethnic Mari faith, guilty of incitement to religious and ethnic hatred for having written and distributed a brochure entitled \"The Priest Speaks\", which describes all world religions as \"demonic.\" He lost his appeal to the Supreme Court on March 21, 2007.\n\nIn June 2007 a Moscow district court published a ban on the works of [[Said Nurs\u00ee|Said Nursi]], a Turkish pacifist Islamic theologian. The ban, which was being appealed, was condemned by religious and human rights leaders. [[Ravil Gainutdin]], Chairman of the [[Russian Council of Muftis]], wrote an open letter to President Putin describing the Risale-i Nur ban as \"a crude violation of freedom of conscience in our country.\" Vladimir Lukin, the Human Rights Ombudsman, denounced the ban, saying that Nursi's works contained no trace of religious hatred or intolerance. In an open letter to the court, Lukin wrote that \"It is very important that we do not allow interference in the convictions and beliefs of millions of citizens on the poorly grounded, unproven pretext of fighting against extremism, as this really could provoke wide-scale violations of their right to freedom of belief.\"\n\nThere has been a trend of senior government officials showing support for those religious leaders who endorse them; this can lead to indirect discrimination. For example, in St. Petersburg, an Imam at Cathedral Mosque endorsed United Russia, which supported his plans for a second mosque in the city. At the same time, Muslims not part of Cathedral Mosque were unable to obtain permission to construct their own mosque in St. Petersburg. Governor [[Valentina Matviyenko]] noted in response to a letter of enquiry that this is in part because they are \"in a state of conflict\" with and \"follow a different trend of Islam\" from the Cathedral Mosque community.\n\nLocal authorities in St. Petersburg began an investigation of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center, their national headquarters, even before the 2006 NGO law's implementing regulations were published. The authorities indicated that any irregularity they found would cause them to close the center. Federal and local authorities continued their investigations of the center in 2007. On February 16, 2007, the center wrote to the Prosecutor General's Office, expressing concern over the investigations, which had continued for more than 2 years. The St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman sent replies stating that the investigators had not exceeded their authority and had not violated the law.\n\nThe Government in practice gave preference to the ROC. Authorities permitted Orthodox chapels and priests on army bases. Protestant groups had more limited access to military facilities, while authorities largely banned Islamic services in the military and generally did not give Muslim conscripts time for daily prayers or alternatives to pork-based meals. Some recruits serving in the army reported that fellow servicemen insulted and abused them because they were Muslim.\n\n===Abuses of religious freedom===\n{{POV section|date=February 2018}}\n\nAlthough there are several laws addressing crimes motivated by ethnic or religious hatred, law enforcement agencies enforced these laws in an inconsistent, generally infrequent, and sometimes arbitrary manner.\n\nAuthorities rarely prosecuted or sentenced those arrested for attacks and vandalism against religious minorities, and they often failed to bring hate-crime charges even when religious bigotry was clearly involved. Some government officials denied that there was a problem with [[hate crimes]], or if they did exist, they were manifestations of economic ills. Some government officials and human rights observers noted that, due to heavy caseloads, prosecutors chose to file easily proven charges of [[vandalism]] or [[hooliganism]] rather than risk an acquittal on the harder-to-prove hate-crime motive. The end result was that hate crime legislation was often not enforced.\n\nThe Government also used counter-terrorism to commit serious violations of religious freedom against the Muslim population. There were numerous cases of Muslims being prosecuted for extremism or terrorism even when they have no clear relation to such activities. These included individuals detained for possessing religious literature such as the [[Quran|Qur'an]], or on the basis of evidence allegedly planted by the police. Some people suspected by local police of [[Islamic extremism]] allegedly were subjected to torture and ill-treatment.\n\nAccording to human rights groups, a Supreme Court decision to ban 15 Muslim groups for alleged ties to international terrorism made it easier for officials to arbitrarily detain Muslims for alleged connections to these groups.\n\nOn 24 May, 2007, during an interethnic brawl in Stavropol between hundreds of Russian and Chechen youths, Gelani Ayatev was badly beaten and soon after died of his injuries. Zaurbek Akhmadov, an eyewitness, said that riot troops and local police cheered on [[skinheads]] as they physically assaulted Ayatev, who had been handcuffed. Police then put Ayatev, still in handcuffs, and Akhmadov, who had been shot in the leg by police as he tried to help Ayatev, in the back of a police vehicle. According to Akmadov, the police refused to allow medical attention for Ayatev or Akmadov for more than an hour, and in response to Akhmadov's cries to help Ayatev and bring him to a doctor, the policemen answered \"Don't worry. He won't be shouting Allah Akbar anymore.\"\n\nIn the case where a suspect threw a [[Molotov cocktail]] at a synagogue in [[Saratov]] in May 2007, police were investigating it as a case of \"hooliganism\" rather than as a hate crime, and had not apprehended any suspects. They declared it may not have been clear to the perpetrator that the building was a synagogue.\n\nIn Saratov at the beginning of April 2007, when a Jewish community member's home was targeted in an arson attack and [[graffiti]] reading \"kikes to Israel\" was written on a fence near the synagogue, police investigators classified these incidents as \"hooliganism\" and had not detained any suspects as of May.\n\nIn February 2007 the court gave light prison sentences to five teenagers who beat and fatally stabbed a Jewish man in October 2005, a murder motivated by ethnic hatred.\n\nThere were isolated instances in which local officials detained individuals who were publicly discussing their religious views, but usually authorities resolved these instances quickly.\n\nOn May 13 and 14, 2007 police arrested and detained 15 members of the Voskresenye Baptist community in Ivanovo, who were holding an event in a movie theater, distributing the New Testament and Book of Psalms. The organizers of the event had a written agreement with the theater. The reason given for the inspection appeared erroneous. The police tried to intimidate the detainees and urged them not to attend Baptist meetings, stating it was a \"harmful sect.\"\n\nOn March 31, 2006, residents of Novaya Adygeia village were prevented from going to their mosque for Friday prayers. Police and Adygeia militia blocked all the roads into the village, stopped cars, and searched Muslims. According to the Maykop mosque imam, police officers also allegedly assaulted and apprehended a group of young Muslims, including the imam; masked policemen dragged the group to minibuses and took them to the Interior Ministry's Anti-Organized Crime Department. The policemen beat and questioned them about why they wore beards and observed Islamic norms of hygiene. After the Muslims were detained for a night in prison, officials took them before a judge who ordered their immediate release. The NGOs Memorial and SOVA reported that government officials have harassed Muslims in Adygeia since summer 2005, including seizing religious literature, preventing congregants from attending Friday prayers, and warning them to stop attending the mosque.\n\nA complicated case regarding the disruption of an April 2006 meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow was still pending. In April 2006 the Lyublino Police Department of Moscow disrupted a religious meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses, and officers detained and interrogated 14 male leaders of the congregation, taking their passports. Police refused to provide written reasons for their detention, reportedly physically assaulted their attorney Vitaly Sinyukov when he went to the police station to assist them, and threatened him at knife-point not to file a complaint. In June 2006 a Moscow district court found the detention of the plaintiffs unlawful but dismissed the remainder of the suit because the Jehovah's Witnesses did not have legal permission to hold the meeting. Both the Jehovah's Witnesses and the police appealed the decision, and on March 22, 2007, the court reversed the June 2006 decision and ruled that the detention had in fact been lawful. The Moscow City Court refused to allow the ECHR judgment Kuznetsov v. Russia to be introduced as evidence in the case.\n\nVitaliy Sinyukov filed a suit against the Lyublino District Police Department. On April 20, 2006, the Lyublino District Court dismissed the complaint against the police without considering its merits. Sinyukov appealed, and on July 13, 2006, the Moscow City Court reversed the ruling and returned the case to the Lyublino District Court for consideration. On August 16, 2006, the Lyublino District Court again ruled to dismiss the case without considering its merits. Sinyukov appealed again, and on December 14, 2006, the Moscow City Court reversed the ruling in part and again returned the case to the Lyublino District Court for partial consideration of its merits. The case was pending at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn December 24, 2006, local police and officials from the Chelyabinsk Emergencies and Youth departments raided a Pentecostal service at a private house in Argayash and demanded documents relating to the property and church. Police Colonel Ramil Galilullin told the press that the reason for the raid was a complaint by local citizens that children attended the Pentecostal church without parental permission. Following the raid, the authorities also conducted a fire inspection and fined the church for incorrect use of a stove and defective wiring. The Chelyabinsk region public prosecutor opened an investigation into the actions of the authorities in February 2007.\n\nFrom July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006, the courts convicted 46 Muslims, 29 of whom were in prison, for membership in Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Courts gave Anton (Abdullah) Stepanenko, an imam in [[Pyatigorsk]] (Stavropol Region), a suspended sentence, partially for inciting religious hatred. Stepanenko's lawyer maintained that he was not permitted to order a psychiatric assessment of a key witness with a long history of mental illness, or to cross-examine scholars responsible for an expert analysis which alleged that Islamic literature\u2014with no proven link to Stepanenko personally\u2014was extremist. Whereas criminal investigators reportedly claimed that Stepanenko was in possession of \"Wahhabi\" literature (a term widely and loosely used in the country to denote Islamic extremism), President Putin stated that \"Wahhabism in itself does not pose any threat.\"\n\nIn February 2006 local police in Kabardino-Balkariya started compiling a list of \"Wahhabis\" by going to educational institutions and noting the names of students who prayed regularly. Under the new government in that region, however, pressure against Muslims seemed to diminish.\n\nIn October 2005, following a dispute between the ROAC and the ROC over the ownership of St. Olga's Church (see Restrictions section), three armed men beat and attempted to kidnap the ROAC Metropolitan from his home. The FSB reportedly interrogated and threatened several ROAC clergy and members following this incident.\n\nThroughout 2005 tensions increased in Kabardino-Balkariya between Islamists and police. Police closed a large number of mosques, especially in areas declared \"liberated\" by Islamist militants. In October 2005, local militants joined Islamic militants loyal to the Chechen fighter Shamil Basayev and attacked and occupied government and police buildings in Nalchik. Several hundred militants were killed; many of the bodies have still not been returned to their families. Government officials said they arrested more than 60 persons on suspicion of participating in raids, while human rights groups claimed the number of detainees was higher and that most of them were not involved in the unrest.\n\nFollowing the 2004 hostage-taking in Beslan, police stepped up activity in the North Caucasus. Authorities allegedly charged increasing numbers of Muslims, both Russian citizens and citizens of the predominantly Muslim states bordering the country, with extremism. The NGO Memorial described 23 cases involving more than 80 individuals charged with extremism as \"trumped-up.\" Of these, 18 resulted in verdicts, only 1 of which was an acquittal.\n\nAccording to the Sova Center, on April 19, 2005, police briefly detained and interrogated nine female students in Kabardino-Balkariya for wearing the hijab and studying the Qur'an as a group.\n\nWhile most detentions for religious practices were of Muslims, there were occasional reports of short-term police detentions of non-Muslims on religious grounds, but such incidents were generally resolved quickly. For example, local police frequently detained missionaries for brief periods throughout the country or asked them to cease their proselytizing activities, regardless of whether they were actually in violation of local statutes. During the reporting period, the Jehovah's Witnesses reported approximately 55 incidents, 21 of which took place in Moscow, in which authorities briefly detained their members or other citizens who were conducting lawful preaching activities.\n\nIn Vladimir Oblast, authorities inspected the property owned by the ROAC several times. In January 2006, FSB representatives seized about 20 files with documentation on ROAC ownership without informing ROAC leaders or giving any reasons.\n\nAs of now{{when|date=September 2018}} there are several religious prisoners including a Dutch man.\n\n===Forced religious conversion===\nThere were no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]].\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\n{{main|Antisemitism in Russia}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{multiple issues |1=\n{{single source|date=September 2018}}\n{{update|date=September 2018}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2018}}\n{{tone|date=September 2018}}\n}}\n\n[[Russia]], the prominence and authority of various religious groups is closely tied to the country's political situation. In the 10th century, [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir I]], who was converted by missionaries from Byzantium, embraced [[Christianity]] as the official Russian religion. For approximately 1,000 years thereafter, [[Russian Orthodoxy]] became the country\u2019s primary denomination.  \n\nAlthough the constitution of the former [[Soviet Union]] nominally guaranteed religious freedom, religious activities were greatly constrained and membership in religious organizations was considered incompatible with membership in the Communist Party. Thus, overt claims of religious beliefs was a hindrance to individual advancement. While open expression of Christian beliefs was permitted during [[World War II]], because the government sought the support of Christians and Jews in the fight against fascism, restrictions were re-imposed when the war ended. \n\n\nIn the 1980s, under the reformist regime of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a policy of [[glasnost]] ({{lang-en|openness}}) was declared, allowing greater tolerance for the unrestricted practice of religion. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], religious freedom was made a reality and revealed that large segments of the population continued to practice a variety of faiths. Russian nationalists who emerged in the 1990s identified the Russian Orthodox church as a major element of Russian culture.\n\nThe Russian government has a number of laws against religious extremism and foreign funding of [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organizations]] including the [[Yarovaya Law]], that can be used to restrict the practices of religious minorities, such as [[evangelism]] or the importation of foreign religious literature. Critics of these laws argue that the Russian government gives priority to the Russian Orthodox Church, making it into an unofficial state church.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article3172785.ece ''President Putin and the patriarchs''.] by Michael Bourdeaux, ''[[The Times]]'', January 11, 2008.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/world/europe/24church.html?_r=1&scp=4&sq=russia&st=nyt&oref=slogin Clifford J.

Some federal agencies, such as the [[Federal Service for State Registration, Cadastre and Cartography|Federal Registration Service]], and many local authorities, continued to restrict the rights of a few religious minorities. Legal obstacles to registration under a complex 1997 [[Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations]] (the 1997 Law stating [[Orthodox Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and [[Buddhism]] as traditional religions) continued to seriously disadvantage some religious groups considered nontraditional. There were indications that the security services, including the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB), treated the leadership of some Islamic groups as security threats.\n\nThere were reports of [[societal abuses]] and [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice. Religious matters were not a source of social tension or problems for the large majority of citizens, but there were some problems between majority and minority groups.\n\nResistance against non-Orthodox religions were behind manifestations of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and occasional friction with non-Orthodox Christian denominations. Conservative activists claiming ties to the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) occasionally disseminated negative publications and held protest meetings against religions considered nontraditional, including alternative Orthodox congregations. Some ROC clergy stated publicly their opposition to any expansion of the presence of Roman Catholics, Protestants, and other non-Orthodox denominations.\n\n==Religious demography==\n{{Main|Religion in Russia}}\n\nThe country has an area of {{convert|17098242|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of 142.8 million. In practice, only a minority of citizens actively participated in any religion. Many who identified themselves as members of a faith rarely participated in religious life or not at all. There is no single set of reliable statistics that breaks down the population by denomination, and the statistics below are compiled from government, polling, and religious group sources.\n\nApproximately 100 million citizens consider themselves Russian Orthodox Christians, although the vast majority are not regular churchgoers. The largest religious minority is formed by 14 to 23&nbsp;million [[Muslim]]s, most of whom live in the Volga-Urals region and the [[North Caucasus]], although [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], and parts of [[Siberia]] and [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]] have sizable Muslim populations. The Buddhist Association of Russia estimated that there were between 1.5 and 2&nbsp;million [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], who live in the traditionally Buddhist regions of [[Buryatiya]], [[Tuva]], and [[Kalmykia|Kalmykiya]]. According to the Slavic Center for Law and Justice, [[Protestantism|Protestants]] make up the second-largest group of Christian believers, with 3,500 registered organizations and more than 2&nbsp;million followers. There are an estimated 600,000 Jews (0.4% of the population), the vast majority of which live in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The [[Catholic Church]] estimated that there are 600,000 Catholics, most of whom are not ethnic Russians. In Yakutiya and [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]], [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and nature-based religions are practiced independently or alongside other religions.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Ombudsman [[Vladimir Lukin]]'s annual report, the Ministry of Justice had registered 22,956 religious organizations as of January 1, 2007, 443 more than in January 2006. Among the registered religious groups are Russian Orthodox, Orthodox Old Believers, Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish, Evangelical Christians, Catholic, and other denominations.\n\n==Status of religious freedom==\n===Legal and policy framework===\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice; however, in some cases the authorities imposed restrictions on certain groups, most often through the registration process. The Constitution also provides for the equality of all religions before the law and the separation of church and state; however, the Government did not always respect this provision.\n\nIn November 2006, the Government eliminated the value-added tax on religious products sold by religious organizations.\n\n===The 1997 Law===\nThe [[Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations]] ({{a.k.a.}} the 1997 Law) declares all religions equal before the law, prohibits government interference in religion, and establishes simple registration procedures for religious groups. The country is by law a secular state without a state religion. The preamble to the 1997 Law, however, acknowledges Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and other religions as constituting an inseparable part of the country's historical heritage and also recognized the \"special contribution\" of Orthodoxy to the country's history and to the establishment and development of its spirituality and culture.\n\nThe 1997 Law creates three categories of religious communities (groups, local organizations, and centralized organizations) with different levels of legal status and privileges.\n\nThe most basic unit is the \"religious group\" which has the right to conduct worship services and rituals and to teach religion to its members. A group is not registered with the Government and consequently does not have the legal status to open a bank account, own property, issue invitations to foreign guests, publish literature, receive tax benefits, or conduct worship services in [[prison]]s, state-owned hospitals, and the armed forces. However, individual members of a group may buy property for the group's use, invite personal guests to engage in religious instruction, and import religious material. In principle, members of unregistered groups are thus able to rent public spaces and hold services, but in practice, they sometimes encountered significant difficulty in doing so.\n\nThe next level is the \"local religious organization\", which can be registered if it has at least 10 citizen members and is either a branch of a centralized organization or has existed in the locality as a religious group for at least 15 years. Local religious organizations have legal status and may open bank accounts, own property, issue invitation letters to foreign guests, publish literature, enjoy tax benefits, and conduct worship services in prisons, state-owned hospitals, and the armed forces.\n\n\"Centralized religious organizations\" can be registered by joining at least three local organizations of the same denomination. In addition to all the legal rights enjoyed by local organizations, centralized organizations also have the right to open new local organizations without any waiting period. Centralized organizations that have existed in the country for more than 50 years have the right to use the words \"Russia\" or \"Russian\" in their official names.\n\nThe 1997 Law gives officials the authority to ban religious groups and thereby prohibit all of the activities of a religious community. Following the passage of the law, groups that failed to re-register by December 31, 2000, became subject to legal dissolution (often translated as \"liquidation\"), i.e., deprivation of juridical status.\n\n====NGO Law====\nThe 2006 Law on Public Associations (NGO or NPO Law) contains a few provisions that apply to religious organizations.\n\nThe NGO law grants the Ministry of Justice the authority to obtain certain documents, to send its representatives (with advance notice) to attend religious organization events, and to conduct an annual review of the organization's compliance with its registered mission statement. Religious organizations are required to inform the Federal Registration Service (FRS) of changes in leadership or address within 3 days of the changes taking effect. The law allows FRS to file suit against organizations that fail to comply with the law's requirements. If a court finds in favor of FRS, then the organization may be closed down. In addition, a contemporaneous amendment to the Civil Code may affect religious organizations, but the effect of this amendment and all other amendments remains to be seen. Some denominations with numerous local organizations feared that compliance with these changes would be highly burdensome.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses reported that federal officials used the NGO Law to investigate their headquarters, and that government officials told them the investigation was launched on the basis of this law.\n\nUnder the NGO law, religious organizations have new reporting requirements. These reporting requirements are extensive, and many NGOs and religious groups complained about the time and effort needed to complete them. The required reporting includes information about \"organized events and activities\" and accounts of funds received from international and foreign organizations, foreign citizens, and stateless persons. This generates difficulties for reporting anonymous donors. Failure to file reports and complete them adequately can result in warnings that may lead to the organization being closed down.\n\nAfter lobbying by many religious groups, including the ROC, the Government reduced the reporting requirements for all religious organizations and extended the financial reporting deadline of the NGO Law to June 1. Russian organizations are no longer asked whether they receive income from Russian individuals or the Russian state. Although each organization must still supply full names, addresses, and passport details of members belonging to its governing body, they no longer have to provide details of religious congresses, conferences or governing body meetings, including the number of participants. The accounting procedures have been significantly simplified.\n\nWhile neither the constitution nor the 1997 Law grants explicit privileges or advantages to the four \"traditional\" religions, in practice the ROC cooperates more closely with the Government than do other faiths. The ROC has entered into a number of formal and informal agreements with various government ministries that give the ROC far greater access than other religious groups to public institutions such as schools, hospitals, prisons, the police, and the army. ROC activities with the Government include support for the psychological rehabilitation of servicemen returning from conflict zones, the holding of religious services for those serving in conflict zones, and cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs to combat extremism.\n\nThe ROC has special arrangements with government agencies to conduct religious education and to provide spiritual counseling. These include agreements with the Ministries of Education, Defense, Health, Internal Affairs, and Emergency Situations, and other bodies, such as the Federal Tax Service, Federal Border Service, and Main Department of Cossack Forces. Not all of the details of these agreements were accessible, but available information indicated that the ROC received preferential treatment.\n\nOfficials in [[law enforcement]] and the legislative branches spoke of protecting the \"spiritual security\" of the country by discouraging the growth of \"[[sect]]s\" and \"[[cult]]s\", usually understood to include some Protestant and newer religious movements. In January 2007, the Moscow City Prosecutor warned of the danger posed by extremist and dangerous new religious movements entering the country, and promised tough measures to stop their activities. To date, no such measures have been proposed or implemented.\n\nThe National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, last updated in 2000, states that \"ensuring national security includes countering the negative influence of foreign religious organizations and missionaries.\"\n\nRepresentative offices of foreign religious organizations are required to register with state authorities, and they may not conduct services or other religious activities unless they have acquired the status of a group or organization. In practice, many foreign religious representative offices opened without registering or were accredited to a registered religious organization.\n\n[[Moscow City Duma|The Moscow City Duma]] is proposing a law that would prohibit \"religion agitation\" in public. Administrative punishment for violations under this article would be approximately $4\u201320 (100-500 rubles).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe regions of [[Kabardino-Balkariya]] and [[Dagestan]] have laws banning extremist Islamic \"[[Wahhabism]]\", but there were no reports that authorities invoked these laws to deny registration to Muslim groups. However, the former president of the Kabardino-Balkaria republic ordered the closure of six of seven [[mosques]] in [[Nalchik]], the region's capital. The new president of the region has reopened one mosque and announced plans to reopen another.\n\nOfficials of the Presidential Administration, regions, and localities maintain consultative mechanisms to facilitate government interaction with religious communities and to monitor application of the 1997 Law. At the national level, groups interact with a special governmental commission on religion, which includes representatives from law enforcement bodies and government ministries. On broader policy questions, religious groups continued to deal with the Presidential Administration through the Presidential Council on Cooperation with Religious Associations. The broad-based Council is composed of members of the Presidential Administration, secular academic specialists on religious affairs, and representatives of traditional and major nontraditional groups. Other governmental bodies for religious affairs include a Governmental Commission for the Affairs of Religious Associations, headed by the Minister of Culture and Mass Communications.\n\nAvenues for interaction with regional and local authorities also exist. The offices of some of the seven Plenipotentiary Presidential Representatives (Polpreds) include suboffices that address social and religious issues. Regional administrations and many municipal administrations also have designated officials for liaison with religious organizations. Religious minorities most often encounter problems at the regional level.\n\nThe Russian Academy of State Service works with religious freedom advocates, such as the Slavic Center for Law and Justice, to train regional and municipal officials in properly implementing the 1997 Law. The Academy opens many of its conferences to international audiences.\n\nThe Office of Federal Human Rights Ombudsman [[Vladimir Lukin]] has a department for religious freedom issues, which receives and responds to complaints. The Ombudsman's Office receives 200\u2013250 religious freedom complaints annually, which represents thousands of alleged individual violations. The Office has determined that approximately 75 percent of these cases represent genuine violations of religious freedoms guaranteed under the law.\n\nContradictions between federal and local laws, and varying interpretations of the law, were used by some regional officials to restrict the activities of religious minorities. According to many observers, local governments are more susceptible to pressure from the local religious majority and therefore are more likely to discriminate against local minority religious communities. Many localities appeared to implement their own policies with very little federal interference. When the federal Government intervenes in local cases, it works through the Procuracy, Ministry of Justice, Presidential Administration, and the courts. The federal Government only occasionally intervened to prevent or reverse discrimination at the local level.\n\nIn July 2006, the country hosted the World Summit of Religious Leaders, where [[Vladimir Putin|President Putin]] spoke to the participants about increasing religious tolerance. Officials met regularly during the reporting period with leaders of several faiths, including Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities.\n\nThe federal Government does not require religious instruction in schools, but it continues to allow public use of school buildings after hours for the ROC to provide religious instruction on a voluntary basis. Several regions offer a course on Orthodoxy in public schools, and five regions ([[Kaluga]], [[Tver]], [[Bryansk]], [[Smolensk]], and [[Voronezh]]) have a mandatory class on the Fundamentals of Orthodox Culture. The [[Belgorod Oblast]] voluntary course can be avoided only if the parents themselves provide and pay for an alternative course. The course is offered as an elective in several other regions. In regions where the class is not mandatory, in practice students may be compelled to take it where schools do not provide alternatives. Minister of Education [[Andrei Fursenko|Andrey Fursenko]] warned against these lessons, and he proposed instead a course on \"world religions\" or on Orthodoxy. Fursenko's proposal remained controversial among some experts, including some in the ROC. Some regions offer a class on \"History of Religion\", a proposal that Fursenko suggested but did not introduce nationally. The Ministry of Education rejected continued publication and dissemination of a textbook that detailed Orthodox Christianity's contribution to the country's culture, with descriptions of some minority religions that members of those religions found objectionable; for example, the text's stance on Jews, certain non-traditional denominations, and foreigners is considered problematic by some. Some schools continued to use the text.\n\nThere is a universal [[military draft]] for men, but the Constitution provides for alternative service for those who refuse to bear arms for reasons of conscience. The length of alternative service is longer than the standard military service. The standard length of military service is 18 months, alternative service in a Ministry of Defense agency is 27 months, and alternative service in a nondefense agency is 31.5 months. Some human rights groups have complained that the extended length of service for draftees requesting alternative assignments acts as a punishment for those who exercise their convictions.\n\nIn July 2006, a new law came into effect that repeals deferrals for students of religious training institutions. The law was protested by many religious groups, including the ROC.\n\n====Extremism laws====\n\nThe 2002 Law on Extremism, amended in July 2006, can affect religious groups, particularly Muslim groups, by criminalizing a broad spectrum of activities. For example, Mansur Shangareev was convicted of extremism and sentenced to 2 years in prison for \"actively adhering to a radical trend of Islam\" that claimed superiority over mainstream Islam, and for making \"remarks to Muslim girls about their immodest dress\", among other things.\n\nThe 2006 amendments allow some charges of extremism where people are alleged to have defended or expressed sympathy with other individuals already charged with extremism.\n\nLaws against extremism have been tightened over time. The 2016 [[Yarovaya Law]], named after politician [[Irina Yarovaya]], extends the legal restrictions against extremism to include evangelism by minority faiths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-yarovaya-law-religious-freedom-restrictions/27852531.html|title=Russia's 'Yarovaya Law' Imposes Harsh New Restrictions On Religious Groups|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-to-bolster-russian-surveillance-angering-edward-snowden/2016/07/07/4d307aca-443e-11e6-a76d-3550dba926ac_story.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2016/july/russia-ban-evangelism-effect.html|title=Russia's Ban on Evangelism Is Now in Effect|first=Sarah Eekhoff|last=Zylstra|website=News & Reporting|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://religionnews.com/2016/07/11/u-s-churches-to-russia-were-not-leaving/|title=Churches to Russia: We\u2019re not leaving|date=July 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn May 5, 2015, customs authorities in Russia seized a shipment of religious literature containing Ossetian-language Bibles published by Jehovah's Witnesses.

In the first three cases, religious communities rely upon government officials to grant them permission to assemble, own, or build property, or allow people into the country.\n\nMany of the difficulties that religious communities face are rooted in bureaucratic obstacles and [[corruption]], not religious bigotry. While it is nearly impossible to discern if groups are being targeted because of their religious beliefs or because they are vulnerable to demands by corrupt officials, the net effect is a restriction on their ability to worship.\n\n====Registration====\nFollowing the 1997 Law's registration deadline of December 31, 2001, the Ministry of Justice began to legally dissolve approximately 2,000 organizations that had not re-registered, sometimes over the complaints of groups who claimed that they were still active. Complaints of involuntary dissolution have decreased as this wave of dissolutions has passed, and only a few remain to be contested in court.{{update inline|date=September 2018}}\n\nDue to legal restrictions, poor administrative procedures on the part of some local authorities or disputes between religious organizations, an unknown number of groups have been unable to register. Some religious groups registered as social organizations because they were unable to do so as religious organizations.\n\nIn June 2007, a St. Petersburg Court suspended and ordered The Scientology Centre in St. Petersburg to close. The Centre had refused to allow government officials to sit in on confidential \"auditing\" sessions and did not hand over confidential documents from these sessions when requested. Government authorities claimed to have a right to these inspections and documents under the new NGO law. The Centre continued to operate at the end of the period covered by this report.{{clarify|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe [[Unification Church]] was contesting the refusal of officials to re-register three local organizations. The Unification Church alleged that its registration process had been complicated by the requirements imposed by a broad range of government agencies, including the fire safety office, tax inspectors, and epidemiological inspectors. The Church also reported that federal authorities investigated its compliance with visa rules, and scrutinized missionaries' activities and property holdings.\n\nLocal authorities continued an investigation of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center\u2014their national headquarters in St. Petersburg\u2014in what the Jehovah's Witnesses described as a search for an excuse to shut down their operations. The authorities indicated to the Jehovah's Witnesses that any irregularity they found would be used as grounds to close the center. On February 16, 2007, the center wrote to the Prosecutor General's Office expressing concern over the investigations, which had continued for more than 2 years. The St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman of the Russian Federation sent replies stating that the investigators had not exceeded their authority and had not violated the law.\n\nAs of December 2006, the Federal Registration Service had registered 407 Jehovah's Witnesses local organizations in 72 regions, but problems with registration continued in some areas, notably Moscow, where the Moscow Golovinskiy Intermunicipal District Court and the Moscow City Court (of appeal) have banned them since 2004. The Moscow community appealed the ban to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR).\n\nIn June 2006, the FRS branch in [[Novosibirsk]] used the NGO law and found that a local [[Pentecostal church]], the Word of Life, violated its charter by organizing a show in a Siberian military unit. The FRS sent a written notification to the church stating that if they violated their charter again, the FRS would file a suit to close the church.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) unanimously ruled against the Government on three religious freedom cases involving the registration of the [[Salvation Army]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and the [[Church of Scientology]]. In all three cases, the court unanimously determined that the Government violated its international obligations under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Other religious freedom cases against the Government were pending at the ECHR.\n\nIn ''Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia'', the ECHR ruled in October 2006 that the Government's refusal to re-register the Moscow branch of the organization violated the right of assembly and freedom of religion of the Salvation Army. The Government paid $13,418 (10,000 euros) in damages and legal fees to the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army cannot re-register its Moscow branch, as the deadline for re-registration under the 1997 Religions Law was May 2000. They may only be re-registered by the Moscow Chief Directorate of the Ministry of Justice. It was the Chief Directorate that designated the Salvation Army as a paramilitary organization, and successfully argued in court that this prevented re-registration. The Supreme Court did not address this designation, nor did they remove it.\n\nIn the Jehovah's Witnesses case, Kuznetsov and Others v. Russia, the ECHR ruled in January 2007 that Chelyabinsk authorities had violated the rights of the Chelyabinsk Jehovah's Witnesses when they disrupted a worship meeting in 2000. The court ordered the Government to pay $121,486 (90,544 euros) to the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nIn the Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia, the ECHR ruled that Moscow authorities violated the religious freedom rights of the Church of Scientology under the European Convention on Human Rights by refusing to re-register their Moscow church. The Scientologists had applied to re-register 11 times with no success. The Government did not appeal, and the decision is final.\n\nLocal authorities refused to register Scientology centers as religious organizations in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia|Dmitrovgrad]], [[Izhevsk]], and other localities. Since these centers have not been in existence for 15 years, they are by law ineligible to register as religious organizations and cannot perform religious services (although they were allowed to hold meetings and seminars). The Churches of Scientology in Surgut City and [[Nizhnekamsk]] (Tatarstan) filed suits with the ECHR contesting the refusal of officials to register the churches based on the 15-year rule. The ECHR found the suits admissible in June 2005 and combined the cases. The case awaited a final decision, which the Church of Scientology expected by the end of 2007.{{update inline|date=September 2018}}\n\nAccording to FRS statistics, there are 22,956 registered religious groups operating in the country, approximately half of which are affiliated with the ROC. In 2005, the last year for which statistics are available, authorities investigated the activities of 3,526 religious organizations during the 2005 calendar year. The Ministry of Justice sent notifications of violations to 2,996 religious organizations. The courts made decisions to liquidate 59 local organizations for violations of constitutional norms and federal legislation during that period.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses alleged in some cases that authorities had consulted with the ROC in determining whether to approve their requests for registration.\n\nMany religious groups had difficulty acquiring land or permits to build houses of worship. Some local governments prevented religious groups from using venues suitable for large gatherings such as cinemas and government facilities.\n\nSome religious groups, particularly Jehovah's Witnesses, but also the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), Pentecostal congregations, and the Evangelical Christian Missionary Union, reported that local authorities in recent years denied them permission to acquire land on which to construct places of worship. Authorities continued to deny construction permits to several groups.\n\nMany non-traditional denominations frequently complained that they were unable to obtain venues for worship. Because they are small and often newly established, they often lacked the necessary resources to buy or rent facilities on the open market and must rely on government assistance. Because they are nontraditional, they frequently met opposition from the traditional communities and often were unable to find government officials who were willing to assist them in renting state-owned property. There were multiple reports of religious organizations who were not allowed to renew leases on public and private buildings. Increased competition for space in a growing economy and increasing real estate prices led many owners (public and private) to lease property to higher-paying clients, and in some cases, religious groups were refused outright at any price.\n\nRepresentatives of multiple Protestant groups spoke about increasing difficulty in extending existing leases or signing new leases for worship premises, the majority of which are still state-controlled. For example, administrations in Tikhoretsk and Volgograd refused to extend rental agreements with member churches of the Union of Christian Evangelical Missionaries, which used the spaces for worship.\n\nThe Word of Life Christian Church in Kaluga region faced great difficulties trying to build its church. The Church had been frequently visited by tax, fire, and other government inspectors. In December 2006, the mayor issued a decree to confiscate the Church's building and land, which would then be given to a foreign commercial developer. The Church's appeals to the governor, prosecutor, and police were unsuccessful, although the property had not been confiscated.\n\nThe NGO Sova Center reported at the end of the reporting period{{when|date=September 2018}} that the Vladimir Muslim community still was not able to obtain public land to build a mosque. In 2004, despite interference from the Vladimir city authorities, the congregation constructed a mosque on private land near a house that community members bought and used as a temporary prayer house. The mosque was called a community house and was used by the local community of Muslims even though it did not have room for all 25,000 members.\n\nThe [[Sochi]] mayor's office continued to deny the Muslim community authorization to build a new mosque; the current premises insufficiently accommodate the membership. Officials allotted land several times but never transferred it to the Muslim community. According to the regional government, authorities can allocate land for a mosque only after a public opinion survey indicates that the proposed location would not cause conflict. In March 2007 [[Abdul-Vahed Niyazov|Abdul-Vakhed Niyazov]], Chairman of the Sochi Russian Islamic Cultural Center, asked Presidential Representative to the Southern Federal District [[Dmitry Kozak|Dmitriy Kozak]] to investigate.\n\nOn 14 May, 2007, at a public hearing in the city of [[Murmansk]], residents of the central city district voted to refuse the Jehovah's Witnesses permission to build a church in the city's downtown area. Mayor [[Mikhail Savchenko]] issued a statement noting that even though it was his preference that new places of worship be built outside of the city center, he regretted the lack of tolerance shown at the public hearing. Jehovah's witnesses in [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dezershinsk]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] failed to obtain land for constructing a building of worship.\n\nReligious news sources claimed that authorities acting on behalf of the ROC sometimes prevented Orthodox churches not belonging to the ROC, including the True Orthodox, from obtaining or maintaining buildings for worship. In 2005 a church reconstructed and renovated by the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church (ROAC) was transferred to the ROC Diocese of Stavropol. The subsequent protest by the ROAC culminated in the beating of Metropolitan Valentin (see the Abuse section) and threats to other ROAC clergy. The Zheleznogorsk City Administration subsequently promised to allot a new building to the ROAC, but had not done so by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThere was an ongoing conflict between the Moscow [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] and the Government regarding allocating a plot of land for worship. In the first half of 2007, Moscow City authorities rescinded their allotment of land for the construction of a Krishna temple in the Moscow city center and instead allotted the Krishnas {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land in the Moscow suburbs.\n\nSince Richen Ling, a Tibetan Buddhist community, lost its Moscow city center premises in 2004 due to a municipal construction project, it continued to rent facilities since it has been unable to secure a permanent house of worship.\n\nThe Unification Church reported difficulties in establishing a Eurasian Church Center in Moscow to coordinate church activities in the region. The authorities would not allow the church building to be occupied until an annex illegally built by the former owner was legalized. The church estimated that the building would remain closed for 2 years until all the necessary documentation was done.\n\nLocal officials have refused permission to build to a Catholic parish in [[Barnaul]] (Altai Region) and to a Muslim community in Sochi for more than 10 years.\n\nThe Church of Scientology reported that it sometimes had difficulties getting permits for large events in Moscow.\n\nIn October 2006 local authorities in [[Tyumen]] destroyed a building that was intended to house a mosque. The Muslim community had spent years working to receive ownership of the building, which had been a mosque before the 1917 revolution. The authorities had decided to give the building to the Muslim community earlier that year.\n\nIn June 2006, the city of [[Krasnodar]] demanded the demolition of a private home intended to host worship for an Evangelical group. The lower court upheld the city's decision. A court appeal was pending.\n\nIn January 2006, the district court in [[Astrakhan]] ordered the demolition of a mosque on an access road to the city. The construction of the mosque had been allowed by the mayor in 1998, but officials argued in 2006 that the land was zoned residential, that the mosque was illegally built, and that the community must demolish it. Following the failure of their appeal to the Russian Supreme Court, which upheld the demolition order and held the Muslim community must pay for the demolition itself, the Muslim community appealed to the ECHR, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nThe Emmanuel Pentecostal Church continued to face difficulties building its church in Moscow. The old House of Culture, which the Emmanuel church wants to convert into a prayer house and office building, sits on land that the local land committee agreed to rent to the church. Other local authorities opposed to that location for the church have up the registration of the land title, some on grounds that local public opinion is against the religious community involved. They refused to allow the building to be reconstructed as a church. On March 26, 2007, arsonists set the building on fire.\n\nThe 1997 Law appeared to change the visa regime for religious and other foreign workers. Immediately after its implementation, nontraditional groups reported problems receiving long-term visas.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the number of foreign religious personnel experiencing visa and customs difficulties while entering or leaving the country decreased, although some problems continued. Authorities have deported or denied entry to religious workers with valid visas in the past. The Unification Church in Moscow appealed the January 2006 deportation of its founder and legal/spiritual advisor, Jack Corley, to the ECHR. By law he must remain outside of the country for at least 5 years, at which point he can reapply for residence. The ECHR appeal joined two similar cases involving deportations of Unification Church foreign missionaries. A member of the Japanese Unification Church invited to Ufa to make a presentation was detained by FSB officers and forced to buy tickets to Moscow for himself and an FSB officer for onward deportation to Japan. He appealed the deportation and won the right to re-enter.\n\nIn June 2007 the Government threatened to deport three Falun Gong followers to c, where they could face official persecution. The UN High Commission on Refugees arranged to have these practitioners resettled to other countries. On March 28, 2007, officials deported a Falun Gong follower and her young daughter to [[China]].\n\nIn December 2006, a Moscow court rejected the appeal against deportation of [[Sunday Adelaja]], a leader of the Ukrainian \"Embassy of God.\" The court found Adelaja's deportation to be \"in the interests of state security.\" In May 2006, while traveling to Moscow in order to participate in a television program, Adelaja had been denied entry at a Moscow airport, despite having a multiple-entry visa.\n\nVisa problems decreased for some groups. Groups such as the LDS and Roman Catholic churches, among others, reported that the Government issued most of their clergy 1-year visas that may be extended to 5-year visas after they have entered the country. They reported that the administration of the visas had improved since the last reporting period. Foreign clergy are particularly important for the Roman Catholic Church, since there are few ordained Russian priests. Catholic authorities reported a decrease in visa problems for priests during the period covered by this report.\n\nMany religious groups were unable to regain property confiscated in the Soviet era and to acquire new property. The SOVA Center said the property problem was most prevalent among Muslims and Protestants.\n\nAlthough authorities have returned many properties used for religious services, including churches, [[synagogues]], and mosques, all four traditional religions continued to pursue restitution cases. As of May 2007, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade was preparing legislation on returning most religious property (except for a few cultural and historical treasures) to its pre-1917 owners.\n\nThe ROC appeared to have greater success reclaiming prerevolutionary property than other groups, although it still had disputed property claims. At the end of the reporting period, the Moscow Diocese of the ROC owned more than 1,400 buildings, up from 130 in 1998.\n\nProperty claims for the ROC are legally complicated, since there was no separation of church and state before the revolution. Most of the Orthodox church buildings that were returned to the ROC were not considered ROC property before 1917. The ROC was only entitled to use these buildings and theoretically could have been evicted, but there was no attempt to do so. The ROC fully owned only churches built, bought, or received after 1991.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Community reported 44 disputed properties, including the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Cathedral in Moscow. While most state-owned property was returned, the community had no success with buildings that had been privatized. The community continued to work with authorities in the federal and local levels to resolve these issues.\n\nMuslims in Beslan appealed to the Presidential Council for Cooperation with Religious Associations for the return of its Cathedral Mosque.\n\nThe Jewish community was still seeking the return of a number of synagogues and cultural and religious artifacts. The Federation of Jewish Communities reported that federal officials had been cooperative in the community's efforts to seek restitution of former synagogues, as had some regional officials, although some Jews asserted that the Government had returned only a small portion of the total properties confiscated during the Soviet period. The international Chabad Lubavitch organization repeatedly sought return of the Schneerson Collection, a large collection of revered religious books and documents of the Lubavitcher rebbes, which the authorities consider part of the country's cultural heritage.\n\nSome human rights groups and religious minorities accused the Procurator General of encouraging legal action against a number of minority religions and of giving official support to materials that are biased against Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, the LDS, and others. There were credible reports that individuals within the federal security services and other law enforcement agencies harassed certain minority religious groups, investigated them for purported criminal activity and violations of tax laws, and pressured landlords to renege on contracts. In some cases the security services were thought to have influenced the Ministry of Justice to reject registration applications.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Kabardino-Balkariya reportedly kept lists of students who said Muslim prayers, had Muslim middle names, or who sent clips with Islamic themes through their mobile phones. During the reporting period, the Sova Center reported that in general the pressure on Muslims in Kabardino-Balkariya dropped with the appointment of the republic's new leadership.\n\nA school principal in [[Argayashsky District|Argayash]] allegedly forced a member of the Pentecostal church to resign from her kindergarten teaching post or else face criminal charges of maltreating children. Local news reports cited complaints from parents that implied that the teacher had been teaching about religion and alleged that she had physically mistreated them. Church officials maintained that these charges were fabricated and that she was actually removed due to her religious beliefs.\n\nIn June 2007 officials in the city of [[Uzlovaya]] banned a [[Christian music festival]] organized by local [[Baptist churches]]. The officials originally gave permission for the festival but revoked it after reportedly receiving phone calls from the local FSB. The mayor reportedly claimed not to have known that the festival was a religious event.\n\nIn May 2007 local authorities in the town of [[Revda, Murmansk Oblast]] ordered the closure of a Pentecostal drug and alcohol rehabilitation center for the homeless. Two members of the town council and a local Russian Orthodox priest first organized public opposition to the center and held a screening of a negative film about Pentecostals. Pentecostals were not invited to the public hearing that decided the issue; they showed up nonetheless and were booed by the approximately 800 participants. The town council then voted to close the center. The Pentecostals planned to appeal the matter to a court.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, a court found Viktor Tanakov, high priest of the ethnic Mari faith, guilty of incitement to religious and ethnic hatred for having written and distributed a brochure entitled \"The Priest Speaks\", which describes all world religions as \"demonic.\" He lost his appeal to the Supreme Court on March 21, 2007.\n\nIn June 2007 a Moscow district court published a ban on the works of [[Said Nurs\u00ee|Said Nursi]], a Turkish pacifist Islamic theologian. The ban, which was being appealed, was condemned by religious and human rights leaders. [[Ravil Gainutdin]], Chairman of the [[Russian Council of Muftis]], wrote an open letter to President Putin describing the Risale-i Nur ban as \"a crude violation of freedom of conscience in our country.\" Vladimir Lukin, the Human Rights Ombudsman, denounced the ban, saying that Nursi's works contained no trace of religious hatred or intolerance. In an open letter to the court, Lukin wrote that \"It is very important that we do not allow interference in the convictions and beliefs of millions of citizens on the poorly grounded, unproven pretext of fighting against extremism, as this really could provoke wide-scale violations of their right to freedom of belief.\"\n\nThere has been a trend of senior government officials showing support for those religious leaders who endorse them; this can lead to indirect discrimination. For example, in St. Petersburg, an Imam at Cathedral Mosque endorsed United Russia, which supported his plans for a second mosque in the city. At the same time, Muslims not part of Cathedral Mosque were unable to obtain permission to construct their own mosque in St. Petersburg. Governor [[Valentina Matviyenko]] noted in response to a letter of enquiry that this is in part because they are \"in a state of conflict\" with and \"follow a different trend of Islam\" from the Cathedral Mosque community.\n\nLocal authorities in St. Petersburg began an investigation of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center, their national headquarters, even before the 2006 NGO law's implementing regulations were published. The authorities indicated that any irregularity they found would cause them to close the center. Federal and local authorities continued their investigations of the center in 2007. On February 16, 2007, the center wrote to the Prosecutor General's Office, expressing concern over the investigations, which had continued for more than 2 years. The St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman sent replies stating that the investigators had not exceeded their authority and had not violated the law.\n\nThe Government in practice gave preference to the ROC. Authorities permitted Orthodox chapels and priests on army bases. Protestant groups had more limited access to military facilities, while authorities largely banned Islamic services in the military and generally did not give Muslim conscripts time for daily prayers or alternatives to pork-based meals. Some recruits serving in the army reported that fellow servicemen insulted and abused them because they were Muslim.\n\n===Abuses of religious freedom===\n{{POV section|date=February 2018}}\n\nAlthough there are several laws addressing crimes motivated by ethnic or religious hatred, law enforcement agencies enforced these laws in an inconsistent, generally infrequent, and sometimes arbitrary manner.\n\nAuthorities rarely prosecuted or sentenced those arrested for attacks and vandalism against religious minorities, and they often failed to bring hate-crime charges even when religious bigotry was clearly involved. Some government officials denied that there was a problem with [[hate crimes]], or if they did exist, they were manifestations of economic ills. Some government officials and human rights observers noted that, due to heavy caseloads, prosecutors chose to file easily proven charges of [[vandalism]] or [[hooliganism]] rather than risk an acquittal on the harder-to-prove hate-crime motive. The end result was that hate crime legislation was often not enforced.\n\nThe Government also used counter-terrorism to commit serious violations of religious freedom against the Muslim population. There were numerous cases of Muslims being prosecuted for extremism or terrorism even when they have no clear relation to such activities. These included individuals detained for possessing religious literature such as the [[Quran|Qur'an]], or on the basis of evidence allegedly planted by the police. Some people suspected by local police of [[Islamic extremism]] allegedly were subjected to torture and ill-treatment.\n\nAccording to human rights groups, a Supreme Court decision to ban 15 Muslim groups for alleged ties to international terrorism made it easier for officials to arbitrarily detain Muslims for alleged connections to these groups.\n\nOn 24 May, 2007, during an interethnic brawl in Stavropol between hundreds of Russian and Chechen youths, Gelani Ayatev was badly beaten and soon after died of his injuries. Zaurbek Akhmadov, an eyewitness, said that riot troops and local police cheered on [[skinheads]] as they physically assaulted Ayatev, who had been handcuffed. Police then put Ayatev, still in handcuffs, and Akhmadov, who had been shot in the leg by police as he tried to help Ayatev, in the back of a police vehicle. According to Akmadov, the police refused to allow medical attention for Ayatev or Akmadov for more than an hour, and in response to Akhmadov's cries to help Ayatev and bring him to a doctor, the policemen answered \"Don't worry. He won't be shouting Allah Akbar anymore.\"\n\nIn the case where a suspect threw a [[Molotov cocktail]] at a synagogue in [[Saratov]] in May 2007, police were investigating it as a case of \"hooliganism\" rather than as a hate crime, and had not apprehended any suspects. They declared it may not have been clear to the perpetrator that the building was a synagogue.\n\nIn Saratov at the beginning of April 2007, when a Jewish community member's home was targeted in an arson attack and [[graffiti]] reading \"kikes to Israel\" was written on a fence near the synagogue, police investigators classified these incidents as \"hooliganism\" and had not detained any suspects as of May.\n\nIn February 2007 the court gave light prison sentences to five teenagers who beat and fatally stabbed a Jewish man in October 2005, a murder motivated by ethnic hatred.\n\nThere were isolated instances in which local officials detained individuals who were publicly discussing their religious views, but usually authorities resolved these instances quickly.\n\nOn May 13 and 14, 2007 police arrested and detained 15 members of the Voskresenye Baptist community in Ivanovo, who were holding an event in a movie theater, distributing the New Testament and Book of Psalms. The organizers of the event had a written agreement with the theater. The reason given for the inspection appeared erroneous. The police tried to intimidate the detainees and urged them not to attend Baptist meetings, stating it was a \"harmful sect.\"\n\nOn March 31, 2006, residents of Novaya Adygeia village were prevented from going to their mosque for Friday prayers. Police and Adygeia militia blocked all the roads into the village, stopped cars, and searched Muslims. According to the Maykop mosque imam, police officers also allegedly assaulted and apprehended a group of young Muslims, including the imam; masked policemen dragged the group to minibuses and took them to the Interior Ministry's Anti-Organized Crime Department. The policemen beat and questioned them about why they wore beards and observed Islamic norms of hygiene. After the Muslims were detained for a night in prison, officials took them before a judge who ordered their immediate release. The NGOs Memorial and SOVA reported that government officials have harassed Muslims in Adygeia since summer 2005, including seizing religious literature, preventing congregants from attending Friday prayers, and warning them to stop attending the mosque.\n\nA complicated case regarding the disruption of an April 2006 meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow was still pending. In April 2006 the Lyublino Police Department of Moscow disrupted a religious meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses, and officers detained and interrogated 14 male leaders of the congregation, taking their passports. Police refused to provide written reasons for their detention, reportedly physically assaulted their attorney Vitaly Sinyukov when he went to the police station to assist them, and threatened him at knife-point not to file a complaint. In June 2006 a Moscow district court found the detention of the plaintiffs unlawful but dismissed the remainder of the suit because the Jehovah's Witnesses did not have legal permission to hold the meeting. Both the Jehovah's Witnesses and the police appealed the decision, and on March 22, 2007, the court reversed the June 2006 decision and ruled that the detention had in fact been lawful. The Moscow City Court refused to allow the ECHR judgment Kuznetsov v. Russia to be introduced as evidence in the case.\n\nVitaliy Sinyukov filed a suit against the Lyublino District Police Department. On April 20, 2006, the Lyublino District Court dismissed the complaint against the police without considering its merits. Sinyukov appealed, and on July 13, 2006, the Moscow City Court reversed the ruling and returned the case to the Lyublino District Court for consideration. On August 16, 2006, the Lyublino District Court again ruled to dismiss the case without considering its merits. Sinyukov appealed again, and on December 14, 2006, the Moscow City Court reversed the ruling in part and again returned the case to the Lyublino District Court for partial consideration of its merits. The case was pending at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn December 24, 2006, local police and officials from the Chelyabinsk Emergencies and Youth departments raided a Pentecostal service at a private house in Argayash and demanded documents relating to the property and church. Police Colonel Ramil Galilullin told the press that the reason for the raid was a complaint by local citizens that children attended the Pentecostal church without parental permission. Following the raid, the authorities also conducted a fire inspection and fined the church for incorrect use of a stove and defective wiring. The Chelyabinsk region public prosecutor opened an investigation into the actions of the authorities in February 2007.\n\nFrom July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006, the courts convicted 46 Muslims, 29 of whom were in prison, for membership in Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Courts gave Anton (Abdullah) Stepanenko, an imam in [[Pyatigorsk]] (Stavropol Region), a suspended sentence, partially for inciting religious hatred. Stepanenko's lawyer maintained that he was not permitted to order a psychiatric assessment of a key witness with a long history of mental illness, or to cross-examine scholars responsible for an expert analysis which alleged that Islamic literature\u2014with no proven link to Stepanenko personally\u2014was extremist. Whereas criminal investigators reportedly claimed that Stepanenko was in possession of \"Wahhabi\" literature (a term widely and loosely used in the country to denote Islamic extremism), President Putin stated that \"Wahhabism in itself does not pose any threat.\"\n\nIn February 2006 local police in Kabardino-Balkariya started compiling a list of \"Wahhabis\" by going to educational institutions and noting the names of students who prayed regularly. Under the new government in that region, however, pressure against Muslims seemed to diminish.\n\nIn October 2005, following a dispute between the ROAC and the ROC over the ownership of St. Olga's Church (see Restrictions section), three armed men beat and attempted to kidnap the ROAC Metropolitan from his home. The FSB reportedly interrogated and threatened several ROAC clergy and members following this incident.\n\nThroughout 2005 tensions increased in Kabardino-Balkariya between Islamists and police. Police closed a large number of mosques, especially in areas declared \"liberated\" by Islamist militants. In October 2005, local militants joined Islamic militants loyal to the Chechen fighter Shamil Basayev and attacked and occupied government and police buildings in Nalchik. Several hundred militants were killed; many of the bodies have still not been returned to their families. Government officials said they arrested more than 60 persons on suspicion of participating in raids, while human rights groups claimed the number of detainees was higher and that most of them were not involved in the unrest.\n\nFollowing the 2004 hostage-taking in Beslan, police stepped up activity in the North Caucasus. Authorities allegedly charged increasing numbers of Muslims, both Russian citizens and citizens of the predominantly Muslim states bordering the country, with extremism. The NGO Memorial described 23 cases involving more than 80 individuals charged with extremism as \"trumped-up.\" Of these, 18 resulted in verdicts, only 1 of which was an acquittal.\n\nAccording to the Sova Center, on April 19, 2005, police briefly detained and interrogated nine female students in Kabardino-Balkariya for wearing the hijab and studying the Qur'an as a group.\n\nWhile most detentions for religious practices were of Muslims, there were occasional reports of short-term police detentions of non-Muslims on religious grounds, but such incidents were generally resolved quickly. For example, local police frequently detained missionaries for brief periods throughout the country or asked them to cease their proselytizing activities, regardless of whether they were actually in violation of local statutes. During the reporting period, the Jehovah's Witnesses reported approximately 55 incidents, 21 of which took place in Moscow, in which authorities briefly detained their members or other citizens who were conducting lawful preaching activities.\n\nIn Vladimir Oblast, authorities inspected the property owned by the ROAC several times. In January 2006, FSB representatives seized about 20 files with documentation on ROAC ownership without informing ROAC leaders or giving any reasons.\n\nAs of now{{when|date=September 2018}} there are several religious prisoners including a Dutch man.\n\n===Forced religious conversion===\nThere were no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]].\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\n{{main|Antisemitism in Russia}}\nRacially motivated violent attacks against Jews decreased during the reporting period, despite an increase in racist violence targeting other ethnic groups. Anti-Semitism remained a serious problem, and there were several anti-Semitic attacks on persons and synagogues during the reporting period.\n\nIn September 2006, a court convicted of attempted murder and of inciting ethnic and religious strife, and sentenced to 16 years in prison, a man who stabbed eight persons during evening prayers in the Chabad synagogue in Moscow in January 2006. The assailant did not deny that anti-Semitism was a motive in his attack. The courts increased the 13-year sentence he received in April 2006 because it had not taken into account the extremist motive of the attack.\n\nA student attempted a [[Copycat crime|copy-cat]] attack on a synagogue in Rostov-on-Don in January 2006, but security guards stopped him before he could harm anyone. An appeals court overturned his attempted murder conviction on the basis that he was mentally unfit to stand trial, and ordered him to undergo psychiatric treatment.\n\nOn October 1, 2005, 21-year-old Andrey Dzyuba was killed by a gang of drunken teenagers in [[Yekaterinburg]]. The group yelled anti-Semitic insults at Dzyuba, dragged him to a cemetery, beat him, and killed him with a metal cross grave marker. Courts convicted five of the attackers of murder for reason of ethnic hatred, and gave them sentences ranging from five to ten years in prison. Ten underage attackers who participated in the beating but not the murder were not charged due to their age.\n\nAccording to the NGO Moscow Bureau of Human Rights (MBHR), the ultranationalist and anti-Semitic Russian National Unity (RNE) paramilitary organization continued to propagate hostility toward Jews and non-Orthodox Christians. The RNE appeared to have lost political influence in some regions since its peak in 1998, but the organization maintained high levels of activity in other regions, such as Voronezh.\n\nSome branches of the ultranationalist and anti-Semitic National Sovereign Way of Russia (NDPR) participated in events organized by local officials.\n\nThe primary targets of skinheads were foreigners and individuals from the North Caucasus, but they expressed anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic sentiments as well.\n\nVandals desecrated several synagogues and Jewish community centers during the reporting period, including in Saratov, Lipetsk, Borovichy, Murmansk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Taganrog, Samara, Petrozavodsk, Perovo, Baltiisk, Kurgan, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad. Officials often classified the crimes as \"hooliganism.\" In the cases where local authorities prosecuted cases, courts generally imposed suspended sentences.\n\nIn May 2007 Dmitry Levanov firebombed the Jewish center in Ulyanovsk and nailed a threatening note on its door with a knife. The next day he returned with a friend and threw a brick through its window. He was detained by police, tried in court, and given a 2-year suspended sentence for inciting ethnic hatred. His friend was released without being charged.\n\nOn 5 May, 2007, an assailant threw a Molotov cocktail at a synagogue in Saratov. No suspects were apprehended. The police were investigating the arson as a case of \"hooliganism\" rather than as a hate crime. They stated it may not have been clear to the perpetrator that the building was a synagogue.\n\nIn the same town at the beginning of April 2007, a Jewish community member's home was targeted in an arson attack. Graffiti reading \"kikes to Israel\" was written on a fence near the synagogue. Police investigators also classified these incidents as hooliganism and had not detained any suspects as of May 2007.\n\nOn the night of March 18, 2007, vandals painted extremist phrases and swastikas on the walls of a synagogue in Voronezh. Officials initiated a criminal investigation on charges of vandalism and inciting extremist activity. The head of the Voronezh Jewish Community believed that the synagogue was attacked in response to the arrest of two young persons suspected of vandalizing a Jewish cemetery in Voronezh.\n\nOn the night of March 1, 2007, vandals desecrated a synagogue in Vladivostok and painted swastikas and anti-Semitic phrases on the walls of the synagogue. The synagogue was also vandalized on October 26, 2006.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, the Jewish Charity Center in Pskov reported that pepper spray was sprayed through a keyhole during its Hanukkah celebration. Police found no evidence of an attack but agreed to step up patrols when the Center was having public events.\n\nIn September 2006 unidentified persons threw stones at synagogues in Khabarovsk and Astrakhan, breaking several windows. One perpetrator threw a Molotov cocktail at the Astrakhan synagogue during this attack.\n\nVandals also desecrated several Jewish cemeteries and memorials during the reporting period.\n\nOn March 30, 2007, unknown vandals defaced seven grave markers in a Jewish cemetery in St. Petersburg with swastikas and graffiti. Police were investigating.\n\nOn March 29, 2007, unknown vandals spray painted swastikas and fascist graffiti on a holocaust memorial in Kaliningrad. The local Jewish community chairman asked the prosecutor to investigate.\n\nOn March 6, 2007, vandals desecrated a Jewish cemetery in Voronezh, ruining more than 20 tombstones. Officials initiated a criminal case under article 244 of the Criminal Code\u2014desecrating a cemetery.\n\nCharges of \"hooliganism\" were quite common for crimes that would normally be considered bias crimes against a particular community, but prosecutors, even by governmental opinion, were reluctant to pursue aggravated charges of racial bias in crimes and were many times content with the lesser charge being applied. At times, there was a fear of not being able to win a court judgment of a bias crime.\n\nThere were many reports of anti-Semitic publications during the reporting period.\n\nA number of small, radical-nationalist newspapers that print anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and xenophobic articles, many of which appeared to violate the law against extremism, were readily available throughout the country. There were also reports of anti-Semitic literature on sale in cities across the country. The estimated number of xenophobic publications exceeded 100, many sponsored by the local chapters of the National Power Party. In addition, there were at least 80 websites in the country that disseminated anti-Semitic propaganda.\n\nThe Euro-Asian Congress noted that in 2006 prosecutors recorded the highest number of attempts to prosecute purveyors of anti-Semitic propaganda. While the Government has publicly denounced nationalist ideology and supported legal action against anti-Semitic acts, the reluctance of some lower-level officials to call such acts anything other than \"hooliganism\" remained an impediment.\n\nIn June 2007 a court in Novosibirsk sentenced the publisher of a local newspaper to two years in prison for inciting anti-Semitism. He had published articles that openly called for violence against Jews.\n\nIn April 2007, at a book fair in Moscow, police arrested a trader in extremist books and charged him with inciting ethnic, racial, and religious enmity. The police stated that they were seeking to identify the publisher of these materials.\n\nMembers of the State Duma and other prominent figures expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in a January 2005 letter, urging the prosecutor general to investigate Jewish organizations and initiate proceedings to ban them, charging that a Russian translation of ancient Jewish law, the Kitzur [[Shulchan Aruch|Shulchan Arukh]], incited hatred against non-Jews. According to the ADL, in 2006 human rights organizations made numerous unsuccessful attempts to prosecute the authors of the \"Letter of 500.\"\n\nThe Rodina party merged with the Party of Life and the Party of Pensioners to form the new \"For a Just Russia\" party in 2006. Rodina members with known anti-Semitic views generally did not approve of the merger and did not join the new party. \"For a Just Russia\" was led by Federation Council Speaker Sergey Mironov, who frequently spoke out against intolerance and anti-Semitism, including at a September 2006 visit to the Babiy Yar memorial in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2006 Nikolay Kurianovich, an LDPR Duma deputy, initiated and publicized a \"list of the enemies of the Russian people\", which mostly featured Jewish names. On March 7, 2007, aides to Kurianovich were expelled from the Duma chambers for wearing swastika armbands. Kurianovich declared their expulsion part of a \"struggle against all that is Russian.\"\n\n===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===\nDuring the reporting period, President Putin spoke several times on the need to combat interethnic and interreligious intolerance. The ROC hosted the World Summit of Religious Leaders in July 2006, including 200 leaders from 40 countries. The conference focused on political and social issues and included calls for interreligious tolerance. President Putin addressed the leaders and urged them to lead their congregations away from extremism.\n\nOn March 13, 2007, President Putin visited the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and discussed with [[Pope Benedict XVI]] ways to improve relations between the ROC and Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe LDS succeeded in registering 51 local religious organizations as of the end of 2006.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, a court affirmed the New Testament Church and the Perm Community of Evangelical Christians' title to the former Lenin Palace of Culture, providing an official certificate documenting the community's ownership of the facility, which they planned to use as a house of worship.\n\nAn Old Believer community in [[Samara]] regained its prerevolutionary church through a municipal decision during the reporting period.\n\nDespite the prolonged series of investigations, Jehovah's Witness officials in St. Petersburg told consulate staff that the situation in Northwest Russia had improved. The officials said they had been able to engage in constructive dialogue with Government officials with regard to the general situation on religious freedom and the investigation of their Administrative Center.\n\nIn November 2006 the Permskiy Kray court ruled in favor of the Pentecostal Church, allowing the church to register its property, overturning several previous lower court decisions against the group. The Pentecostal group reported having received no official harassment since the resolution of the case.\n\nIn February 2007 a Sverdlovsk oblast court convicted five teenagers of the 2005 murder of a Jewish man, sentencing them to prison sentences ranging from 5 to 10 years. The teens were skinheads and members of extremist and Nazi-affiliated groups. The court acknowledged the anti-Semitic nature of the crime in its verdict, which came under Article 105, Section 2, \"Ethnic or Religious Hate Crime.\"\n\nFederal and regional officials participated actively in, and in many cases strongly supported, a range of government and NGO-organized programs to promote tolerance. The December 2006 conference \"A Multi-Ethnic Russia\" was cosponsored by the Federation Council and UNESCO and included sessions on religious diversity and tolerance.\n\nThe Commission for Human Rights in the Russian Federation, a government body headed by Vladimir Lukin, released its annual report on human rights and publicized the difficulty that some religious groups faced in property restitution and land acquisition, and the difficulties that religious minorities faced with government officials.\n\nThe Public Chamber's Commission on Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience promoted tolerance in troubled areas, by holding a public hearing in March 2006 on how to promote stability and civil accord in the North Caucasus. Among the participants were government and religious leaders from the region.\n\nFederal authorities, and in many cases regional and local authorities, facilitated the establishment of new Jewish institutions. In June 2006 work began on the construction of a $100 million Moscow Jewish community center on land donated by the Moscow city government to house Jewish community institutions including a school, a hospital, and a major new museum devoted to the history of the country's Jews, the Holocaust, and tolerance. The construction was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2008.\n\nEvangelical Christian leaders in St. Petersburg reported important progress in obtaining federal permission to expand work with prisoners, in particular through its broadcasting network. With the cooperation of the ROC, satellite receivers were installed in dozens of prisons to allow broadcasting of programming that was broadly Protestant but tried to reach across denominations. The prison broadcasting program's stated goal was to provide inmates with an alternative to mainstream television.\n\nROC Patriarch Aleksiy II and spiritual leaders of Russian Muslims held an interfaith appeal for peace and joint efforts to counter ethnic and religious strife, following interethnic violence in the city of Kondopoga.\n\nDespite the problems the Jehovah's Witnesses faced, church leaders said that their community grew by 3 percent (to 140,000) in the last year. Although in the past the Jehovah's Witnesses had difficulty securing large venues, they held an annual congress on July 14-16, 2006, at the Luzhniki Sports Complex in Moscow, which more than 22,000 attended. The April 2007 Jehovah's Witnesses' observances of the death of Jesus in Moscow proceeded without official or community disruption.\n\n==Societal abuses and discrimination==\nHere were reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice, including some physical attacks against individuals and communities because of the victims' religious affiliation (see also the section on Anti-Semitism). Groups that monitor hate crimes reported at least 70 incidents of vandalism against religious targets, including 36 aimed at Jews, 12 against Russian Orthodox, and 11 against Muslims.\n\nOn April 9, 2007, the Stavropol court charged a suspect with murder on religious hatred grounds for the September 2006 killing of Imam Kurdzhiyev.\n\nIn February 2007 police charged suspects in the June 2004 killing of Nikolay Girenko, an expert on [[xenophobia]], [[racism]], and anti-Semitism. Girenko had served for many years as an expert witness in trials involving alleged skinheads and [[neo-Nazis]].\n\nOn December 8, 2006, a hand grenade was thrown into the yard of the house of Ismail Berdiyev, Chairman of the Coordinating Council of Moslems of the North Caucasus. No one was hurt in the attack.\n\nRussian Orthodox priest Andrey Nikolayev, his wife, and their three children were killed on December 2, 2006, when their house was set on fire. The motive for the arson and murder was not known, but media reported that a criminal group had threatened the priest in the past and had burned down his house in another village.\n\nAccording to Jehovah's Witness officials, there were 5 incidents of physical attacks on Jehovah's Witnesses, and 11 incidents of police detention in the first half of 2007. In 2006 there were 24 physical attacks and 40 cases of police detention.\n\nMany citizens believe that at least nominal adherence to the ROC is a part of Russian culture, and three other faiths\u2014Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism\u2014are widely considered \"traditional religions.\" Terrorism and events related to the war in Chechnya have given rise to negative popular attitudes toward traditionally Muslim ethnic groups in many regions. Hostility toward non-Russian-Orthodox religious groups sparked harassment and occasionally physical attacks. Religiously motivated violence continued, although it was often difficult to determine whether xenophobia, religion, or ethnic prejudices were the primary motivation. Conservative activists claiming ties to the ROC disseminated negative publications and staged demonstrations throughout the country against Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other minority religions.\n\nSome religious groups participated in interfaith dialogues. Pentecostal and Baptist organizations, as well as the ROC, were reluctant to support ecumenism at the local level, although the national leaders engaged each other at public forums during the reporting period. At the international level, the ROC has traditionally pursued interfaith dialogue with other Christian groups. In the Muslim-dominated regions of the [[Tatarstan|Tatarstan republic]] and the surrounding Volga region, tensions between Muslims and Russian Orthodox believers occasionally emerged. Law enforcement organizations closely watched Muslim groups. Officials often described Muslim charitable organizations as providing aid to extremists in addition to their overt charity.\n\nA small splinter group of the [[Russian National Unity|ultranationalist Russian National Unity]] (RNE) organization called \"Russian Rebirth\" registered successfully in the past in Tver and Nizhniy Novgorod as a social organization, prompting protests from human rights groups; however, in several regions such as Moscow and Karelia, the authorities limited the activities of the RNE by denying registration to its local affiliates. According to Sova Center, there were neither registration denials nor registrations of RNE during the reporting period. Sova Center reported that three other ultranationalist organizations were dissolved in 2006. In one case, the Supreme Court upheld the decision by a Krasnodar court to ban the Krasnodar Orthodox Slavic community, an Orthodox Old Believers group that used neo-Nazi symbols.\n\nOn July 2, 2006, 15 shots were fired over a 15-minute period at the Trinikolsky monastery in the Dmitrovsky District of the Moscow Oblast. While no one was injured, the shots caused $12,000 in damage.\n\nOn August 27, 2006, an unknown attacker sprayed teargas, disrupting a Pentecostal church service in the \"New Testament\" Evangelical Church in the city of Perm.\n\nMuslims continued to encounter societal discrimination and antagonism in some regions. After terrorists associated with Chechen, Ingush, and Islamic extremists seized a school in 2004 in Beslan, North Ossetia, interethnic and interreligious tensions resulting in discrimination persisted in the region without the authorities' intervention, according to NGOs. Muslims claimed that citizens in certain regions feared Muslims, citing cases such as a dispute in Kolomna, approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} southeast of Moscow, over the proposed construction of a mosque. Government officials, journalists, and the public have liberally labeled Muslim organizations \"Wahhabi\", a term that has become equivalent with \"extremist.\" Numerous press reports documented anti-Islamic sentiment.\n\nIn Muslim-dominated regions, relations between Muslims and Russian Orthodox believers were generally harmonious. Extremely traditional or orthodox versions of Islam were often associated in the public mind with terrorism and radical Muslim fighters in the North Caucasus.\n\nAlthough the previous reporting period saw the chairman of the Council of Muftis, the head of the Central Spiritual Board of the country's Muslims, and the head of the Coordinating Center of Muslims of the North Caucasus jointly denounce terrorism, the national press carried stories during the reporting period highlighting their public differences in attitudes toward Wahabbism, among other things.\n\nAs in the past, there were many attacks against houses of worship, meeting halls, and cemeteries across the country. Attacks ranged from threats and graffiti to arson. Often, even in the face of blatant anti-religious signs, local authorities investigated the cases as \"hooliganism\", and not under the stronger anti-hate laws, although there were signs that prosecutors were using the hate-crime laws more often. In April 2007 the Government amended the Criminal Code to increase punitive measures for hate crimes and extremism. According to new legislation, an individual convicted of committing an act of vandalism motivated by ideological, political, national, racial and religious hatred or enmity can be sentenced for up to 3 years.\n\nSova Center reported that 25 acts of vandalism motivated by religious hatred were committed against churches and other religious buildings in 2006, including 11 attacks on Muslim religious buildings. A mosque was bombed in Yahroma village of Moscow region. Mosques in Vladimir and Yaroslavl were attacked with Molotov cocktails.\n\nOn September 27, 2006, arsonists attempted to burn down a mosque in Yaroslavl by throwing six Molotov cocktails at the building. Vandals painted extremist phrases and [[swastika]]s on the outer wall of the mosque. Police arrested and charged an 18-year-old student with instigation of nationalist, racial, and religious hatred. There was another attempt of arson on the same mosque 3 days earlier. On December 25, 2006, the arsonists were convicted of [[desecration]] and [[arson]]; one was given a suspended sentence of 1 year and 3 months, and the other was sentenced to 10 months in a [[labor camp]]. The arsonists apologized publicly.\n\nEmmanuel Moscow Evangelical Church reported an arson attack on their building in Solntsevo district of Moscow on the night of March 26, 2007. Also in March 2007, attackers threw bottles filled with resin at the front wall of Central Prayer House of the Christians of Evangelical Faith in Voronezh.\n\nSova Center registered 24 cases of vandalism in Orthodox, Muslim, and Jewish cemeteries in 2006. On October 3, 2006, a group of skinheads desecrated approximately 150 Jewish and Tatar tombs in a cemetery in Tver. Extremist leaflets were found at the scene. A criminal case was initiated on charges of desecrating a cemetery.\n\nOn August 4, 2006, a Muslim cemetery was vandalized in Yekaterinburg. More than a dozen headstones, many of them of historic value, were destroyed. Police characterized the vandalism as hooliganism, not a hate crime, and Muslim community representatives in Yekaterinburg, including Imam Sibgatulla-Hazrat, agreed with this view.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the tensions between the Vatican and the ROC notably decreased, although the Patriarchy in Moscow continued to object to the transfer of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic See from [[Lviv]] to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, which occurred in August 2005. The press coverage of President Putin's March 2007 meeting with Pope Benedict XVI was positive, and Roman Catholic representatives noted a decrease in tensions during the reporting period. Other issues of concern that remained between the two groups included the continued belief that Roman Catholics were proselytizing in the country and a proposal by a local priest to open a Catholic Carmelite convent whose main mission would be to work with orphans in the city of Nizhniy Novgorod. The ROC alleged that the convent would serve as a base for missionary activities, while the Catholic Church maintained that the convent was not a full-fledged convent but a means for caring for local orphans. In April 2007 the Head of the ROC's Inter-Christian Relations Secretariat publicly criticized the Catholic Church for allegedly proselytizing at orphanages, calling their missionary activity \"unacceptable.\"\n\nReports of the harassment of evangelicals and Pentecostals dramatically decreased during the reporting period, particularly after September 2005, when Bishop Sergey Ryakhovskiy joined the Public Chamber. Nevertheless, African-Russian and African ministers of non-Orthodox Christian churches were subject to religious and racial bigotry.\n\nAccording to a July 13, 2006, report by SOVA, an Orthodox priest and other activists attempted to interrupt a Baptist service in the village of Achit (Sverdlovsk region). They reportedly told persons walking by that the Baptists were a dangerous \"sect.\" Police arrived on the scene and fined the Baptists for holding an \"unauthorized meeting.\" Similar actions were reported against Pentecostals and Hare Krishnas.\n\nThe press routinely continued to reference members of Jehovah's Witnesses as a religious \"sect\", although they have been present in the country for approximately 100 years.\n\nIn the past, Jehovah's Witnesses officials reported physical attacks against their members throughout the country. The officials were unable to update these figures for this reporting period, citing the difficulty of collecting the information.\n\nA case at the ECHR continued 4 years after a provocative exhibit on religion was vandalized at the Sakharov Center. Although the authorities never prosecuted the vandals, a court found the Center Director and a staff member guilty of inciting religious hatred, and fined them. The case was being appealed at the ECHR.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Slavic Center for Law and Justice and a number of minority \"nontraditional\" religious leaders asserted that the Government and majority religious groups increasingly used the mass media, conferences, and public demonstrations to foment opposition to minority religions as threats to physical, mental, and spiritual health, asserting that these groups threatened national security. During the reporting period, television channels broadcast several programs about \"dangerous cults and sects\" and implied that these included Pentecostals and other proselytizing religions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Religion in Russia]]\n* [[Yarovaya law]] (Anti proselytism law)\n* [[Human rights in Russia]]\n* [[Freedom of assembly in Russia]]\n* [[Freedom of press in Russia]]\n\n==References==\n* United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

The Algerine ships had come from the port of [[Algiers]], and were acting as corsairs, conducting [[commerce raiding]] against [[Christianity|Christian]] [[merchant ships]] and enslaving their crews. This was part of the [[Barbary slave trade]], where the [[Barbary states]], autonomous [[Vassal state|vassals]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] raided Christian settlements and merchant vessels for [[Slavery|slaves]] to sell in their own cities. The corsairs targeted Spain, [[Religion in Spain|a Christian country]], and the [[Spanish navy]] was sent to track down the formidable Algerine force of two ships of the line, which posed a significant threat to any Christian vessels in the region. When the fleets sighted each other on November 28, 1751, they found that they were evenly matched with their opposition; both fielded two ships of the line.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\nThe Spanish navy had been put to sea in the aftermath of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] to ensure that they remained an experienced force. Pedro Fitz-James Stuart sighted the Algerine corsairs off Cape St. Vincent on the coast of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], and moved to engage the two corsairs before they could escape. The Algerine ships, led by Mohammed Chirif commanding the [[flagship]] of the Algerine fleet, opened fire on the Spanish ship first, initiating the engagement. However, they then proceeded to try and escape back to a safe port, reasoning that they were no match for the trained Spanish crews. The Spanish set their sails in pursuit, and managed to catch up to the Algerine flagship, the ''Danzik'', while the other warship, the ''Castillo Nuevo'' took the opportunity to flee and successfully made it back to a safe port. Fitz-James Stuart's ship, the ''Drag\u00f3n'', engaged the ''Danzik'' over the course of two days, eventually managing to disable her after heavy fighting. The heavily damaged corsair was removed of the crew and Christian slaves held in the hold before set on fire, as it was too weak to make it back to port. Fitz-James Stuart returned to Spain to applause and recognition from the Spanish Navy.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Jacques Dumont - All\u00e9gorie en l&#039;honneur de la publication de la paix d&#039;Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the War of the Austrian Sucession.]]\nEurope had been enbroiled in war since the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], a complex and global conflict occuring over who would succeed the deceased [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. Although Charles spent his entire life trying to ensure that his daughter, [[Maria Theresa]], would succeed him as rule of the Hapsburg dominions, many nations in Europe refused to accept the ascension. Despite this, she was able to defend her territory and in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], managed to secure recognition from the states that had opposed her as Queen of the [[Hapsburg Monarchy|Habsburg dominions]]. Spain had involved herself in the war, and its navy had engaged in several battles with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], such as the [[Battle of Havana (1748)|engagement off Havana]]. Thus, the Spanish fleets were crewed with experienced sailors, a valuable advantage if any future wars were to occur. After the peace treaty was signed, Spain was freed from of any potential threat from other European powers. However, the naval administration of Spain was keenly aware that the Spanish fleets needed to put to sea and engage in combat to ensure they retained their experience for the coming years.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\nThe [[Barbary corsairs]] had long plagued [[Christendom|Christian countries]], plundering their ships and enslaving their crews. Many daring corsairs even raided coastal [[villages]] and kidnapped villagers to sell into slavery. This formed a significant part of the economies of the Barbary states, which were autonomous vassals of the Ottoman Empire. Spain was resolved to end this threat to them by any means necessary, and the [[Zen\u00f3n de Somodevilla, 1st Marquis of Ensenada|Marquis of Ensenada]] was ordered to assemble two naval divisions with the aim of engaging with the Barbary corsairs and to prevent the [[sailors]] of the Spanish fleet from remaining inactive and losing any experience they had gained from the war.<ref name=\"Duro415\">Fern\u00e1ndez Duro p.415</ref> Both divisions were dispatched to patrol the Barbary coast, where Barbary [[galliots]] and other minor warships were frequently captured by the Spanish, but no significant engagement took place before November 1751. Around the same time, two Algerine corsairs sailed around the [[Iberian peninsula]] to carry out commerce raiding on Christian ships, posing a threat to the maritime trade of Spain. Before the two fleets encountered each other, the two corsairs had already captured several Christian merchant ships, enslaving any of those they didn't kill.<ref name=\"Duro415\"/>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Retrato_del_teniente_general_de_la_armada_Pedro_Fitz-James_Stuart_y_Col\u00f3n_de_Portugal,_marqu\u00e9s_de_San_Leonardo_(1791).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A painting of Pedro Fitz-James Stuart, painted by an unknown author.]]\nOn 28 November, Spanish captain Pedro Fitz-James Stuart had been ordered to undergo a cruise around the coast of Spain. Fitz-James Stuart, a member of the [[Scottish diaspora]], had been searching for two Barbary ships of the line which had recently been sighted off the Spanish coast, harassing merchant shipping in the region. In command of the 60-gun ships of the line ''Drag\u00f3n'' along with the ''Am\u00e9rica'' which was commanded by [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], Fitz-James Stuart sighted two corsairs which appeared to belong to the [[Regency of Algiers]] fifty-two leagues off the Cape.<ref name=\"Duro415\"/> These were the 60-gun ''Danzik'', which happened to be [[flagship]] of the Algerine fleet and under command of Barbary corsair Mohammed Chirif, and the 54-gun ''Castillo Nuevo''.<ref name=\"Bouche198\">Bouch\u00e9 p.198</ref> Fitz-James Stuart sailed towards the two ships to ascertain their nationality, and by 5 p.m had closed with the two corsairs. The ''Danzik'' suddenly raised the Algerine colours and unleashed a furious cannonade upon the ''Drag\u00f3n'', and then almost immediately set sail and tried to evade the two Spanish warships. It was clear that the Algerines knew they were outmatched and thus attempted to resort to such [[perfidy|underhanded tactics]] to try and evade capture. After this, Chirif ordered his ships to start sailing towards the south-west, although with the ''Drag\u00f3n'' and ''Am\u00e9rica'' in hot pursuit.<ref name=\"Bouche198\"/>\n\nThe pursuit took place over two days, with the ''Castillo Nuevo'', itself a captured Spanish ship of the line, managing to split course from the ''Danzik'' and evade their Spanish pursuers. Fitz-James Stuart ordered his ships to disregard the ''Castillo Nuevo'' and continue their pursuit of the ''Danzik''. Chirif was successfully able to avoid taking cannon fire from the Spanish by sailing [[windward]], which prevented the Spanish ships from opening the ports of their [[Gun deck|gundecks]].<ref name=\"Bouche198\"/> Despite this, the Spanish ships were able to fire their [[bowsprit]] cannons at the ''Danzik'', which suffered damage to her [[rigging]] and [[sail|sails]], forcing her to slow down until the Spanish ships were close enough to board.<ref name=\"Bouche\"/> For a brief moment, she [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], but Chirif, urged on by his crew, ordered it to be hoisted again and resumed the action until the sunset, when both himself and Stuart declined to continue fighting due to rough sea.<ref name=\"Bouche\"/> The next day the Spanish warships attacked again, and in the ensuing conflict a duel emerged between the ''Drag\u00f3n'' and the ''Danzik''. This inflicted heavy casualties upon the ''Danzik'' and caused significant damage to the ship. Finally, seeing no other option, Chirif lowered his colours again and surrendered for the second and last time. Fitz-James Stuart sent men on board the ship to take possession of it. The losses on the Spanish side was negligible, amounting to be only 3 killed and 25 wounded, compared to 194 killed and about 90 wounded on the Algerine ship. The ''Danzik'', severely damaged, had to be set on fire after 320 prisoners-of-war were transferred aboard Stuart's flagship, among them Chirif, wounded during the battle, and 50 rescued Christian slaves, who were mostly [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Spanish ships returned to port with Fitz-James Stuart receiving applause and recognition from the Spanish Navy. The Dutch slaves were allowed to return to the [[Dutch Republic]], and the crews of the two Spanish warships received their [[prize money]] from valuables taken from the ''Danzik''. The ''Castillo Nuevo'', returning to the Barbary states safe and sound, continued its career preying on Christian ships. Despite this defeat, which was followed by other Spanish victories over the Barbary corsairs such as the sinking of three xebecs off [[Benidorm]] or the [[Battle of Cape Palos (1758)|destruction of the ''Castillo Nuevo'']] seven years later, the Barbary corsairs continued to threaten and harass Spanish merchant ships. In 1775, the [[King of Spain]], [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered [[Alejandro O'Reilly]] to strike a major blow to the [[Baba Mohammed ben-Osman|Dey of Algiers]] by capturing the port of Algiers, a major center of the Barbary slave trade. [[Invasion of Algiers (1775)|The expedition]], although assembling 20,000 men and 74 warships, failed miserably, and was unable to move the position of the various Deys in regards to their approval of the enslavement of Christians. Despite this defeat, Charles never gave up his ambition to put an end to the Barbary threat to his nation.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\nIn 1783, Charles ordered [[Admiral]] [[Antonio Barcel\u00f3]] to bombard Algiers, as it was commonly perceived that the the humiliating defeat of the expedition eight years earlier had \"offended the national pride of Spain\". On [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|his first bombardment]], both the Spanish and the Algerines fruitlessly attempted to bombard each other, inflicting insignificant casualties on both sides. Barcel\u00f3, citing unfavorable weather conditions, gave the order for his ships to withdraw. The Spanish court was furious at the failure of Barcel\u00f3, but this only increased the desire of Charles to inflict a defeat on the Algerines. Charles sent an emissary to the [[Sublime Porte]] in [[Istanbul]] to try and diplomatically put an end to the activities of the Barbary corsairs, but the [[Baba Mohammed ben-Osman|Dey]] refused to listen to the agreement, making Charles realize that war would be the only path. On 12 July 1784, a massive allied fleet consisting of warships from Spain, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and the [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Order of Saint John]] [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|inflicted a decisive defeat]] on the Barbary corsairs, destroying the [[fortifications]] of Algiers and inflicting heavy casualties. The [[Baba Mohammed ben-Osman|Dey]]'s forces weakened to the point where they could put up little resistance, the Regency of Algiers was forced to negotiate a peace with the Spanish by which it was forced to cease large-scale [[piracy]], signalling the effective end to the activities of the Barbary corsairs until the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=20%; align= center rowspan=2  | <small> Ship </small>\n! width=25%; align= center rowspan=2  | <small> Commander </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2  | <small> Navy </small>\n! width=5%; align= center rowspan=2  | <small> Guns </small>\n! width=15%; align= center colspan=3 | <small> Casualties</small>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n! width=5%; align= center | <small> Killed </small>\n! width=5%; align= center | <small> Wounded </small>\n! width=5%; align= center | <small> Total</small>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | ''Drag\u00f3n''\n| align= left | Captain Pedro Fitz-James Stuart\n| align= center  | {{flagdeco|Spain|1701}}\n| align= center | 60\n| align= center | 3\n| align= center | 25\n| align= center | 28\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | ''Am\u00e9rica''\n| align= left | Captain [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]]\n| align= center  | {{flagdeco|Spain|1701}}\n| align= center | 60\n| align= center | 0\n| align= center | 0\n| align= center | 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"10\" bgcolor=\"white\"|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | ''Danzik'' (captured)\n| align= left | Corsair Mohammed Chirif {{POW}}\n| align= center  | {{flagicon image|Flag of Ottoman Algiers.svg}}\n| align= center | 60\n| align= center | 194\n| align= center | 90\n| align= center | 284\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align= left  | ''Castillo Nuevo'' (escaped)\n| align= left | Corsair Mahamud Rais\n| align= center  | {{flagicon image|Flag of Ottoman Algiers.svg}}\n| align= center | 54\n| align= center | 0\n| align= center | 0\n| align= center | 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Antonio Barcel\u00f3]]\n* [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)]]\n* [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Espa\u00f1ol Bouch\u00e9\n | first = Luis\n | authorlink = Luis Espa\u00f1ol \n | year = 1999\n | chapter =\n | title = ''New and old problems in the Succession of the Spanish Crown: Pragmatics of Carlos III on unequal marriages.''\n | publisher = Hidalgu\u00eda Editions\n | isbn = 9788489851139\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Fern\u00e1ndez Duro\n | first = Ces\u00e1reo\n | authorlink = Ces\u00e1reo Fern\u00e1ndez Duro\n | year = 1895\n | chapter =\n | title = ''The Spanish Navy from the union of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon.''\n | publisher = Madrid Naval Museum\n | isbn = 9780270858273\n}}\n\n{{coord missing|Portugal}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1751]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving Spain]]\n[[Category:Naval battles involving Ottoman Algeria]]\n[[Category:Barbary pirates]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|other battles fought on the same location|Battle of Cape St. Vincent (disambiguation){{!}}Battle of Cape St. Vincent}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Action of 28 November 1751\n|image=Dansik-y-dragon.jpg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption= Anonymous engraving depicting the final battle between the ''Drag\u00f3n'' and the ''Danzik''\n|partof=the [[Template:Campaignbox Spanish-Barbary battles of the 18th century|Spanish-Barbary Wars]]\n|date=November 28 \u2013 December 2, 1751\n|place=off [[Cape St Vincent]], [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|result=Spanish victory\n|combatant1={{flagdeco|Spain|1701}} [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]]\n|combatant2={{flagicon image|Flag of Ottoman Algiers.svg}} [[Ottoman Algeria|Regency of Algiers]]\n|commander1={{flagdeco|Spain|1701}} Pedro Stuart\n|commander2={{flagicon image|Flag of Ottoman Algiers.svg}} Mohammed Chirif\n|strength1=2 ships of the line\n|strength2=2 ships of the line\n|casualties1=3 killed<br>25 wounded<ref name=\"Bouche\">Bouch\u00e9 pg. 199</ref><ref name=\"Leurencin\">Laurenc\u00edn pg. 77</ref>\n|casualties2=194 killed,<br>90 wounded<br>320 captured<br>1 ship of line destroyed<ref name=\"Bouche\"/><ref name=\"Leurencin\"/><ref name=\"Duro416\">Fern\u00e1ndez Duro pg. 416</ref>\n|casualties3=50 European slaves freed\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Spanish-Barbary battles of the 18th century}}\n\nThe '''Action of 28 November 1751''' was a naval engagement off [[Cape St. Vincent]] between a squadron of two [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] [[ships of the line]] under [[Captain (naval)|captain]] Pedro Fitz-James Stuart and an [[Ottoman Algeria|Algerine]] squadron of two ships of the line under [[Barbary pirates|corsair]] Mohammed Chirif, which was fought from November 28 to December 2, 1751 and resulted in a victory for the Spanish fleet. The Algerine ships had come from the port of [[Algiers]], and were acting as corsairs, conducting [[commerce raiding]] against [[Christianity|Christian]] [[merchant ships]] and enslaving their crews. This was part of the [[Barbary slave trade]], where the [[Barbary states]], autonomous [[Vassal state|vassals]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] raided Christian settlements and merchant vessels for [[Slavery|slaves]] to sell in their own cities. The corsairs targeted Spain, [[Religion in Spain|a Christian country]], and the [[Spanish navy]] was sent to track down the formidable Algerine force of two ships of the line, which posed a significant threat to any Christian vessels in the region. When the fleets sighted each other on November 28, 1751, they found that they were evenly matched with their opposition; both fielded two ships of the line.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\nThe Spanish navy had been put to sea in the aftermath of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] to ensure that they remained an experienced force. Pedro Fitz-James Stuart sighted the Algerine corsairs off Cape St. Vincent on the coast of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], and moved to engage the two corsairs before they could escape. The Algerine ships, led by Mohammed Chirif commanding the [[flagship]] of the Algerine fleet, opened fire on the Spanish ship first, initiating the engagement. However, they then proceeded to try and escape back to a safe port, reasoning that they were no match for the trained Spanish crews. The Spanish set their sails in pursuit, and managed to catch up to the Algerine flagship, the ''Danzik'', while the other warship, the ''Castillo Nuevo'' took the opportunity to flee and successfully made it back to a safe port. Fitz-James Stuart's ship, the ''Drag\u00f3n'', engaged the ''Danzik'' over the course of two days, eventually managing to disable her after heavy fighting. The heavily damaged corsair was removed of the crew and Christian slaves held in the hold before set on fire, as it was too weak to make it back to port. Fitz-James Stuart returned to Spain to applause and recognition from the Spanish Navy.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Jacques Dumont - All\u00e9gorie en l&#039;honneur de la publication de la paix d&#039;Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the War of the Austrian Sucession.]]\nEurope had been enbroiled in war since the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], a complex and global conflict occuring over who would succeed the deceased [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. Although Charles spent his entire life trying to ensure that his daughter, [[Maria Theresa]], would succeed him as rule of the Hapsburg dominions, many nations in Europe refused to accept the ascension. Despite this, she was able to defend her territory and in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], managed to secure recognition from the states that had opposed her as Queen of the [[Hapsburg Monarchy|Habsburg dominions]]. Spain had involved herself in the war, and its navy had engaged in several battles with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], such as the [[Battle of Havana (1748)|engagement off Havana]]. Thus, the Spanish fleets were crewed with experienced sailors, a valuable advantage if any future wars were to occur. After the peace treaty was signed, Spain was freed from of any potential threat from other European powers. However, the naval administration of Spain was keenly aware that the Spanish fleets needed to put to sea and engage in combat to ensure they retained their experience for the coming years.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\nThe [[Barbary corsairs]] had long plagued [[Christendom|Christian countries]], plundering their ships and enslaving their crews. Many daring corsairs even raided coastal [[villages]] and kidnapped villagers to sell into slavery. This formed a significant part of the economies of the Barbary states, which were autonomous vassals of the Ottoman Empire. Spain was resolved to end this threat to them by any means necessary, and the [[Zen\u00f3n de Somodevilla, 1st Marquis of Ensenada|Marquis of Ensenada]] was ordered to assemble two naval divisions with the aim of engaging with the Barbary corsairs and to prevent the [[sailors]] of the Spanish fleet from remaining inactive and losing any experience they had gained from the war.<ref name=\"Duro415\">Fern\u00e1ndez Duro p.415</ref> Both divisions were dispatched to patrol the Barbary coast, where Barbary [[galliots]] and other minor warships were frequently captured by the Spanish, but no significant engagement took place before November 1751. Around the same time, two Algerine corsairs sailed around the [[Iberian peninsula]] to carry out commerce raiding on Christian ships, posing a threat to the maritime trade of Spain. Before the two fleets encountered each other, the two corsairs had already captured several Christian merchant ships, enslaving any of those they didn't kill.<ref name=\"Duro415\"/>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Retrato_del_teniente_general_de_la_armada_Pedro_Fitz-James_Stuart_y_Col\u00f3n_de_Portugal,_marqu\u00e9s_de_San_Leonardo_(1791).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A painting of Pedro Fitz-James Stuart, painted by an unknown author.]]\nOn 28 November, Spanish captain Pedro Fitz-James Stuart had been ordered to undergo a cruise around the coast of Spain. Fitz-James Stuart, a member of the [[Scottish diaspora]], had been searching for two Barbary ships of the line which had recently been sighted off the Spanish coast, harassing merchant shipping in the region. In command of the 60-gun ships of the line ''Drag\u00f3n'' along with the ''Am\u00e9rica'' which was commanded by [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], Fitz-James Stuart sighted two corsairs which appeared to belong to the [[Regency of Algiers]] fifty-two leagues off the Cape.<ref name=\"Duro415\"/> These were the 60-gun ''Danzik'', which happened to be [[flagship]] of the Algerine fleet and under command of Barbary corsair Mohammed Chirif, and the 54-gun ''Castillo Nuevo''.<ref name=\"Bouche198\">Bouch\u00e9 p.198</ref> Fitz-James Stuart sailed towards the two ships to ascertain their nationality, and by 5 p.m had closed with the two corsairs. The ''Danzik'' suddenly raised the Algerine colours and unleashed a furious cannonade upon the ''Drag\u00f3n'', and then almost immediately set sail and tried to evade the two Spanish warships. It was clear that the Algerines knew they were outmatched and thus attempted to resort to such [[perfidy|underhanded tactics]] to try and evade capture. After this, Chirif ordered his ships to start sailing towards the south-west, although with the ''Drag\u00f3n'' and ''Am\u00e9rica'' in hot pursuit.<ref name=\"Bouche198\"/>\n\nThe pursuit took place over two days, with the ''Castillo Nuevo'', itself a captured Spanish ship of the line, managing to split course from the ''Danzik'' and evade their Spanish pursuers. Fitz-James Stuart ordered his ships to disregard the ''Castillo Nuevo'' and continue their pursuit of the ''Danzik''. Chirif was successfully able to avoid taking cannon fire from the Spanish by sailing [[windward]], which prevented the Spanish ships from opening the ports of their [[Gun deck|gundecks]].<ref name=\"Bouche198\"/> Despite this, the Spanish ships were able to fire their [[bowsprit]] cannons at the ''Danzik'', which suffered damage to her [[rigging]] and [[sail|sails]], forcing her to slow down until the Spanish ships were close enough to board.<ref name=\"Bouche\"/> For a brief moment, she [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], but Chirif, urged on by his crew, ordered it to be hoisted again and resumed the action until the sunset, when both himself and Stuart declined to continue fighting due to rough sea.<ref name=\"Bouche\"/> The next day the Spanish warships attacked again, and in the ensuing conflict a duel emerged between the ''Drag\u00f3n'' and the ''Danzik''. This inflicted heavy casualties upon the ''Danzik'' and caused significant damage to the ship. Finally, seeing no other option, Chirif lowered his colours again and surrendered for the second and last time. Fitz-James Stuart sent men on board the ship to take possession of it. The losses on the Spanish side was negligible, amounting to be only 3 killed and 25 wounded, compared to 194 killed and about 90 wounded on the Algerine ship. The ''Danzik'', severely damaged, had to be set on fire after 320 prisoners-of-war were transferred aboard Stuart's flagship, among them Chirif, wounded during the battle, and 50 rescued Christian slaves, who were mostly [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Spanish ships returned to port with Fitz-James Stuart receiving applause and recognition from the Spanish Navy. The Dutch slaves were allowed to return to the [[Dutch Republic]], and the crews of the two Spanish warships received their [[prize money]] from valuables taken from the ''Danzik''. The ''Castillo Nuevo'', returning to the Barbary states safe and sound, continued its career preying on Christian ships. Despite this defeat, which was followed by other Spanish victories over the Barbary corsairs such as the sinking of three xebecs off [[Benidorm]] or the [[Battle of Cape Palos (1758)|destruction of the ''Castillo Nuevo'']] seven years later, the Barbary corsairs continued to threaten and harass Spanish merchant ships. In 1775, the [[King of Spain]], [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered [[Alejandro O'Reilly]] to strike a major blow to the [[Baba Mohammed ben-Osman|Dey of Algiers]] by capturing the port of Algiers, a major center of the Barbary slave trade. [[Invasion of Algiers (1775)|The expedition]], although assembling 20,000 men and 73 warships, failed miserably, and was unable to move the position of the various Deys in regards to their approval of the enslavement of Christians. Despite this defeat, Charles never gave up his ambition to put an end to the Barbary threat to his nation.<ref>Sabater Galindo pg.153</ref>\n\nIn 1783, Charles ordered [[Admiral]] [[Antonio Barcel\u00f3]] to bombard Algiers, as it was commonly perceived that the the humiliating defeat of the expedition eight years earlier had \"offended the national pride of Spain\". On [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|his first bombardment]], both the Spanish and the Algerines fruitlessly attempted to bombard each other, inflicting insignificant casualties on both sides. Barcel\u00f3, citing unfavorable weather conditions, gave the order for his ships to withdraw. The Spanish court was furious at the failure of Barcel\u00f3, but this only increased the desire of Charles to inflict a defeat on the Algerines. Charles sent an emissary to the [[Sublime Porte]] in [[Istanbul]] to try and diplomatically put an end to the activities of the Barbary corsairs, but the [[Baba Mohammed ben-Osman|Dey]] refused to listen to the agreement, making Charles realize that war would be the only path. On 12 July 1784, a massive allied fleet consisting of warships from Spain, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and the [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Order of Saint John]] [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|inflicted a decisive defeat]] on the Barbary corsairs, destroying the [[fortifications]] of Algiers and inflicting heavy casualties.

Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.

They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.

Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.

It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.

CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.  Teams are listed chronologically when possible.\n\n* William Fred Slater: 1890-1892 [[1892 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]] Half-back, 1894 Chicago AA\n* Lucas: 1894 Chicago AA\n* Paul G.

This was one of the first games played in Indianapolis in 1895, as the city had \"opened\" the football season on the same day.  The Indianapolis Journal described the CAA team as a machine, and gave credit to Brown, Slater, Camp, Hadden and Coffeen for good runs.  Thompson made the first touchdown, followed by Brown, and then Camp, with Brown going 2 for 3 on PATs.  The ILA team had some minor disagreements with the referring, but overall claimed the CAA had great teamwork, and was well trained in interference (blocking and tackling).  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31607367/chicago-athletic-club-16-indianapolis/|title=Chicago Athletic Club 16 @Indianapolis Light Artillery 0 AND|date=1895-10-20|work=The Indianapolis Journal|access-date=2020-04-23|pages=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49392581/artillerymen-are-defeated-by-a-score-of/|title=Artillerymen Are Defeated by a Score of 16 to 0.|date=1895-10-20|work=The Inter Ocean|access-date=2020-04-23|pages=10}}</ref>\n\nOctober 22: Mr. Mulliken, a man with past experience at Columbia and on the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn, decides to join the Chicago AA eleven. CAA also began preparation for their journey to the east, and sent out the first roster of those going.  The initial list was, Stone and Thompson as Left Ends, Thomas Left Tackle, Ryan Left Guard, Stevenson Center, Bartl and Mulliken Right Guards, McCormick Right Tackle, Hadden Right End, Aldrich Quarterback, Coffeen, Blaney and Hoagland Right Half Backs, Slater Left Half Back, and Brown Full Back.  Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.  Lake Forest had also just come from contests between the likes of [[1895 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]], who had beaten them 52 to 0 and 26 to 5 respectively.  They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.  The two teams hoped to stand a better chance against the CAA as well when they play them this afternoon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49392812/c-a-a-and-lake-forest-meet/|title=C.

Thomas scores the first Touchdown, followed by Blaney twice to end the first half.  Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.  Although the score is large, one writer for The Inter Ocean newspaper claimed that CAA played horribly.  He asserted that \"if yesterday's showing is a test of the ability at the game, it [The Chicago AA team] would have to work hard to defeat the Yohokas Pigskin Pelters or any like organization.\"  In other news, the CAA would hold a practice with the Illinois Cycling Club this afternoon, the last practice before their trip east on October 24th at 10:30 A.

Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT Engineers\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated.\n\n'''October 31st-''' The Philadelphia Inquirer named Chicago AA,\"strongest eleven in the west, college or otherwise.\"  The game against Penn decided to be at 3:00 in the afternoon, with an admission of 50 cents, and an extra 25 for reserved seating.  It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.\n\n===October 29: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs Penn\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= Penn Quakers\n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= [[Laurie Bliss]]\n|Umpire= Leonard and Hatfield\n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= Woodruff\n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.
