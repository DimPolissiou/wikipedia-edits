There were too many airlines in Anchorage at the time, and not enough demand to support them. In the next few years the airline performed many mergers and acquisitions that produced changes in the name and saw business expand throughout Alaska. The first of these mergers was in 1934, when McGee sold his namesake airline for US$50,000 to [[Star Air Service]], an airline also located in Anchorage. This allowed McGee to enter the mining industry.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\">{{cite news|last=Glab |first=Jim |title=Alaska Airlines 75th Anniversary |url=http://atwonline.com/it-distribution/article/alaska-airlines-75th-anniversary-0309 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503104421/http://atwonline.com/it-distribution/article/alaska-airlines-75th-anniversary-0309 |work=[[Air Transport World]] |archivedate=May 3, 2012 |access-date=May 17, 2012 |date=December 1, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> With a fleet of fifteen aircraft, Star Air Service was a dominant airline in Alaska.

That year, Star Air Service purchased Alaska Interior Airlines and was incorporated as '''Star Air Lines'''.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/> Star was again sold later that year to a group of miners.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1938, federal regulation began when Congress created the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB). The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between [[Seattle]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] was awarded to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]].<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the [[Merrill Field|Anchorage airport]]. That year, the airline's name was changed to '''Alaska Star Airlines'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> The name '''Alaska Airlines''' was adopted on May 2, 1944, having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name.<ref name=history_link /> In the 1940s Alaska's headquarters were in Anchorage.<ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3sMKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3671,3196652&dq=alaska-airlines+new+headquarters&hl=en Alaska Airlines Gets New Chief].

During the war, the airline lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar]], its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year the company's stock was traded for the very first time on the [[American Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Expansion after World War II (1945\u20131949)===\n[[File:DC-3 on ice colors adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of a silver Douglas DC-3 aircraft parked on snow-covered ground.|An Alaska Airlines Douglas DC-3, one of the aircraft purchased by the airline after World War II]]\nIn 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1947, jockey James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /><ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\"/> Under his leadership, the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II. The airline purchased [[Douglas DC-3]]s, [[Douglas DC-4]]s and [[Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando]]s.<ref name=history_link /> Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC-3s on skis.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nAlaska Airlines' large charter business made it profitable, and the airline moved its base of operations to [[Paine Field]], an airport north of Seattle. It kept a branch office in Anchorage, however. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines' worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations. The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights, and president James Wooten left the company.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />  Also in 1949, Alaska Air began operating five [[Bell 47]]B helicopters in order to support oil exploration on the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>\"Alaska Airlines\" by Cliff & Nancy Hollebeck, http://www.hollenbeckproductions.com</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the airline was a major participant in an effort by the newly established state of Israel to airlift Jews out of [[Yemen]] to [[Israel]] in what became known as [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]. C-46 or DC-4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3,000 mile flight, made necessary to avoid overflying Arab nations. Planes flew from [[Eritrea]] to [[Aden]], then along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to [[Tel Aviv]]. After unloading the refugees, crews then immediately continued to Cyprus, afraid to stay on the ground in Tel Aviv in fear of being bombed. Some 49,000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers without a single loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Operation Magic Carpet|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/magic-carpet.aspx|website=AlaskaAir}}</ref>\n\n===New leadership (1950s)===\nAlaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, '''Collins Air Service''' and '''Al Jones Airways'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThough the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Also, Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States; this award would become permanent in 1957.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis, Jr. became the company's new president and CEO. A pilot during World War II, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day. Under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service of the [[Douglas DC-6]], the airline's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6's, the airline introduced \"Golden Nugget\" service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Jet age (1960s)===\n[[File:Convair 880-61 Alaska AL in flight 1961.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Left side view of an aircraft in flight|The Convair 880 was Alaska Airlines' first jet aircraft.]]\nIn 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer [[Convair]] to purchase a [[Convair 880]] jetliner with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year. In 1966 the company received its first [[Boeing 727-100]] jets and removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners. Several of Alaska's first 727s were series 100C models which could be operated either as all cargo freighters, in an all passenger configuration or as mixed passenger/freight [[combi aircraft]].<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 aircraft</ref>  In the spring of 1967, greatly increased passenger loads required quick addition of fleet aircraft and Alaska purchased a [[Convair 990]] jetliner formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier [[Varig]] as PP-VJE which then became Alaska Airlines N987AS. This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727-100's which were then joined by stretched [[Boeing 727-200]]s which in turn became Alaska Airlines' signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It also became the first carrier to fly the [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules]] (L382 model), the civil version of the military [[C-130]] cargo turboprop, which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] and later to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Alaska also owned [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliners including two [[Lockheed L-1649A Starliner]]s from 1962 to 1968, and three L-1049's which were used for [[Military Air Transport Service]] operations.<ref>[http://calclassic.com/starliner.htm California Classic Propliners \u2013 L-1649A Starliners]; Gibson, Tom \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N7316C.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N7316C c/n 1018]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N8083H.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N8083H c/n 1038]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref>  Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were also operated, including the [[Convair 240]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and Super [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[amphibian aircraft]] as well as two versions of the [[Grumman Goose]] [[amphibian aircraft]], one with piston engines and the other model being a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the \"Turbo-Goose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/as.htm|website=timetableimages.com|title=June 1, 1967; June 1, 1969 & Sept. 14, 1970 Alaska Airlines system timetables}}</ref> The Catalina and Grumman amphibian seaplane aircraft joined the fleet when the airline acquired local southeast Alaska operator [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] in 1968.\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-100 Alaska Airlines Gilliand.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft parked on the tarmac, with a tree-covered hill as well as some clouds and buildings in the background|A Boeing 727-100 at [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]]. The airline introduced this type in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nDuring this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition from other airlines such as [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Pan Am]] and [[Pacific Northern Airlines]], the latter being an Alaska-based air carrier operating [[Boeing 720]] jetliners which was subsequently acquired by and merged into [[Western Airlines]] in 1967. Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated [[Boeing 747]] wide body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle\u2013Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle\u2013Fairbanks nonstop with the 747.  To set itself apart from the competition, Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, staging fashion shows in the aisles and having bingo games on board while en route.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn December 1962 [[Air Guin\u00e9e]] signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise, in addition to two [[Douglas DC-4]]s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period but the contract ended after only six months, leading to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the [[Guinea]]n airline to Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"guttery\">{{cite book |last=Guttery |first=Ben R. |title=Encyclopedia of African airlines |publisher=Ben R. Guttery |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=78\u201379 |isbn=0-7864-0495-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, as well as some smaller aircraft, to [[Wien Air Alaska]]. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. In an attempt to increase the state's appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional \"Gay Nineties\" theme with stewardesses dressed in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Economic hardship (1970s)===\n[[File:Boeing 727-200Adv Alaska Airlines Durand.jpg|thumb|alt=Left side view of an aircraft approaching an airport, with its nose pitched down slightly.

The airline gained permission to fly more than two-dozen flights in 1970, 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Alaska Airlines was also operating [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]] jetliners in scheduled passenger service between destinations in Alaska and Seattle during the early and mid 1970s.<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 aircraft at Anchorage (ANC) and Seattle (SEA)</ref>\n\nHowever, the airline was not in good financial shape at that time. Like much of the airline industry, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy.<ref name=history_link /> Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] was delayed. The airline's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a [[Boeing 727-100]] jetliner [[Alaska Airlines Flight 1866|crashed]] on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America's worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, the airline's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. The airline was {{US$|22}} million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. The airline's cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline's tarnished image of \"Elastic Airlines.\"<!--\"Elastic Airlines\" is mentioned in the source at the end of the paragraph.--> The logo was changed to an image of a smiling [[Eskimo]], which remains today. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Post-deregulation expansion (1978\u20131990)===\nAlaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 [[Airline Deregulation Act]], knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> After deregulation, the company's real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor [[Wien Air Alaska]], but this ultimately failed, and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition. Wien Air was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in 1984, and never merged into Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nAt the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US \u2014the city of Seattle\u2014, and it had only ten planes in its fleet.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], and it also introduced service to [[Palm Springs, California]]. [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] were added in 1981.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1979, Alaska also studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with [[Hughes Air West]], however this never came to fruition. Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline's route map by 1985 were [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in [[California]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in [[Idaho]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" />\n\nDeregulation also brought challenges to the airline, however. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits and salaries. By 1979, competitors [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Western Airlines]] were both flying wide body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jets on the core Anchorage\u2013Seattle nonstop route with additional competition being provided by [[Wien Air Alaska]] which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Anchorage schedules</ref>  Northwest was operating nonstop DC-10 service on the Fairbanks\u2013Seattle route at this time as well.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Fairbanks schedules</ref>  There were also tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants.<ref name=history_link /> In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its [[machinist]]s. By June the same year, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called ''Gold Streak'' with service to and from Alaska.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n[[File:Alaska Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83 N958AS.jpg|thumb|alt=Right side view of an airplane taxiing on the ground towards left side of image.

In an effort to compensate for this, the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]]. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska. The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger, more profitable markets.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===\n[[File:Alaska-737-4QB-YVR.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft on final approach with blue sky in the background.|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400]] landing at [[Vancouver International Airport]]]]\nThe airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400s]] from [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC).<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.<ref name=\"1st B734 delivered\">{{cite news|title=Alaska To Get 1st Delivery of Boeing 737-400 order|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920417&slug=1487017|access-date=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 17, 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the [[Russian Far East]], it added the cities of [[Magadan]] and [[Khabarovsk]], as well as service to [[Toronto]], its first Canadian city and the first city east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. However, Toronto was later dropped in 1992<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> and the Russian destinations in 1998.<ref name=\"Russia-flights-ended\" />\n\nAs the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also faced increased competition from [[low-cost carrier]]s. One carrier that competed with Alaska was [[MarkAir]]. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. Mark Air offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; for the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of {{US$|121}} million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth {{US$|2}} billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nThe cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to {{US$|45}} million and they made a {{US$|40}} million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline [[Southwest Airlines]] entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing [[Morris Air]]. Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline also promoted itself as \"the last great airline\" and with the motto \"For the same price, you just get more\", yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/><ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants' union.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. Their last 727 was retired in March 1994.<ref name=\"AS-retires-727s\" /> The airline's MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.<ref name=\"AS-Fleet-1996_FI\">{{cite web|title=World Airline Directory 1996|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200672.html |publisher=[[Flight International]]|access-date=May 1, 2012|date=March 20, 1996}}</ref>\n\nVecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an \"open skies\" agreement between the US and Canada.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a heads-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first U.S. airline to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline's planes carried [[automated external defibrillator]]s, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline also installed self-service kiosks called \"Instant Travel Machines\" that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter. An X-ray device, an addition to the unit allowing passengers to check their own baggage was being tested in 1999 at Anchorage.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> This concept, known as \"Airport of the Future\" by the airline, was first tested in Anchorage and was later brought to its Seattle hub, and it drew attention from other airlines as well.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /> The airline would also become the first airline in the world to integrate [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[Ground proximity warning system|Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System]] (EGPWS) technology, adding a real-time, three-dimensional display of terrain. The system was operational in all the carrier's Boeing 737-400s by April 1999.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThe late 1990s also saw the carrier recording much profitability. The airline added new training and maintenance facilities.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Also, the airline began buying new 737s, ordering three [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-700|Boeing 737-700s]] and becoming the launch customer for the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-900|Boeing 737-900]] when it placed an order for ten of the jets in November 1997.<ref name=\"Launch customer for B737-900\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_971110b.html|title=Alaska Airlines Order Launches Boeing 737-900 Program|date=November 10, 1997|publisher=[[Boeing]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106182308/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_971110b.html|archivedate=November 6, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=July 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"737Order-1997_ST\">{{cite news|last=Lane |first=Polly |title=Boeing Gets $2 Billion In New Orders For Jets |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971110&slug=2571462 |access-date=July 4, 2012 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 10, 1997 |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517022655/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971110&slug=2571462 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Introducing flights across the U.S. (2000s)===\n[[File:B737-900 Alaska Seatac.JPG|thumb|left|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Next Generation#737-900|Boeing 737-900]] at Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport.

In 2005, due to the greater efficiency of the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]] and rising costs for maintenance, fuel and crew training, Alaska Airlines decided to phase out the remaining 26 MD-80s and trained the pilots to fly the newer 737-800s that were being ordered to replace them. The last MD-80 flights took place on August 25, 2008.<ref name=\"md80 retired\" />\n\nAlaska also used eight [[Boeing 737#737-200|Boeing 737-200 Combi/QCs]] to suit the unique needs of flying in the state of Alaska. These [[combi aircraft]] operated with mixed load of passengers and freight on the main deck were valued for their ability to be rapidly reconfigured (hence the moniker QC or \"Quick Change\") to match the specific cargo and passenger loads for any given flight. In the all-freight configuration, the 737-200 Combis carried up to six cargo containers, known as \"igloos.\" The palletized floor allowed for passenger seating to range from 26 to 72 seats.

In its report, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the [[horizontal stabilizer]]'s trim system. The failure happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident.

The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between [[Seattle]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] was awarded to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]].<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the [[Merrill Field|Anchorage airport]]. That year, the airline's name was changed to '''Alaska Star Airlines'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> The name '''Alaska Airlines''' was adopted on May 2, 1944, having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name.<ref name=history_link /> In the 1940s Alaska's headquarters were in Anchorage.<ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3sMKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5U4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3671,3196652&dq=alaska-airlines+new+headquarters&hl=en Alaska Airlines Gets New Chief].

During the war, the airline lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar]], its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year the company's stock was traded for the very first time on the [[American Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Expansion after World War II (1945\u20131949)===\n[[File:DC-3 on ice colors adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of a silver Douglas DC-3 aircraft parked on snow-covered ground.|An Alaska Airlines Douglas DC-3, one of the aircraft purchased by the airline after World War II]]\nIn 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1947, jockey James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /><ref name=\"AS 1940s HQ\"/> Under his leadership, the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II. The airline purchased [[Douglas DC-3]]s, [[Douglas DC-4]]s and [[Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando]]s.<ref name=history_link /> Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC-3s on skis.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nAlaska Airlines' large charter business made it profitable, and the airline moved its base of operations to [[Paine Field]], an airport north of Seattle. It kept a branch office in Anchorage, however. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines' worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations. The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights, and president James Wooten left the company.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />  Also in 1949, Alaska Air began operating five [[Bell 47]]B helicopters in order to support oil exploration on the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary-wing aircraft.<ref>\"Alaska Airlines\" by Cliff & Nancy Hollebeck, http://www.hollenbeckproductions.com</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the airline was a major participant in an effort by the newly established state of Israel to airlift Jews out of [[Yemen]] to [[Israel]] in what became known as [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]. C-46 or DC-4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3,000 mile flight, made necessary to avoid overflying Arab nations. Planes flew from [[Eritrea]] to [[Aden]], then along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] to [[Tel Aviv]]. After unloading the refugees, crews then immediately continued to Cyprus, afraid to stay on the ground in Tel Aviv in fear of being bombed. Some 49,000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers without a single loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Operation Magic Carpet|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/history/magic-carpet.aspx|website=AlaskaAir}}</ref>\n\n===New leadership (1950s)===\nAlaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, '''Collins Air Service''' and '''Al Jones Airways'''.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nThough the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Also, Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States; this award would become permanent in 1957.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nIn 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis, Jr. became the company's new president and CEO. A pilot during World War II, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day. Under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service of the [[Douglas DC-6]], the airline's first [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]] plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6's, the airline introduced \"Golden Nugget\" service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Jet age (1960s)===\n[[File:Convair 880-61 Alaska AL in flight 1961.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Left side view of an aircraft in flight|The Convair 880 was Alaska Airlines' first jet aircraft.]]\nIn 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer [[Convair]] to purchase a [[Convair 880]] jetliner with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year. In 1966 the company received its first [[Boeing 727-100]] jets and removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners. Several of Alaska's first 727s were series 100C models which could be operated either as all cargo freighters, in an all passenger configuration or as mixed passenger/freight [[combi aircraft]].<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 aircraft</ref>  In the spring of 1967, greatly increased passenger loads required quick addition of fleet aircraft and Alaska purchased a [[Convair 990]] jetliner formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier [[Varig]] as PP-VJE which then became Alaska Airlines N987AS. This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727-100's which were then joined by stretched [[Boeing 727-200]]s which in turn became Alaska Airlines' signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It also became the first carrier to fly the [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules]] (L382 model), the civil version of the military [[C-130]] cargo turboprop, which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska's [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] and later to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Alaska also owned [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliners including two [[Lockheed L-1649A Starliner]]s from 1962 to 1968, and three L-1049's which were used for [[Military Air Transport Service]] operations.<ref>[http://calclassic.com/starliner.htm California Classic Propliners \u2013 L-1649A Starliners]; Gibson, Tom \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N7316C.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N7316C c/n 1018]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref><ref>[http://conniesurvivors.com/N8083H.htm Lockheed Constellation Survivors \u2013 N8083H c/n 1038]; Petersen, Ralph M. \u2013 ''Retrieved 11/5/10''</ref>  Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were also operated, including the [[Convair 240]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and Super [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[amphibian aircraft]] as well as two versions of the [[Grumman Goose]] [[amphibian aircraft]], one with piston engines and the other model being a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the \"Turbo-Goose\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/as.htm|website=timetableimages.com|title=June 1, 1967; June 1, 1969 & Sept. 14, 1970 Alaska Airlines system timetables}}</ref> The Catalina and Grumman amphibian seaplane aircraft joined the fleet when the airline acquired local southeast Alaska operator [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] in 1968.\n\n[[File:Boeing 727-100 Alaska Airlines Gilliand.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft parked on the tarmac, with a tree-covered hill as well as some clouds and buildings in the background|A Boeing 727-100 at [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]]. The airline introduced this type in the mid-1960s.]]\n\nDuring this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition from other airlines such as [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Pan Am]] and [[Pacific Northern Airlines]], the latter being an Alaska-based air carrier operating [[Boeing 720]] jetliners which was subsequently acquired by and merged into [[Western Airlines]] in 1967. Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated [[Boeing 747]] wide body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle\u2013Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle\u2013Fairbanks nonstop with the 747.  To set itself apart from the competition, Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, staging fashion shows in the aisles and having bingo games on board while en route.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nIn December 1962 [[Air Guin\u00e9e]] signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise, in addition to two [[Douglas DC-4]]s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period but the contract ended after only six months, leading to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the [[Guinea]]n airline to Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"guttery\">{{cite book |last=Guttery |first=Ben R. |title=Encyclopedia of African airlines |publisher=Ben R. Guttery |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=78\u201379 |isbn=0-7864-0495-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, as well as some smaller aircraft, to [[Wien Air Alaska]]. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. In an attempt to increase the state's appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional \"Gay Nineties\" theme with stewardesses dressed in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]] and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Economic hardship (1970s)===\n[[File:Boeing 727-200Adv Alaska Airlines Durand.jpg|thumb|alt=Left side view of an aircraft approaching an airport, with its nose pitched down slightly.

The airline gained permission to fly more than two-dozen flights in 1970, 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"AS-75thAnniversary_ATW\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> Alaska Airlines was also operating [[Boeing 707]], [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]] jetliners in scheduled passenger service between destinations in Alaska and Seattle during the early and mid 1970s.<ref>http://www.airliners.net, photos of Alaska Airlines Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 aircraft at Anchorage (ANC) and Seattle (SEA)</ref>\n\nHowever, the airline was not in good financial shape at that time. Like much of the airline industry, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy.<ref name=history_link /> Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] was delayed. The airline's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a [[Boeing 727-100]] jetliner [[Alaska Airlines Flight 1866|crashed]] on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America's worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, the airline's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. The airline was {{US$|22}} million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. The airline's cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline's tarnished image of \"Elastic Airlines.\"<!--\"Elastic Airlines\" is mentioned in the source at the end of the paragraph.--> The logo was changed to an image of a smiling [[Eskimo]], which remains today. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===Post-deregulation expansion (1978\u20131990)===\nAlaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 [[Airline Deregulation Act]], knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> After deregulation, the company's real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor [[Wien Air Alaska]], but this ultimately failed, and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition. Wien Air was [[Liquidation|liquidated]] in 1984, and never merged into Alaska Airlines.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\nAt the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US \u2014the city of Seattle\u2014, and it had only ten planes in its fleet.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /> Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], and it also introduced service to [[Palm Springs, California]]. [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] were added in 1981.<ref name=\"history by decade\" /><ref name=\"alaska air group history\" /> In 1979, Alaska also studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with [[Hughes Air West]], however this never came to fruition. Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline's route map by 1985 were [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in [[California]], [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in [[Idaho]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"history by decade\" />\n\nDeregulation also brought challenges to the airline, however. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits and salaries. By 1979, competitors [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[Western Airlines]] were both flying wide body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jets on the core Anchorage\u2013Seattle nonstop route with additional competition being provided by [[Wien Air Alaska]] which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Anchorage schedules</ref>  Northwest was operating nonstop DC-10 service on the Fairbanks\u2013Seattle route at this time as well.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle\u2013Fairbanks schedules</ref>  There were also tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants.<ref name=history_link /> In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its [[machinist]]s. By June the same year, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called ''Gold Streak'' with service to and from Alaska.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n[[File:Alaska Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-83 N958AS.jpg|thumb|alt=Right side view of an airplane taxiing on the ground towards left side of image.

In an effort to compensate for this, the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]]. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska. The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger, more profitable markets.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\" />\n\n===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===\n[[File:Alaska-737-4QB-YVR.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right side view of an aircraft on final approach with blue sky in the background.|An Alaska Airlines [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400]] landing at [[Vancouver International Airport]]]]\nThe airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-400|Boeing 737-400s]] from [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC).<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.<ref name=\"1st B734 delivered\">{{cite news|title=Alaska To Get 1st Delivery of Boeing 737-400 order|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920417&slug=1487017|access-date=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 17, 1992}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the [[Russian Far East]], it added the cities of [[Magadan]] and [[Khabarovsk]], as well as service to [[Toronto]], its first Canadian city and the first city east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. However, Toronto was later dropped in 1992<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> and the Russian destinations in 1998.<ref name=\"Russia-flights-ended\" />\n\nAs the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also faced increased competition from [[low-cost carrier]]s. One carrier that competed with Alaska was [[MarkAir]]. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. Mark Air offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; for the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of {{US$|121}} million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth {{US$|2}} billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nThe cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to {{US$|45}} million and they made a {{US$|40}} million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline [[Southwest Airlines]] entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing [[Morris Air]]. Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline also promoted itself as \"the last great airline\" and with the motto \"For the same price, you just get more\", yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts.<ref name=\"history by decade\"/><ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/> At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants' union.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. Their last 727 was retired in March 1994.<ref name=\"AS-retires-727s\" /> The airline's MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.<ref name=\"AS-Fleet-1996_FI\">{{cite web|title=World Airline Directory 1996|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200672.html |publisher=[[Flight International]]|access-date=May 1, 2012|date=March 20, 1996}}</ref>\n\nVecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an \"open skies\" agreement between the US and Canada.<ref name=\"alaska air group history\"/>\n\nAlaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a heads-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first U.S. airline to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline's planes carried [[automated external defibrillator]]s, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline also installed self-service kiosks called \"Instant Travel Machines\" that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter.

In its report, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the [[horizontal stabilizer]]'s trim system. The failure happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident.

Out of control drinking has consequences.\" The director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland said Diageo \"blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them. The belief that drunk girls are 'asking for it' is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it. [...] This is a harmful, regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable. Survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner. This latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning. The out-of-control campaign which started by asking women if they were 'embarrassed' while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position, has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/rape-crisis-network-slams-rape-victim-blaming-ads-667305.html|title=Rape Crisis Network slams 'rape victim blaming' ads|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=12 March 2015|accessdate=12 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312163328/http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/rape-crisis-network-slams-rape-victim-blaming-ads-667305.html|archivedate=12 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2016, Diageo announced its intention of selling at auction [[Sir Edwin Landseer]]'s iconic 1851 painting ''[[The Monarch of the Glen (painting)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'' \u2013 which the company owns, but which has been on loan to the [[National Museum of Scotland]] since 1999 \u2013 as it had \"no direct link to our business or brands\".

Out of control drinking has consequences.\" The director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland said Diageo \"blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them. The belief that drunk girls are 'asking for it' is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it. [...] This is a harmful, regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable. Survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner.

And in the case of \"The Outsider\", it's sung from the perspective of a person who doesn't understand at all what their friend is going through, what their loved one is going through, and they think that it's more like a sprained ankle; they can just kind of walk it off.\"<ref>''[[Amotion]]'', [[A Perfect Circle]], [[DVD]] commentary</ref></blockquote>\n\nKeenan, not having struggled with addiction first-hand, drew from experiencing it happen to others around him, such as [[Layne Staley]], the lead singer of [[Alice in Chains]], who died in 2002 due to [[drug addiction]].<ref name=\"mtvnews\" /> The song \"The Package\" is from the perspective of an addict, desperate for more, while \"[[Blue (A Perfect Circle song)|Blue]]\" is from the perspective of someone having a difficult time dealing with the aftermath of an overdose.<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n\n\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\" is a cover of the song by [[Failure (band)|Failure]], originally featured on the 1996 album ''[[Fantastic Planet (album)|Fantastic Planet]]''.\n\n==Release and promotion==\nThe album was released on September 16, 2003, and debuted at number 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts, with 231,000 copies sold.<ref name=\"blabbermouth\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/a-perfect-circle-guitarist-to-release-ashes-divide-debut-in-march/|title=A PERFECT CIRCLE Guitarist To Release ASHES DIVIDE Debut In March|first=|last=Blabbermouth|date=November 28, 2007|publisher=}}</ref> Three singles were released from the album, \"Weak and Powerless\", which topped both the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Modern Rock Tracks]], \"The Outsider\", and \"[[Blue (A Perfect Circle song)|Blue]]\".<ref name=\"blabbermouth\" /> \"Weak and Powerless\" and \"The Outsider\" managed to crossover into mainstream pop radio formats as well, with the two charting at number 61 and 79 respectively on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts.

I have a lot of friends who've gone through a lot of these situations. Some of the songs are sung from the perspective of the actual drug, from the perspective of someone who has realized that they have an issue or a problem, also from the perspective of a person who realizes that if they don't do something they're going to die, a song from the perspective of a person who is in denial about a loved one, dying right before their eyes. And in the case of \"The Outsider\", it's sung from the perspective of a person who doesn't understand at all what their friend is going through, what their loved one is going through, and they think that it's more like a sprained ankle; they can just kind of walk it off.\"<ref>''[[Amotion]]'', [[A Perfect Circle]], [[DVD]] commentary</ref></blockquote>\n\nKeenan, not having struggled with addiction first-hand, drew from experiencing it happen to others around him, such as [[Layne Staley]], the lead singer of [[Alice in Chains]], who died in 2002 due to [[drug addiction]].<ref name=\"mtvnews\" /> The song \"The Package\" is from the perspective of an addict, desperate for more, while \"[[Blue (A Perfect Circle song)|Blue]]\" is from the perspective of someone having a difficult time dealing with the aftermath of an overdose.<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n\n\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\" is a cover of the song by [[Failure (band)|Failure]], originally featured on the 1996 album ''[[Fantastic Planet (album)|Fantastic Planet]]''.\n\n==Release and promotion==\nThe album was released on September 16, 2003, and debuted at number 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts, with 231,000 copies sold.<ref name=\"blabbermouth\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/a-perfect-circle-guitarist-to-release-ashes-divide-debut-in-march/|title=A PERFECT CIRCLE Guitarist To Release ASHES DIVIDE Debut In March|first=|last=Blabbermouth|date=November 28, 2007|publisher=}}</ref> Three singles were released from the album, \"Weak and Powerless\", which topped both the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Modern Rock Tracks]], \"The Outsider\", and \"[[Blue (A Perfect Circle song)|Blue]]\".<ref name=\"blabbermouth\" /> \"Weak and Powerless\" and \"The Outsider\" managed to crossover into mainstream pop radio formats as well, with the two charting at number 61 and 79 respectively on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts.

Stokes comprises {{convert|16447|acre|km2}} of mountainous woods in the [[Kittatinny Mountains]], extending from the southern boundary of [[High Point State Park]] southwestward to the eastern boundary of the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]. The park is operated and maintained by the [[New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry]].\n\n==History==\n\nStokes State Forest was created in 1907 when Governor [[Edward C. Stokes|Edward Stokes]] donated {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land on [[Kittatinny Mountains]] and the State of New Jersey purchased {{convert|5432|acre|km2}} of land.  Due to the governor's generous donation, the forest was named Stokes State forest.  The forest started with {{convert|5932|acre|km2}} of land and through the years, additional purchases were made to bring the forest to over {{convert|16000|acre|km2}}.  Trails through the forest were made in the 1930s by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] as well as white pine trees being planted.\n\nDuring the 19th century the forests in New Jersey were cut down for farming and for lumber.  Stokes was created to preserve the forests on the Kittatinny Mountains.\n\n==Geology==\n\nAround five hundred  million years ago, an [[Volcanic arc|arcuate chain of volcanic islands]] collided with proto-North America.  The North American plate was [[Subduction|subducted]] under the chain of islands.  The islands overrode the edge of North America, creating the Highlands and Kittatinny Valley which is of the [[Ordovician]] Martinsburg Shale.  Quartz and the sedimentary [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] was transported to an inland sea, which was over part of the Martinsburg [[shale]]. The [[quartz]] was deposited over the Martinsburg shale.\n\nThen around four hundred million years ago a small continent, long and thin, collided with proto-North America, compressing the bedrock. The Kittatinny Mountains were created due to folding and faulting of the [[Silurian]] Shawangunk conglomerate which is made of quartz.  This stone was in a shallow sea above the Martinsburg shale when folding occurred, producing heat in which the quartz bent. Then the quartz was cemented together with other small stones from silica. Due to the hardness of the stone, this makes the mountain highly resistant to weathering.\n\nOver millions of years, the mountain weathered from wind, rain, snow and ice.\n\nThe [[Wisconsin Glacier]] covered Stokes State Forest and the Kittatinny Mountains from 21,000 BC to 13,000 BC.  The glacier left [[Terminal moraine|end moraines]], [[kettle hole]]s and periglacial rock fields.\n\nThe Big Flat Brook is a shallow stream which starts in the mountain swamp of Steam Mill and travels in a southwesterly direction. It empties into the [[Delaware River]] near Flatbrookville.  This stream is stocked by the New Jersey Fish and Game with [[rainbow trout]] and [[brown trout]].  This stream is considered one of the premier fishing streams in the state of New Jersey.\n\nIn the 1880s, [[John Snook]] dug a mine and extracted [[silver]] ore.  He was paid well for the ore and the silver quickly ran out.  This mine, which is filled with water today, is not far from the Kittle Field picnic area or about a mile and a half north of the forest office.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nStokes forest is a northern deciduous forest in the north eastern Appalachians composed of various oaks, hickories, maples, as well as birch, chestnuts, beech, sycamore, cherry, walnut, ash, elm, and other hardwood tree species.\nRhododendron, mountain laurel, high and low bush blueberries, grow in the forest as well as various mosses and ferns.\nBig game animals such as white tailed deer and bear inhabit the forest.  Also there is beaver, mink, raccoons, possums, skunks, chipmunks, gray and red squirrels, gray fox, as well as the Adirondack fisher. There is also eastern coyote and bobcat.\n\n==Sunrise Mountain==\nSunrise Mountain is part of the Kittatinny Mountains which goes from the [[New York (state)|New York]] State Line to Delaware Water Gap. This mountain was formed during the Silurian period and made of the Shawangunk conglomerate which is made of quartz.  Bedrock exposure of the Shawangunk conglomerate can be seen along the trail.\n\nThe pavilion at the top of the peak makes a great place to picnic. To make traveling to Sunrise more interesting, one can look for the New Jersey shaped rock.  The mountain is the second highest point in New Jersey, being {{convert|1653|ft|m}} above sea level.  Hikers are amazed with the view.  There is a USGS marker at the top of the mountain which gives the elevation. To get there, the hiking stretch is a quarter of a mile from a parking lot. Much of Sussex County can be seen from the summit of the mountain. From the eastern side of the mountain, one can view the Kittatinny Valley and the Highlands.  From the western side, the [[Delaware Valley]] and the [[Port Jervis]] trough can be seen. From the top of Sunrise Mountain you can see three states, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Appalachian Trail follows the ridge-line of the Kittatinny Mountains.  It is marked with short white stripes known as blazes on trees.\n\n==Stony Lake==\nStony Lake is an eight-acre lake that has a beach surrounded by picnic tables, pavilions, showers, dressing rooms, a new bathroom with flushing toilets.  The beach is host to many swimmers during the months of July and August.  The lake has life guards during swimming hours.  The lake also offers many spots to fish. One can explore the forest around the lake. There are admission prices to the lake.  There are also many playgrounds such as Kittle Field to take young children to.\n\n==Lake Ocquittunk==\n\n[[Lake Ocquittunk]] is a {{convert|6|acre|m2|adj=on}} lake shape like a U, located in Stokes State Forest.  There are eleven cabins around the lake that can be rented.  The N.J. Fish and game stocks the lake with rainbow and brown trout three times a year.  There is a small section of the lake on the other side of the road, that runs next to the lake.  Perch, bass, and pickerel also inhabit the lake.  A small stream runs into the lake and exits the lake.\n\n==Tillman Ravine==\nTillman Ravine Natural Area is a {{convert|525|acre|km2}} section of coniferous and deciduous forest surrounding Tillman Brook.  Tillman brook starts as a spring, which flows year round.  An [[old-growth forest]] of {{convert|25|acre|km2}} containing [[eastern hemlock]] and hardwoods follows part of the ravine.<ref name=\"oldGrowthEast\">{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/nj.pdf\n |title       = Old Growth in the East: A Survey.

Tillman Ravine is a habitat for the [[barred owl]] and other endangered species.\n\nThe ravine was created when the Wisconsin glacier melted and the melt water created a stream by traveling through the weaknesses of the bedrock of the Kittatinny Mountains. Tillman Creek flows over Buttermilk Falls and joins the [[Flat Brook]] in the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]] two-miles south of the hamlet of Walpack Centre in Walpack Township, New Jersey.\n\n==School of Conservation==\nThe [[New Jersey School of Conservation]] is one of the largest university run camps in the state of New Jersey, operated by and part of [[Montclair State University]], in [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]] as its Environmental Education Field Campus.  The \"school\" is host to music and environmental awareness camps. It is the largest and oldest university-operated environmental education center in the nation. It is located {{convert|57|mi|km}} from the Montclair campus on a {{convert|240|acre|ha}} tract in the center of Stokes State Forest.\n\nEach academic year the School of Conservation provides environmental education programs for nearly 9,000 elementary/secondary school students, and nearly 1,000 teachers from approximately 100 schools. There are also field courses for graduate students and weekend workshops designed to train pre-service and in-service teachers and youth leaders in environmental education curriculum development and field techniques. The school has become the focus of intense environmental research in recent years, with the establishment of MSU's Doctoral program in Environmental Management and the Passaic River Institute, among other major research initiatives.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of New Jersey state parks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.abandonedmines.net/snook.htm Stokes State Forest Silver Mine]\n* [http://www.nynjtc.org/park/stokes-state-forest NY-NJTC: Stokes State Forest Trail Details and Info]\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{New Jersey Parks}}\n\n[[Category:New Jersey state forests]]\n[[Category:State forests of the Appalachians]]\n[[Category:Parks in Sussex County, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Sandyston Township, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Frankford Township, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Montague Township, New Jersey]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox park\n| name           = Stokes State Forest\n| image          = {{#property:image}}\n| image_size     = \n| image_alt      = \n| image_caption  = Stokes State Forest, Sussex County\n| map            = USA New Jersey#USA\n| map_label      = Stokes State Forest\n| map_caption    = Location in [[New Jersey]]##Location in [[United States]]\n| type           = \n| location       = [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]]\n| nearest_city   = \n| coords         = {{WikidataCoord|display=title,inline}}\n| coords_ref     = <ref>{{Official website}}</ref>\n| area           = {{convert|16447|acre|km2|adj=on}}\n| created        = \n| operator       = [[{{#property:operator}}]]\n| visitation_num = \n| status         = \n| designation    = \n| opened         = {{#property:inception}}\n| website        = {{Official website}}\n}}\n\n'''Stokes State Forest''' is a [[state park]] located in [[Sandyston Township, New Jersey|Sandyston]], [[Montague Township, New Jersey|Montague]] and [[Frankford Township, New Jersey|Frankford]] in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. Stokes comprises {{convert|16447|acre|km2}} of mountainous woods in the [[Kittatinny Mountains]], extending from the southern boundary of [[High Point State Park]] southwestward to the eastern boundary of the [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]. The park is operated and maintained by the [[New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry]].\n\n==History==\n\nStokes State Forest was created in 1907 when Governor [[Edward C. Stokes|Edward Stokes]] donated {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land on [[Kittatinny Mountains]] and the State of New Jersey purchased {{convert|5432|acre|km2}} of land.  Due to the governor's generous donation, the forest was named Stokes State forest.  The forest started with {{convert|5932|acre|km2}} of land and through the years, additional purchases were made to bring the forest to over {{convert|16000|acre|km2}}.  Trails though the forest were made in the 1930s by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] as well as white pine trees being planted.\n\nDuring the 19th century the forests in New Jersey were cut down for farming and for lumber.  Stokes was created to preserve the forests on the Kittatinny Mountains.\n\n==Geology==\n\nAround five hundred  million years ago, an [[Volcanic arc|arcuate chain of volcanic islands]] collided with proto-North America.  The North American plate was [[Subduction|subducted]] under the chain of islands.  The islands overrode the edge of North America, creating the Highlands and Kittatinny Valley which is of the [[Ordovician]] Martinsburg Shale.  Quartz and the sedimentary [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] was transported to an inland sea, which was over part of the Martinsburg [[shale]]. The [[quartz]] was deposited over the Martinsburg shale.\n\nThen around four hundred million years ago a small continent, long and thin, collided with proto-North America, compressing the bedrock. The Kittatinny Mountains were created due to folding and faulting of the [[Silurian]] Shawangunk conglomerate which is made of quartz.  This stone was in a shallow sea above the Martinsburg shale when folding occurred, producing heat in which the quartz bent. Then the quartz was cemented together with other small stones from silica.

Moreover, the collage principle of writing practiced by him excludes the presence of an authorial lyrical voice.

It combines the rationality of a subtle analyst and an impartial critic with an exquisite poetic instinct. After the Silver Age (Andrei Bely, Vyach. Ivanov, Osip Mandelstam), the combination of theorist and poet in one person almost disappeared from Russian literature. Skidan has a line between the world of criticism, mental play and the world of poetry, which does not allow a direct invasion of the analytic concept into poetry. But determining where this line passes is not easy\". - <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uglyducklingpresse.org/publications/red-shifting/|title=Aleksandr Skidan Red Shifting|last=|first=|date=|website=Ugly Duckling Presse|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Mikhail Yampolsky\n\n== Skidan's Poetics ==\nSkidan explores subjects of postmodern russian poetics. The subjects range from politics( ex. poem, \"''Kondratievsky Prospect\"'', Red Shifting (2008) pg.65), sexual assault (ex. Travesty, Red Shifting (2008) pg. 3), and modern western influence (\"Piercing of the Lower Lip\", Red Shifting (2008) pg. 107). Amoung his many subjects, Skidan introduces themes of freedom, modernity, imagination, visualization, and metaphors to build the architecture of his writing. Skidan is a technical writer, who constantly revises his work. Skidan's work explores political and social aspects of life in post soviet Russia. Skidan also explores themes of dialogue in some of his poems, which not only help the reader to visualize his poetry, but emphasize it's hidden meaning.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skidan, Aleksandr}}\n[[Category:Russian male poets]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1965 births]]\n[[Category:Writers from Saint Petersburg]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Skidan, Alexander.JPG|thumb]]\n'''Alexsandr <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cultin.ru/writers-skidan-aleksandr-vadimovich|title=Cultin features Aleksandr Skidan|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Vadimovich Skidan '''(\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d, born December 29, 1965, in [[Leningrad]]) is a well known author of Russian poetry and a translator of both American poetry and American and European literary theory.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readab.com/askidan.html|title=(READING BETWEEN A and B: Aleksandr Skidan|last=|first=|date=2020|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref>''' Skidan is known as one of Russia's most important contemporary poets.\n\n== Works and publishing ==\nSkidan has a collection of works, that include the following.

The temptation to find your own unique subjectivity in the zone of its fundamental impossibility, in the zone of unconditional triumph of impersonal foreign speech, gleaned from a high cultural archive or from a low household vocabulary ... Moreover, the collage principle of writing practiced by him excludes the presence of an authorial lyrical voice. That is why the inevitable explosive effect arises, caused by the uncertainty and decay of the subject of the utterance.\"- <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uglyducklingpresse.org/publications/red-shifting/|title=Aleksandr Skidan Red Shifting|last=|first=|date=|website=Ugly Duckling Presse|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> Dmitry Golynko-Wolfson\n\n\"Alexander Skidan is a unique phenomenon for modern Russian literature. It combines the rationality of a subtle analyst and an impartial critic with an exquisite poetic instinct. After the Silver Age (Andrei Bely, Vyach. Ivanov, Osip Mandelstam), the combination of theorist and poet in one person almost disappeared from Russian literature. Skidan has a line between the world of criticism, mental play and the world of poetry, which does not allow a direct invasion of the analytic concept into poetry. But determining where this line passes is not easy\". - <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uglyducklingpresse.org/publications/red-shifting/|title=Aleksandr Skidan Red Shifting|last=|first=|date=|website=Ugly Duckling Presse|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Mikhail Yampolsky\n\n== Skidan's Poetics ==\nSkidan explores subjects of postmodern russian poetics. The subjects range from politics( ex. poem, \"''Kondratievsky Prospect\"'', Red Shifting (2008) pg.65), sexual assault (ex. Travesty, Red Shifting (2008) pg. 3), and modern western influence (\"Piercing of the Lower Lip\", Red Shifting (2008) pg. 107). Amoung his many subjects, Skidan introduces themes of freedom, modernity, imagination, visualization, and metaphors to build the architecture of his writing. Skidan is a technical writer, who constantly revises his work. Skidan's work explores political and social aspects of life in post soviet Russia. Skidan also explores themes of dialogue in some of his poems, which not only help the reader to visualize his poetry, but emphasize it's hidden meaning.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skidan, Aleksandr}}\n[[Category:Russian male poets]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1965 births]]\n[[Category:Writers from Saint Petersburg]]\n", "name_user": "Amoshkin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correct name spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Skidan"}

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims, including those who died from [[AIDS]] and [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]]. \n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates at the [[Rikers Island]] jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available. Prior to 2019, several laws to transfer jurisdiction to the Parks Department had been proposed to ease public access to Hart Island.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are numerous theories about the possible origins for the island's name.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims, including those who died from [[AIDS]] and [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]]. \n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates at the [[Rikers Island]] jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available.
