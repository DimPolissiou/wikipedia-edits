It offers full-time and part-time programs at the baccalaureate, diploma, certificate and graduate levels.\n\n==History==\nSeneca opened in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to establish an Ontario-wide network of colleges of applied arts and technology providing career-oriented [[diploma]] and [[Academic certificate|certificate]] courses as well as [[continuing education]] programs to [[Ontario]] communities.  The province was responding to the increasing need for sophisticated applied learning as technology continued to change the nature of work and the provincial economy. General education was considered an important element in postsecondary education, and breadth courses continue to be a part of every program.  In 2001 the colleges were granted the ability to offer baccalaureate degrees.  Seneca is one of six colleges that can offer up to 15 per cent of its program activity at the degree level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/32379/1/M%20Skolnik%20-%20Baccalaureate.pdf|format=PDF|title=College Baccalaureate Degrees and the Diversification Of Baccalaureate Production in Ontario|website=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:Finch Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign marks the future site of Seneca's Finch Campus (later renamed Newnham Campus), June, 1968.

It offers full-time and part-time programs at the baccalaureate, diploma, certificate and graduate levels.\n\n==History==\nSeneca opened in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to establish an Ontario-wide network of colleges of applied arts and technology providing career-oriented [[diploma]] and [[Academic certificate|certificate]] courses as well as [[continuing education]] programs to [[Ontario]] communities.  The province was responding to the increasing need for sophisticated applied learning as technology continued to change the nature of work and the provincial economy. General education was considered an important element in postsecondary education, and breadth courses continue to be a part of every program.  In 2001 the colleges were granted the ability to offer baccalaureate degrees.  Seneca is one of six colleges that can offer up to 15 per cent of its program activity at the degree level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/32379/1/M%20Skolnik%20-%20Baccalaureate.pdf|format=PDF|title=College Baccalaureate Degrees and the Diversification Of Baccalaureate Production in Ontario|website=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:Finch Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign marks the future site of Seneca's Finch Campus (later renamed Newnham Campus), June, 1968.

Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it in November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2212 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. As the opening track on the album, the song introduces the overarching theme of the album: an impending apocalyptic disaster will destroy Earth in five years and the who will save it is a bisexual alien rock star named Ziggy Stardust. While the first two verses are told from a child narrator, the third is from Bowie, who addresses the listener directly. As the track progresses, it builds intensity, before climaxing with strings and Bowie screaming the title.\n\nSince release, \"Five Years\" has received critical acclaim from music critics, with the majority complimenting Bowie's songwriting and Woodmansey's drum track. It has since been regarded as one of Bowie's greatest songs and by some as one of the greatest opening tracks of all time. Bowie performed the song frequently throughout the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour|Ziggy Stardust]], [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar]], [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|1978 Stage]] and [[A Reality Tour|2003 Reality]] tours. It has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012 for its 40th anniversary; this remaster was later included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015, which took its title from this song.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Five Years\" was recorded on 15 November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=163}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2212 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. Also recorded on this day were \"It's Gonna Rain Again\" and \"Shadow Man\", which both remain unreleased.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} It begins with a \"slow-quick-quick\" drumbeat from Woodmansey that creates an \"ominous\" atmosphere before Bowie begins his vocals.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=161}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} Author David Buckley describes the drum pattern as \"heartbeat-like\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=118}} The opening line, \"Pushing through the market square\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} likely refers to the [[Aylesbury]] market square in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} Bowie debuted both ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' and ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' albums at Friars Club in the town, and is reputed to have formed the Spiders there, following the ''Hunky Dory'' gig.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Biographers [[Nicholas Pegg]] and [[Peter Doggett]] both note the track's building intensity, especially in Bowie's vocal performance \u2013 moving from calm to screaming, as reminiscent of English musician [[John Lennon]]'s 1970 solo album ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', particularly on its opening track \"[[Mother (John Lennon song)|Mother]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=161}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} Doggett believes this was not a coincidence, as \"Five Years\" uses a standard 1-6-4-5 song structure that begins in the same minimalist style as \"Mother\" before gradually becoming \"more ornate\" like Lennon's \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\" from the same album.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} Unlike Lennon's basic arrangements on that album, \"Five Years\" contains [[autoharp]] to \"emphasise key chords\", before adding acoustic guitar and strings at the second verse.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} According to Doggett, \"by the finale, the orchestral players were fighting for air against amplified guitar static, scraping despairingly at their own instruments while the last of the human race screamed around them.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}}\n\nThe lyrics break the news that the Earth only has five years left before it gets destroyed by an impending apocalyptic disaster.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=161}} The first two verses are from the point of view of a kid, who hears this news for the first time and goes numb as it sinks in.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} Like the rest of the album, Bowie uses American slang and pronunciations, including \"news guy\", \"cop\" and \"TV\" (instead of \"newsreader\", \"policeman\" and \"telly\", respectively).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=130}} By the third verse, Bowie addresses the listener directly, which was a rarity in rock lyrics at the time.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} Bowie observes us blissfully unaware of our fate through \"jump cuts\" of urban decay, including in fantasies of Americana using stereotypes: \u2013 the [[Cadillac]], the \"black\", the \"queer\" and a girl carelessly enjoying a milkshake in an ice cream parlor.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} According to Bowie, \"we don't even know we're being sung about.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} Because of this, Bowie proclaims that he \"feels like an actor\" and \"with a flock of misfits and minorities gathering around him,\" he declares \"I want you to walk\",{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} indirectly introducing the character of Ziggy Stardust,{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a bisexual alien rock star who will save the Earth from the impending disaster, who is introduced directly in the third track \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Pegg writes: \"It's a classic example of the dexterity and economy of Bowie's best songwriting: with its scant few lines 'Five Years' drips with implication.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} The track ends with Bowie screaming the title as the Spiders join in, transforming the \"histrionics\" into \"jolly pub chant.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} It fades out with the same drumbeat as the beginning, which \"allows the listener to catch his or her breath\" before another beat begins the next track, \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}}\n\nLater in the 1970s, Bowie claimed to have chosen the length of time, five years, as a result of a dream in which his deceased father told him he must never fly again and would die in five years, in response to a question about his [[fear of flying]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}{{sfn|Buckley|2004|p=16}} Pegg notes another inspiration for the track is a poem Bowie had kept as part of his [[cabaret]] act in 1968: [[Roger McGough]]'s \"At Lunchtime A Story of Love\", which tells the story of a \"sexual abandon\" that erupts on a bus when news arrives that the world will end at lunchtime.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} It contains imagery that Bowie adapted for \"Five Years\": the bus suddenly stops \"to avoid a mother and child in the road\", while the bus conductor strikes up \"some sort of relationship with the driver.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} Spitz and Doggett both note the thematic resemblance to American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1963 song \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\", which also describes an impending disaster.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=160\u2013161}} In 1973, Bowie elaborated on the scenario described in \"Five Years\" in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':\n\n{{block quote|\"It has been announced that the world will end because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy is in a position where all the kids have access to things that they thought they wanted. The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on their own to plunder anything. Ziggy was in a rock'n'roll band and the kids no longer want rock'n'roll. There's no electricity to play it. Ziggy's adviser tells him to collect news and sing it, 'cause there is no news. So Ziggy does this and there is terrible news.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Copetas |first1=Craig |title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman: William Burroughs Interviews David Bowie |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=28 February 1974 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225220056/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |archive-date=25 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''The Complete David Bowie'', Pegg attributes Bowie's \"half-sung, half-spoken\" vocal performance to American musician [[Lou Reed]] of [[the Velvet Underground]], notes that the \"gathering omens of doom\" are similar to the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and directly correlates the \"violent images of societal breakdown\" to ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} He believes these violent images signals essence in Bowie's new subject matter: \"human longing and bruised relationships, expressed in the poignantly tacky idiom of British sci-fi.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} He further writes that the theatrical process of \"dissimulation\" mirrors Bowie's own sense of alienation, noting that on his previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'', he was \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|living in a silent film]]\",{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=383\u2013384}} but now \"feels like an actor\" as, \"[[Frankenstein]]-like\", he breathes life into his new creation: Ziggy Stardust.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Five Years\" was released as the opening track on Bowie's fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 16 June 1972 by [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> The song has received critical acclaim from music critics, with the majority complimenting Bowie's songwriting and Woodmansey's drum track.

Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it in November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2212 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. As the opening track on the album, the song introduces the overarching theme of the album: an impending apocalyptic disaster will destroy Earth in five years and the who will save it is a bisexual alien rock star named Ziggy Stardust. While the first two verses are told from a child narrator, the third is from Bowie, who addresses the listener directly. As the track progresses, it builds intensity, before climaxing with strings and Bowie screaming the title.\n\nSince release, \"Five Years\" has received critical acclaim from music critics, with the majority complimenting Bowie's songwriting and Woodmansey's drum track. It has since been regarded as one of Bowie's greatest songs and by some as one of the greatest opening tracks of all time. Bowie performed the song frequently throughout the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour|Ziggy Stardust]], [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar]], [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|1978 Stage]] and [[A Reality Tour|2003 Reality]] tours. It has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012 for its 40th anniversary; this remaster was later included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015, which took its title from this song.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Five Years\" was recorded on 15 November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=163}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2212 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. Also recorded on this day were \"It's Gonna Rain Again\" and \"Shadow Man\", which both remain unreleased.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} It begins with a \"slow-quick-quick\" drumbeat from Woodmansey that creates an \"ominous\" atmosphere before Bowie begins his vocals.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=161}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} Author David Buckley describes the drum pattern as \"heartbeat-like\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=118}} The opening line, \"Pushing through the market square\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} likely refers to the [[Aylesbury]] market square in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} Bowie debuted both ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' and ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' albums at Friars Club in the town, and is reputed to have formed the Spiders there, following the ''Hunky Dory'' gig.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Biographers [[Nicholas Pegg]] and [[Peter Doggett]] both note the track's building intensity, especially in Bowie's vocal performance \u2013 moving from calm to screaming, as reminiscent of English musician [[John Lennon]]'s 1970 solo album ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'', particularly on its opening track \"[[Mother (John Lennon song)|Mother]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=161}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} Doggett believes this was not a coincidence, as \"Five Years\" uses a standard 1-6-4-5 song structure that begins in the same minimalist style as \"Mother\" before gradually becoming \"more ornate\" like Lennon's \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\" from the same album.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} Unlike Lennon's basic arrangements on that album, \"Five Years\" contains [[autoharp]] to \"emphasise key chords\", before adding acoustic guitar and strings at the second verse.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} According to Doggett, \"by the finale, the orchestral players were fighting for air against amplified guitar static, scraping despairingly at their own instruments while the last of the human race screamed around them.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}}\n\nThe lyrics break the news that the Earth only has five years left before it gets destroyed by an impending apocalyptic disaster.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=161}} The first two verses are from the point of view of a kid, who hears this news for the first time and goes numb as it sinks in.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} Like the rest of the album, Bowie uses American slang and pronunciations, including \"news guy\", \"cop\" and \"TV\" (instead of \"newsreader\", \"policeman\" and \"telly\", respectively).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=130}} By the third verse, Bowie addresses the listener directly, which was a rarity in rock lyrics at the time.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} Bowie observes us blissfully unaware of our fate through \"jump cuts\" of urban decay, including in fantasies of Americana using stereotypes: \u2013 the [[Cadillac]], the \"black\", the \"queer\" and a girl carelessly enjoying a milkshake in an ice cream parlor.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=161}} According to Bowie, \"we don't even know we're being sung about.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} Because of this, Bowie proclaims that he \"feels like an actor\" and \"with a flock of misfits and minorities gathering around him,\" he declares \"I want you to walk\",{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} indirectly introducing the character of Ziggy Stardust,{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a bisexual alien rock star who will save the Earth from the impending disaster, who is introduced directly in the third track \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Pegg writes: \"It's a classic example of the dexterity and economy of Bowie's best songwriting: with its scant few lines 'Five Years' drips with implication.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} The track ends with Bowie screaming the title as the Spiders join in, transforming the \"histrionics\" into \"jolly pub chant.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} It fades out with the same drumbeat as the beginning, which \"allows the listener to catch his or her breath\" before another beat begins the next track, \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\".{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}}\n\nLater in the 1970s, Bowie claimed to have chosen the length of time, five years, as a result of a dream in which his deceased father told him he must never fly again and would die in five years, in response to a question about his [[fear of flying]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}{{sfn|Buckley|2004|p=16}} Pegg notes another inspiration for the track is a poem Bowie had kept as part of his [[cabaret]] act in 1968: [[Roger McGough]]'s \"At Lunchtime A Story of Love\", which tells the story of a \"sexual abandon\" that erupts on a bus when news arrives that the world will end at lunchtime.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} It contains imagery that Bowie adapted for \"Five Years\": the bus suddenly stops \"to avoid a mother and child in the road\", while the bus conductor strikes up \"some sort of relationship with the driver.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} Spitz and Doggett both note the thematic resemblance to American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1963 song \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\", which also describes an impending disaster.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=160\u2013161}} In 1973, Bowie elaborated on the scenario described in \"Five Years\" in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':\n\n{{block quote|\"It has been announced that the world will end because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy is in a position where all the kids have access to things that they thought they wanted. The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on their own to plunder anything. Ziggy was in a rock'n'roll band and the kids no longer want rock'n'roll. There's no electricity to play it. Ziggy's adviser tells him to collect news and sing it, 'cause there is no news. So Ziggy does this and there is terrible news.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Copetas |first1=Craig |title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman: William Burroughs Interviews David Bowie |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=28 February 1974 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225220056/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |archive-date=25 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''The Complete David Bowie'', Pegg attributes Bowie's \"half-sung, half-spoken\" vocal performance to American musician [[Lou Reed]] of [[the Velvet Underground]], notes that the \"gathering omens of doom\" are similar to the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and directly correlates the \"violent images of societal breakdown\" to ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} He believes these violent images signals essence in Bowie's new subject matter: \"human longing and bruised relationships, expressed in the poignantly tacky idiom of British sci-fi.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}} He further writes that the theatrical process of \"dissimulation\" mirrors Bowie's own sense of alienation, noting that on his previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'', he was \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|living in a silent film]]\",{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=383\u2013384}} but now \"feels like an actor\" as, \"[[Frankenstein]]-like\", he breathes life into his new creation: Ziggy Stardust.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=162}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Five Years\" was released as the opening track on Bowie's fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 16 June 1972 by [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> Since release, the song has received critical acclaim from music critics, with the majority complimenting Bowie's songwriting and Woodmansey's drum track.

The rivalry started in the [[1970 NBA Playoffs]] after the Lakers became the second team ever to come back from a 3-1 deficit. In the [[1972-73 NBA season]], the Suns joined the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] which is the division that the Lakers play in and ever since then, the two teams have always seen each other a lot in the regular season and sometimes the playoffs. The two teams have met five times in the 1980s where the Lakers won all five playoff series, twice in the 1990s where the Suns won both playoff series, three times in the 2000s where the Suns won two of the three playoff series, and once in the 2010s where the Lakers won it. However, ever since the recent decline of the Lakers and the Suns during the mid 2010s, the two teams haven't met in the playoffs.\n\n==Background==\nThe Lakers were founded as the [[Detroit Gems]] in 1946 before relocating to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and renaming themselves the Lakers ([[List of U.S. state nicknames|Minnesota's nickname]] is \"The Land of 10,000 Lakes\"). The club won several titles led by [[center (basketball)|center]] [[George Mikan]] in the 1950s before moving to [[Los Angeles]] in 1960.<ref name=\"LH\">[http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html History of the Lakers], nba.com/lakers, accessed April 18, 2007.</ref> In 1972 they won another championship led by center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and point guard [[Jerry West]].<ref name=\"10greatest\">[http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html Top 10 Teams in NBA History] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E2Bn24ti?url=http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html |date=2013-01-29 }}, nba.com/history, accessed April 17, 2007.</ref> After acquiring center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] in 1975 and point guard [[Magic Johnson]] in 1979, the Lakers built a team that won 5 titles in the 1980s. With the retirement of Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar, they struggled in the 1990s. However, in 1996 the club acquired free agent center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and traded with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for newly drafted shooting guard [[Kobe Bryant]]. With the two maturing under coach [[Phil Jackson]], the club turned into a contender in the early 2000s and won three straight NBA championships.<ref name=\"LH\"/>However after the loss in the [[2004 NBA Finals]], the Lakers traded O'Neal to the [[Miami Heat]], and decided to build around Bryant. During this time the Lakers began to struggle, only to make the playoffs twice between 2004-2007 and to never get out of the first round. However, during the [[2007-08 NBA season]], the Lakers acquired all-star power forward/center [[Pau Gasol]] from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and in the same year they made the [[2008 NBA Finals]] losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in six games. The Lakers would then proceed to win back-to-back championships after that.\n\nThe Suns were one of two franchises to join the NBA at the start of the 1968\u201369 season, alongside the Milwaukee Bucks from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and were the first major professional sports franchise in the Phoenix market and in the entire state of Arizona. Led by general manager [[Jerry Colangelo]], their early years they were shrouded in mediocrity, but their fortunes changed in the 1970s, where, after partnering long-term guard [[Dick Van Arsdale]] and center [[Alvan Adams]] with [[Paul Westphal]], the Suns reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture the championship, the Suns would rebuild around [[Walter Davis (basketball)|Walter Davis]] for a majority of the 1980s until the acquisitions of [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]], [[Dan Majerle]] and [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]] in 1988. The three players would lead the Suns into the 1990s, and in 1992, the Suns traded for all-star power forward [[Charles Barkley]] who went on to win the MVP award in the 1992\u201393 season and lead them to the [[1993 NBA Finals|finals]], where they eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. After the Suns traded Barkley in 1996, they then began to trade for and build around point guard [[Jason Kidd]], who led the team during the late 1990s and early 2000s. After the Suns traded Kidd to the Nets for [[Stephon Marbury]] and then traded him to the [[New York Knicks]] a year later, they then decided to sign free agent point guard [[Steve Nash]] and hire coach [[Mike D'Antoni]]. Along with Nash, [[Shawn Marion]], [[Amare Stoudemire]] and D'Antoni, the Suns began to dominate the league with their revolutionizing offense. Despite the fact that they couldn't win a championship, their style of play had a major influence around the league and it changed the way basketball was played.\n\n==Rivalry history==\nThe rivalry began when the Lakers finished the [[1969-70 NBA season]] with a 46-36 record and the second seed while the Suns finished with a 39-43 record and the fourth seed which set up a playoff matchup between the two teams<ref name=\"I\">[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html 1969-70 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html, accessed February 26, 2020.</ref>. The Lakers were led by Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain and [[Elgin Baylor]] while the Suns were led by [[Gail Goodrich]], Dick Van Arsdale and [[Connie Hawkins]]. In Game 1, Elgin Baylor led the Lakers with 32 points, 10 assists and 6 rebounds enroute to a victory. Games 2, 3, and 4 however belonged to the Suns, where they would take a 3-1 lead over the Lakers in a best of seven games. But in the end, the Suns fell short, losing three straight games and getting knocked out in the playoffs. This was marked as a historic series because of the fact that this was only the second time a team ever came back from a 3-1 deficit<ref name=\"S1\">[https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1970-nba-western-division-semifinals-suns-vs-lakers.html 1970 NBA Western Division Semifinals Suns vs. Lakers], basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1970, accessed February 26, 2020.</ref>.\n\nTen years later, the Lakers and Suns would meet again in the semifinals in 1980.

The rivalry started in the [[1970 NBA Playoffs]] after the Lakers became the second team ever to come back from a 3-1 deficit. In the [[1972-73 NBA season]], the Suns joined the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] which is the division that the Lakers play in and ever since then, the two teams have always seen each other a lot in the regular season and sometimes the playoffs. The two teams have met five times in the 1980s where the Lakers won all five playoff series, twice in the 1990s where the Suns won both playoff series, three times in the 2000s where the Suns won two of the three playoff series, and once in the 2010s where the Lakers won it. However, ever since the recent decline of the Lakers and the Suns during the mid 2010s, the two teams haven't met in the playoffs.\n\n==Background==\nThe Lakers were founded as the [[Detroit Gems]] in 1946 before relocating to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and renaming themselves the Lakers ([[List of U.S. state nicknames|Minnesota's nickname]] is \"The Land of 10,000 Lakes\"). The club won several titles led by [[center (basketball)|center]] [[George Mikan]] in the 1950s before moving to [[Los Angeles]] in 1960.<ref name=\"LH\">[http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html History of the Lakers], nba.com/lakers, accessed April 18, 2007.</ref> In 1972 they won another championship led by center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and point guard [[Jerry West]].<ref name=\"10greatest\">[http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html Top 10 Teams in NBA History] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E2Bn24ti?url=http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html |date=2013-01-29 }}, nba.com/history, accessed April 17, 2007.</ref> After acquiring center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] in 1975 and point guard [[Magic Johnson]] in 1979, the Lakers built a team that won 5 titles in the 1980s. With the retirement of Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar, they struggled in the 1990s. However, in 1996 the club acquired free agent center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and traded with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for newly drafted shooting guard [[Kobe Bryant]]. With the two maturing under coach [[Phil Jackson]], the club turned into a contender in the early 2000s and won three straight NBA championships.<ref name=\"LH\"/>However after the loss in the [[2004 NBA Finals]], the Lakers traded O'Neal to the [[Miami Heat]], and decided to build around Bryant. During this time the Lakers began to struggle, only to make the playoffs twice between 2004-2007 and to never get out of the first round. However, during the [[2007-08 NBA season]], the Lakers acquired all-star power forward/center [[Pau Gasol]] from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and in the same year they made the [[2008 NBA Finals]] losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in six games. The Lakers would then proceed to win back-to-back championships after that.\n\nThe Suns were one of two franchises to join the NBA at the start of the 1968\u201369 season, alongside the Milwaukee Bucks from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and were the first major professional sports franchise in the Phoenix market and in the entire state of Arizona. Led by general manager [[Jerry Colangelo]], their early years they were shrouded in mediocrity, but their fortunes changed in the 1970s, where, after partnering long-term guard [[Dick Van Arsdale]] and center [[Alvan Adams]] with [[Paul Westphal]], the Suns reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture the championship, the Suns would rebuild around [[Walter Davis (basketball)|Walter Davis]] for a majority of the 1980s until the acquisitions of [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]], [[Dan Majerle]] and [[Tom Chambers]] in 1988. The three players would lead the Suns into the 1990s, and in 1992, the Suns traded for all-star power forward [[Charles Barkley]] who went on to win the MVP award in the 1992\u201393 season and lead them to the [[1993 NBA Finals|finals]], where they eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. After the Suns traded Barkley in 1996, they then began to trade for and build around point guard [[Jason Kidd]], who led the team during the late 1990s and early 2000s. After the Suns traded Kidd to the Nets for [[Stephon Marbury]] and then traded him to the [[New York Knicks]] a year later, they then decided to sign free agent point guard [[Steve Nash]] and hire coach [[Mike D'Antoni]]. Along with Nash, [[Shawn Marion]], [[Amare Stoudemire]] and D'Antoni, the Suns began to dominate the league with their revolutionizing offense. Despite the fact that they couldn't win a championship, their style of play had a major influence around the league and it changed the way basketball was played.\n\n==Rivalry history==\nThe rivalry began when the Lakers finished the [[1969-70 NBA season]] with a 46-36 record and the second seed while the Suns finished with a 39-43 record and the fourth seed which set up a playoff matchup between the two teams<ref name=\"I\">[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html 1969-70 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1970.html, accessed February 26, 2020.</ref>. The Lakers were led by Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain and [[Elgin Baylor]] while the Suns were led by [[Gail Goodrich]], Dick Van Arsdale and [[Connie Hawkins]]. In Game 1, Elgin Baylor led the Lakers with 32 points, 10 assists and 6 rebounds enroute to a victory. Games 2, 3, and 4 however belonged to the Suns, where they would take a 3-1 lead over the Lakers in a best of seven games. But in the end, the Suns fell short, losing three straight games and getting knocked out in the playoffs. This was marked as a historic series because of the fact that this was only the second time a team ever came back from a 3-1 deficit<ref name=\"S1\">[https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1970-nba-western-division-semifinals-suns-vs-lakers.html 1970 NBA Western Division Semifinals Suns vs. Lakers], basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1970, accessed February 26, 2020.</ref>.\n\nTen years later, the Lakers and Suns would meet again in the semifinals in 1980.

The Indian scripts are mostly clearly related to the cave arts as existed in primitive to modern Indian architecture. Thus the Cave arts are the forerunners of Indian Scripts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abstract|first1=ICOSAL-13|title=Origin and Development of Indian Scripts: A Positional Study|publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages|location=Mysuru|page=188}}</ref>\n\n=== Role of Classical Status for Odia Language ===\nA great work of research activities of Dr. Prusty is Document preparation for classical status to Odia language. When all the scholar and intellectuals of Odisha was accepted that Odia script, language and literature not more than 1000 years back. He proved with sufficient evidence that not only Odia language and script was more than 5000 years but also Odia Literature as old as Sanskrit Literature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mohanty|first1=Dr. Prasanna Kumar|title=A Report on classical status of Odia Language|date=2013|publisher=Department of Culture, Govt.

The script \u2018Ga\u2019, and \u2018o\u2019 (tha) was discovered from [[yogimatha rock painting]], this painting saw a person with four animals and write some alphabet. According to Dr. Prusty, that painting created a word Like \"Gaitha\" (very popular Odia word at present \u2018Gotha\u2019 or \u2018group\u2019 in English). This art closely related to this alphabet. This alphabet has similarity to Dhauli and Jaugada Inscription's script of Ashok.

This feature commonly co-exists with a full system of grammatical gender, where all nouns are assigned to classes such as masculine, feminine and neuter. However, in some languages, such as [[gender in English|English]], this general system of noun gender has been lost, but gender distinctions are preserved in the third-person pronouns (the singular pronouns only, in the case of English).\n\nIn languages with grammatical gender, even pronouns which are semantically gender-neutral may be required to take a gender for such purposes as grammatical [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]. Thus in [[French grammar|French]], for example, the first- and second-person personal pronouns may behave as either masculine or feminine depending on the sex of the [[referent]]; and [[indefinite pronoun]]s such as ''quelqu'un'' (\"someone\") and ''personne'' (\"no one\") are treated conventionally as masculine, even though ''personne'' as a noun (\"person\") is only feminine regardless of the sex of the referent. (See {{slink|Grammatical gender|Gender of pronouns}}.)\n\nIssues concerning gender and pronoun usage commonly arise in situations where it is necessary to choose between gender-specific pronouns, even though the sex of the person or persons being referred to is not known, not specified, or (for plurals) mixed. In English and many other languages, the masculine form has sometimes served as the default or [[Markedness|unmarked]] form; that is, masculine pronouns have been used in cases where the referent or referents are not known to be (all) female.<ref>{{Cite book|page=821|last1=Garner |first1=Bryan A. |authorlink1= Bryan A. Garner|title=Garner's Modern English Usage |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-049148-2}}</ref> This collective masculine is also the case in ancient languages, like [[Classical Greek]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] and have influenced the modern forms. This leads to sentences such as:\n*In English: ''If anybody comes, tell '''him'''.'' Here the masculine pronoun ''him'' refers to a person of unknown sex.\n*In French: ''Vos amis sont arriv\u00e9s \u2014 '''ils''' \u00e9taient en avance'' (\"Your friends have arrived \u2013 '''they''' were early\"). Here the masculine plural pronoun ''ils'' is used rather than the feminine ''elles'', unless it is known that all the friends in question are female (in which case the noun would also change to ''amies'' and the past participle would change to ''arriv\u00e9es'').\n\nAs early as 1795, dissatisfaction with this convention led to calls for gender-neutral pronouns, and attempts to invent pronouns for this purpose date back to at least 1850, although the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']] as a natural gender-neutral pronoun in English has persisted since the 14th century.<ref name=Williams1990s>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=John |title=History \u2014 Modern Neologism |work=Gender-Neutral Pronoun FAQ |date=1990s |url=http://www.aetherlumina.com/gnp/history.html#net |accessdate=2007-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205220746/http://www.aetherlumina.com/gnp/history.html |archivedate=December 5, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==English==\n\n===Standard usage===\nThe [[English language]] has gender-specific personal pronouns in the third-[[grammatical person|person]] singular. The masculine pronoun is ''[[he (pronoun)|he]]'' (with derived forms ''him'', ''his'' and ''himself''); the feminine is ''[[She (pronoun)|she]]'' (with derived forms ''her'', ''hers'' and ''herself''); the neuter is ''it'' (with derived forms ''its'' and ''itself''). The third-person plural ''they'' and its inflected and derived forms (''them'', ''their'', ''themselves'', etc.) are gender-neutral and also used to refer singular, personal antecedents (e.g. \"Where a recipient of an allowance under section 4 absents themself from Canada, payment of the allowance shall ...\"<ref>{{Cite web|ref={{SfnRef| Canadian government |2013}} | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/W-3.pdf | title = Canadian War Veterans Allowance Act (1985) as amended 12 December 2013| last1 = Canadian government | authorlink1 = Government of Canada| date= 12 December 2013| publisher = [[Government of Canada]]| format = pdf| id = R.S.C., 1985, c.

When a person has adopted a persona of a different gender (such as when [[acting]] or performing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]]), pronouns with the gender of the persona are used when referring to that apart from the usual identity of the person. Pronouns are sometimes reversed ([[gender transposition]]) in [[gay slang]].

The distinction is found even in languages which do not retain a masculine\u2013feminine [[grammatical gender]] system for nouns generally, such as English and [[Danish language|Danish]]. Sometimes the distinction is neutralized in the [[plural]], as in most modern [[Germanic languages]] (gender-neutral third-person plural pronouns include English ''they'' and [[German grammar|German]] {{lang|de|sie}}), and also in modern [[Russian language|Russian]] (where the equivalent pronoun is {{lang|ru|\u043e\u043d\u0438}} {{lang|ru-Latn|oni}}). However some languages make the distinction in the plural as well, as with [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|ils}} and {{lang|fr|elles}}; [[Czech language|Czech]] {{lang|cs|oni}} and {{lang|cs|ony}}; or Greek {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af}} and {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2}}, for respectively masculine and feminine equivalents of \"they\". It is traditional in most of these languages, in cases of [[grammatical gender#Mixed and indeterminate gender|mixed or indeterminate gender]], to use the masculine as a default.\n\n===Romance languages===\n{{see also|Gender neutrality in Spanish and Portuguese}}\n\nFor example, in [[French language|French]],\n*First person singular ''je'' ('I'), ''me'', ''moi'' ('me')\n*Second person singular (familiar) ''tu'', ''te'', ''toi'' ('you')\n*Third person [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] ''on'' ('one', 'you')\n*First person plural ''nous'' ('we', 'us')\n*Second person plural ''vous'' ('you')\n*Third person possessives ''leur'' ('their') and ''son''/''sa''/''ses'' (depending on the gender and number of the item possessed), 'his', 'her' 'its', 'their' (masculine-gender object)/ 'his', 'her' 'its', 'their' (feminine-gender object) / 'his', 'her' 'its', 'their' (objects)\nare all gender-inclusive; but\n*Third person pronouns ''il'' ('he'), ''le'' ('the' masculine-gender), ''ils'' ('they', referring to an all-male or mixed-gender group) are all masculine.\n*Third person pronouns ''elle'' ('she'), ''la'' ('the' feminine-gender) and ''elles'' ('they', referring to an all-female group) are all feminine.\nThe choice of [[possessive pronoun]] in many [[Romance language]]s is determined by the [[grammatical gender]] of the possessed object; the gender of the possessor is not explicit. For instance, in [[French language|French]] the possessive pronouns are usually ''sa'' for a feminine object, and ''son'' for a masculine object: ''son livre'' can mean either \"his book\" or \"her book\"; the masculine ''son'' is used because ''livre'' is masculine. Similarly, ''sa maison'' means either \"his house\" or \"her house\" because \"maison\" is feminine. Non-possessive pronouns, on the other hand, are usually gender-specific.\n\n====Catalan====\nAs in French, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] also determines the gender of object but not of the possessor, by possessive pronouns \u2013 ''seu'' stands for a masculine object (''el seu llibre''), while ''seva'', ''seua'' or ''sa'' stands for a feminine object (''la seva mansi\u00f3'').\n\n====Portuguese====\n[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] works with two sets of pronouns. One of them (''seu/teu'' for masculine and ''sua/tua'' for feminine) follows the same rules as French and Catalan, with the gender determined by the object (''o seu livro'' and ''a sua casa''); in the other set (''dele'' for masculine and ''dela'' for feminine), the gender is determined by the possessor as in English, so ''o livro dele'' is possessed by a masculine being and ''o livro dela'' is possessed by a feminine being. Portuguese can use ''se'' and 3rd person plural without subject as in Spanish, to express [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]]/[[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]] sense.\n\n====Italian====\n[[Italian language|Italian]] is similar to French, with phrases such as ''il mio/tuo/suo libro'' not implying anything about the owner's gender or the owner's name's grammatical gender. In the third person, if the \"owner's\" sex or category (person vs thing) is an issue, it is solved by expressing ''di lui, di lei'' for persons or superior animals or ''di esso'' for things or inferior animals. ''Lui port\u00f2 su le valigie di lei'' (He brought her luggage upstairs). This rarely happens, though, because it is considered inelegant and the owner's gender can often be inferred from the context, which is anyhow much more important in an Italian environment than in an English-speaking one.\n\n====Spanish====\n{{Further|Grammatical gender in Spanish|Spanish personal pronouns}}\nIn contrast, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] possessive pronouns agree with neither the gender of the possessor nor that of the possession (but they do agree with number of the possession), except in the construct with ''de'': ''de \u00e9l, de ella'' (\"of his, of hers\"). In the third person, the possessive pronoun ''su(s)'' is used. Example: ''Su libro'' could mean either \"his book\" or \"her book\", or even \"your book\" when speaking politely using the \"usted\" form of \"you\", while the informal form of \"you\" (\"t\u00fa/vos\") would be \"tu libro\", with the gender of the possessor being made clear from the context of the statement. Pronouns referring to people (or any noun) in Spanish have gender \u2013 ''\u00e9l'' for \"him\" and ''ella'' for \"her\". Only when referring to an indefinite antecedent is the neuter ''ello'' used, and since Spanish is a [[pronoun dropping language]], it usually only appears in [[prepositional phrases]], like ''para ello'', \"for it\". Grammatical person is [[inflection|inflected]] in verbs, so subject pronouns are generally used when necessary to make a distinction or add emphasis. For example, the verb ''vivir'' (\"to live\") may be conjugated in the third person as ''vive'' (\"he/she/it lives\") and be a complete sentence on its own. To make a distinction, one might say \"'''''Ella''''' ''vive en Madrid pero'' '''''\u00e9l''''' ''vive en Barcelona''\" \u2013 \"She lives in Madrid but he lives in Barcelona\". If it is absolutely necessary to provide a subject when referring to an unnamed object, a demonstrative can be used instead of a pronoun: ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 es '''eso'''?'' (\"What is '''that'''?\"). An acceptable answer would be ''Eso es un libro'' or ''Eso es una revista'' (\"That's a book\", \"That's a magazine\"), with the genderless ''eso'' as subject in both cases.\n\nHowever, when the pronoun is used as a direct object, gender-specific forms reappear in Spanish. The sentence \"I can't find it\", when referring to the masculine noun ''libro'' (book) would be \"''No '''lo''' encuentro''\", whereas if the thing being looked for were a magazine (''revista'' in Spanish, which is feminine) then the sentence would be \"''No '''la''' encuentro''\".\n\nWhen expressing [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]]/[[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]] sense, hence no known gender, there are several ways in Spanish: 3rd person singular ''se'' and sometimes ''uno'' can express \"one\"/\"you\" in the general sense, \"''No se sabe''\" (\"It's unknown\"). Another way is by omitting the pronoun in 3rd person plural to say \"they\", in the sense of \"you\" but exclusive \"''En Francia hablan franc\u00e9s''\" (\"In France they speak French\"), and 2nd person singular, ''t\u00fa'' (\"you\") as in \"''debes creer en ti mismo''\" (\"one shall believe in oneself\"). In instructions, like cooking recipes, one can see 3rd person plural with ''se'', or 1st person plural.\n\nThe Spanish language presents difficulties to [[gender neutral]] writing also due to gender [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] for adjectives like ''bueno'' (\"good\") and nouns, e.g. for professions ''panadero'' (\"baker\"), which signal masculine gender and using the other available form would signal exclusively feminine.\n\n===Germanic languages===\n====Icelandic====\n[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] uses a similar system to other [[Germanic languages]] in distinguishing three 3rd-person genders in the singular \u2013 ''hann'' (masculine gender), ''h\u00fan'' (feminine gender), ''\u00fea\u00f0'' ([[grammatical gender|neuter gender]]). However it also uses this three-way distinction in the plural: ''\u00feeir'' (m. only), ''\u00fe\u00e6r'' (f. only), ''\u00feau'' (n., which includes mixed gender). It is therefore possible to be gender-specific in all circumstances should one wish \u2013 although of course ''\u00feau'' can be used for gender-inclusiveness. Otherwise the form used is determined grammatically (i.e., by the gender of the noun replaced). In general statements the use of ''menn'' would be preferable as it is less specific than ''\u00feau''.<!---(see below) Where? --->\n\n====Norwegian====\nIn [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], a new word was proposed, ''hin'' ('sie' or 'hir') to fill the gap between the third person pronouns ''hun'' ('she') and ''han'' ('he'). ''Hin'' is very rarely used, and in limited special interest groups; it is not embraced by society as a whole. A reason for the marginal interest in a neuter gender word is the constructed nature of the word, and that the word is homonymous with several older words both in official language and dialectal speech, such as ''hin'' ('the other') and ''hinsides'' ('beyond'). One can also use ''man'' or ''en'' or ''den'' (''en'' means 'one'). These three are considered [[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]]. Amongst [[LGBT]] interest groups the use of the word 'hen' after the Swedish implementation in 2010 is now in use.<ref>{{cite news|title=Should we be using \"hen,\" as well as \"she\" and \"he\" in Norway? [norwegian]|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/viten/Bor-vi-begynne-a-si-hen-i-tillegg-til-hun-og-han-ogsa-i-Norge-8033593.html|accessdate=12 April 2016|agency=Aftenposten|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\n====Swedish====\n{{main|hen (pronoun)}}\nThe [[Swedish language]] has 4 grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, ''reale'' and neutral , which correspond to the 3rd person forms ''han, hon, den, det'' (\"he, she, it, it\"). The other forms are gender neutral: singular 1st ''jag'', 2nd ''du'', 3rd [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]]/[[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]] ''man'', plural 1st ''vi'', 2nd ''ni'', 3rd ''de''. Neutral is characterised by the definite singular article '-t' whereas the rest end with '-n'. The same distinction applies to the indefinite adjectival singular forms. For people and animals with specified gender the masculine or feminine are used. There is no grammatical way to make gender distinction in plural.\n\nIn Swedish, the word ''hen'' was introduced generally in the 2000s as a complement to the gender-specific ''hon'' (\"she\") and ''han'' (\"he\"). It can be used when the gender of a person is not known or when it is not desirable to specify them as either a \"she\" or \"he\". The word was proposed by [[Rolf Dun\u00e5s]] in 1966, and could be used occasionally, like in a guideline from the Swedish building council from 1980, authored by [[Rolf Reimers]]. Its origin may have been a combination of ''han'' and ''hon''.\n\nIt was proposed again in 1994, with reference to the Finnish ''h\u00e4n'', similarly pronounced, a [[personal pronoun]] that is gender-neutral, since [[Finnish language|Finnish]] completely lacks [[grammatical gender]]. In 2009 it was included in [[Nationalencyklopedin]]. However, it did not receive widespread recognition until around 2010, when it began to be used in some texts, and provoked some media debates and controversy, but is included since 2015 in ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'', the most authoritative [[glossary]] of the Swedish language, by the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url= http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=128&artikel=5925135\n|title= Svenska Akademiens ordlista inf\u00f6r hen\n|newspaper= [[Sveriges Radio]]\n|first= Mina |last= Benaissa |date= 29 July 2014\n}}\n</ref>\n\n{{As of | 2016}} Swedish [[manual of style|manuals of style]] treat \"hen\" as a [[neologism]]. Major newspapers like ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' have recommended against its usage, though some journalists still use it. The [[Swedish Language Council]] has not issued any general recommendations against the use of ''hen'', but advises against the use of the object form ''henom'' (\"her/him\"); it instead recommends using ''hen'' as both the subject and object form. ''Hen'' has two basic usages: as a way to avoid a stated preference to either gender; or as a way of referring to individuals who are [[transgender]], who prefer to identify themselves as belonging to a [[third gender]] or who reject the division of male/female gender roles on ideological grounds. Its entry will cover two definitions: as a reference to individual's belonging to an unspecified sex or [[third gender]], or where the sex is not known.\n\nTraditionally, Swedish offers other ways of avoiding using gender-specific pronouns; e.g., \"vederb\u00f6rande\" (\"the referred person\") and \"man\" (\"one\", as in \"Man borde...\"/\"One should...\") with its objective form \"en\" or alternatively \"en\" as both subjective and objective since \"man\"/\"one\" sounds the same as \"man\"/\"male adult\" although they are discernible through syntax. \"Denna/Denne\" (\"this one\") may be used to refer to a non-gender-specific referent already or soon-to-be mentioned (\"Vederb\u00f6rande kan, om denne s\u00e5 vill,...\"/\"The referent may, if they wish,...\"). One method is rewriting into the plural, as Swedish \u2013 like English \u2013 has only gender-neutral pronouns in the plural. Another method is writing the pronoun in the referent's grammatical gender (\"Barnet f\u00e5r om ''det'' vill.\"/\"The child is allowed to, if ''it'' wants to.\" The word \"barn\" is grammatically neuter, thus the use of the third-person neuter pronoun \"det\"); some nouns retain their traditional pronouns, e.g., \"man\"/\"man\" uses \"han\"/\"he\", \"kvinna\"/\"woman\" uses \"hon\"/\"she\", and \"m\u00e4nniska\"/\"human being\" uses \"hon\"/\"she\". While grammatically correct, using \"den/det\" to refer to human beings may sound as if the speaker regards the referenced human beings as objects.\n\n====German====\n\n{{Wiktionary pipe|sie#Etymology_2_2|sie}}\n{{Further|German pronouns}}\n{{Rewrite section|date=March 2017}}\n<!-- This section should include only 3rd person pronouns.

These pronouns of Old Rapa also define the degree of clusivity in the first person dual and the first person plural forms.\n\nIn the first person tense \u2013 as depicted in the table below \u2013 Old Rapa contains pronouns that are exclusive first person singular (ou \u2013 free; ku \u2013 bound), however does not contain pronouns that are inclusive first person singular. Old Rapa also consists of pronouns to describe both the exclusive and inclusive first person dual and first person plural forms. By definition, exclusive pronouns are pronouns that include the speaker and one or more others, although does not include the person being addressed. Inclusive pronouns are pronouns that work in the opposite fashion, by including the speaker and the addressee, and potentially more others.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Pronouns in Old Rapa<ref name=\":1\" />\n|\n|Singular\n\n(Free)\n|Singular\n\n(Bound)\n|Dual\n|Plural\n|-\n|First Person Exclusive\n|ou\n|ku\n|m\u0101ua\n|m\u0101tou\n|-\n|First Person Inclusive\n|\n|\n|t\u0101ua\n|t\u0101tou\n|-\n|Second Person\n|koe\n|\n|k\u014drua\n|koutou\n|-\n|Third Person\n|'\u014dna,koia\n|na\n|r\u0101ua\n|r\u0101tou\n|}\n\nFor both the second and third person tense, Old Rapa contains pronouns that describe second person singular (however devoiding a distinction for bound words), second person dual, and second person plural.

Finnish is essentially a [[pronoun dropping language]] but in the 3rd person singular it is common to use a pronoun explicitly.

Most of the time the language drops the pronoun completely or refers to people using their name with a suffix such as the gender-neutral -''san'' added to it.\n\nFor example, \"She (Ms. Sait\u014d) came\" would be \"\u658e\u85e4\u3055\u3093\u304c\u6765\u307e\u3057\u305f\" (''Sait\u014d-san ga kimashita'').\n\nIn modern Japanese, ''kare'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f7c}}) is the male and ''kanojo'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f7c\u5973}}) the female third-person pronouns. Historically, ''kare'' was a word in the demonstrative paradigm (i.e., a system involving demonstrative prefixes, ''ko-'', ''so-'', ''a-,'' and ''do-''), used to point to an object that is physically far but psychologically near. The feminine counterpart ''kanojo'', on the other hand, is a combination of ''kano'' (adjective version of ''ka-'') and ''jo'' (\"woman\"), coined for the translation of its Western equivalents. It was not until the [[Meiji period]] that ''kare'' and ''kanojo'' were commonly used as the masculine and feminine pronoun in the same way as their Western equivalents. Although their usage as the Western equivalent pronouns tends to be infrequent\u2014because pronouns tend to be dropped in the first place\u2014''kare-shi'' and ''kanojo'' are commonly used today to mean \"boyfriend\" and \"girlfriend\" respectively.<ref name=\"Japanese: Revised Edition\">\n\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=715Wgeae6IcC&pg=PA276&dq=japanese+kare+pronoun&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KPXjU9LzOob8igLyq4H4Cg&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=japanese%20kare%20pronoun&f=false Japanese: Revised Edition], Iwasaki, Shoichi.

The Turkish singular third-person pronoun ''o'' (he/she/it) is completely gender-neutral and can be used to refer to masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns. The plural third-person pronoun ''onlar'' (they) is used the same way.\n\nTurkish is also a [[null-subject language]] which means pronouns can usually be dropped while retaining the meaning of the sentence. For example, the sentences \"O okuldan geldi.\" and \"Okuldan geldi.\" both translate to \"He/she/it came from school.\"\n\n===Thai===\n[[Thai language#Pronouns|Thai pronouns]] are numerous. Here is only a short list.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! First person\n! Second person\n! Third person\n|-\n!

It can be used when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. It is seldom used when both parties are male.\n\nThe third neuter pronouns are used differently. \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 (man) is often used to refer to inanimate objects and non-human animate beings. However, this pronoun can also be used to refer to people in informal situations (e.g., a mother speaking about her child, or a person speaking about a close friend). The pronouns \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (khao), \u0e41\u0e01 (kae), and \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19 (than) are often used in formal situations \u2013 with the latter being the most formal and \u0e41\u0e01 (kae) being used to refer to a person older than the speaker.\n\nThese three pronouns can also be used to refer to a different grammatical person. \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (khao) can be used in the first person, while \u0e41\u0e01 (kae) and \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19 (than) can be used in the second person.\n\n==Constructed languages==\n\n===Esperanto===\n{{Main|Gender reform in Esperanto#Gender-neutral pronouns|l1=Gender-neutral pronouns in Esperanto}}\nEsperanto has no universally accepted gender-neutral pronouns, but there are several proposals. [[L. L. Zamenhof|Zamenhof]] proposed using the pronoun ''\u011di'' (literally \"it\"). Some writers also use other established pronouns like ''tiu'' (\"this\" or \"that\") or ''oni'' (\"one\"). Still other writers use [[neologism]]s such as ''ri'' for this purpose.\n\n===Ido===\nIdo has gendered and gender-neutral pronouns in the third person, both singular and plural. The gendered pronouns are:\n\n-'''il(u)''' (he)\n\n-'''el(u)''' (she)\n\n-'''ol(u)''' (it)\n\nThe final \"u\" can be dropped in all of these cases without any change in meaning.\n\nAdditionally there is the genderless \"lu\" which can freely replace any of the above forms if the gender of the referent is ignored, if one  wants it to be left ambiguous, or simply because the speaker doesn't want to state it.\n\nAll of these pronouns have a plural form, to translate the English \"they\":\n\n-'''ili''' (when all of the referents are male)\n\n-'''eli''' (when all of the referents are female)\n\n-'''oli''' (when all of the referents are inanimate), and\n\n-'''li''', which can substitute any of the above under any circumstances, but can also be used if the referents are of mixed genders.\n\nFirst and second person pronouns are all gender-neutral:\n\n-'''me''' (I)\n\n-'''tu''' (you, sing. informal)\n\n-'''vu''' (you, sing. formal)\n\n-'''ni''' (we)\n\n-'''vi''' (you, plural, both formal and informal).\n\n===Interlingua===\nBecause [[Interlingua]] is an [[Italic languages|Italic]] constructed language, it shares many traits with Spanish, Italian and French.\n\nSingular: 1st person: ''io'', 2nd: ''tu'', 3rd: ''ille, illa'' for humans/animals and ''illo'' for objects\n\nPlural: 1st: ''nos'', 2nd: ''vo''s, 3rd: ''illes, illas, illos'' as plural of above.\n\nThird person singular ''on'' is used for [[indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] \"one\"/\"you\" as in French.\n\n===Lingua Franca Nova===\n[[Lingua Franca Nova]] (\"Elefen\") has two third person singular pronouns: ''el'', used for humans and animals; ''lo'', used for all else. ''Los'' is used for the third person plural, ''se'' for third person reflexive (singular and plural), and ''sua'' for third person possessives (singular and plural).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Epicenity]]\n*[[Gender marking in job titles]]\n*[[Gender neutrality in genderless languages]]\n*[[Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender]]\n*[[Generic antecedent]]\n*[[Pronoun game]]\n*[[Feminist language reform]]\n*[[LGBT linguistics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Gender shifts in the history of English |author=Anne Curzan |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521820073}} (includes chapters on \"she\" for ships and [[generic he]])\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|Appendix:English third-person singular pronouns|Appendix:List of protologisms/third person singular gender neutral pronouns}}\n*[http://quinion.com/words/articles/genpr.htm Gender-Neutral Pronouns], a style guide\n*[http://www.bcli.org/pages/projects/genderfree/genderfree.html Gender-free Legal Writing]\n*[https://www.jstor.org/stable/455007?seq=1 The Epicene Pronouns: A Chronology of the Word That Failed] (gender-neutral pronoun history)\n* {{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/fashion/pronoun-confusion-sexual-fluidity.html | date = January 31, 2016 | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | title = She?

This feature commonly co-exists with a full system of grammatical gender, where all nouns are assigned to classes such as masculine, feminine and neuter. However, in some languages, such as [[gender in English|English]], this general system of noun gender has been lost, but gender distinctions are preserved in the third-person pronouns (the singular pronouns only, in the case of English).\n\nIn languages with grammatical gender, even pronouns which are semantically gender-neutral may be required to take a gender for such purposes as grammatical [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]. Thus in [[French grammar|French]], for example, the first- and second-person personal pronouns may behave as either masculine or feminine depending on the sex of the [[referent]]; and [[indefinite pronoun]]s such as ''quelqu'un'' (\"someone\") and ''personne'' (\"no one\") are treated conventionally as masculine, even though ''personne'' as a noun (\"person\") is only feminine regardless of the sex of the referent. (See {{slink|Grammatical gender|Gender of pronouns}}.)\n\nIssues concerning gender and pronoun usage commonly arise in situations where it is necessary to choose between gender-specific pronouns, even though the sex of the person or persons being referred to is not known, not specified, or (for plurals) mixed. In English and many other languages, the masculine form has sometimes served as the default or [[Markedness|unmarked]] form; that is, masculine pronouns have been used in cases where the referent or referents are not known to be (all) female.<ref>{{Cite book|page=821|last1=Garner |first1=Bryan A. |authorlink1= Bryan A. Garner|title=Garner's Modern English Usage |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-049148-2}}</ref> This collective masculine is also the case in ancient languages, like [[Classical Greek]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] and have influenced the modern forms. This leads to sentences such as:\n*In English: ''If anybody comes, tell '''him'''.'' Here the masculine pronoun ''him'' refers to a person of unknown sex.\n*In French: ''Vos amis sont arriv\u00e9s \u2014 '''ils''' \u00e9taient en avance'' (\"Your friends have arrived \u2013 '''they''' were early\"). Here the masculine plural pronoun ''ils'' is used rather than the feminine ''elles'', unless it is known that all the friends in question are female (in which case the noun would also change to ''amies'' and the past participle would change to ''arriv\u00e9es'').\n\nAs early as 1795, dissatisfaction with this convention led to calls for gender-neutral pronouns, and attempts to invent pronouns for this purpose date back to at least 1850, although the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']] as a natural gender-neutral pronoun in English has persisted since the 14th century.<ref name=Williams1990s>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=John |title=History \u2014 Modern Neologism |work=Gender-Neutral Pronoun FAQ |date=1990s |url=http://www.aetherlumina.com/gnp/history.html#net |accessdate=2007-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205220746/http://www.aetherlumina.com/gnp/history.html |archivedate=December 5, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==English==\n\n===Standard usage===\nThe [[English language]] has gender-specific personal pronouns in the third-[[grammatical person|person]] singular. The masculine pronoun is ''[[he (pronoun)|he]]'' (with derived forms ''him'', ''his'' and ''himself''); the feminine is ''[[She (pronoun)|she]]'' (with derived forms ''her'', ''hers'' and ''herself''); the neuter is ''it'' (with derived forms ''its'' and ''itself''). The third-person plural ''they'' and its inflected and derived forms (''them'', ''their'', ''themselves'', etc.) are gender-neutral and also used to refer singular, personal antecedents (e.g. \"Where a recipient of an allowance under section 4 absents themself from Canada, payment of the allowance shall ...\"<ref>{{Cite web|ref={{SfnRef| Canadian government |2013}} | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/W-3.pdf | title = Canadian War Veterans Allowance Act (1985) as amended 12 December 2013| last1 = Canadian government | authorlink1 = Government of Canada| date= 12 December 2013| publisher = [[Government of Canada]]| format = pdf| id = R.S.C., 1985, c.

When a person has adopted a persona of a different gender (such as when [[acting]] or performing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]]), pronouns with the gender of the persona are used when referring to that apart from the usual identity of the person. Pronouns are sometimes reversed ([[gender transposition]]) in [[gay slang]]. ''He'' and ''she'' are normally used for humans; use of ''it'' can be dehumanizing, and thus inappropriate, but ''it'' is sometimes used for a baby when there is no antecedent such as ''son'' or ''daughter'' and its sex is irrelevant or distracting. ''It'' is normally used for animals, but ''he'' or ''she'' can be used for an animal when the speaker wants to indicate the animal's sex or there is a higher degree of empathy with the animal, as is more likely with pets, domesticated animals, and other \"higher\" animals, such as elephants. ''He'' or ''she'' are used for an animal that is referred to by a proper name (e.g. \"Fido adores his blanket\".).<ref name=\"Huddleston 2002 gender\">{{Cite book|pages=488\u2013489|last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey |authorlink2=Geoffrey Pullum |title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8}}</ref> \n\nThe other English pronouns (the first- and second-person personal pronouns ''I'', ''we'', ''you'', etc.; the third-person plural personal pronoun ''they''; the [[indefinite pronouns]] ''one'', ''someone'', ''anyone'', etc.; and others) do not make male\u2013female gender distinctions, that is, they are gender-neutral.

The distinction is found even in languages which do not retain a masculine\u2013feminine [[grammatical gender]] system for nouns generally, such as English and [[Danish language|Danish]]. Sometimes the distinction is neutralized in the [[plural]], as in most modern [[Germanic languages]] (gender-neutral third-person plural pronouns include English ''they'' and [[German grammar|German]] {{lang|de|sie}}), and also in modern [[Russian language|Russian]] (where the equivalent pronoun is {{lang|ru|\u043e\u043d\u0438}} {{lang|ru-Latn|oni}}). However some languages make the distinction in the plural as well, as with [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|ils}} and {{lang|fr|elles}}; [[Czech language|Czech]] {{lang|cs|oni}} and {{lang|cs|ony}}; or Greek {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af}} and {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2}}, for respectively masculine and feminine equivalents of \"they\". It is traditional in most of these languages, in cases of [[grammatical gender#Mixed and indeterminate gender|mixed or indeterminate gender]], to use the masculine as a default.\n\n===Romance languages===\n{{see also|Gender neutrality in Spanish and Portuguese}}\n\nFor example, in [[French language|French]],\n*First person singular ''je'' ('I'), ''me'', ''moi'' ('me')\n*Second person singular (familiar) ''tu'', ''te'', ''toi'' ('you')\n*Third person [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] ''on'' ('one', 'you')\n*First person plural ''nous'' ('we', 'us')\n*Second person plural ''vous'' ('you')\n*Third person possessives ''leur'' ('their') and ''son''/''sa''/''ses'' (depending on the gender and number of the item possessed), 'his', 'her' 'its', 'their' (masculine-gender object)/ 'his', 'her' 'its', 'their' (feminine-gender object) / 'his', 'her' 'its', 'their' (objects)\nare all gender-inclusive; but\n*Third person pronouns ''il'' ('he'), ''le'' ('the' masculine-gender), ''ils'' ('they', referring to an all-male or mixed-gender group) are all masculine.\n*Third person pronouns ''elle'' ('she'), ''la'' ('the' feminine-gender) and ''elles'' ('they', referring to an all-female group) are all feminine.\nThe choice of [[possessive pronoun]] in many [[Romance language]]s is determined by the [[grammatical gender]] of the possessed object; the gender of the possessor is not explicit. For instance, in [[French language|French]] the possessive pronouns are usually ''sa'' for a feminine object, and ''son'' for a masculine object: ''son livre'' can mean either \"his book\" or \"her book\"; the masculine ''son'' is used because ''livre'' is masculine. Similarly, ''sa maison'' means either \"his house\" or \"her house\" because \"maison\" is feminine. Non-possessive pronouns, on the other hand, are usually gender-specific.\n\n====Catalan====\nAs in French, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] also determines the gender of object but not of the possessor, by possessive pronouns \u2013 ''seu'' stands for a masculine object (''el seu llibre''), while ''seva'', ''seua'' or ''sa'' stands for a feminine object (''la seva mansi\u00f3'').\n\n====Portuguese====\n[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] works with two sets of pronouns. One of them (''seu/teu'' for masculine and ''sua/tua'' for feminine) follows the same rules as French and Catalan, with the gender determined by the object (''o seu livro'' and ''a sua casa''); in the other set (''dele'' for masculine and ''dela'' for feminine), the gender is determined by the possessor as in English, so ''o livro dele'' is possessed by a masculine being and ''o livro dela'' is possessed by a feminine being. Portuguese can use ''se'' and 3rd person plural without subject as in Spanish, to express [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]]/[[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]] sense.\n\n====Italian====\n[[Italian language|Italian]] is similar to French, with phrases such as ''il mio/tuo/suo libro'' not implying anything about the owner's gender or the owner's name's grammatical gender. In the third person, if the \"owner's\" sex or category (person vs thing) is an issue, it is solved by expressing ''di lui, di lei'' for persons or superior animals or ''di esso'' for things or inferior animals. ''Lui port\u00f2 su le valigie di lei'' (He brought her luggage upstairs). This rarely happens, though, because it is considered inelegant and the owner's gender can often be inferred from the context, which is anyhow much more important in an Italian environment than in an English-speaking one.\n\n====Spanish====\n{{Further|Grammatical gender in Spanish|Spanish personal pronouns}}\nIn contrast, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] possessive pronouns agree with neither the gender of the possessor nor that of the possession (but they do agree with number of the possession), except in the construct with ''de'': ''de \u00e9l, de ella'' (\"of his, of hers\"). In the third person, the possessive pronoun ''su(s)'' is used. Example: ''Su libro'' could mean either \"his book\" or \"her book\", or even \"your book\" when speaking politely using the \"usted\" form of \"you\", while the informal form of \"you\" (\"t\u00fa/vos\") would be \"tu libro\", with the gender of the possessor being made clear from the context of the statement. Pronouns referring to people (or any noun) in Spanish have gender \u2013 ''\u00e9l'' for \"him\" and ''ella'' for \"her\". Only when referring to an indefinite antecedent is the neuter ''ello'' used, and since Spanish is a [[pronoun dropping language]], it usually only appears in [[prepositional phrases]], like ''para ello'', \"for it\". Grammatical person is [[inflection|inflected]] in verbs, so subject pronouns are generally used when necessary to make a distinction or add emphasis. For example, the verb ''vivir'' (\"to live\") may be conjugated in the third person as ''vive'' (\"he/she/it lives\") and be a complete sentence on its own. To make a distinction, one might say \"'''''Ella''''' ''vive en Madrid pero'' '''''\u00e9l''''' ''vive en Barcelona''\" \u2013 \"She lives in Madrid but he lives in Barcelona\". If it is absolutely necessary to provide a subject when referring to an unnamed object, a demonstrative can be used instead of a pronoun: ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 es '''eso'''?'' (\"What is '''that'''?\"). An acceptable answer would be ''Eso es un libro'' or ''Eso es una revista'' (\"That's a book\", \"That's a magazine\"), with the genderless ''eso'' as subject in both cases.\n\nHowever, when the pronoun is used as a direct object, gender-specific forms reappear in Spanish. The sentence \"I can't find it\", when referring to the masculine noun ''libro'' (book) would be \"''No '''lo''' encuentro''\", whereas if the thing being looked for were a magazine (''revista'' in Spanish, which is feminine) then the sentence would be \"''No '''la''' encuentro''\".\n\nWhen expressing [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]]/[[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]] sense, hence no known gender, there are several ways in Spanish: 3rd person singular ''se'' and sometimes ''uno'' can express \"one\"/\"you\" in the general sense, \"''No se sabe''\" (\"It's unknown\"). Another way is by omitting the pronoun in 3rd person plural to say \"they\", in the sense of \"you\" but exclusive \"''En Francia hablan franc\u00e9s''\" (\"In France they speak French\"), and 2nd person singular, ''t\u00fa'' (\"you\") as in \"''debes creer en ti mismo''\" (\"one shall believe in oneself\"). In instructions, like cooking recipes, one can see 3rd person plural with ''se'', or 1st person plural.\n\nThe Spanish language presents difficulties to [[gender neutral]] writing also due to gender [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] for adjectives like ''bueno'' (\"good\") and nouns, e.g. for professions ''panadero'' (\"baker\"), which signal masculine gender and using the other available form would signal exclusively feminine.\n\n===Germanic languages===\n====Icelandic====\n[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] uses a similar system to other [[Germanic languages]] in distinguishing three 3rd-person genders in the singular \u2013 ''hann'' (masculine gender), ''h\u00fan'' (feminine gender), ''\u00fea\u00f0'' ([[grammatical gender|neuter gender]]). However it also uses this three-way distinction in the plural: ''\u00feeir'' (m. only), ''\u00fe\u00e6r'' (f. only), ''\u00feau'' (n., which includes mixed gender). It is therefore possible to be gender-specific in all circumstances should one wish \u2013 although of course ''\u00feau'' can be used for gender-inclusiveness. Otherwise the form used is determined grammatically (i.e., by the gender of the noun replaced). In general statements the use of ''menn'' would be preferable as it is less specific than ''\u00feau''.<!---(see below) Where? --->\n\n====Norwegian====\nIn [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], a new word was proposed, ''hin'' ('sie' or 'hir') to fill the gap between the third person pronouns ''hun'' ('she') and ''han'' ('he'). ''Hin'' is very rarely used, and in limited special interest groups; it is not embraced by society as a whole. A reason for the marginal interest in a neuter gender word is the constructed nature of the word, and that the word is homonymous with several older words both in official language and dialectal speech, such as ''hin'' ('the other') and ''hinsides'' ('beyond'). One can also use ''man'' or ''en'' or ''den'' (''en'' means 'one'). These three are considered [[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]]. Amongst [[LGBT]] interest groups the use of the word 'hen' after the Swedish implementation in 2010 is now in use.<ref>{{cite news|title=Should we be using \"hen,\" as well as \"she\" and \"he\" in Norway? [norwegian]|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/viten/Bor-vi-begynne-a-si-hen-i-tillegg-til-hun-og-han-ogsa-i-Norge-8033593.html|accessdate=12 April 2016|agency=Aftenposten|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\n====Swedish====\n{{main|hen (pronoun)}}\nThe [[Swedish language]] has 4 grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, ''reale'' and neutral , which correspond to the 3rd person forms ''han, hon, den, det'' (\"he, she, it, it\"). The other forms are gender neutral: singular 1st ''jag'', 2nd ''du'', 3rd [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]]/[[impersonal pronoun|impersonal]] ''man'', plural 1st ''vi'', 2nd ''ni'', 3rd ''de''. Neutral is characterised by the definite singular article '-t' whereas the rest end with '-n'. The same distinction applies to the indefinite adjectival singular forms. For people and animals with specified gender the masculine or feminine are used. There is no grammatical way to make gender distinction in plural.\n\nIn Swedish, the word ''hen'' was introduced generally in the 2000s as a complement to the gender-specific ''hon'' (\"she\") and ''han'' (\"he\"). It can be used when the gender of a person is not known or when it is not desirable to specify them as either a \"she\" or \"he\". The word was proposed by [[Rolf Dun\u00e5s]] in 1966, and could be used occasionally, like in a guideline from the Swedish building council from 1980, authored by [[Rolf Reimers]]. Its origin may have been a combination of ''han'' and ''hon''.\n\nIt was proposed again in 1994, with reference to the Finnish ''h\u00e4n'', similarly pronounced, a [[personal pronoun]] that is gender-neutral, since [[Finnish language|Finnish]] completely lacks [[grammatical gender]]. In 2009 it was included in [[Nationalencyklopedin]]. However, it did not receive widespread recognition until around 2010, when it began to be used in some texts, and provoked some media debates and controversy, but is included since 2015 in ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'', the most authoritative [[glossary]] of the Swedish language, by the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url= http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=128&artikel=5925135\n|title= Svenska Akademiens ordlista inf\u00f6r hen\n|newspaper= [[Sveriges Radio]]\n|first= Mina |last= Benaissa |date= 29 July 2014\n}}\n</ref>\n\n{{As of | 2016}} Swedish [[manual of style|manuals of style]] treat \"hen\" as a [[neologism]]. Major newspapers like ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' have recommended against its usage, though some journalists still use it. The [[Swedish Language Council]] has not issued any general recommendations against the use of ''hen'', but advises against the use of the object form ''henom'' (\"her/him\"); it instead recommends using ''hen'' as both the subject and object form. ''Hen'' has two basic usages: as a way to avoid a stated preference to either gender; or as a way of referring to individuals who are [[transgender]], who prefer to identify themselves as belonging to a [[third gender]] or who reject the division of male/female gender roles on ideological grounds. Its entry will cover two definitions: as a reference to individual's belonging to an unspecified sex or [[third gender]], or where the sex is not known.\n\nTraditionally, Swedish offers other ways of avoiding using gender-specific pronouns; e.g., \"vederb\u00f6rande\" (\"the referred person\") and \"man\" (\"one\", as in \"Man borde...\"/\"One should...\") with its objective form \"en\" or alternatively \"en\" as both subjective and objective since \"man\"/\"one\" sounds the same as \"man\"/\"male adult\" although they are discernible through syntax. \"Denna/Denne\" (\"this one\") may be used to refer to a non-gender-specific referent already or soon-to-be mentioned (\"Vederb\u00f6rande kan, om denne s\u00e5 vill,...\"/\"The referent may, if they wish,...\"). One method is rewriting into the plural, as Swedish \u2013 like English \u2013 has only gender-neutral pronouns in the plural. Another method is writing the pronoun in the referent's grammatical gender (\"Barnet f\u00e5r om ''det'' vill.\"/\"The child is allowed to, if ''it'' wants to.\" The word \"barn\" is grammatically neuter, thus the use of the third-person neuter pronoun \"det\"); some nouns retain their traditional pronouns, e.g., \"man\"/\"man\" uses \"han\"/\"he\", \"kvinna\"/\"woman\" uses \"hon\"/\"she\", and \"m\u00e4nniska\"/\"human being\" uses \"hon\"/\"she\". While grammatically correct, using \"den/det\" to refer to human beings may sound as if the speaker regards the referenced human beings as objects.\n\n====German====\n\n{{Wiktionary pipe|sie#Etymology_2_2|sie}}\n{{Further|German pronouns}}\n{{Rewrite section|date=March 2017}}\n<!-- This section should include only 3rd person pronouns.

These pronouns of Old Rapa also define the degree of clusivity in the first person dual and the first person plural forms.\n\nIn the first person tense \u2013 as depicted in the table below \u2013 Old Rapa contains pronouns that are exclusive first person singular (ou \u2013 free; ku \u2013 bound), however does not contain pronouns that are inclusive first person singular. Old Rapa also consists of pronouns to describe both the exclusive and inclusive first person dual and first person plural forms. By definition, exclusive pronouns are pronouns that include the speaker and one or more others, although does not include the person being addressed. Inclusive pronouns are pronouns that work in the opposite fashion, by including the speaker and the addressee, and potentially more others.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Pronouns in Old Rapa<ref name=\":1\" />\n|\n|Singular\n\n(Free)\n|Singular\n\n(Bound)\n|Dual\n|Plural\n|-\n|First Person Exclusive\n|ou\n|ku\n|m\u0101ua\n|m\u0101tou\n|-\n|First Person Inclusive\n|\n|\n|t\u0101ua\n|t\u0101tou\n|-\n|Second Person\n|koe\n|\n|k\u014drua\n|koutou\n|-\n|Third Person\n|'\u014dna,koia\n|na\n|r\u0101ua\n|r\u0101tou\n|}\n\nFor both the second and third person tense, Old Rapa contains pronouns that describe second person singular (however devoiding a distinction for bound words), second person dual, and second person plural.

Finnish is essentially a [[pronoun dropping language]] but in the 3rd person singular it is common to use a pronoun explicitly.

Using a full-length pronoun in colloquial speech can be used to give a pronoun more semantic weight.\n\n===Hungarian===\n[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] does not have gendered pronouns nor any other concept of linguistic gender. The third person singular pronoun for a person (or a pet) is ''\u0151''.\n\n==Other languages==\n\n===Chinese===\n[[Written Chinese]] has gone in the opposite direction, from non-gendered to gendered pronouns, though this has not affected the spoken language.\n\nIn spoken [[standard Chinese|standard Mandarin]], there is no gender distinction in personal pronouns: the pronoun ''t\u0101'' ({{lang|zh|\u4ed6}}) can mean \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\".

As a result, the old character ''t\u0101'' ({{lang|zh|\u4ed6}}), which previously also meant \"she\" in written texts, is sometimes restricted to meaning \"he\" only. In contrast to most Chinese characters coined to represent specifically male concepts, the character ''t\u0101'' is formed with the ungendered character for person ''r\u00e9n'' ({{lang|zh|\u4eba}}), rather than the character for male ''n\u00e1n'' ({{lang|zh|\u7537}}).\"<ref name=\"Liu\">{{Cite book|title=Translingual Practice: Literature, National Culture, and Translated Modernity--China, 1900-1937|first=Lydia|last=Liu|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1995|pages=36\u201338}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of gendered pronouns in Chinese was part of the [[May Fourth Movement]] to modernize Chinese culture, and specifically an attempt to assert sameness between Chinese and the European languages, which generally have gendered pronouns.<ref name=\"Ettner\"/> Of all the contemporary neologisms from the period, the only ones to remain in common use are ''t\u0101'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b83}}) for objects, ''t\u0101'' ({{lang|zh|\u7260}}, from ''ni\u00fa'' {{lang|zh|\u725b}}, \"cow\") for animals, and ''t\u0101'' ({{lang|zh|\u7942}} from ''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u793a}}, \"revelation\") for gods.

Historically, ''kare'' was a word in the demonstrative paradigm (i.e., a system involving demonstrative prefixes, ''ko-'', ''so-'', ''a-,'' and ''do-''), used to point to an object that is physically far but psychologically near. The feminine counterpart ''kanojo'', on the other hand, is a combination of ''kano'' (adjective version of ''ka-'') and ''jo'' (\"woman\"), coined for the translation of its Western equivalents. It was not until the [[Meiji period]] that ''kare'' and ''kanojo'' were commonly used as the masculine and feminine pronoun in the same way as their Western equivalents.

The Turkish singular third-person pronoun ''o'' (he/she/it) is completely gender-neutral and can be used to refer to masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns. The plural third-person pronoun ''onlar'' (they) is used the same way.\n\nTurkish is also a [[null-subject language]] which means pronouns can usually be dropped while retaining the meaning of the sentence. For example, the sentences \"O okuldan geldi.\" and \"Okuldan geldi.\" both translate to \"He/she/it came from school.\"\n\n===Thai===\n[[Thai language#Pronouns|Thai pronouns]] are numerous. Here is only a short list.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! First person\n! Second person\n! Third person\n|-\n! Masculine\n| \u0e1c\u0e21 (phom)\n| \u0e19\u0e32\u0e22 (nai) (informal)\n| \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19 (mhor nun) (derogative)\n|-\n! Feminine\n| \u0e14\u0e34\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 (di chan) \u0e0a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19 (chan)\n|\n| \u0e19\u0e32\u0e07\u0e19\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19 (nang nun) (derogative)\n|-\n! Neuter\n| \u0e09\u0e31\u0e19 (chan) \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 (rao)\n| \u0e04\u0e38\u0e13 (khun) \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (ther)\n| \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 (man), \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (khao), \u0e41\u0e01 (kae), \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19 (than)\n|}\n\nThe pronoun \u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d (ther, lit: you) is semi-feminine. It can be used when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. It is seldom used when both parties are male.\n\nThe third neuter pronouns are used differently. \u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 (man) is often used to refer to inanimate objects and non-human animate beings. However, this pronoun can also be used to refer to people in informal situations (e.g., a mother speaking about her child, or a person speaking about a close friend). The pronouns \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (khao), \u0e41\u0e01 (kae), and \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19 (than) are often used in formal situations \u2013 with the latter being the most formal and \u0e41\u0e01 (kae) being used to refer to a person older than the speaker.\n\nThese three pronouns can also be used to refer to a different grammatical person. \u0e40\u0e02\u0e32 (khao) can be used in the first person, while \u0e41\u0e01 (kae) and \u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19 (than) can be used in the second person.\n\n==Constructed languages==\n\n===Esperanto===\n{{Main|Gender reform in Esperanto#Gender-neutral pronouns|l1=Gender-neutral pronouns in Esperanto}}\nEsperanto has no universally accepted gender-neutral pronouns, but there are several proposals. [[L. L. Zamenhof|Zamenhof]] proposed using the pronoun ''\u011di'' (literally \"it\"). Some writers also use other established pronouns like ''tiu'' (\"this\" or \"that\") or ''oni'' (\"one\"). Still other writers use [[neologism]]s such as ''ri'' for this purpose.\n\n===Ido===\nIdo has gendered and gender-neutral pronouns in the third person, both singular and plural. The gendered pronouns are:\n\n-'''il(u)''' (he)\n\n-'''el(u)''' (she)\n\n-'''ol(u)''' (it)\n\nThe final \"u\" can be dropped in all of these cases without any change in meaning.\n\nAdditionally there is the genderless \"lu\" which can freely replace any of the above forms if the gender of the referent is ignored, if one  wants it to be left ambiguous, or simply because the speaker doesn't want to state it.\n\nAll of these pronouns have a plural form, to translate the English \"they\":\n\n-'''ili''' (when all of the referents are male)\n\n-'''eli''' (when all of the referents are female)\n\n-'''oli''' (when all of the referents are inanimate), and\n\n-'''li''', which can substitute any of the above under any circumstances, but can also be used if the referents are of mixed genders.\n\nFirst and second person pronouns are all gender-neutral:\n\n-'''me''' (I)\n\n-'''tu''' (you, sing. informal)\n\n-'''vu''' (you, sing. formal)\n\n-'''ni''' (we)\n\n-'''vi''' (you, plural, both formal and informal).\n\n===Interlingua===\nBecause [[Interlingua]] is an [[Italic languages|Italic]] constructed language, it shares many traits with Spanish, Italian and French.\n\nSingular: 1st person: ''io'', 2nd: ''tu'', 3rd: ''ille, illa'' for humans/animals and ''illo'' for objects\n\nPlural: 1st: ''nos'', 2nd: ''vo''s, 3rd: ''illes, illas, illos'' as plural of above.\n\nThird person singular ''on'' is used for [[indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] \"one\"/\"you\" as in French.\n\n===Lingua Franca Nova===\n[[Lingua Franca Nova]] (\"Elefen\") has two third person singular pronouns: ''el'', used for humans and animals; ''lo'', used for all else. ''Los'' is used for the third person plural, ''se'' for third person reflexive (singular and plural), and ''sua'' for third person possessives (singular and plural).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Epicenity]]\n*[[Gender marking in job titles]]\n*[[Gender neutrality in genderless languages]]\n*[[Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender]]\n*[[Generic antecedent]]\n*[[Pronoun game]]\n*[[Feminist language reform]]\n*[[LGBT linguistics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Gender shifts in the history of English |author=Anne Curzan |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521820073}} (includes chapters on \"she\" for ships and [[generic he]])\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|Appendix:English third-person singular pronouns|Appendix:List of protologisms/third person singular gender neutral pronouns}}\n*[http://quinion.com/words/articles/genpr.htm Gender-Neutral Pronouns], a style guide\n*[http://www.bcli.org/pages/projects/genderfree/genderfree.html Gender-free Legal Writing]\n*[https://www.jstor.org/stable/455007?seq=1 The Epicene Pronouns: A Chronology of the Word That Failed] (gender-neutral pronoun history)\n* {{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/fashion/pronoun-confusion-sexual-fluidity.html | date = January 31, 2016 | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | title = She?

His father, Herbert Alfredovich Swann, was a [[Russians|Russian]] doctor of English descent, from the expatriate community that started out as the [[Muscovy Company]].  His mother, Naguim\u00e9 Sult\u00e1n Swann (born Pisz\u00f3va), was a [[Turkmens|Turkmen]]-Russian nurse from [[Ashgabat]], now part of [[Turkmenistan]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swann|first1=Donald|title=Swann's Way: A life in Song|date=1991|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-434-75292-4|page=13|edition=1st}}</ref> They were refugees from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].  Swann's great-grandfather, Alfred Trout Swan, a draper from [[Lincolnshire]], emigrated to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1840 and married the daughter of the horologer to the Tsars. Some time later the family added a second 'n' to their surname. His uncle [[Alfred Swan|Alfred]] wrote the first biography of [[Alexander Scriabin]] in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/cuttings.html |title=Flanders and Swann Online |publisher=Nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk |accessdate=15 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307030742/http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/cuttings.html |archivedate=7 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe family moved to London, where Swann attended [[Dulwich College Preparatory School]] and [[Westminster School]]. It was at the latter that he first met [[Michael Flanders]], a fellow pupil.  In July and August 1940 they staged a revue called ''Go To It''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.donaldswann.co.uk/hatshow.html|title=Hat Shows|website=Donaldswann.co.uk}}</ref> The pair then went their separate ways during [[World War II]], but were later to establish a musical partnership writing songs and [[light opera]], Flanders providing the words and Swann composing the music.\n\nIn 1941 Swann was awarded an [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], to read modern languages. In 1942 he registered as a [[conscientious objector]] and served with the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] (a [[Quaker]] relief organisation) in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]]. After the war, Swann returned to Oxford to read Russian and [[Greek language|Modern Greek]].\n\nIn the 1970s, Swann became a Sponsor of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].\n\nDonald Swann was married twice; he married Janet Oxborrow in 1955 and they were divorced in 1983; his second wife was the art historian Alison Smith. In 1992 he was diagnosed with cancer. He died at [[Trinity Hospice]] in South London on 23 March 1994, survived by both wives and two children from his first marriage: Rachel and Natasha.\n\n==Career==\nWhen by chance Swann and Flanders met again in 1948 it led to the start of their professional partnership. They began writing songs and light opera, Swann writing the music and Flanders writing the words. Their songs were performed by artists such as [[Ian Wallace (singer)|Ian Wallace]] and [[Joyce Grenfell]]. They subsequently wrote two two-man revues, ''[[At the Drop of a Hat]]'' and ''[[At the Drop of Another Hat]]'', which they performed all over the world until their partnership ended in 1967.\n\nAt the same time, Swann was maintaining a prolific musical output, writing the music for several operas and operettas, including a full-length version of [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Perelandra]]'', and a setting of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s poems from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to music in ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]'' collection. In 1953\u201359 Swann provided music for seven plays by [[Henry Reed (poet)|Henry Reed]] on the BBC Third Programme, generally known as the [[Hilda Tablet]] plays for one of the fictional characters, a lady composer of avant-garde \"musique concr\u00e8te renforc\u00e9e\". Besides incidental music, Swann composed for this character an opera, \"Emily Butter\" and several other complete works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/HREED.HTML |title=Henry Reed radio drama \u2013 DIVERSITY |publisher=Suttonelms.org.uk |date= |accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> A lifelong friendship with [[Sydney Carter]] resulted in scores of songs, the best known being \"The Youth of the Heart\" which reappeared in ''At the Drop of A Hat'', and a musical ''Lucy & the Hunter''. After his partnership with Flanders ended, Swann continued to give solo concerts and to write for other singers. He also formed the ''Swann Singers'' and toured with them in the 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, he continued performing in various combinations with singers and colleagues and as a solo artist. In the later years of his life he 'discovered' Victorian poetry and composed some of his most profound and moving music to the words of [[William Blake]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Christina Rossetti]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and others. He wrote a number of [[hymn tune]]s which appear in modern standard hymn books.\n\nIt is estimated that Swann wrote or set to music nearly 2,000 songs during his career.\n\n==Discography==\n===Flanders and Swann===\n* 1957 \u2013 ''Excerpts from at the Drop of a Hat'' ([[Extended play|EP]])\n* 1957 \u2013 ''More Excerpts from at the Drop of a Hat'' (EP)\n* 1957 \u2013 ''More out of the Hat!

His mother, Naguim\u00e9 Sult\u00e1n Swann (born Pisz\u00f3va), was a [[Turkmens|Turkmen]]-Russian nurse from [[Ashgabat]], now part of [[Turkmenistan]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swann|first1=Donald|title=Swann's Way: A life in Song|date=1991|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-434-75292-4|page=13|edition=1st}}</ref> They were refugees from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].  Swann's great-grandfather, Alfred Trout Swan, a draper from [[Lincolnshire]], emigrated to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1840 and married the daughter of the horologer to the Tsars. Some time later the family added a second 'n' to their surname. His uncle [[Alfred Swan|Alfred]] wrote the first biography of [[Alexander Scriabin]] in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/cuttings.html |title=Flanders and Swann Online |publisher=Nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk |accessdate=15 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307030742/http://www.nyanko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/fas/cuttings.html |archivedate=7 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe family moved to London, where Swann attended [[Dulwich College Preparatory School]] and [[Westminster School]]. It was at the latter that he first met [[Michael Flanders]], a fellow pupil.  In July and August 1940 they staged a revue called ''Go To It''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.donaldswann.co.uk/hatshow.html|title=Hat Shows|website=Donaldswann.co.uk}}</ref> The pair then went their separate ways during [[World War II]], but were later to establish a musical partnership writing songs and [[light opera]], Flanders providing the words and Swann composing the music.\n\nIn 1941 Swann was awarded an [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], to read modern languages. In 1942 he registered as a [[conscientious objector]] and served with the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] (a [[Quaker]] relief organisation) in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]]. After the war, Swann returned to Oxford to read Russian and [[Greek language|Modern Greek]].\n\nIn the 1970s, Swann became a Sponsor of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].\n\nDonald Swann was married twice; he married Janet Oxborrow in 1955 and they were divorced in 1983; his second wife was the art historian Alison Smith. In 1992 he was diagnosed with cancer. He died at [[Trinity Hospice]] in South London on 23 March 1994, survived by both wives and two children from his first marriage: Rachel and Natasha.\n\n==Career==\nWhen by chance Swann and Flanders met again in 1948 it led to the start of their professional partnership. They began writing songs and light opera, Swann writing the music and Flanders writing the words. Their songs were performed by artists such as [[Ian Wallace (singer)|Ian Wallace]] and [[Joyce Grenfell]]. They subsequently wrote two two-man revues, ''[[At the Drop of a Hat]]'' and ''[[At the Drop of Another Hat]]'', which they performed all over the world until their partnership ended in 1967.\n\nAt the same time, Swann was maintaining a prolific musical output, writing the music for several operas and operettas, including a full-length version of [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Perelandra]]'', and a setting of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s poems from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to music in ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]'' collection. In 1953\u201359 Swann provided music for seven plays by [[Henry Reed (poet)|Henry Reed]] on the BBC Third Programme, generally known as the [[Hilda Tablet]] plays for one of the fictional characters, a lady composer of avant-garde \"musique concr\u00e8te renforc\u00e9e\". Besides incidental music, Swann composed for this character an opera, \"Emily Butter\" and several other complete works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/HREED.HTML |title=Henry Reed radio drama \u2013 DIVERSITY |publisher=Suttonelms.org.uk |date= |accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> A lifelong friendship with [[Sydney Carter]] resulted in scores of songs, the best known being \"The Youth of the Heart\" which reappeared in ''At the Drop of A Hat'', and a musical ''Lucy & the Hunter''. After his partnership with Flanders ended, Swann continued to give solo concerts and to write for other singers. He also formed the ''Swann Singers'' and toured with them in the 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, he continued performing in various combinations with singers and colleagues and as a solo artist. In the later years of his life he 'discovered' Victorian poetry and composed some of his most profound and moving music to the words of [[William Blake]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Christina Rossetti]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and others. He wrote a number of [[hymn tune]]s which appear in modern standard hymn books.\n\nIt is estimated that Swann wrote or set to music nearly 2,000 songs during his career.\n\n==Discography==\n===Flanders and Swann===\n* 1957 \u2013 ''Excerpts from at the Drop of a Hat'' ([[Extended play|EP]])\n* 1957 \u2013 ''More Excerpts from at the Drop of a Hat'' (EP)\n* 1957 \u2013 ''More out of the Hat!

Anthony and Lulu spend the day together looking for Kate, but see Jessica spontaneously kissing her which causes Anthony to think Kate is a lesbian. They go home and decide to have sex, despite Anthony knowing that Kate has come home to look for him, and Lulu knowing Kate is not a lesbian. Melody is painting Colin for the last time at the hospital, and he accidentally falls out of the window and needs to go to a real hospital. Fred is ignoring dramatic and frantic phone calls from Sam as he vows to not be the one who runs to his side, however Sam has accompanied Melody and leaves a deliberately vague voice mail saying he is at the hospital. Fred rushes there and admonishes Sam for stretching the truth and breaking him and Will up, before collapsing from hypoglycemia. Sam stays at his bedside, and after apologising, kisses Fred. Under the guise of being a nurse, Melody looks after Colin in hospital before his ex-wife Cara ([[Janie Dee]]) visits the hospital, and Colin wakes up to show his support for Melody.

Anthony lives with a number of housemates including his \u2018anal\u2019 fianc\u00e9e Kate (Louise Ford), their overtly sexual friend Sam (Jonathan Bailey), French artist Melody (Julie Dray), and the timid Fred (Amit Shah). Sam convinces Kate to throw him an elaborate scavenger hunt as his birthday party, which is attended by a number of friends and Kate\u2019s colleagues, including the recently divorced Colin (Adrian Scarborough) who fascinates Melody. Anthony is delighted by the arrival of Lulu, although tension immediately arises for Kate due to the attraction between the two friends. While Lulu and Anthony become reacquainted, the housemates are split into partners for the party. Melody and Colin bond, while Sam discovers a surprising friendship with Fred.

Following a fit of hysterics regarding their bath blowing up, Kate accidentally gets Lulu a temporary job as a receptionist at her work, where Melody calls, demanding to see Colin.

Melody is enraptured by Colin, and requests to make him and his pain the subject of her art, and Colin moves into the hospital. Sam is keen to spend more time with Fred, and gets him to take the day off work to spend it with him, which concludes with Sam attending his father\u2019s funeral. Fred begins to express interest in Sam; however, Sam gently rebuffs him, but continues to lead him on.

During a group sing-a-long, she becomes exasperated that she has to sing about orgasms, and she claims that Anthony told Lulu that she has never orgasmed. Kate tells Lulu in confidence that she has orgasmed before, just never with Anthony. The evening continues to get heated, with Sam becoming jealous of Fred\u2019s adoration of Will, causing him to pursue Lulu and irritating Anthony who tells him to stop out of jealousy. Lulu offends Melody and Colin by questioning their relationship, who leave the dinner, and continue to paint. Lulu then accidentally reveals that Kate has never experienced an orgasm with Anthony, with the dinner table then collapsing and ruins the dinner. Anthony and Kate go to bed, and Fred and Will leave, with a drunk Lulu remaining with Sam, who declines her advances.

Sam takes Will and Fred to look at housing options, where Will privately tells Sam he dislikes his crass language and behaviours towards Fred. Sam defies him and openly begins showing his animosity towards Will. Melody paints Kate\u2019s body, and they begin to bond over their relationships, their femininity and confidence. When Melody asks why Kate likes Anthony, she falters in her response, before they start having a playful paint fight, which is joined by Will, Sam and Fred, and later Anthony and Lulu. Colin returns from a visit to the dentist, and happily tells Melody he is at home at the hospital now. Becoming sexually frustrated by Will and Fred, Sam asks Lulu to have sex with him, which she does after acknowledging Anthony will not be happy.

Sam adopting a peculiar voice and calling himself \u2018Stephen\u2019, and causing Fred to deduce it is Sam. Later at the hospital, Sam confronts Will, who tells Sam he thinks he is gay because he is obsessive about the men in his life. Sam seduces Will into kissing him and he runs to reveal Will\u2019s betrayal to Fred, at which point Will tells Anthony that Lulu and Sam had sex, and Sam admits that Kate is not pregnant.

Anthony and Lulu spend the day together looking for Kate, but see Jessica spontaneously kissing her which causes Anthony to think Kate is a lesbian. They go home and decide to have sex, despite Anthony knowing that Kate has come home to look for him, and Lulu knowing Kate is not a lesbian. Melody is painting Colin for the last time at the hospital, and he accidentally falls out of the window and needs to go to a real hospital. Fred is ignoring dramatic and frantic phone calls from Sam as he vows to not be the one who runs to his side, however Sam has accompanied Melody and leaves a deliberately vague voice mail saying he is at the hospital. Fred rushes there and admonishes Sam for stretching the truth and breaking him and Will up, before collapsing from hypoglycemia. Sam stays at his bedside, and after apologising, kisses Fred. Under the guise of being a nurse, Melody looks after Colin in hospital before his ex-wife Cara ([[Janie Dee]]) visits the hospital, and Colin wakes up to show his support for Melody. In the morning, Anthony tells Lulu that Kate does not want to break up, and asks her what he should do. Lulu tells them to remain together, hiding her disappointment.

These Glycoazodyes use a [[Ester|diester]] linker, specifically a [[Succinic acid|succinyl]] bridge. An [[ester]] group bonds the sugar to an n-[[alkane]] spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another [[ester]] group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Synthesis ====\nFirst-generation Glycoazodyes are synthesized using [[glucose]], [[galactose]] or [[lactose]] as the sugar group. The point of [[Ester|esterification]] is controlled by selectively protecting and deprotecting alcohol groups on the sugar, or by choosing azo dyes with different alcohol group positions.\u00a0 Either the dye or the sugar group can be [[Succinylation|succinylated]] by reacting a free alcohol group with [[succinic anhydride]]. The resulting hemisuccinate then reacts with a free alcohol group on either the dye or the sugar. The condensation product is then deprotected.<ref name=\":0\" /> \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== Second-generation ===\nThe second-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2008. These Glycoazodyes use an etherel linker. An ether group bonds the sugar and the dye to an n-[[alkane]] spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another ether group. Like first-generation Glycoazodyes, second-generation Glycoazodyes use glucose, galactose or lactose as the sugar group.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n=== Third-generation ===\nThe third-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2015. These Glycoazodyes use an amido-ester linker.
