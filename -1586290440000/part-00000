Currently, the building of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|very hostile]] to human life. They would involve technologies, such as [[controlled ecological life support system]]s, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also have to deal with the as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term. Because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the Earth into orbit (around $1400 per kg, or $640 per-pound, to low Earth orbit by the Falcon Heavy vehicle, expected to further decrease), a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.\n\nThere are yet no plans for building space colonies by any large-scale organization, either government or private. However, many proposals, speculations, and designs for space settlements have been made through the years, and a considerable number of space colonization [[space advocacy|advocates]] and groups are active.

Second step, these colonies could gradually become self-sufficient, enabling them to survive if or when the mother civilization on earth fails or dies. Third step, the colonies could develop and expand their habitation by themselves on their [[space station]]s or celestial bodies, fx via [[terraforming]]. Fourth step, the colonies could self-replicate and establish new colonies further into space, a process that could then repeat itself and continue at an [[Exponential growth|exponential rate]] throughout cosmos.

There is no night in free space, and no clouds or atmosphere to block sunlight. Light intensity obeys an [[inverse-square law]]. So the solar energy available at distance ''d'' from the Sun is ''E'' = 1367/''d''<sup>2</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>, where ''d'' is measured in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) and 1367 watts/m<sup>2</sup> is the energy available at the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun, 1 AU.<ref>McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology, 8th Edition 1997; vol. 16 p. 654</ref>\n\nIn the weightlessness and vacuum of space, high temperatures for industrial processes can easily be achieved in [[solar ovens]] with huge parabolic reflectors made of metallic foil with very lightweight support structures. Flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas (to avoid line-of-sight access for cosmic rays, or to make the Sun's image appear to move across their \"sky\") or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.\n\nLarge solar power photovoltaic cell arrays or thermal power plants would be needed to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hours]] per person per year.)<ref>[http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm UNESCAP Electric Power in Asia and the Pacific] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213083253/http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm |date=February 13, 2011 }}</ref> These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with [[wireless power transmission]].\n\nA major export of the initial space settlement designs was anticipated to be large [[solar power satellite]]s (SPS) that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked [[microwave]] beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[nuclear waste]] from electricity generation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/gaertner1/|title=Solar vs. Traditional Energy in Homes|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\nTransmitting solar energy wirelessly from the Earth to the Moon and back is also an idea proposed for the benefit of space colonization and energy resources. Physicist Dr. David Criswell, who worked for NASA during the Apollo missions, came up with the idea of using power beams to transfer energy from space. These beams, microwaves with a wavelength of about 12&nbsp;cm, will be almost untouched as they travel through the atmosphere.

Otherwise, the means of generating the power would need to be included with these projects and pay the heavy penalty of Earth launch costs. Therefore, other than proposed demonstration projects for power delivered to Earth,<ref name=\"NatSecSpaceOffice2007\"/> the first priority for SPS electricity is likely to be locations in space, such as communications satellites, fuel depots or \"orbital tugboat\" boosters transferring cargo and passengers between [[low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) and other orbits such as [[geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO), [[lunar orbit]] or [[Highly elliptical orbit|highly-eccentric Earth orbit]] (HEEO).<ref name=\"Lewis1997\">[[Mining the Sky]]</ref>{{rp|132}} The system will also rely on satellites and receiving stations on Earth to convert the energy into electricity.

Mars has nights, relatively high gravity, and an atmosphere featuring [[Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|large dust storms]] to cover and degrade solar panels.

The [[Biosphere 2]] project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people for at least a year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that the mission failed.\n\nThe relationship between organisms, their habitat and the non-Earth environment can be:\n* Organisms and their habitat fully isolated from the environment (examples include artificial [[biosphere]], Biosphere 2, [[life support system]])\n* Changing the environment to become a life-friendly habitat, a process called [[terraforming]]\n* Changing organisms to become more compatible with the environment (see [[genetic engineering]], [[transhumanism]], [[cyborg]])\n\nA combination of the above technologies is also possible.\n\n===Radiation protection===\n{{see also|Health threat from cosmic rays}}\n\n[[Cosmic rays]] and [[solar flare]]s create a lethal radiation environment in space.

Use of a [[sperm bank]] from Earth also allows a smaller starting base with negligible [[inbreeding]].\n\nResearchers in conservation biology have tended to adopt the \"50/500\" rule of thumb initially advanced by Franklin and Soule. This rule says a short-term [[effective population size]] (''N''<sub>e</sub>) of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of [[breed|inbreeding]], whereas a long\u2010term ''N''<sub>e</sub> of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability. The ''N''<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1% per generation, approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders. The ''N''<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;500 value attempts to balance the rate of gain in genetic variation due to mutation with the rate of loss due to [[genetic drift]].\n\nAssuming a journey of 6,300 years, the astrophysicist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Marin and the particle physicist Camille Beluffi calculated that the minimum viable population for a [[generation ship]] to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] would be 98 settlers at the beginning of the mission (then the crew will breed until reaching a stable population of several hundred settlers within the ship) .<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1806.03856|last1=Marin|first1=F|title=Computing the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=71|pages=45|last2=Beluffi|first2=C|year=2018|bibcode=2018JBIS...71...45M}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611485/this-is-how-many-people-wed-have-to-send-to-proxima-centauri-to-make-sure-someone-actually/amp/ |magazine=[[MIT Technology Review]] |title=This is how many people we'd have to send to Proxima Centauri to make sure someone actually arrives |date=June 22, 2018 |quote=\u201cWe can then conclude that, under the parameters used for those simulations, a minimum crew of 98 settlers is needed for a 6,300-year multi-generational space journey towards Proxima Centauri b,\u201d say Marin and Beluffi.}}</ref>\n\n=== Money and currency ===\nExperts have debated on the possible usage of money and currencies in societies that will be established in space.

A drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Water-ice deposits that exist in some polar [[Impact crater|craters]] could serve as a source for these elements. An alternative solution is to bring hydrogen from near-Earth asteroids and combine it with oxygen extracted from lunar rock.\n\nThe Moon's low surface gravity is also a concern, as it is unknown whether 1/6[[g-force|g]] is enough to maintain human health for long periods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=R. L.|date=March 1993|title=The effects of prolonged weightlessness and reduced gravity environments on human survival.|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=46|issue=3|pages=97\u2013106|pmid=11539500}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon's lack of atmosphere provides no protection from space radiation or meteoroids. The early Moon colonies may shelter in ancient [[Lunar lava tube]]s to gain protection. The two-week day/night cycle makes use of solar power more difficult.\n\n====Lagrange points====\n{{Main|Lagrange point colonization}}\n[[File:Lagrange points.jpg|thumb|A contour plot of the [[gravitational potential]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]], showing the five Earth\u2013Sun Lagrange points]]\n\nAnother near-Earth possibility are the five Earth\u2013Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]]. Although they would generally also take a few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the Sun. However, the fact that the Earth\u2013Moon Lagrange points {{L4}} and {{L5}} tend to collect dust and debris, whereas {{L1}}-{{L3}} require active [[orbital stationkeeping|station-keeping]] measures to maintain a stable position, make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed. Additionally, the orbit of {{L2}}\u2013{{L5}} takes them out of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time, exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.\n\nThe five Earth\u2013Sun Lagrange points would totally eliminate eclipses, but only {{L1}} and {{L2}} would be reachable in a few days' time. The other three Earth\u2013Sun points would require months to reach.\n\n===Other micro-g orbits===\nSee [[space habitat]]\n\n===The inner planets===\n\n====Mercury====\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\n{{specific|section|date=August 2018}}\nColonizing Mercury would involve similar challenges as the Moon as there are few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nGeologist Stephen Gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make Mercury an ideal place to build and launch [[solar sail]] spacecraft, which could launch as folded up \"chunks\" by [[mass driver]] from Mercury's surface.  Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's [[solar constant]] is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.<ref>Stanley Schmidt and [[Robert Zubrin]], eds., \"Islands in the Sky: Bold New Ideas for Colonizing Space\"; Wiley, 1996, p. 71-84</ref>\n\n====Venus====\n{{Main|Colonization of Venus}}\n[[File:TerraformedVenus.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a terraformed Venus]]\n\n====Mars====\n{{Main|Colonization of Mars}}\nL\n\n===Asteroid belt===\n{{Main|Colonization of the asteroids}}\n{{See also|Asteroids#Exploration}}\n\nColonization of asteroids would require space habitats. The [[asteroid belt]] has significant overall material available, the largest object being [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous [[momentum]]. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.\n\n===Moons of outer planets===\n\n====Jovian moons&nbsp;\u2013 Europa, Callisto and Ganymede====\n{{Main|Colonization of Europa|Colonization of the outer Solar System}}\n\nThe [[Artemis Project]] designed a plan to colonize [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], one of [[Jupiter]]'s moons. Scientists were to inhabit [[igloo]]s and drill down into the Europan ice crust, exploring any sub-surface ocean. This plan discusses possible use of \"air pockets\" for human habitation. Europa is considered one of the more habitable bodies in the Solar System and so merits investigation as a possible abode for life.\n\nNASA performed a study called ''HOPE'' (Revolutionary Concepts for '''H'''uman '''O'''uter '''P'''lanet '''E'''xploration) regarding the future exploration of the Solar System.<ref>Patrick A.

If Enceladus has liquid water, it joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as one of the prime places in the Solar System to look for extraterrestrial life and possible future settlements.\n\nOther large satellites: [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], all have large quantities of volatiles, which can be used to support settlements.\n\n===Trans-Neptunian region===\n{{main|Colonization of trans-Neptunian objects}}\n\nThe [[Kuiper belt]] is estimated to have 70,000 bodies of 100&nbsp;km or larger.\n\n[[Freeman Dyson]] has suggested that within a few centuries human civilization will have relocated to the Kuiper belt.<ref>Freeman Dyson, ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513922-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Oort cloud]] is estimated to have up to a trillion comets.\n\n===Outside the Solar System===\n[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|A [[star]] forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]]]\nLooking beyond the Solar System, there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred thousand times further away than the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high speed (some more-than-fractional percentage of the [[speed of light]]), or travel times lasting centuries or millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems can provide.\n\nMany scientific papers have been published about [[interstellar travel]]. Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and generational voyages seem possible, though representing a very considerable technological and economic challenge unlikely to be met for some time, particularly for manned probes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSpace colonization technology could in principle allow human expansion at high, but sub-relativistic speeds, substantially less than the speed of light, ''c''.&nbsp; An interstellar colony ship would be similar to a space habitat, with the addition of major propulsion capabilities and independent energy generation.\n\nHypothetical [[starship]] concepts proposed both by scientists and in [[hard science fiction]] include:\n* A [[generation ship]] would travel much slower than light, with consequent interstellar trip times of many decades or centuries. The crew would go through generations before the journey is complete, so that none of the initial crew would be expected to survive to arrive at the destination, assuming current human lifespans.\n* A [[sleeper ship]], in which most or all of the crew spend the journey in some form of [[hibernation]] or [[suspended animation]], allowing some or all who undertake the journey to survive to the end.\n* An [[embryo space colonization|embryo-carrying interstellar starship]] (EIS), much smaller than a generation ship or sleeper ship, transporting human [[embryo]]s or DNA in a frozen or dormant state to the destination. (Obvious biological and psychological problems in birthing, raising, and educating such voyagers, neglected here, may not be fundamental.)\n* A [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission|fission]] powered ship (e.g. [[ion drive]]) of some kind, achieving velocities of up to perhaps 10% ''c''&nbsp; permitting one-way trips to nearby stars with durations comparable to a human lifetime.\n* A [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]-ship, a nuclear-powered concept proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]] which would use [[nuclear bomb|nuclear explosions]] to propel a starship. A special case of the preceding nuclear rocket concepts, with similar potential velocity capability, but possibly easier technology.\n* [[Solar sail|Laser propulsion]] concepts, using some form of beaming of power from the Solar System might allow a [[solar sail|light-sail]] or other ship to reach high speeds, comparable to those theoretically attainable by the fusion-powered electric rocket, above. These methods would need some means, such as supplementary nuclear propulsion, to stop at the destination, but a hybrid (light-sail for acceleration, fusion-electric for deceleration) system might be possible.\n* [[Mind uploading|Uploaded human minds]] or [[artificial intelligence]] may be transmitted via radio or laser at light speed to interstellar destinations where [[self-replicating spacecraft]] have travelled subluminally and set up infrastructure and possibly also brought some minds. [[Extraterrestrial intelligence]] might be another viable destination.\n\nThe above concepts which appear limited to high, but still sub-relativistic speeds, due to fundamental energy and reaction mass considerations, and all would entail trip times which might be enabled by space colonization technology, permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries. Yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1% of ''c''&nbsp; would permit settlement of the entire Galaxy in less than one half of the Sun's galactic orbital period of ~240,000,000 years, which is comparable to the timescale of other galactic processes. Thus, even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible (which cannot be clearly determined at this time), the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the Solar System without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen. This could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales, given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.\n\nIf humanity does gain access to a large amount of energy, on the order of the mass-energy of entire planets, it may eventually become feasible to construct [[Alcubierre drive]]s. These are one of the few methods of superluminal travel which may be possible under current physics. However it is probable that such a device could never exist, due to the fundamental challenges posed. For more on this see [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Difficulties of making and using an Alcubierre Drive]].\n\n====Intergalactic travel====\n{{Main|Intergalactic travel}} \nLooking beyond the Milky Way, there are at least 2 trillion other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times farther than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years,<ref>Stuart Armstrong and Anders Sandberg, \"Eternity in six hours: Intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox,\" ''Acta Astronautica'' 89 (2013): 1\u201313.</ref> or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the [[Alcubierre drive]]. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that [[intergalactic travel]] is impossible in principle.\n\nUploaded human minds or AI may be transmitted to other galaxies in the hope some intelligence there would receive and activate them.\n\n==Economics==\nSpace colonization can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become [[Economic behavior|cheap enough]] (such as space access by cheaper launch systems) to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose, in addition to estimated profits from [[commercial use of space]].\n\nAlthough there are no immediate prospects for the large amounts of money required for space colonization to be available given traditional launch costs,<ref>[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Basics/wwwwh.html Space Settlement Basics] by Al Globus, NASA Ames Research Center.

Currently, the building of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|very hostile]] to human life. They would involve technologies, such as [[controlled ecological life support system]]s, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also have to deal with the as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term. Because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the Earth into orbit (around $1400 per kg, or $640 per-pound, to low Earth orbit by the Falcon Heavy vehicle, expected to further decrease), a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.\n\nThere are yet no plans for building space colonies by any large-scale organization, either government or private. However, many proposals, speculations, and designs for space settlements have been made through the years, and a considerable number of space colonization [[space advocacy|advocates]] and groups are active.

So the solar energy available at distance ''d'' from the Sun is ''E'' = 1367/''d''<sup>2</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>, where ''d'' is measured in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) and 1367 watts/m<sup>2</sup> is the energy available at the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun, 1 AU.<ref>McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology, 8th Edition 1997; vol. 16 p. 654</ref>\n\nIn the weightlessness and vacuum of space, high temperatures for industrial processes can easily be achieved in [[solar ovens]] with huge parabolic reflectors made of metallic foil with very lightweight support structures. Flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas (to avoid line-of-sight access for cosmic rays, or to make the Sun's image appear to move across their \"sky\") or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.\n\nLarge solar power photovoltaic cell arrays or thermal power plants would be needed to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hours]] per person per year.)<ref>[http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm UNESCAP Electric Power in Asia and the Pacific] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213083253/http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm |date=February 13, 2011 }}</ref> These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with [[wireless power transmission]].\n\nA major export of the initial space settlement designs was anticipated to be large [[solar power satellite]]s (SPS) that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked [[microwave]] beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[nuclear waste]] from electricity generation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/gaertner1/|title=Solar vs. Traditional Energy in Homes|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\nTransmitting solar energy wirelessly from the Earth to the Moon and back is also an idea proposed for the benefit of space colonization and energy resources.

Otherwise, the means of generating the power would need to be included with these projects and pay the heavy penalty of Earth launch costs. Therefore, other than proposed demonstration projects for power delivered to Earth,<ref name=\"NatSecSpaceOffice2007\"/> the first priority for SPS electricity is likely to be locations in space, such as communications satellites, fuel depots or \"orbital tugboat\" boosters transferring cargo and passengers between [[low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) and other orbits such as [[geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO), [[lunar orbit]] or [[Highly elliptical orbit|highly-eccentric Earth orbit]] (HEEO).<ref name=\"Lewis1997\">[[Mining the Sky]]</ref>{{rp|132}} The system will also rely on satellites and receiving stations on Earth to convert the energy into electricity.

However, nuclear submarines run \"open loop\"\u2014extracting oxygen from seawater, and typically dumping [[carbon dioxide]] overboard, although they recycle existing oxygen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh?DocID=P20100106003-200911-201004190023-201004190023-1642-1650|title=A Novel Application of the SAWD-Sabatier-SPE Integrated System for CO2 Removal and O2 Regeneration in Submarine Cabins during Prolonged Voyages|last=Huang|first=Zhi|website=Airiti Library|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> Recycling of the carbon dioxide has been approached in the literature using the [[Sabatier process]] or the [[Bosch reaction]].\n\nAlthough a fully mechanistic life support system is conceivable, a [[closed ecological system]] is generally proposed for life support. The [[Biosphere 2]] project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people for at least a year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that the mission failed.\n\nThe relationship between organisms, their habitat and the non-Earth environment can be:\n* Organisms and their habitat fully isolated from the environment (examples include artificial [[biosphere]], Biosphere 2, [[life support system]])\n* Changing the environment to become a life-friendly habitat, a process called [[terraforming]]\n* Changing organisms to become more compatible with the environment (see [[genetic engineering]], [[transhumanism]], [[cyborg]])\n\nA combination of the above technologies is also possible.\n\n===Radiation protection===\n{{see also|Health threat from cosmic rays}}\n\n[[Cosmic rays]] and [[solar flare]]s create a lethal radiation environment in space. In Earth orbit, the [[Van Allen belts]] make living above the Earth's atmosphere difficult. To protect life, settlements must be surrounded by sufficient mass to absorb most incoming radiation, unless magnetic or plasma radiation shields were developed.<ref name = spacecraftshielding>[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/ Spacecraft Shielding] engineering.dartmouth.edu.

However, it represents a significant obstacle to maneuvering vessels with such massive bulk (mobile spacecraft being particularly likely to use less massive active shielding).<ref name = spacecraftshielding/> Inertia would necessitate powerful thrusters to start or stop rotation, or electric motors to spin two massive portions of a vessel in opposite senses. Shielding material can be stationary around a rotating interior. To protect from radiation they say to bundle up in the thickest clothes possible so that the cloth can absorb the radiation and prevent it from getting to your body.\n\n===Self-replication===\n{{see also|von Neumann probe|clanking replicator|molecular nanotechnology}}\n\n[[Space manufacturing]] could enable self-replication. Some think it's the ultimate goal because it allows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth.<ref>Ian Crawford, \"Where are they?,\" ''Scientific American'' 283, no. 1 (2000 July): 38.</ref> It could be argued that the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of [[self-replication]].<ref>Lynn Margulis and Ricardo Guerrero, \"Life as a planetary phenomenon: the colonization of Mars,\" ''Microbiolog\u00eda'' 11 (1995): 173\u201384.</ref> Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as [[integrated circuit]]s, medicines, [[DNA|genetic material]] and tools.\n\n===Psychological adjustment===\nThe monotony and loneliness that comes from a prolonged space mission can leave astronauts susceptible to cabin fever or having a psychotic break. Moreover, lack of sleep, fatigue, and work overload can affect an astronaut's ability to perform well in an environment such as space where every action is critical.<ref>Clynes, Manfred E. and Nathan S. Kline, (1960) \"Cyborgs and Space,\" Astronautics, September, pp.&nbsp;26\u201327 and 74\u201376;</ref>\n\n===Population size===\nIn 2002, the [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[John H. Moore]] estimated<ref>https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated.</ref> that a population of 150\u2013180 would permit a stable society to exist for 60 to 80 generations\u2014equivalent to 2000 years.\n\nA much smaller initial population of as little as two women should be viable as long as human [[embryo]]s are available from Earth. Use of a [[sperm bank]] from Earth also allows a smaller starting base with negligible [[inbreeding]].\n\nResearchers in conservation biology have tended to adopt the \"50/500\" rule of thumb initially advanced by Franklin and Soule. This rule says a short-term [[effective population size]] (''N''<sub>e</sub>) of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of [[breed|inbreeding]], whereas a long\u2010term ''N''<sub>e</sub> of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability. The ''N''<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1% per generation, approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders. The ''N''<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;500 value attempts to balance the rate of gain in genetic variation due to mutation with the rate of loss due to [[genetic drift]].\n\nAssuming a journey of 6,300 years, the astrophysicist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Marin and the particle physicist Camille Beluffi calculated that the minimum viable population for a [[generation ship]] to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] would be 98 settlers at the beginning of the mission (then the crew will breed until reaching a stable population of several hundred settlers within the ship) .<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1806.03856|last1=Marin|first1=F|title=Computing the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=71|pages=45|last2=Beluffi|first2=C|year=2018|bibcode=2018JBIS...71...45M}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611485/this-is-how-many-people-wed-have-to-send-to-proxima-centauri-to-make-sure-someone-actually/amp/ |magazine=[[MIT Technology Review]] |title=This is how many people we'd have to send to Proxima Centauri to make sure someone actually arrives |date=June 22, 2018 |quote=\u201cWe can then conclude that, under the parameters used for those simulations, a minimum crew of 98 settlers is needed for a 6,300-year multi-generational space journey towards Proxima Centauri b,\u201d say Marin and Beluffi.}}</ref>\n\n=== Money and currency ===\nExperts have debated on the possible usage of money and currencies in societies that will be established in space. The Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination, or QUID, is a physical currency made from a space-qualified polymer [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] for inter-planetary travelers. QUID was designed for the foreign exchange company Travelex by scientists from Britain's National Space Centre and the University of Leicester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/4454-scientists-design-space-currency.html|title=Scientists Design New Space Currency|last=Christensen|first=Bill|date=October 10, 2007|website=Space.com|access-date=2019-01-21}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Mars mission.jpg|thumb|Artist Les Bossinas' 1989 concept of [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars mission]]]]\nLocation is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates. The location of colonization can be on a physical body [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], [[natural satellite]], or [[asteroid]] or orbiting one. For colonies not on a body see also [[space habitat]].\n\n===Near-Earth space===\n\n====The Moon====\n{{Main|Colonization of the Moon}}\nDue to its proximity and familiarity, Earth's Moon is discussed as a target for colonization. It has the benefits of proximity to Earth and lower [[escape velocity]], allowing for easier exchange of goods and services. A drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Water-ice deposits that exist in some polar [[Impact crater|craters]] could serve as a source for these elements. An alternative solution is to bring hydrogen from near-Earth asteroids and combine it with oxygen extracted from lunar rock.\n\nThe Moon's low surface gravity is also a concern, as it is unknown whether 1/6[[g-force|g]] is enough to maintain human health for long periods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=R. L.|date=March 1993|title=The effects of prolonged weightlessness and reduced gravity environments on human survival.|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=46|issue=3|pages=97\u2013106|pmid=11539500}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon's lack of atmosphere provides no protection from space radiation or meteoroids. The early Moon colonies may shelter in ancient [[Lunar lava tube]]s to gain protection. The two-week day/night cycle makes use of solar power more difficult.\n\n====Lagrange points====\n{{Main|Lagrange point colonization}}\n[[File:Lagrange points.jpg|thumb|A contour plot of the [[gravitational potential]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]], showing the five Earth\u2013Sun Lagrange points]]\n\nAnother near-Earth possibility are the five Earth\u2013Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]]. Although they would generally also take a few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the Sun. However, the fact that the Earth\u2013Moon Lagrange points {{L4}} and {{L5}} tend to collect dust and debris, whereas {{L1}}-{{L3}} require active [[orbital stationkeeping|station-keeping]] measures to maintain a stable position, make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed. Additionally, the orbit of {{L2}}\u2013{{L5}} takes them out of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time, exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.\n\nThe five Earth\u2013Sun Lagrange points would totally eliminate eclipses, but only {{L1}} and {{L2}} would be reachable in a few days' time. The other three Earth\u2013Sun points would require months to reach.\n\n===Other micro-g orbits===\nSee [[space habitat]]\n\n===The inner planets===\n\n====Mercury====\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\n{{specific|section|date=August 2018}}\nColonizing Mercury would involve similar challenges as the Moon as there are few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nGeologist Stephen Gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make Mercury an ideal place to build and launch [[solar sail]] spacecraft, which could launch as folded up \"chunks\" by [[mass driver]] from Mercury's surface.  Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's [[solar constant]] is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.<ref>Stanley Schmidt and [[Robert Zubrin]], eds., \"Islands in the Sky: Bold New Ideas for Colonizing Space\"; Wiley, 1996, p. 71-84</ref>\n\n====Venus====\n{{Main|Colonization of Venus}}\n[[File:TerraformedVenus.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a terraformed Venus]]\n\n====Mars====\n{{Main|Colonization of Mars}}\n\n===Asteroid belt===\n{{Main|Colonization of the asteroids}}\n{{See also|Asteroids#Exploration}}\n\nColonization of asteroids would require space habitats. The [[asteroid belt]] has significant overall material available, the largest object being [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous [[momentum]]. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.\n\n===Moons of outer planets===\n\n====Jovian moons&nbsp;\u2013 Europa, Callisto and Ganymede====\n{{Main|Colonization of Europa|Colonization of the outer Solar System}}\n\nThe [[Artemis Project]] designed a plan to colonize [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], one of [[Jupiter]]'s moons. Scientists were to inhabit [[igloo]]s and drill down into the Europan ice crust, exploring any sub-surface ocean. This plan discusses possible use of \"air pockets\" for human habitation. Europa is considered one of the more habitable bodies in the Solar System and so merits investigation as a possible abode for life.\n\nNASA performed a study called ''HOPE'' (Revolutionary Concepts for '''H'''uman '''O'''uter '''P'''lanet '''E'''xploration) regarding the future exploration of the Solar System.<ref>Patrick A.

It could be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.\n\nThree of the [[Galilean moons]] (Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) have an abundance of volatiles that may support colonization efforts.\n\n====Moons of Saturn&nbsp;\u2013 Titan, Enceladus, and others====\n{{Main|Colonization of Titan}}\n\n[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is suggested as a target for colonization,<ref name=\"zoob2ttn\">Robert Zubrin, ''Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization'', section: Titan, pp. 163\u2013166, Tarcher/Putnam, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-58542-036-0}}</ref> because it is the only moon in the Solar System to have a dense atmosphere and is rich in carbon-bearing compounds.

If Enceladus has liquid water, it joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as one of the prime places in the Solar System to look for extraterrestrial life and possible future settlements.\n\nOther large satellites: [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], all have large quantities of volatiles, which can be used to support settlements.\n\n===Trans-Neptunian region===\n{{main|Colonization of trans-Neptunian objects}}\n\nThe [[Kuiper belt]] is estimated to have 70,000 bodies of 100&nbsp;km or larger.\n\n[[Freeman Dyson]] has suggested that within a few centuries human civilization will have relocated to the Kuiper belt.<ref>Freeman Dyson, ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513922-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Oort cloud]] is estimated to have up to a trillion comets.\n\n===Outside the Solar System===\n[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|A [[star]] forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]]]\nLooking beyond the Solar System, there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred thousand times further away than the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high speed (some more-than-fractional percentage of the [[speed of light]]), or travel times lasting centuries or millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems can provide.\n\nMany scientific papers have been published about [[interstellar travel]]. Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and generational voyages seem possible, though representing a very considerable technological and economic challenge unlikely to be met for some time, particularly for manned probes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSpace colonization technology could in principle allow human expansion at high, but sub-relativistic speeds, substantially less than the speed of light, ''c''.&nbsp; An interstellar colony ship would be similar to a space habitat, with the addition of major propulsion capabilities and independent energy generation.\n\nHypothetical [[starship]] concepts proposed both by scientists and in [[hard science fiction]] include:\n* A [[generation ship]] would travel much slower than light, with consequent interstellar trip times of many decades or centuries. The crew would go through generations before the journey is complete, so that none of the initial crew would be expected to survive to arrive at the destination, assuming current human lifespans.\n* A [[sleeper ship]], in which most or all of the crew spend the journey in some form of [[hibernation]] or [[suspended animation]], allowing some or all who undertake the journey to survive to the end.\n* An [[embryo space colonization|embryo-carrying interstellar starship]] (EIS), much smaller than a generation ship or sleeper ship, transporting human [[embryo]]s or DNA in a frozen or dormant state to the destination. (Obvious biological and psychological problems in birthing, raising, and educating such voyagers, neglected here, may not be fundamental.)\n* A [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission|fission]] powered ship (e.g. [[ion drive]]) of some kind, achieving velocities of up to perhaps 10% ''c''&nbsp; permitting one-way trips to nearby stars with durations comparable to a human lifetime.\n* A [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]-ship, a nuclear-powered concept proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]] which would use [[nuclear bomb|nuclear explosions]] to propel a starship. A special case of the preceding nuclear rocket concepts, with similar potential velocity capability, but possibly easier technology.\n* [[Solar sail|Laser propulsion]] concepts, using some form of beaming of power from the Solar System might allow a [[solar sail|light-sail]] or other ship to reach high speeds, comparable to those theoretically attainable by the fusion-powered electric rocket, above. These methods would need some means, such as supplementary nuclear propulsion, to stop at the destination, but a hybrid (light-sail for acceleration, fusion-electric for deceleration) system might be possible.\n* [[Mind uploading|Uploaded human minds]] or [[artificial intelligence]] may be transmitted via radio or laser at light speed to interstellar destinations where [[self-replicating spacecraft]] have travelled subluminally and set up infrastructure and possibly also brought some minds. [[Extraterrestrial intelligence]] might be another viable destination.\n\nThe above concepts which appear limited to high, but still sub-relativistic speeds, due to fundamental energy and reaction mass considerations, and all would entail trip times which might be enabled by space colonization technology, permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries. Yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1% of ''c''&nbsp; would permit settlement of the entire Galaxy in less than one half of the Sun's galactic orbital period of ~240,000,000 years, which is comparable to the timescale of other galactic processes. Thus, even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible (which cannot be clearly determined at this time), the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the Solar System without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen. This could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales, given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.\n\nIf humanity does gain access to a large amount of energy, on the order of the mass-energy of entire planets, it may eventually become feasible to construct [[Alcubierre drive]]s. These are one of the few methods of superluminal travel which may be possible under current physics. However it is probable that such a device could never exist, due to the fundamental challenges posed. For more on this see [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Difficulties of making and using an Alcubierre Drive]].\n\n====Intergalactic travel====\n{{Main|Intergalactic travel}} \nLooking beyond the Milky Way, there are at least 2 trillion other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times farther than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years,<ref>Stuart Armstrong and Anders Sandberg, \"Eternity in six hours: Intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox,\" ''Acta Astronautica'' 89 (2013): 1\u201313.</ref> or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the [[Alcubierre drive]]. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that [[intergalactic travel]] is impossible in principle.\n\nUploaded human minds or AI may be transmitted to other galaxies in the hope some intelligence there would receive and activate them.\n\n==Economics==\nSpace colonization can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become [[Economic behavior|cheap enough]] (such as space access by cheaper launch systems) to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose, in addition to estimated profits from [[commercial use of space]].\n\nAlthough there are no immediate prospects for the large amounts of money required for space colonization to be available given traditional launch costs,<ref>[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Basics/wwwwh.html Space Settlement Basics] by Al Globus, NASA Ames Research Center.

Earth's [[natural resource]]s do not increase to a noteworthy extent (which is in keeping with the \"only one Earth\" position of environmentalists). Thus, considerable efforts in colonizing places outside Earth would appear as a hazardous waste of the Earth's limited resources for an aim without a clear end.\n\nThe fundamental problem of public things, needed for survival, such as space programs, is the [[free-rider problem]]. Convincing the public to fund such programs would require additional self-interest arguments: If the objective of space colonization is to provide a \"backup\" in case everyone on Earth is killed, then why should someone on Earth pay for something that is only useful after they are dead?

Indeed, the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate|birth rates]] of many developed countries, specifically [[spacefaring|spacefaring ones]], are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonization as a means of population control.<ref name = tsr2009/>\n\nOther objections include concerns that the forthcoming colonization and [[commodification]] of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions e.g. the large financial institutions, the major aerospace companies and the [[military\u2013industrial complex]], to lead to new [[war]]s, and to exacerbate pre-existing exploitation of [[Exploitation of labour|workers]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|resources]], [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], social [[Social division|division]] and [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], environmental degradation, and other detrimental processes or institutions.<ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11/><ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02/><ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03/>\n\nAdditional concerns include creating a culture in which humans are no longer seen as human, but rather as material assets.

In 1970, he joined the family business: [[Koch Industries]], the second-largest privately held company in the United States. He became president of the subsidiary Koch Engineering in 1979, and became a co-owner of Koch Industries (along with elder brother [[Charles Koch|Charles]]) in 1983. Koch served as an executive vice president of Koch Industries until he retired due to health issues in 2018.\n\nKoch was a [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]]. He was the 1980 [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate for [[Vice President of the United States]] and helped finance the campaign. He founded [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] and donated to advocacy groups and [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|political campaigns]], most of which were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Koch became a Republican in 1984; in 2012, he spent over $100&nbsp;million to oppose the re-election of President [[Barack Obama]].\n\nKoch was the fourth-richest person in the United States in 2012 and was the wealthiest resident of [[New York City]] in 2013. As of June 2019, Koch was ranked as the 11th-richest person in the world (tied with his brother Charles), with a fortune of $50.5&nbsp;billion. Known for his philanthropy, Koch contributed to the [[Lincoln Center]], [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Kettering]], [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]], and the Dinosaur Wing at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, home of the [[New York City Ballet]], was renamed the [[David H. Koch Theater]] in 2008 following Koch's gift of $100&nbsp;million for the renovation of the theater.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKoch was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the son of Mary Clementine (n\u00e9e Robinson) and [[Fred C. Koch|Fred Chase Koch]], a chemical engineer. David's paternal grandfather, [[Harry Koch (businessman)|Harry Koch]], was a Dutch immigrant who founded the ''Quanah Tribune-Chief'' newspaper and was a founding shareholder of the [[Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway]].<ref name=\"new netherland\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/kochd.htm |title=Koch, David Hamilton (1940) |publisher=New Netherland Project |access-date=August 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819225843/http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/kochd.htm |archive-date=August 19, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> David was the third of four sons, with elder brothers [[Frederick R.

He was a member of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity. Koch played basketball at MIT, averaging 21 points per game at MIT over three years, a school record.

Section 18 of the Act says:\n<blockquote>\nA person who uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting, is guilty of an offence if\u2014\n\n::(a) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or\n\n::(b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby.\n</blockquote>\nOffences under Part 3 carry a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment or a fine or both.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Public+Order+Act&Year=1986&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&TYPE=QS&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=2236942&ActiveTextDocId=2237025&filesize=2382#1365595|title=Public Order Act 1986|website=www.statutelaw.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] inserted Section 4A into the Public Order Act 1986.
