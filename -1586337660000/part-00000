Since DC distributed Marvel's output at the time, Theakston theorizes that, \"Goodman and Lee decided to keep their superhero line looking as much like their horror line as they possibly could,\" downplaying \"the fact that [Marvel] was now creating heroes\" with the effect that they ventured \"into deeper waters, where DC had never considered going\".

[T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC ''owned'' Independent News). \u2026 As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. \u2026 Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. \u2026 Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth.}}\n\nGoodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA's strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most.

Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Randy |first2=James S. |last2=Olson |title=American Experiences: Readings in American History: Since 1865 |edition=4 |publisher=[[Addison\u2013Wesley]] |year=1998 |page=317 |isbn=978-0-321-01031-5 |quote=Marvel Comics employed a realism in both characterization and setting in its superhero titles that was unequaled in the comic book industry.}}</ref> This applied to ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel's most successful book.

Since DC distributed Marvel's output at the time, Theakston theorizes that, \"Goodman and Lee decided to keep their superhero line looking as much like their horror line as they possibly could,\" downplaying \"the fact that [Marvel] was now creating heroes\" with the effect that they ventured \"into deeper waters, where DC had never considered going\". See Ro, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\nMarvel often presented flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfits\u2014unlike the perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books. Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and the Thing. This [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] approach even extended into topical politics.\n\nComics historian Mike Benton also noted:\n{{bquote|text=In the world of [rival [[DC Comics]]'] [[Superman]] comic books, communism did not exist. Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mike |last=Benton |title=Superhero Comics of the Silver Age: The Illustrated History |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas, Texas |isbn=978-0-87833-746-0 |year=1991 |page=35}}</ref> From 1962 to 1965, there were more communists [in Marvel Comics] than on the subscription list of ''[[Pravda]]''.

During the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. In AD 15, statues to the deified Augustus were erected, dedicated by [[Gaius Norbanus Flaccus (consul 15)|C. Norbanus Flaccus]]. Also inside was the [[Porticus Octaviae]]. The entrance to the piazza was marked by one of three large marble arches erected in honor of [[Germanicus]], engraved with records of his military conquests. To the east was the [[Theatre of Marcellus]].\n\nA fragment of the [[Severan marble plan]] preserves a mention of the Circus Flaminius.\n\n==Use==\nThe Circus Flaminius was never meant to rival the much larger [[Circus Maximus]], and, unlike the Circus Maximus, it was not just an entertainment venue.

Equestrian events were also associated with underworld deities in other rituals and festivals in the Campus Martius. [[Strabo]] makes no mention of equestrian activities taking place in the Circus Flaminius. [[Valerius Maximus]], who is likely to be in error, is the only ancient source that claims the ''Ludi Plebeii'' ([[Plebeian Games]]) were held there. In 2 BC, the circus was flooded for the slaughter of 36 crocodiles to commemorate the building of the [[Forum of Augustus]].<ref> Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 55.10</ref>\n\nThe Circus Flaminius was also used as a market. [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]] were often held within it. In 9 BC, it was the venue when [[Augustus]] delivered the ''Laudatio'' of Drusus.\n\nThe buildings remained in use until the end of the fourth century, when the area was finally abandoned.

He was suspended in [[Pride's Purge]] of 1648, and arrested several times between 1650 to 1659. At the [[The_Restoration|1660 Restoration]], he was elected to the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], but retired from politics when it dissolved. He died at [[Osterley_Park|Osterley Park, London]] in September 1668.  \n\nWaller was one of many who served in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] with great reluctance, but did so based on deeply held religious or political principles. He is perhaps best remembered by a letter written in 1643 to his close friend and Royalist opponent, [[Ralph_Hopton,_1st_Baron_Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]].\n\n{{quote|That great God who is the searcher of my heart knows with what a sad sense I go upon this service, and with what a perfect hatred I detest this war without an enemy;... We are both upon the stage and must act such parts as are assigned us in this tragedy, let us do it in a way of honour, and without personal animosities.{{sfn|Waller|1793|pp=xiii\u2013xiv}}}}\n\n==Life==\nWilliam Waller was born in [[Knole]], near [[Sevenoaks]] in [[Kent]], son of Sir Thomas Waller and his wife Margaret Lennard, the daughter of [[Margaret Fiennes, 11th Baroness Dacre]]. He attended [[Hertford College, Oxford#Magdalen Hall|Magdalen Hall, Oxford]], but did not graduate.{{sfn|Waller|1793|p=22}}\n\nHe married three times; Jane Reynell (1622\u20131633), Lady Anne Finch (1638\u20131652), and [[Anne_Waller,_Lady_Waller|Lady Anne Harcourt]] (1652\u20131661). In all, he had three sons and three daughters. \n\n==Career==\nThe family held various offices in the 16th century, including  constable of [[Dover Castle]] and [[Member_of_parliament|MP]] for [[Dover (UK Parliament constituency)|Dover]], but lost their money. Waller became a professional soldier, and in 1617, he joined the army of the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]], where he met the English mercenary leader, [[Horace_Vere,_1st_Baron_Vere_of_Tilbury|Sir Horace Vere]]. In 1620, he and [[Ralph_Hopton,_1st_Baron_Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]] were members of the personal bodyguard for [[Elizabeth_Stuart,_Queen_of_Bohemia|Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia]], sister of the future [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]]. After her husband [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|Frederick]] was defeated at [[Battle_of_White_Mountain|White Mountain]] in November, they escorted her to safety in [[Frankfurt]].{{sfn|Donagan|2008}}\n\nOn his return in 1622, he was rewarded with a knighthood, while he inherited the right to [[Butlerage|wine import duties]] from his grandmother, which brought him the then substantial sum of \u00a31,000 \u2013 \u00a33,000 per year. This allowed him to marry Jane Reynell, from a wealthy [[Devon]] family; she died in 1633, followed by her father in 1634, then their son Richard in 1636. Waller inherited most of her estates, and he purchased a quarter-share in the [[Providence Island Company]].{{sfn|Kupperman|1982|p=46}} A devout [[Presbyterian]], this directly connected to others who shared his beliefs, and later became prominent supporters of Parliament, among them [[John Pym]], Henry Darley, [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[Robert_Greville,_2nd_Baron_Brooke|Lord Brooke]].{{sfn|Duinen|2007|p=531}}\n\nHis second wife, Lady Anne Finch, was related to another influential Kent politician, the [[Earl_of_Winchilsea#Earls_of_Winchilsea_(1628)_and_Nottingham_(1681)|Earl of Winchilsea]], and shared his religious beliefs. They purchased [[Winchester Castle]] in 1638, and lived a 'retired life' in the country, but as the political conflict between Charles and [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] increased, Waller felt it his duty to participate. In April 1640, he was elected to the [[Short Parliament]] as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Andover (UK Parliament constituency)|Andover]], then re-elected to the [[Long Parliament]] on 3 May 1642.{{sfn|Henning|1983}}\n\n==The Civil War==\n{{Location map many|England south|caption = Waller's war, England & Wales, 1642\u20131645|relief=yes|border = black| width = 500| float = left\n|label =  Exeter|pos=left|lat_deg= 50|lat_min= 43|lon_deg = -3 |lon_min = -32\n|label2 = Alton|pos2=top|lat2_deg=51|lat2_min = 09 |lon2_deg = -1 |lon2_min = 0\n|label3 = London |pos3= top|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 30|lon3_deg = 0|lon3_min = -8\n|label4 = Bristol|pos4= top|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 27|lon4_deg = -2|lon4_min = -35\n|label5 = Oxford|pos5=top|lat5_deg=51|lat5_min =45 |lon5_deg = -1 |lon5_min = -16\n|label6 = Farnham|pos6=right|lat6_deg=51|lat6_min = 13 |lon6_deg = 0 |lon6_min = -47\n|label7 = Portsmouth|pos7=bottom|lat7_deg=50|lat7_min = 48 |lon7_deg = -1 |lon7_min = 0\n|label9 = Roundway Down|pos9=bottom|lat9_deg=51|lat9_min = 21 |lon9_deg = -2 |lon9_min = 00\n|label10 = Gloucester|pos10=left|lat10_deg=51|lat10_min = 52 |lon10_deg = -2 |lon10_min = -14\n|label11 = Newbury|pos11=top|lat11_deg=51|lat11_min = 24 |lon11_deg = -1 |lon11_min = -20\n|label13 = Plymouth|pos13=right|lat13_deg=50|lat13_min = 22 |lon13_deg = -4 |lon13_min = -9\n|label14 = Shrewsbury|pos14=left|lat14_deg=52|lat14_min = 43 |lon14_deg = -2 |lon14_min = -46\n|label15 = Cheriton|pos15=bottom|lat15_deg=51|lat15_min = 04 |lon15_deg = -1 |lon15_min = -17\n|label16 = Lostwithiel|pos16=left|lat16_deg=50|lat16_min = 25 |lon16_deg = -4 |lon16_min = -40\n|label17 = Copredy Bridge|pos17=top|lat17_deg=52|lat17_min = 07 |lon17_deg = -1 |lon17_min = -19\n|label18 = Lyme|pos18=right|lat18_deg=50|lat18_min = 43 |lon18_deg = -2 |lon18_min = -56\n|label19 = Worcester|pos19=left|lat19_deg=52|lat19_min = 11 |lon19_deg = -2 |lon19_min = -13\n}}\nA firm supporter of Parliament, when the [[First English Civil War]] began in August 1642, Waller was appointed a colonel, [[Siege_of_Portsmouth|capturing Portsmouth]], [[Farnham, Surrey|Farnham]], [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] and other key locations in southern England. At the beginning of 1643, Waller was promoted [[Major-general]] and placed in charge of operations in the region of [[Gloucester]] and [[Bristol]].<ref>'February 1643: Ordinance to appoint Sir William Waller Serjeant Major General of the Forces in Gloucester and other adjacent Counties, and for paying his Army.', Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642\u20131660 (1911), pp. 79\u201380.

Date accessed: 13 April 2007.</ref> \n\nHe was then called upon to oppose the advance of his old friend Sir Ralph Hopton, leader of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] Western army, After the inconclusive [[Battle of Lansdowne]] on 5 July, Hopton linked up with [[Maurice_of_the_Palatinate|Prince Maurice]], and their combined force destroyed William Waller's Western Association army at [[Battle of Roundway Down|Roundway Down]] on 13 July. The biggest Royalist success of the war, it secured the West Country, apart from isolated garrisons in Plymouth and elsewhere.{{sfn|Royle|2004|pp=243\u2013245}}\n\nAlthough defeat at Roundway had little impact on Waller's military reputation, there were increasing signs on all sides of war weariness, including anti-war demonstrations on 7 to 9 August in London. At a strategy meeting in [[Oxford]], the Royalist high command agreed [[Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine|Prince Rupert]] would [[Siege_of_Gloucester|capture Gloucester]], the last major Parliamentary position in the west, then move against London.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=275}} This would be supported by Hopton advancing into [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]], whose [[Wealden_iron_industry|iron foundries]] were Parliament's main source of armaments.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=281}} \n\nTo counter this, Waller assembled a new army at [[Farnham Castle]], consisting of [[Trainband|Trained bands]] from the South-Eastern Association of [[Kent]], Sussex and Hampshire, bolstered by others from London.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=139}}    Throughout the war, both sides relied on these militia; service was normally limited to 30 days, within their home area, but  as the largest and best equipped, London units were often used by Parliament to fill gaps. Waller's army included several regiments mustered to repel Prince Rupert's advance on London, which ended at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] in late September. An attack on [[Siege_of_Basing_House|Basing House]] in November failed, with various regiments demanding to be allowed home.{{sfn|Nagel|1982|pp=145\u2013148}}  \n\nUnder instructions from the [[Robert_Devereux,_3rd_Earl_of_Essex|Earl of Essex]] to retake [[Alton,_Hampshire|Alton]], then [[Arundel]], Waller persuaded the London Bands to help him [[Battle_of_Alton|capture Alton]] on 13 December. When he asked for their help with Arundel, they refused, and were sent home on 15 December.{{sfn|Nagel|1982|p=150}} However, he successfully [[Siege_of_Arundel|captured Arundel]] on 6 January, before a heavy snow fall ended operations for the next few weeks.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=140}} \n[[File:Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton of Stratton from NPG.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Ralph_Hopton,_1st_Baron_Hopton|Ralph Hopton]], Waller's close friend and opponent]]\nBy the end of February, Waller's army had been increased to 5,000 infantry and 3,500 horse; he was ordered to slip past Hopton and retake the west. One of his commanders, [[Sir_Richard_Grenville,_1st_Baronet|Sir Richard Grenville]], deserted in early March, and shared this with the Royalist command, who sent Hopton reinforcements. Waller defeated him at [[Battle_of_Cheriton|Cheriton]] on 29 March 1644, ending the Royalist threat in the south-east, then joined Essex to threaten the Royalist capital of Oxford.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|pp=142\u2013143}} \n\nOn 29 March, Waller ended the offensive in Southern England by defeating Hopton at [[Battle_of_Cheriton|Cheriton]], then joined Essex to threaten Oxford. To avoid being trapped there, a Royalist field army nominally commanded by Charles retreated to [[Worcester]]; Essex ordered Waller to follow him, while he went west to relieve the [[siege of Lyme Regis]]. On 29 June, Waller clashed with Charles at [[Battle_of_Cropredy_Bridge|Cropredy Bridge]]; his losses were minimal, but his men were demoralised. His army disintegrated, causing panic in London, and allowing Charles to pursue Essex into the West Country.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=330\u2013331}}\n\nIn September, Essex and his army were trapped at [[Battle_of_Lostwithiel|Lostwithiel]]; 5,000 infantry were forced to surrender, although Essex and the cavalry escaped. At [[Second_Battle_of_Newbury|Second Newbury]] on 27 October, the Royalists lifted the siege of [[Donnington_Castle|Donnington Castle]]; lack of co-ordination among the Parliamentary forces under Waller, Essex and Manchester allowed Charles to re-enter Oxford.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=385}}\n\nParliament was split into peace and war factions. The 'Peace Party' was dominated by English Presbyterians, with Scottish support; concerned by political radicals like the [[Levellers]], they wanted an immediate, negotiated settlement. The 'War Party' fundamentally mistrusted Charles, and saw military victory as the only way to secure their objectives. They also objected to the Scottish alliance, especially the demand for a unified, Presbyterian church of England and Scotland; [[Oliver Cromwell]] claimed he would fight, rather than accept such terms.{{sfn|Rees|2016|pp=118\u2013119}}\n\nThis conflict became public in recriminations over the failure to exploit Marston Moor, Essex' capitulation at Lostwithiel, and Manchester's alleged unwillingness to fight at Second Newbury; Waller supported these criticisms.{{sfn|Cotton|1975|p=212}} In December, [[Henry_Vane_the_Younger|Sir Henry Vane]] introduced the [[Self-denying Ordinance]], requiring any officers in the army or navy who were also members of Parliament to resign from one, or the other. This automatically removed Manchester and Essex, since they could not resign their titles, although later amended to allow them to be re-appointed, 'if Parliament approved.' Waller supported the Ordinance, and resigned his commission in April 1645.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=398\u2013399}}\n\n==Later life and death==\n\nConsidered for command in Ireland, Waller also briefly explored returning to [[Cretan_War_(1645\u20131669)|Venetian service]], but this ended his active military career. Although he backed the creation of the [[New Model Army]], like other Presbyterians, he came to see it as a threat, and supported attempts to disband it when the war ended in 1646. In June 1647, he was one of the [[Eleven members]] accused by Cromwell and other Independents of 'plotting to destabilise the kingdom', and fled abroad in August.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=406}} \n\nHe stayed in [[The Hague]], where he renewed his acquaintance with Elizabeth of Bohemia, before returning home in June 1648. He was arrested in 1650, allegedly for conspiring to restore [[Charles_II_of_England|Charles II]], then released in early 1652. He purchased [[Osterley Park]] in 1654, and while frequently questioned under [[the Protectorate]], avoided implication in the 1655 [[Penruddock uprising]].   \n\nAt the [[The_Restoration|1660 Restoration]], he was elected for [[Middlesex_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Middlesex]] to the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], but subsequently retired from political life.

commanded  [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] armies during the [[First English Civil War]], before relinquishing his commission under the 1645 [[Self-denying_Ordinance|Self-denying Ordinance]]. \n\nElected [[Member_of_parliament|MP]] for [[Andover (UK Parliament constituency)|Andover]] in 1640, then 1642, in June 1647 he was one of the [[Eleven Members]] accused of destabilising the kingdom. He was suspended in [[Pride's Purge]] of 1648, and arrested several times between 1650 to 1659. At the [[The_Restoration|1660 Restoration]], he was elected to the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], but retired from politics when it dissolved. He died at [[Osterley_Park|Osterley Park, London]] in September 1668.  \n\nWaller was one of many who served in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] with great reluctance, but did so based on deeply held religious or political principles. He is perhaps best remembered by a letter written in 1643 to his close friend and Royalist opponent, [[Ralph_Hopton,_1st_Baron_Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]].\n\n{{quote|That great God who is the searcher of my heart knows with what a sad sense I go upon this service, and with what a perfect hatred I detest this war without an enemy;... We are both upon the stage and must act such parts as are assigned us in this tragedy, let us do it in a way of honour, and without personal animosities.{{sfn|Waller|1793|pp=xiii-xiv}}}}\n\n==Life==\nWilliam Waller was born in [[Knole]], near [[Sevenoaks]] in [[Kent]], son of Sir Thomas Waller and his wife Margaret Lennard, the daughter of [[Margaret Fiennes, 11th Baroness Dacre]]. He attended [[Hertford College, Oxford#Magdalen Hall|Magdalen Hall, Oxford]], but did not graduate.{{sfn|Waller|1793|p=22}}\n\nHe married three times; Jane Reynell (1622-1633), Lady Anne Finch (1638-1652), and [[Anne_Waller,_Lady_Waller|Lady Anne Harcourt]] (1652-1661). In all, he had three sons and three daughters. \n\n==Career==\nThe family held various offices in the 16th century, including  constable of [[Dover Castle]] and [[Member_of_parliament|MP]] for [[Dover (UK Parliament constituency)|Dover]], but lost their money. Waller became a professional soldier, and in 1617, he joined the army of the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]], where he met the English mercenary leader, [[Horace_Vere,_1st_Baron_Vere_of_Tilbury|Sir Horace Vere]]. In 1620, he and [[Ralph_Hopton,_1st_Baron_Hopton|Sir Ralph Hopton]] were members of the personal bodyguard for [[Elizabeth_Stuart,_Queen_of_Bohemia|Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia]], sister of the future [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]]. After her husband [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|Frederick]] was defeated at [[Battle_of_White_Mountain|White Mountain]] in November, they escorted her to safety in [[Frankfurt]].{{sfn|Donagan|2008}}\n\nOn his return in 1622, he was rewarded with a knighthood, while he inherited the right to [[Butlerage|wine import duties]] from his grandmother, which brought him the then substantial sum of \u00a31,000 - \u00a33,000 per year. This allowed him to marry Jane Reynell, from a wealthy [[Devon]] family; she died in 1633, followed by her father in 1634, then their son Richard in 1636. Waller inherited most of her estates, and he purchased a quarter-share in the [[Providence Island Company]].{{sfn|Kupperman|1982|p=46}} A devout [[Presbyterian]], this directly connected to others who shared his beliefs, and later became prominent supporters of Parliament, among them [[John Pym]], Henry Darley, [[William_Fiennes,_1st_Viscount_Saye_and_Sele|Lord Saye]], and [[Robert_Greville,_2nd_Baron_Brooke|Lord Brooke]].{{sfn|Duinen|2007|p=531}}\n\nHis second wife, Lady Anne Finch, was related to another influential Kent politician, the [[Earl_of_Winchilsea#Earls_of_Winchilsea_(1628)_and_Nottingham_(1681)|Earl of Winchilsea]], and shared his religious beliefs. They purchased [[Winchester Castle]] in 1638, and lived a 'retired life' in the country, but as the political conflict between Charles and [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] increased, Waller felt it his duty to participate. In April 1640, he was elected to the [[Short Parliament]] as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Andover (UK Parliament constituency)|Andover]], then re-elected to the [[Long Parliament]] on 3 May 1642.{{sfn|Henning|1983}}\n\n==The Civil War==\n{{Location map many|England south|caption = Waller's war, England & Wales, 1642-1645|relief=yes|border = black| width = 500| float = left\n|label =  Exeter|pos=left|lat_deg= 50|lat_min= 43|lon_deg = -3 |lon_min = -32\n|label2 = Alton|pos2=top|lat2_deg=51|lat2_min = 09 |lon2_deg = -1 |lon2_min = 0\n|label3 = London |pos3= top|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 30|lon3_deg = 0|lon3_min = -8\n|label4 = Bristol|pos4= top|lat4_deg=51|lat4_min = 27|lon4_deg = -2|lon4_min = -35\n|label5 = Oxford|pos5=top|lat5_deg=51|lat5_min =45 |lon5_deg = -1 |lon5_min = -16\n|label6 = Farnham|pos6=right|lat6_deg=51|lat6_min = 13 |lon6_deg = 0 |lon6_min = -47\n|label7 = Portsmouth|pos7=bottom|lat7_deg=50|lat7_min = 48 |lon7_deg = -1 |lon7_min = 0\n|label9 = Roundway Down|pos9=bottom|lat9_deg=51|lat9_min = 21 |lon9_deg = -2 |lon9_min = 00\n|label10 = Gloucester|pos10=left|lat10_deg=51|lat10_min = 52 |lon10_deg = -2 |lon10_min = -14\n|label11 = Newbury|pos11=top|lat11_deg=51|lat11_min = 24 |lon11_deg = -1 |lon11_min = -20\n|label13 = Plymouth|pos13=right|lat13_deg=50|lat13_min = 22 |lon13_deg = -4 |lon13_min = -9\n|label14 = Shrewsbury|pos14=left|lat14_deg=52|lat14_min = 43 |lon14_deg = -2 |lon14_min = -46\n|label15 = Cheriton|pos15=bottom|lat15_deg=51|lat15_min = 04 |lon15_deg = -1 |lon15_min = -17\n|label16 = Lostwithiel|pos16=left|lat16_deg=50|lat16_min = 25 |lon16_deg = -4 |lon16_min = -40\n|label17 = Copredy Bridge|pos17=top|lat17_deg=52|lat17_min = 07 |lon17_deg = -1 |lon17_min = -19\n|label18 = Lyme|pos18=right|lat18_deg=50|lat18_min = 43 |lon18_deg = -2 |lon18_min = -56\n|label19 = Worcester|pos19=left|lat19_deg=52|lat19_min = 11 |lon19_deg = -2 |lon19_min = -13\n}}\nA firm supporter of Parliament, when the [[First English Civil War]] began in August 1642, Waller was appointed a colonel, [[Siege_of_Portsmouth|capturing Portsmouth]], [[Farnham, Surrey|Farnham]], [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] and other key locations in southern England. At the beginning of 1643, Waller was promoted [[Major-general]] and placed in charge of operations in the region of [[Gloucester]] and [[Bristol]].<ref>'February 1643: Ordinance to appoint Sir William Waller Serjeant Major General of the Forces in Gloucester and other adjacent Counties, and for paying his Army.', Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642\u20131660 (1911), pp. 79\u201380.

Date accessed: 13 April 2007.</ref> \n\nHe was then called upon to oppose the advance of his old friend Sir Ralph Hopton, leader of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] Western army, After the inconclusive [[Battle of Lansdowne]] on 5 July, Hopton linked up with [[Maurice_of_the_Palatinate|Prince Maurice]], and their combined force destroyed William Waller's Western Association army at [[Battle of Roundway Down|Roundway Down]] on 13 July. The biggest Royalist success of the war, it secured the West Country, apart from isolated garrisons in Plymouth and elsewhere.{{sfn|Royle|2004|pp=243-245}}\n\nAlthough defeat at Roundway had little impact on Waller's military reputation, there were increasing signs on all sides of war weariness, including anti-war demonstrations on 7 to 9 August in London. At a strategy meeting in [[Oxford]], the Royalist high command agreed [[Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine|Prince Rupert]] would [[Siege_of_Gloucester|capture Gloucester]], the last major Parliamentary position in the west, then move against London.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=275}} This would be supported by Hopton advancing into [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]], whose [[Wealden_iron_industry|iron foundries]] were Parliament's main source of armaments.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=281}} \n\nTo counter this, Waller assembled a new army at [[Farnham Castle]], consisting of [[Trainband|Trained bands]] from the South-Eastern Association of [[Kent]], Sussex and Hampshire, bolstered by others from London.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=139}}    Throughout the war, both sides relied on these militia; service was normally limited to 30 days, within their home area, but  as the largest and best equipped, London units were often used by Parliament to fill gaps. Waller's army included several regiments mustered to repel Prince Rupert's advance on London, which ended at [[First_Battle_of_Newbury|Newbury]] in late September. An attack on [[Siege_of_Basing_House|Basing House]] in November failed, with various regiments demanding to be allowed home.{{sfn|Nagel|1982|pp=145-148}}  \n\nUnder instructions from the [[Robert_Devereux,_3rd_Earl_of_Essex|Earl of Essex]] to retake [[Alton,_Hampshire|Alton]], then [[Arundel]], Waller persuaded the London Bands to help him [[Battle_of_Alton|capture Alton]] on 13 December. When he asked for their help with Arundel, they refused, and were sent home on 15 December.{{sfn|Nagel|1982|p=150}} However, he successfully [[Siege_of_Arundel|captured Arundel]] on 6 January, before a heavy snow fall ended operations for the next few weeks.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=140}} \n[[File:Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton of Stratton from NPG.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Ralph_Hopton,_1st_Baron_Hopton|Ralph Hopton]], Waller's close friend and opponent]]\nBy the end of February, Waller's army had been increased to 5,000 infantry and 3,500 horse; he was ordered to slip past Hopton and retake the west. One of his commanders, [[Sir_Richard_Grenville,_1st_Baronet|Sir Richard Grenville]], deserted in early March, and shared this with the Royalist command, who sent Hopton reinforcements. Waller defeated him at [[Battle_of_Cheriton|Cheriton]] on 29 March 1644, ending the Royalist threat in the south-east, then joined Essex to threaten the Royalist capital of Oxford.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|pp=142-143}} \n\nOn 29 March, Waller ended the offensive in Southern England by defeating Hopton at [[Battle_of_Cheriton|Cheriton]], then joined Essex to threaten Oxford. To avoid being trapped there, a Royalist field army nominally commanded by Charles retreated to [[Worcester]]; Essex ordered Waller to follow him, while he went west to relieve the [[siege of Lyme Regis]]. On 29 June, Waller clashed with Charles at [[Battle_of_Cropredy_Bridge|Cropredy Bridge]]; his losses were minimal, but his men were demoralised. His army disintegrated, causing panic in London, and allowing Charles to pursue Essex into the West Country.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=330-331}}\n\nIn September, Essex and his army were trapped at [[Battle_of_Lostwithiel|Lostwithiel]]; 5,000 infantry were forced to surrender, although Essex and the cavalry escaped. At [[Second_Battle_of_Newbury|Second Newbury]] on 27 October, the Royalists lifted the siege of [[Donnington_Castle|Donnington Castle]]; lack of co-ordination among the Parliamentary forces under Waller, Essex and Manchester allowed Charles to re-enter Oxford.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=385}}\n\nParliament was split into peace and war factions. The 'Peace Party' was dominated by English Presbyterians, with Scottish support; concerned by political radicals like the [[Levellers]], they wanted an immediate, negotiated settlement. The 'War Party' fundamentally mistrusted Charles, and saw military victory as the only way to secure their objectives. They also objected to the Scottish alliance, especially the demand for a unified, Presbyterian church of England and Scotland; [[Oliver Cromwell]] claimed he would fight, rather than accept such terms.{{sfn|Rees|2016|pp=118-119}}\n\nThis conflict became public in recriminations over the failure to exploit Marston Moor, Essex' capitulation at Lostwithiel, and Manchester's alleged unwillingness to fight at Second Newbury; Waller supported these criticisms.{{sfn|Cotton|1975|p=212}} In December, [[Henry_Vane_the_Younger|Sir Henry Vane]] introduced the [[Self-denying Ordinance]], requiring any officers in the army or navy who were also members of Parliament to resign from one, or the other. This automatically removed Manchester and Essex, since they could not resign their titles, although later amended to allow them to be re-appointed, 'if Parliament approved.' Waller supported the Ordinance, and resigned his commission in April 1645.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=398-399}}\n\n==Later life and death==\n\nConsidered for command in Ireland, Waller also briefly explored returning to [[Cretan_War_(1645\u20131669)|Venetian service]], but this ended his active military career. Although he backed the creation of the [[New Model Army]], like other Presbyterians, he came to see it as a threat, and supported attempts to disband it when the war ended in 1646. In June 1647, he was one of the [[Eleven members]] accused by Cromwell and other Independents of 'plotting to destabilise the kingdom', and fled abroad in August.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=406}} \n\nHe stayed in [[The Hague]], where he renewed his acquaintance with Elizabeth of Bohemia, before returning home in June 1648. He was arrested in 1650, allegedly for conspiring to restore [[Charles_II_of_England|Charles II]], then released in early 1652. He purchased [[Osterley Park]] in 1654, and while frequently questioned under [[the Protectorate]], avoided implication in the 1655 [[Penruddock uprising]].   \n\nAt the [[The_Restoration|1660 Restoration]], he was elected for [[Middlesex_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Middlesex]] to the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], but subsequently retired from political life.
