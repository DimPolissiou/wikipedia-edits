Biden, the former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] and a former [[United States Senator|U.S. senator]] from [[Delaware]], had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 candidate]] after declining to be a candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].\n\nBiden is generally described as a [[moderate]]. His positions include codifying ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' into statute, a [[public option]] for health insurance, [[decriminalization]] of recreational cannabis, passing the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], free [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]], and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the [[Green New Deal]]. He supports regulation as opposed to a complete ban on [[fracking]].  \n\nAs a former vice president, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of elections, he has been the candidate most identified as the frontrunner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses]] or the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire Democratic primary]]. He won a landslide victory in the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] on February 29, 2020, which was widely seen as reinvigorating his campaign. In March, Biden was endorsed by 10 of his former competitors, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on [[Super Tuesday 2020]] to pull ahead of Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]. On April 8, 2020, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n==Background==\n===Previous presidential campaigns===\n{{main|Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign}}\n\nBiden's 2020 presidential campaign is his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html|title=One Year From Election, Trump Trails Biden but Leads Warren in Battlegrounds|last=Cohn|first=Nate|date=November 4, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> His first campaign was made in the [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988 Democratic Party primaries]] where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates.

Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the [[Iowa caucus]] in January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by [[Barack Obama]] as his running mate and won the general election as [[vice president of the United States]], being sworn in on January 20, 2009.\n\n===Speculation===\nVice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

Biden, the former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] and a former [[United States Senator|U.S. senator]] from [[Delaware]], had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 candidate]] after declining to be a candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].\n\nBiden is generally described as a [[moderate]]. His positions include codifying ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' into statute, a [[public option]] for health insurance, [[decriminalization]] of recreational cannabis, passing the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], free [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]], and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the [[Green New Deal]]. He supports regulation as opposed to a complete ban on [[fracking]].  \n\nAs a former vice president, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of elections, he has been the candidate most identified as the frontrunner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses]] or the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire Democratic primary]]. He won a landslide victory in the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] on February 29, 2020, which was widely seen as reinvigorating his campaign. In March, Biden was endorsed by 10 of his former competitors, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on [[Super Tuesday 2020]] to pull ahead of Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]. On April 8, 2020, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n==Background==\n===Previous presidential campaigns===\n{{main|Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign}}\n\nBiden's 2020 presidential campaign is his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html|title=One Year From Election, Trump Trails Biden but Leads Warren in Battlegrounds|last=Cohn|first=Nate|date=November 4, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> His first campaign was made in the [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988 Democratic Party primaries]] where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates.

Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the [[Iowa caucus]] in January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by [[Barack Obama]] as his running mate and won the general election as [[vice president of the United States]], being sworn in on January 20, 2009.\n\n===Speculation===\nVice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. On October 21, 2015, following the death of his son [[Beau Biden|Beau]], Biden announced that he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/21/joe-biden-not-running-president-2016-election|title=Joe Biden announces he will not run for president in 2016|last=McCarthy|first=Tom|date=October 21, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 25, 2019|last2=Gambino|first2=Lauren|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Roberts|first3=Dan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425013851/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/21/joe-biden-not-running-president-2016-election|archive-date=April 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/joe-biden-concludes-theres-no-time-for-a-2016-run.html|title=Joe Biden Concludes There's No Time for a 2016 Run|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=October 21, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 25, 2019|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320174541/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/joe-biden-concludes-theres-no-time-for-a-2016-run.html|archive-date=March 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of the [[United States Senate]] with reporters on December 5, 2016, Biden refused to rule out a potential bid for the presidency in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-citing-hidden-hand-of-fate-joe-biden-1480986947-htmlstory.html |title=Joe Biden wouldn't count out a 2020 run for president.

In April 2019, Biden told reporters, \"The fact of the matter is the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.\" Biden also described himself as an \"Obama-Biden Democrat\".
