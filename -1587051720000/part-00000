It is possibly the first depiction of the Kelmendi ''fis''.]]\n{{Template:Albanian tribes sidebar}}\n'''Kelmendi''' is a historical [[Albanian tribes|Albanian tribe]] (''fis'') and region in [[Mal\u00ebsia]] ([[Kelmend (municipality)|Kelmend municipality]]) and eastern Montenegro (parts of [[Gusinje Municipality]]). It is located in the upper valley of the [[Cem (river)|Cem]] river and its tributaries in the [[Accursed Mountains]] range of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Vermosh river springs in the [[Vermosh|village of the same]], which is Albania's northernmost village. Vermosh pours into [[Lake Plav]].\n\nKelmendi is mentioned as early as the 14th century and as a territorial tribe it developed in the 15th century. In the Balkans, it is widely known historically for its longtime resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its extensive battles and raids against the Ottomans which reached as far north as Bosnia and as far east as Bulgaria. By the 17th century, they had grown so much in numbers and strength that their name was sometimes used for all tribes of northern Albania and Montenegro. The Ottoman tried several times to expel them completely from their home territory and forcefully settle them elsewhere, but the community returned to its ancestral lands again. \n\nKelmendi's legacy is found throughout the region. Via expansion, migratory settlement or even forced resettlement, Kelmendi is found beyond the Cem valley ([[Selc\u00eb]], [[Vuk\u00ebl]], [[Nik\u00e7]] and others), Gusinje (in particular, the villages [[Vusanje|Vuthaj]], Doli, Martinaj and Gusinje/Gucia itself) and [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] (Hakaj). To the east in the [[Pe\u0161ter]] plateau, many families trace their origin to Kelmendi. In [[Kosovo]]{{Cref2|a}}, descendants of Kelmendi live in the [[Rugova Canyon]]. In Montenegro, half of the tribe (''pleme'') of Old [[Ceklin]] and a part of [[Ku\u010di]] in the 16th century come from Kelmendi. The northernmost settlement from Kelmendi is in the villages of [[Hrtkovci]] and [[Nikinci]] in [[Syrmia]] when 1,600 Catholic Albanian refugees settled there in 1737.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Kelmendi'' comes from Latin [[Clemens]]. A folk etymology explains it as Kol Mendi (Nicholas the Clever). The historical origin of the toponym is traced to the Roman fort of Clementiana which [[Procopius of Caesarea]] mentions in the mid 6th century in the road that connected [[Scodra]] and [[Petriz\u00ean]]. As a surname it first appears in 1353 in a Latin document which mentions ''dominus Georgius filius Georgii Clementi de Spasso'' (Lord Georgius, son of Georgius Clementi of Spas) in northern Albania.<ref name=\"\u0160ufflay\">{{cite book|author=Milan \u0160ufflay|authorlink=Milan \u0160ufflay|title=Izabrani politi\u010dki spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXJOAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 March 2020|year=2000|publisher=Matica hrvatska|page=136}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nikc 04.JPG|thumb|left|Catholic church in [[Nik\u00e7]].]]\n[[File:Overview of Albanian tribes, Franz Seiner, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Albanian bajraks (1918). Kelmendi bajraks are numbered 1\u20134.]]\nThe Kelmendi region is located in the [[District of Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]] in northern Albania, situated in the northernmost and most isolated part of the country. It borders the Albanian tribal regions of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the west, [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the southwest, [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Boga]] to the south, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] to the east, and the [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin tribal]] regions of [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThere are many theories on the place of origin of the Kelmendi. Before the 20th century, several travellers, historians and clergymen have recorded various oral traditions and presented their own interpretations. In modern times, archival research has provided a more historically grounded approach. [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] in the 1920s found the first reference to the Kelmendi name in the Venetian archives. The publication of the Ottoman defter of the sanjak of Scutari in 1974 marks the publication of the first historical record about the people of Kelmendi, their anthroponymy, toponymy and social organization. \n\nIn the early centuries of Kelmendi, in the 15th and 16th centuries the only information that is mentioned about them is their language, ethnic group and religion. As Catholic bishop [[Frang Bardhi]] writes in his correspondence with the [[Roman Curia]], ''they belong to the Albanian nation, speak Albanian, hold our holy Roman Catholic beliefs''.<ref name=\"Zamputi1963\">{{cite book |last1=Zamputi |first1=Injac |title=Relacione mbi gjendjen e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb veriore e t\u00eb mesme n\u00eb shekullin XVII (1634-1650) [Correspondence on the situation in northern and central Albania in the 17th century] |date=1963 |publisher=Univeristy of Tirana |page=161 |url=https://www.academia.edu/41423125 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The first writing about Kelmendi's area of origin is from Franciscan missionary, Bernardo da Verona who in 1663 wrote that ''it is not easy to make comments about Kelmendi's origin, but it has become customary to say that they came from [[Ku\u010di]] or one of the neighbouring tribes.''. The second commentary about Kelmendi's place of origin comes in 1685 in a letter by Catholic archbishop [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] who writes that ''according to oral stories the progenitor of Kelmendi came from the Upper [[Mora\u010da]]''.<ref name=\"Ukgjini1999\">{{cite web |last1=Ukgjini |first1=Nik\u00eb |title=V\u00ebshtrim i shkurt\u00ebr historik p\u00ebr fisin e Kelmendit [A short historical summary about the fis of Kelmendi] |url=http://www.kulturserver-hamburg.de/home/shkodra/phoenix_11_12/phoenix_11_12_art05.html |publisher=Phoenix Journal |date=1999 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |ref=Ukgjini1999}}</ref> \n\nFrench consul Hyacinte Hecquard (1814\u20131866), noted that all of the Kelmendi (''Clementi'') except the families called ''Onos'' believe that they descend from one ancestor, ''Clemens'' or ''Clement'' (Kelment or Kelmend{{sfn|Elsie|2015}} in Albanian).{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=177}} A Franciscan priest in Shkodra, Gabriel recounted a story about a Clemens who was a Venetian who was a priest in [[Venetian Dalmatia]] and [[Herzegovina]] before taking refuge in Albania.{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}} The story went on to say he originated from either of those two provinces, and that he was encountered by a pastor in [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]].{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}}\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded the most widely spread oral tradition about Kelmendi's origins in 1850. According it a rich herdsman in the region of Triepshi (which administratively in the past fell within Kuci) employed as a herdsman a young man who came to Triepshi from an unknown region. The young man had an affair with Bum\u00e7e, the daughter of the rich herdsman.

One story has it that the founder settled from Lajqit e Hotit, in Hoti, and to Hoti from Fundane, the village of Lopare in Ku\u010di; he was upset with the Hoti and Ku\u010di, and therefore left those tribes. When he lived in Lopare, he married a girl from Triepshi, who followed him. His name was Amati, and his wife's name was Bum\u00e7e. According to others, his name was Klement, from where the tribe received its name. Another story, which Jovi\u010devi\u0107 had heard in Selce, was that the founder was from Piperi, a poor man that had worked as a servant for a wealthy Ku\u010di, there he sinned with a girl from a noble family, and left via the [[Cem (river)|Cem]].{{sfn|Jovi\u010devi\u0107|1923|pp=60\u201361}}  \n\nIn oral tradition, Bum\u00e7e, the wife of Kelmendi came from the Bekaj brotherhood of Triepshi.<ref name=\"Shyti\">{{cite web |last1=Shyti |first1=Nikoll\u00eb |title=T\u00eb par\u00ebt e Kelmendit erdh\u00ebn nga Trieshi |url=https://zanimalsise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ZANI-I-MALESISE-PRILL-2018.pdf |website=Zani i Mal\u00ebsis\u00eb [Voice of Mal\u00ebsia] |accessdate=19 March 2020 |ref=Shyti}}</ref>\n\nThe first historical record about Kelmendi is the Ottoman [[defter]] of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] 1497, which was a supplementary registry to that of 1485.

Thus, [[Marino Bizzi]] (1570\u20131624), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] writes in 1610 that ''the Kelmendi peoples, who are almost entirely Latin, speak Albanian and Dalmatian and are divided in ten katuns: Kelmendi, Gruda, Hoti, Kastrati, Shkreli, Tuzi all Latins and Bjelopavlici, Piperi, Bratonosici, these are Dalmatians and Kuci of whom half are schismatics and half Latin''.{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2013|p=23}}\n\nBizzi reported an incident in 1613 in which an Ottoman commander, Arslan Pasha, raided the villages of the Kelmendi and started taking prisoners, until an agreement was reached with the Kelmendi clans. According to the agreement, the Kelmendi would surrender fifteen of their members as slaves, and pay a tribute of 1,000 ducats to the Ottomans. However, as Arslan Pasha waited for the payment of the tribute, the Kelmendi ambushed part of his troops and killed about thirty cavalrymen.

It is located in the upper valley of the [[Cem (river)|Cem]] river and its tributaries in the [[Accursed Mountains]] range of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The Vermosh river springs in the [[Vermosh|village of the same]], which is Albania's northernmost village. Vermosh pours into [[Lake Plav]].\n\nKelmendi is mentioned as early as the 14th century and as a territorial tribe it developed in the 15th century. In the Balkans, it is widely known historically for its longtime resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its extensive battles and raids against the Ottomans which reached as far north as Bosnia and as far east as Bulgaria. By the 17th century, they had grown so much in numbers and strength that their name was sometimes used for all tribes of northern Albania and Montenegro. The Ottoman tried several times to expel them completely from their home territory and forcefully settle them elsewhere, but the community returned to its ancestral lands again. \n\nKelmendi's legacy is found throughout the region. Via expansion, migratory settlement or even forced resettlement, Kelmendi is found beyond the Cem valley ([[Selc\u00eb]], [[Vuk\u00ebl]], [[Nik\u00e7]] and others), Gusinje (in particular, the villages [[Vusanje|Vuthaj]], Doli, Martinaj and Gusinje/Gucia itself) and [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] (Hakaj) to the east in [[Ro\u017eaje]] and the [[Pe\u0161ter]] plateau. In [[Kosovo]]{{Cref2|a}}, descendants of Kelmendi live in the [[Rugova Canyon]] and western Kosovo mainly. In Montenegro, half of the tribe (''pleme'') of Old [[Ceklin]] and a part of [[Ku\u010di]] in the 16th century come from Kelmendi. The northernmost settlement from Kelmendi is in the villages of [[Hrtkovci]] and [[Nikinci]] in [[Syrmia]] when 1,600 Catholic Albanian refugees settled there in 1737.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name ''Kelmendi'' comes from Latin [[Clemens]]. A folk etymology explains it as Kol Mendi (Nicholas the Clever). The historical origin of the toponym is traced to the Roman fort of Clementiana which [[Procopius of Caesarea]] mentions in the mid 6th century in the road that connected [[Scodra]] and [[Petriz\u00ean]]. As a surname it first appears in 1353 in a Latin document which mentions ''dominus Georgius filius Georgii Clementi de Spasso'' (Lord Georgius, son of Georgius Clementi of Spas) in northern Albania.<ref name=\"\u0160ufflay\">{{cite book|author=Milan \u0160ufflay|authorlink=Milan \u0160ufflay|title=Izabrani politi\u010dki spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXJOAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 March 2020|year=2000|publisher=Matica hrvatska|page=136}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nikc 04.JPG|thumb|left|Catholic church in [[Nik\u00e7]].]]\n[[File:Overview of Albanian tribes, Franz Seiner, 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Albanian bajraks (1918).

It borders the Albanian tribal regions of [[Gruda (tribe)|Gruda]] to the west, [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] to the southwest, [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Boga]] to the south, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] to the east, and the [[Tribes of Montenegro|Montenegrin tribal]] regions of [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThere are many theories on the place of origin of the Kelmendi. Before the 20th century, several travellers, historians and clergymen have recorded various oral traditions and presented their own interpretations. In modern times, archival research has provided a more historically grounded approach. [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] in the 1920s found the first reference to the Kelmendi name in the Venetian archives. The publication of the Ottoman defter of the sanjak of Scutari in 1974 marks the publication of the first historical record about the people of Kelmendi, their anthroponymy, toponymy and social organization. \n\nIn the early centuries of Kelmendi, in the 15th and 16th centuries the only information that is mentioned about them is their language, ethnic group and religion. As Catholic bishop [[Frang Bardhi]] writes in his correspondence with the [[Roman Curia]], ''they belong to the Albanian nation, speak Albanian, hold our holy Roman Catholic beliefs''.<ref name=\"Zamputi1963\">{{cite book |last1=Zamputi |first1=Injac |title=Relacione mbi gjendjen e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb veriore e t\u00eb mesme n\u00eb shekullin XVII (1634-1650) [Correspondence on the situation in northern and central Albania in the 17th century] |date=1963 |publisher=Univeristy of Tirana |page=161 |url=https://www.academia.edu/41423125 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The first writing about Kelmendi's area of origin is from Franciscan missionary, Bernardo da Verona who in 1663 wrote that ''it is not easy to make comments about Kelmendi's origin, but it has become customary to say that they came from [[Ku\u010di]] or one of the neighbouring tribes.''. The second commentary about Kelmendi's place of origin comes in 1685 in a letter by Catholic archbishop [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] who writes that ''according to oral stories the progenitor of Kelmendi came from the Upper [[Mora\u010da]]''.<ref name=\"Ukgjini1999\">{{cite web |last1=Ukgjini |first1=Nik\u00eb |title=V\u00ebshtrim i shkurt\u00ebr historik p\u00ebr fisin e Kelmendit [A short historical summary about the fis of Kelmendi] |url=http://www.kulturserver-hamburg.de/home/shkodra/phoenix_11_12/phoenix_11_12_art05.html |publisher=Phoenix Journal |date=1999 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |ref=Ukgjini1999}}</ref> \n\nFrench consul Hyacinte Hecquard (1814\u20131866), noted that all of the Kelmendi (''Clementi'') except the families called ''Onos'' believe that they descend from one ancestor, ''Clemens'' or ''Clement'' (Kelment or Kelmend{{sfn|Elsie|2015}} in Albanian).{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=177}} A Franciscan priest in Shkodra, Gabriel recounted a story about a Clemens who was a Venetian who was a priest in [[Venetian Dalmatia]] and [[Herzegovina]] before taking refuge in Albania.{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}} The story went on to say he originated from either of those two provinces, and that he was encountered by a pastor in [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]].{{sfn|Hecquard|1859|p=178}}\n\n[[Johann Georg von Hahn]] recorded the most widely spread oral tradition about Kelmendi's origins in 1850.

When he lived in Lopare, he married a girl from Triepshi, who followed him. His name was Amati, and his wife's name was Bum\u00e7e.

Thus, [[Marino Bizzi]] (1570\u20131624), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] writes in 1610 that ''the Kelmendi peoples, who are almost entirely Latin, speak Albanian and Dalmatian and are divided in ten katuns: Kelmendi, Gruda, Hoti, Kastrati, Shkreli, Tuzi all Latins and Bjelopavlici, Piperi, Bratonosici, these are Dalmatians and Kuci of whom half are schismatics and half Latin''.{{sfn|Shkurtaj|2013|p=23}}\n\nBizzi reported an incident in 1613 in which an Ottoman commander, Arslan Pasha, raided the villages of the Kelmendi and started taking prisoners, until an agreement was reached with the Kelmendi clans. According to the agreement, the Kelmendi would surrender fifteen of their members as slaves, and pay a tribute of 1,000 ducats to the Ottomans. However, as Arslan Pasha waited for the payment of the tribute, the Kelmendi ambushed part of his troops and killed about thirty cavalrymen.

It is a town of approximately 19,000 people (2000), 1600m above sea level. It has an [[Goroka Airport|airport]] (in the centre of town) and is on the \"[[Highlands Highway]]\", about 285&nbsp;km from [[Lae]] in [[Morobe Province|Morobe province]] and 90&nbsp;km from the nearby town of [[Kainantu]] also in the Eastern Highlands. Other nearby towns include [[Kundiawa]] in [[Simbu Province]] and [[Mount Hagen]] in [[Western Highlands Province]]. It has a mild climate, known as a \"perpetual Spring\".\n\nIt is the home of several national institutions: CRMF Christian Radio Missionary Fellowship,  the [[PNG Institute of Medical Research]], the National Film Institute, the [[Melanesian Institute]], the Raun Raun Theatre Company and the [[University of Goroka]]. Several NGOs also have presences there, including [[Oxfam]] and [[Save the Children]]. The town's single largest hotel is the Bird of Paradise, owned by the Coral Seas Hotels chain.\n\nCoffee is a common cash crop in the area; smaller industries include trout farms, pigs, bee keeping and food gardens (broccoli, kau kau or sweet potato, carrots, ginger and peanuts are examples of produce that grow well here; nearby Bena Bena is known for its pineapples).\n\n== Events ==\nIn May, Goroka hosts the PNG Coffee Festival.\n\nThe [[Goroka Show]] event takes place annually around the time of the country's Independence Day (September 16). It continues for two or three days. The Goroka Show is the oldest show in Papua New Guinea, over 50 years of \"keeping the spirit alive\".\n\n==Geography==\nIt is a relatively small town, containing a bank, a police station, one of the few airports in the province, several stores, a hospital, a post office, a second-hand market, two food markets and several churches.

It is a town of approximately 19,000 people (2000), 1600m above sea level. It has an [[Goroka Airport|airport]] (in the centre of town) and is on the \"[[Highlands Highway]]\", about 285&nbsp;km from [[Lae]] in [[Morobe Province|Morobe province]] and 90&nbsp;km from the nearby town of [[Kainantu]] also in the Eastern Highlands. Other nearby towns include [[Kundiawa]] in [[Simbu Province]] and [[Mount Hagen]] in [[Western Highlands Province]]. It has a mild climate, known as a \"perpetual Spring\".\n\nIt is the home of several national institutions: CRMF Christian Radio Missionary Fellowship,  the [[PNG Institute of Medical Research]], the National Film Institute, the [[Melanesian Institute]], the Raun Raun Theatre Company and the [[University of Goroka]]. Several NGOs also have presences there, including [[Oxfam]] and [[Save the Children]]. The town's single largest hotel is the Bird of Paradise, owned by the Coral Seas Hotels chain.\n\nCoffee is a common cash crop in the area; smaller industries include trout farms, pigs, bee keeping and food gardens (broccoli, kau kau or sweet potato, carrots, ginger and peanuts are examples of produce that grow well here; nearby Bena Bena is known for its pineapples).\n\n== Events ==\nIn May, Goroka hosts the PNG Coffee Festival.\n\nThe [[Goroka Show]] event takes place annually around the time of the country's Independence Day (September 16). It continues for two or three days. The Goroka Show is the oldest show in Papua New Guinea, over 50 years of \"keeping the spirit alive\".\n==Geography==\nIt is a relatively small town, containing a bank, a police station, one of the few airports in the province, several stores, a hospital, a post office, a second-hand market, two food markets and several churches. The Highlands Highway is the only paved road that leads out of it, but there are several smaller, unpaved roads, including one of the roads to [[Mount Wilhelm]].\n\nThe [[Wahgi River]] runs along one side of Kundiawa, and the [[Simbu River]], which runs on and becomes the Wahgi, flows along the other side. The terrain around Kundiawa is very steep and mountainous, and many people walk several kilometres each way to get to Kundiawa from their villages because they don't have access to roads.\n==Climate==\nGoroka has a relatively cool [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am) due to altitude with heavy rainfall most of the year and low rainfall from June to September.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Goroka\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 25.5\n|Feb high C = 25.5\n|Mar high C = 25.1\n|Apr high C = 25.2\n|May high C = 25.3  \n|Jun high C = 24.4\n|Jul high C = 24.0\n|Aug high C = 24.5\n|Sep high C = 24.9\n|Oct high C = 25.3\n|Nov high C = 25.9\n|Dec high C = 25.4\n  \n|Jan mean C = 19.9\n|Feb mean C = 20.1\n|Mar mean C = 19.8\n|Apr mean C = 19.8\n|May mean C = 19.7\n|Jun mean C = 18.8\n|Jul mean C = 18.6\n|Aug mean C = 18.9\n|Sep mean C = 19.1\n|Oct mean C = 19.4\n|Nov mean C = 19.7\n|Dec mean C = 19.8\n\n|Jan low C = 14.4\n|Feb low C = 14.7\n|Mar low C = 14.6\n|Apr low C = 14.4\n|May low C = 14.2\n|Jun low C = 13.3\n|Jul low C = 13.2\n|Aug low C = 13.3\n|Sep low C = 13.4\n|Oct low C = 13.5   \n|Nov low C = 13.5\n|Dec low C = 14.3\n\n|Jan precipitation mm= 229\n|Feb precipitation mm= 249\n|Mar precipitation mm= 232\n|Apr precipitation mm= 181\n|May precipitation mm= 117\n|Jun precipitation mm= 62\n|Jul precipitation mm= 55\n|Aug precipitation mm= 65\n|Sep precipitation mm= 99\n|Oct precipitation mm= 159\n|Nov precipitation mm= 163\n|Dec precipitation mm= 229\n|year precipitation mm= \n\n|source =<ref>https://en.climate-data.org/location/50976</ref>\n}}\n\n==Notable people==\nGoroka is the birthplace of ex-[[Premier of Tasmania]] [[Lara Giddings]]\n*[[rugby league]] players [[Stanley Gene]] and [[James Segeyaro]].\n\n[[File:GorokaMarket.jpg|thumb|none|Goroka market]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Goroka Urban LLG]]\n*[[Goroka District]]\n*[[Goroka languages]]\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Goroka}}\n\n*{{wikivoyage-inline|Goroka}}\n*[http://www.uog.ac.pg/ The University of Goroka]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090203133353/http://www.mi.org.pg/ Melanesian Institute]\n*[https://crmf.org.pg/ CRMF Christian Radio Missionary Fellowship]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022101719/http://gorokashow.com/ Goroka Show website]\n\n{{PNG Provincial Capitals}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Goroka| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Eastern Highlands Province]]\n[[Category:Provincial capitals in Papua New Guinea]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroka"}

His association with them continued, to some extent, when he was hired to produce the music for the recordings associated with the television show that was loosely based on their life and career. That show, which aired from 1970-1974, \"[[The Partridge Family]]\", featured the theme song, \"C'mon Get Happy\" which was written by Farrell (with Danny Janssen).

Farrell also co-wrote \"Come and Take a Ride in My Boat\" (with [[Jerry Goldstein (producer)|Jerry Goldstein]]), slightly reworked in 1967 to provide [[Every Mother's Son]] with their signature hit \"[[Come on Down to My Boat]]\" (US #6).  He also co-wrote (with Larry Kusik and Ritchie Adams) the song [[Happy Summer Days]], a hit for [[Ronnie Dove]] in 1966.\n\nFarrell's Top 40 hit \"Look What You've Done\" \u2014 first recorded in 1966 by the [[Pozo Seco Singers]] \u2014 appears on [[Carla Olson|Carla Olson's]] 2013 album ''Have Harmony, Will Travel'' as a duet with Rob Waller (of I See Hawks in LA).\n\nIn 1966, Farrell wrote the theme song for ''[[Gamera (film)|Gammera the Invincible]]'' (aka ''Gamera''), the American cut of the first [[Gamera]] film .<ref name=\"AFI_1997\">\n{{cite book| author = American Film Institute| authorlink = American Film Institute| title = The AFI Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States: Feature Films, 1961-1970| publisher = University of California Press| year = 1997| isbn = 0520209702| page = 388| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC&pg=PA388&dq=%22wes+farrell%22+%22gamera%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9DGyUKaiCuW40gHkzoCQDg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22wes%20farrell%22%20%22gamera%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nSuccess as a producer came in 1968 when Farrell produced \"[[Indian Lake (song)|Indian Lake]]\" for the [[Cowsills]]. The recording of that song written by [[Tony Romeo]] was a top ten hit. He produced three other tracks for that family band, including \"Poor Baby\" and \"The Path of Love\", also written by Romeo. His association with them continued, to some extent, when he was hired to produce the music for the recordings associated with the television show that was loosely based on their life and career. That show, which aired from 1970-1974, \"[[The Partridge Family]]\", featured the theme song, \"C'mon Get Happy\" which was written by Farrell (with Danny Janssen). Seven studio albums connected with the show were produced by Farrell.<ref name=Tiger>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmongethappy.com/interviews/wf/|title=Interview with Wes Farrell|website=CmonGetHappy.com|publisher=[[Tiger Beat]] special edition ''[[Partridge Family]] Magazine''|date=March 1971|}}</ref> They included 30 songs which Farrell also co-wrote.  Among those songs were \"[[Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted]]\" (with Jim Cretecos and [[Mike Appel]]), and \"[[I'll Meet You Halfway]]\" (with [[Gerry Goffin]]), which were both top ten U.S. hits.  Unlike the Cowsills, who were actually featured on their own records, the albums produced under the name of the Partridge Family mostly featured session musicians now known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] with backing vocals by [[the Ron Hicklin Singers]].

It is dedicated to show business, themed after movies, production, and behind-the-scenes. In 2017, the park hosted approximately 5.2 million guests,<ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url= https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/disneyland-paris.htm |title=Disneyland Paris facts and information | year=2019 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref> making it the third-most visited amusement park in Europe. Its sister park is [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Florida]].\n\nThe park is represented by the [[Earffel Tower]], a [[water tower]] similar to one that was installed at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] lot in [[Burbank, California]].\n\n==Dedication==\n{{quote|''To all who enter this studio of dreams...welcome. Walt Disney Studios is dedicated to our timeless fascination and affection for cinema and television. Here we celebrate the art and the artistry of storytellers from Europe and around the world who create magic. May this special place stir our own memories of the past, and our dreams of the future.''|[[Michael D. Eisner]], 16 March 2002}}\n\n==History==\nInitial plans for a second theme park, named '''Disney-MGM Studios Europe''' or '''Disney-MGM Studios Paris''', were scheduled to open in 1996, though these plans were canceled around mid-1992 due to the resort's financial crisis at the time. After the resort began to make a profit, these plans were revived on a much smaller scale. Walt Disney Studios Park opened on 16 March 2002.\n\nIn June 2007, a new \"studio lot\" opened in the Animation Courtyard area of the park, named [[Toon Studio]]. It is themed as a \"toon backlot\", representing the film studio workplace of animated characters, where they produce their animated films, including ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'', and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. The concept has been created exclusively for Walt Disney Studios Park and features two rides not seen in any other [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme park]], along with small merchandising locations and many character meet-and-greets. In this expansion phase are ''[[Crush's Coaster]]'', a custom-designed [[Maurer S\u00f6hne]] SC 2000 indoor spinning [[roller coaster]], and ''[[Cars Quatre Roues Rallye]]'' themed after the 2006 [[Disney/Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', with the ride taking the form of an enhanced teacups ride. Similar rides are found in [[Mermaid Lagoon]] at [[Tokyo DisneySea]] and [[A Bug's Land]] at [[Disney California Adventure]]. On 22 December 2007, [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|''The Twilight Zone'' Tower of Terror]] soft-opened with the new Hollywood Boulevard on Production Courtyard. [[Stitch Encounter|''Stitch Live!'']], imported from [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], replaced the Disney Channel Studio Tour.\n\nIn 2009, new entertainment opened at Walt Disney Studios to run alongside ''Mickey's Magical Party'', which began in April 2009. ''Playhouse Disney Live On Stage!'' opened next to ''[[Stitch Encounter|Stitch Live!]]'' and is presented in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Walt Disney Studios opened with a full-size parade called 'Disney's Cinema Parade', which was themed after popular Disney animated and live-action films. In 2008 the parade was replaced with 'Disney's Stars 'n' Cars', a smaller version of [[Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade]], which came from [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Florida]]. In August 2010, [[Toy Story Playland]] opened to coincide with the new Disney\u00b7Pixar film ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', \"shrinking\" guests to the size of a toy. The three attractions are a [[Half Pipe (roller coaster)|Half pipe coaster]] named RC Racer, a [[parachute jump|parachute jumpstyle ride]] named Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop and a [[Music Express]] train named Slinky Dog Zigzag Spin, all themed intricately around the first 2 Toy Story films.\n\nOn 27 February 2018, [[Bob Iger]] announced a transformative multi-year expansion, opening in phases from 2021 to 2025 to coincide with the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], which will completely transform the park. The cost of this expansion is \u20ac2 billion. It will feature new areas based on [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel]], ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Frozen (franchise)|Frozen]]'', all surrounding a new man-made lake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://disneylandparis-news.com/en/disney-announces-transformative-multi-year-expansion-for-disneyland-paris/|title=Disney Announces Transformative Multi-Year Expansion for Disneyland Paris \u2013 Disneyland Paris News|language=en-US|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nWalt Disney Studios Park, alongside [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]], is temporarily closed until further notice starting 14 March 2020  in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/business/disneyland-coronavirus.html|title=Disney Parks and Cruise Line Will Close in Response to Coronavirus|date=12 March 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 March 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Current Studio lots==\n{{main|List of Walt Disney Studios Park attractions}}\nWalt Disney Studios Park is divided into four \"studio lots\", representing various aspects of film production present at a Hollywood film studio.\n\n===Front Lot===\n[[Front Lot]] serves as the park's main entrance and is home to most shops and services of the park, the [[Earffel Tower]] is located here.

[[Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e]], France, which opened on 16 March 2002. It is dedicated to show business, themed after movies, production, and behind-the-scenes. In 2017, the park hosted approximately 5.2 million guests,<ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url= https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/disneyland-paris.htm |title=Disneyland Paris facts and information | year=2019 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref> making it the third-most visited amusement park in Europe. Its sister park is [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Florida]].\n\nThe park is represented by the [[Earffel Tower]], a [[water tower]] similar to one that was installed at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] lot in [[Burbank, California]].\n\n==Dedication==\n{{quote|''To all who enter this studio of dreams...welcome. Walt Disney Studios is dedicated to our timeless fascination and affection for cinema and television. Here we celebrate the art and the artistry of storytellers from Europe and around the world who create magic. May this special place stir our own memories of the past, and our dreams of the future.''|[[Michael D. Eisner]], 16 March 2002}}\n\n==History==\nInitial plans for a second theme park, named '''Disney-MGM Studios Europe''' or '''Disney-MGM Studios Paris''', were scheduled to open in 1996, though these plans were canceled around mid-1992 due to the resort's financial crisis at the time. After the resort began to make a profit, these plans were revived on a much smaller scale. Walt Disney Studios Park opened on 16 March 2002.\n\nIn June 2007, a new \"studio lot\" opened in the Animation Courtyard area of the park, named [[Toon Studio]]. It is themed as a \"toon backlot\", representing the film studio workplace of animated characters, where they produce their animated films, including ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'', and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. The concept has been created exclusively for Walt Disney Studios Park and features two rides not seen in any other [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme park]], along with small merchandising locations and many character meet-and-greets. In this expansion phase are ''[[Crush's Coaster]]'', a custom-designed [[Maurer S\u00f6hne]] SC 2000 indoor spinning [[roller coaster]], and ''[[Cars Quatre Roues Rallye]]'' themed after the 2006 [[Disney/Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', with the ride taking the form of an enhanced teacups ride. Similar rides are found in [[Mermaid Lagoon]] at [[Tokyo DisneySea]] and [[A Bug's Land]] at [[Disney California Adventure]]. On 22 December 2007, [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|''The Twilight Zone'' Tower of Terror]] soft-opened with the new Hollywood Boulevard on Production Courtyard. [[Stitch Encounter|''Stitch Live!'']], imported from [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], replaced the Disney Channel Studio Tour.\n\nIn 2009, new entertainment opened at Walt Disney Studios to run alongside ''Mickey's Magical Party'', which began in April 2009. ''Playhouse Disney Live On Stage!'' opened next to ''[[Stitch Encounter|Stitch Live!]]'' and is presented in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Walt Disney Studios opened with a full-size parade called 'Disney's Cinema Parade', which was themed after popular Disney animated and live-action films. In 2008 the parade was replaced with 'Disney's Stars 'n' Cars', a smaller version of [[Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade]], which came from [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Florida]]. In August 2010, [[Toy Story Playland]] opened to coincide with the new Disney\u00b7Pixar film ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', \"shrinking\" guests to the size of a toy. The three attractions are a [[Half Pipe (roller coaster)|Half pipe coaster]] named RC Racer, a [[parachute jump|parachute jumpstyle ride]] named Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop and a [[Music Express]] train named Slinky Dog Zigzag Spin, all themed intricately around the first 2 Toy Story films.\n\nOn 27 February 2018, [[Bob Iger]] announced a Transformative Multi Year Expansion, opening in phases from 2021 to 2025 to coincide with the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], which will completely transform the park. The cost of this expansion is \u20ac2 billion. It will feature new areas based on [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel]], ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Frozen (franchise)|Frozen]]'', all surrounding a new man-made lake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://disneylandparis-news.com/en/disney-announces-transformative-multi-year-expansion-for-disneyland-paris/|title=Disney Announces Transformative Multi-Year Expansion for Disneyland Paris \u2013 Disneyland Paris News|language=en-US|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nWalt Disney Studios Park, alongside [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]], was temporarily closed from 14 March 2020 until the end of March 2020 in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/business/disneyland-coronavirus.html|title=Disney Parks and Cruise Line Will Close in Response to Coronavirus|date=12 March 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 March 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Current Studio lots==\n{{main|List of Walt Disney Studios Park attractions}}\nWalt Disney Studios Park is divided into four \"studio lots\", representing various aspects of film production present at a Hollywood film studio.\n\n===Front Lot===\n[[Front Lot]] serves as the park's main entrance and is home to most shops and services of the park, the [[Earffel Tower]] is located here.

The song was released as the second single from their [[studio album]], ''[[Elephunk]]'' (2003). It is about a disastrous courtship with the chorus consisting of the lines \"Shut up, just shut up, shut up\".\n\n== Background and release==\n[[will.i.am]] needed a female singer for the song, so he brought in [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]. She assisted the group on most of the songs on ''Elephunk'' and became the group's fourth member in 2003. While will.i.am, [[apl.de.ap]], and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] were working on the song, their girlfriends' phone calls would interrupt the session. Will said \"The vibe was blown\" and Taboo said \"So we turned the negative into positive\", by adding the problems they were having into the song they were making.\n\nThe song contains an uncredited sample of [[Kurtis Blow]]'s \"Tough\".\n\n\"Shut Up\" was not released in the U.S. but became an instant success internationally. \"Shut Up\" was released as the album's second single in late 2003, after \"[[Where Is the Love?]]\".\n\nThe song's \"Knee Deep Remix\" includes a rerecorded version of will.i.am's verse and the bridge. It also includes a new verse with apl.de.ap. An edited version of this remix appears on the deluxe version of the group's fifth studio album, ''[[The E.N.D]]'', titled \"Shut the Phunk Up\". The Remix samples the song \"[[(Not Just) Knee Deep]]\" by [[Funkadelic]]. In December 2010, Funkadelic leader [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit against will.i.am, Fergie and Universal Music. Clinton stated that he did not give his permission for the sample and that his signature was forged on the release form.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/14/george-clinton-black-eyed-peas|title=George Clinton sues Black Eyed Peas for copyright infringement|author=Associated Press|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2010-12-14|accessdate=2013-03-14|author-link=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performances==\nThe single has become an international success, reaching #1 in [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Romania]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]].

Two posters from the song \"[[Where Is the Love?]]\" are also shown. [[Kimberly Wyatt]] and [[Carmit Bachar]] from [[the Pussycat Dolls]] both make cameos in the video.

The song was released as the second single from their [[studio album]], ''[[Elephunk]]'' (2003). It is about a disastrous courtship with the chorus consisting of the lines \"Shut up, just shut up, shut up\".\n\n== Background and release==\n[[will.i.am]] needed a female singer for the song, so he brought in [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]. She assisted the group on most of the songs on ''Elephunk'' and became the group's fourth member in 2003. While will.i.am, [[apl.de.ap]], and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] were working on the song, their girlfriends' phone calls would interrupt the session. Will said \"The vibe was blown\" and Taboo said \"So we turned the negative into positive\", by adding the problems they were having into the song they were making.\n\nThe song contains an uncredited sample of [[Kurtis Blow]]'s \"Tough\".\n\n\"Shut Up\" was not released in the U.S. but became an instant success internationally. \"Shut Up\" was released as the album's second single in late 2003, after \"[[Where Is the Love?]]\".\n\nThe song's \"Knee Deep Remix\" includes a rerecorded version of will.i.am's verse and the bridge. It also includes a new verse with apl.de.ap. An edited version of this remix appears on the deluxe version of the group's fifth studio album, ''[[The E.N.D]]'', titled \"Shut the Phunk Up\". The Remix samples the song \"[[(Not Just) Knee Deep]]\" by [[Funkadelic]]. In December 2010, Funkadelic leader [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit against will.i.am, Fergie and Universal Music. Clinton stated that he did not give his permission for the sample and that his signature was forged on the release form.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/14/george-clinton-black-eyed-peas|title=George Clinton sues Black Eyed Peas for copyright infringement|author=Associated Press|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2010-12-14|accessdate=2013-03-14|author-link=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performances==\nThe single has become an international success, reaching #1 in [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Romania]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]].
