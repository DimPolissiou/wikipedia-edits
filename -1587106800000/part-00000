Jinhan was one of the [[Samhan]] (or \"Three Hans\"), along with [[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] and [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]]. Apparently descending from the [[Jin (Korean history)|Jin]] state of southern Korea, Jinhan was absorbed by the later [[Silla]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].\n\n==History==\n{{History of Korea}}\n\nJinhan, like the other Samhan confederacies, arose out of the confusion and migration following the fall of [[Wiman Joseon]] in 108 BC.\n\n==Culture==\nIts relation to the earlier state of [[Jin (Korean history)|Jin]] is not clear, although the contemporary Chinese chronicle ''[[San guo zhi|San Guo Zhi]]'' alleges that Jinhan was identical with Jin (while another record describes Jin as the predecessor of the Samhan as a whole). Jinhan and Byeonhan shared essentially the same culture, with varying religious customs, and apparently were not separated by a clear boundary.\n\nThe people claimed they were descendants of [[Qin dynasty]] migrants, fleeing Qin's force labor policies moved to the [[Mahan confederacy]] which give them the east land.

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old. The technical term for \"fraternal\" is \"polyzygotic\".]]\n[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218\u20132225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}</ref>\n\n===Twins===\n{{Main|Twin}}\n\nTwins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bellefonds |first1=Colleen |title=Do Twins Really Run in Families? |url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/twins-and-multiples/do-twins-really-run-in-families/ |website=What to Expect |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Triplets===\n{{further|List of triplets}}\n[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]\n[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|A pediatric nurse checking recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2004]]\n[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nTriplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg. In this case the original zygote divides into two, and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not.\n[[File:2004-03-29 Evangel Triplets 10 cropped.jpg|thumb|Recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria March 29, 2004.]]\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" />\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets).

It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high.

By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3\u20135 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses.<ref name=\"pmid9620827\">{{cite journal | author = Hammond KR | title = Multifetal pregnancy reduction | journal = J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 338\u201343 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9620827 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.1998.tb02657.x }}</ref>\nThough multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.\n\n===Prevention in IVF===\nToday many multiple pregnancies are the result of [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF).

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available.

One of the twins ([[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]], [[Heracles]]) is the illegitimate son of the god [[Zeus]]; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called ''[[superfecundation#Use in mythology|superfecundation]]''.\n\nIn certain medieval European [[chivalric romance]]s, such as [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Le Fresne (lai)|Le Fresne]]'', a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children.<ref>Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p295, 244 New York Burt Franklin,1963</ref>  A similar effect occurs in the [[Knight of the Swan]] romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before [[Child abandonment#In fiction|exposing]] the children.<ref>Laura A.

Out of all the assisted reproductive technology available that is currently in practice, in vitro fertilization has the highest chance of producing multiple offspring. Per each female egg, IVF currently has a 60-70% chance of conceiving. Fertilization is made possible by administering a fertility drug to the eggs or by directly injecting semen into the eggs.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is an increased chance for women over the age of 35 to have multiple births.<ref name=\"pmid16497698\" /> IVF is a common genetic and ethical topic. Through IVF individuals can produce offspring successfully when natural procreation is not viable. However, in vitro can become genetically specific and allow for the selection of particular genes or expressible traits to be dominantly present in the formed embryo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigalos|first=George \u0391.|last2=Triantafyllidou|first2=Olga|last3=Vlahos|first3=Nikos F.|date=2016-09-15|title=Novel embryo selection techniques to increase embryo implantation in IVF attempts|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|volume=294|issue=6|pages=1117\u20131124|doi=10.1007/s00404-016-4196-5|pmid=27628754|issn=0932-0067}}</ref> Ethical dilemmas arise when determining health care coverage and the deviation from natural selection and gene variations.

[[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old. The technical term for \"fraternal\" is \"polyzygotic\".]]\n[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218\u20132225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}</ref>\n\n===Twins===\n{{Main|Twin}}\n\nTwins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bellefonds |first1=Colleen |title=Do Twins Really Run in Families? |url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/twins-and-multiples/do-twins-really-run-in-families/ |website=What to Expect |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Triplets===\n{{further|List of triplets}}\n[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]\n[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|A pediatric nurse checking recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2004]]\n[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nTriplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg. In this case the original zygote divides into two, and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not.\n[[File:2004-03-29 Evangel Triplets 10 cropped.jpg|thumb|Recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria March 29, 2004.]]\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" />\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets).

By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets.

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available.

One of the twins ([[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]], [[Heracles]]) is the illegitimate son of the god [[Zeus]]; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called ''[[superfecundation#Use in mythology|superfecundation]]''.\n\nIn certain medieval European [[chivalric romance]]s, such as [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Le Fresne (lai)|Le Fresne]]'', a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children.<ref>Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p295, 244 New York Burt Franklin,1963</ref>  A similar effect occurs in the [[Knight of the Swan]] romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before [[Child abandonment#In fiction|exposing]] the children.<ref>Laura A.

Out of all the assisted reproductive technology available that is currently in practice, in vitro fertilization has the highest chance of producing multiple offspring. Per each female egg, IVF currently has a 60-70% chance of conceiving. Fertilization is made possible by administering a fertility drug to the eggs or by directly injecting semen into the eggs.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is an increased chance for women over the age of 35 to have multiple births.<ref name=\"pmid16497698\" /> IVF is a common genetic and ethical topic. Through IVF individuals can produce offspring successfully when natural procreation is not viable. However, in vitro can become genetically specific and allow for the selection of particular genes or expressible traits to be dominantly present in the formed embryo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigalos|first=George \u0391.|last2=Triantafyllidou|first2=Olga|last3=Vlahos|first3=Nikos F.|date=2016-09-15|title=Novel embryo selection techniques to increase embryo implantation in IVF attempts|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|volume=294|issue=6|pages=1117\u20131124|doi=10.1007/s00404-016-4196-5|pmid=27628754|issn=0932-0067}}</ref> Ethical dilemmas arise when determining health care coverage and the deviation from natural selection and gene variations.

[[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.

The word Dewas is believed to be a [[sandhi]] of the words [[Deva deity|Dev]] (deity) and Vas [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (abode), so Dewas means ''house of the god''. [[Swami Shivom Tirtha]] wrote the history of the hill (''Tekri''&thinsp;) of Dewas in his book, ''Sadhan Shikhar''. Inspired by the area, [[E.M.

One is that Dewas lies at the base of a {{convert|300|ft|adj=on}} conical hill, known as Chamunda hill, on top of which the shrine of Chamunda is located. The image of the goddess is cut into the wall of a cave, known as Devi Vashini or the goddess's residence. From this, the name Dewas (''dev''-''vas'') seems to have been derived. The other view of the probable origin is from the name of the founder of the city, Dewasa Bania.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mp.nic.in/dewas/Dewas/html/geography.htm|title=Geography|website=dic.mp.nic.in|access-date=30 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|Dewas State}}\nDewas was formerly the capital of two [[princely states]] of [[British India]]. The original state was founded in the first half of the 18th century by the brothers Tukaji Rao (senior) and Jivaji Rao (junior), from the [[Pawar|Puar]] clan of [[Maratha]]s. They had advanced into Malwa with the Maratha [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao I|Baji Rao]], in 1728. The brothers divided the territory among themselves; their descendants ruled as the senior and junior branches of the family. After 1841, each branch ruled his own portion as a separate state, though the lands belonging to each were intimately entangled; in Dewas, the capital town, the two sides of the main street were under different administrations and had different arrangements for water supply and lighting.\n\nThe senior branch had an area of {{convert|446|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of in 62,312 in 1901, while the area of the junior branch was {{convert|440|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} and had a population of 54,904 that same year.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dewas|volume=8|page=137}}</ref> Both Dewas states were in the [[Malwa Agency]] of the [[Central India Agency]]. There were many Jagirdars and Zamindars of the estate; one of them was Zamindar Binjraj Tapdiya the whole sole of the village Binjana and Sanjay Nagar. On his name only the name of Binjana was kept. He was popularly known as Binjana seth. His eldest son kisanlal ruled the region under puar dynasty for six decades. After him his son Seth Vallabhdas Tapdiya had ruled the village. They were the biggest Jagirdars in the kingdom of Maharaj Krishnaji Rao III Puar. After India's independence in 1947, the Rajas of Dewas acceded to India, and their states were integrated into [[Madhya Bharat]], which became a state of India in 1950. In 1956, Madhya Bharat was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]] state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mp.nic.in/dewas/Dewas/html/history_of_dewas.htm|title=History Of Dewas|website=dic.mp.nic.in|access-date=30 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nDewas lies northeast of [[Indore]], southeast of [[Ujjain]], and southwest of [[Shajapur]].

The word Dewas is believed to be a [[sandhi]] of the words [[Deva deity|Dev]] (deity) and Vas [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (abode), so Dewas means ''house of the god''. [[Swami Shivom Tirtha]] wrote the history of the hill (''Tekri''&thinsp;) of Dewas in his book, ''Sadhan Shikhar''. Inspired by the area, [[E.M. Forster]] wrote ''[[The Hill of Devi]]'' in 1953.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cvJxAAAAMAAJ|title=The Hill of Devi|last=Forster|first=Edward Morgan|date=1 January 1953|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe district takes its name from the district headquarters town, Dewas, which is said to have been derived on the basis of two traditions. One is that Dewas lies at the base of a {{convert|300|ft|adj=on}} conical hill, known as Chamunda hill, on top of which the shrine of Chamunda is located. The image of the goddess is cut into the wall of a cave, known as Devi Vashini or the goddess's residence. From this, the name Dewas (''dev''-''vas'') seems to have been derived. The other view of the probable origin is from the name of the founder of the city, Dewasa Bania.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mp.nic.in/dewas/Dewas/html/geography.htm|title=Geography|website=dic.mp.nic.in|access-date=30 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|Dewas State}}\nDewas was formerly the capital of two [[princely states]] of [[British India]]. The original state was founded in the first half of the 18th century by the brothers Tukaji Rao (senior) and Jivaji Rao (junior), from the [[Pawar|Puar]] clan of [[Maratha]]s. They had advanced into Malwa with the Maratha [[Peshwa]], [[Baji Rao I|Baji Rao]], in 1728. The brothers divided the territory among themselves; their descendants ruled as the senior and junior branches of the family. After 1841, each branch ruled his own portion as a separate state, though the lands belonging to each were intimately entangled; in Dewas, the capital town, the two sides of the main street were under different administrations and had different arrangements for water supply and lighting.\n\nThe senior branch had an area of {{convert|446|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of in 62,312 in 1901, while the area of the junior branch was {{convert|440|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} and had a population of 54,904 that same year.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dewas|volume=8|page=137}}</ref> Both Dewas states were in the [[Malwa Agency]] of the [[Central India Agency]]. There were many Jagirdars and Zamindars of the estate; one of them was Zamindar Binjraj Tapdiya the whole sole of the village Binjana and Sanjay Nagar. On his name only the name of Binjana was kept. He was popularly known as Binjana seth. His eldest son kisanlal ruled the region under puar dynasty for six decades. After him his son Seth Vallabhdas Tapdiya had ruled the village. They were the biggest Jagirdars in the kingdom of Maharaj Krishnaji Rao III Puar. After India's independence in 1947, the Rajas of Dewas acceded to India, and their states were integrated into [[Madhya Bharat]], which became a state of India in 1950. In 1956, Madhya Bharat was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]] state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mp.nic.in/dewas/Dewas/html/history_of_dewas.htm|title=History Of Dewas|website=dic.mp.nic.in|access-date=30 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nDewas lies northeast of [[Indore]], southeast of [[Ujjain]], and southwest of [[Shajapur]].
