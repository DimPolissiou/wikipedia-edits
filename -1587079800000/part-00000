The race, contested over 72 laps, was the first race of the [[1993 FIA Formula One World Championship]] and was won from [[pole position]] by [[Alain Prost]], driving a [[Williams FW15C|Williams]]-[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]], with [[Ayrton Senna]] second in a [[McLaren MP4/8|McLaren]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Mark Blundell]] third in a [[Ligier JS39|Ligier]]-[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]].\n\nThis was the first time since [[1971 Formula One season|1971]] that the first race of a season did not feature the defending Drivers' Champion in the field (in 1971, [[Jochen Rindt]] was missing as he was killed in 1970). Defending 1992 champion [[Nigel Mansell]] had moved to race in [[Champcar|Indycar]] for the season. Since there was no defending Drivers' Champion in the field this season, defending Constructors' Champion [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] could not use No. 1 on either of its cars. Therefore, this was the first race since the [[1973 United States Grand Prix]] that number 0 was used.\n\nThis was the 33rd South African Grand Prix and, as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the most recent.\n\nThe Swiss [[Sauber]] team made their Grand Prix debut and scored their first points with [[JJ Lehto]]'s 5th place finish.\n\n==Report==\nThe season started off in Kyalami where Prost, in his first race with [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]], took pole ahead of Senna, Schumacher, Hill, Alesi and Lehto, impressing in Sauber's first Grand Prix. At the start, Prost was poor and Senna and Hill (who was already ahead of Schumacher) got ahead of him. Then, Hill spun in front of Prost and dropped well down the field, Prost being forced to back off and let Schumacher through to second. Senna led Schumacher, Prost, Lehto, Wendlinger and Alesi at the end of lap one.\n\nProst attacked Schumacher, took second on lap 13 and set off after Senna. Five laps later, he attacked into the first corner but Senna took the inside and defended. However, Senna could not do anything when Prost attacked on lap 25 with the inside line. He took the lead and motored off. Schumacher also passed Senna to take second soon after. Both of them pitted unlike Prost, but Senna was quicker and rejoined ahead.\n\nSchumacher was in no mood to stay third and attacked Senna on lap 40. There was minor contact and Schumacher spun off into retirement. Patrese was third but he too spun off on lap 47, leaving Blundell's Ligier third and Fittipaldi's impressive Minardi in fourth. Prost won from Senna, Blundell, Fittipaldi, Lehto (who was lapped twice in early stages of the race) and Berger (he was out but was classified sixth).\n\n==Classification==\n\n===Qualifying===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers. Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed, and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories.\nIn 1875 by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands.

In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule.

The \u00c5land movement (\u00c5landsr\u00f6relsen) wanted \u00c5land to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and \u00c5land belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When [[Independence of Finland|Finland became independent]] (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the [[League of Nations]] referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didn't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|website = MacGregor is History |title = Disputes in the League of Nations in the 1920's|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616144657/http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|archive-date = 16 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]]\n| '''{{flag|Two Sicilies}}'''<br />{{flagicon|Malta|1814}} [[Malta Colony|Malta]]<br />{{flag|France}}<br />{{flag|Spain|1785}}\n| 1831\n| 1831\n|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831.

As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers.

During 1749\u201364, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred \"grants\", offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont. In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule. In 1777, the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York, Britain, and New Hampshire, calling it the State of Vermont. Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country, considered by New York to be a district in rebellion.

The \u00c5land movement (\u00c5landsr\u00f6relsen) wanted \u00c5land to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and \u00c5land belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When [[Independence of Finland|Finland became independent]] (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the [[League of Nations]] referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didn't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|website = MacGregor is History |title = Disputes in the League of Nations in the 1920's|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616144657/http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|archive-date = 16 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]]\n| '''{{flag|Two Sicilies}}'''<br />{{flagicon|Malta|1814}} [[Malta Colony|Malta]]<br />{{flag|France}}<br />{{flag|Spain|1785}}\n| 1831\n| 1831\n|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831.

Often the term 5 speed transmission refers simply to the '''gearbox''' that uses [[gear]]s and [[gear train]]s to provide [[speed]] and [[torque]] conversions from a rotating power source to another device.<ref>{{cite book|author1= J. J. Uicker|author2= G. R. Pennock|author3= J. E. Shigley |year= 2003 |title= Theory of Machines and Mechanisms|publisher= Oxford University Press|place= New York|edition= 3rd|isbn= 9780195155983}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= B. Paul|year= 1979|title= Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery|publisher= Prentice Hall}}</ref>\n\nIn [[British English]], the term ''transmission'' refers to the whole [[drivetrain]], including [[clutch]], gearbox, prop shaft (for rear-wheel drive), [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], and final drive shafts. In [[American English|American]] English, however, the term refers more specifically to the gearbox alone, and detailed usage differs.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"usage\">In American English, a gearbox can be any housing containing a [[gear train]], even just one pair of bevel gears; a transmission is a type of gearbox that is used to dynamically change the speed-torque ratio such as in a vehicle; and [[automatic transmission]]s are usually called by that name only, although [[manual transmission]]s are often called gearboxes.</ref>\n\nThe most common use is in [[motor vehicle]]s, where the transmission adapts the output of the [[internal combustion engine]] to the drive wheels. Such engines need to operate at a relatively high [[rotational speed]], which is inappropriate for starting, stopping, and slower travel. The transmission reduces the higher engine speed to the slower wheel speed, increasing [[torque]] in the process. Transmissions are also used on pedal bicycles, fixed machines, and where different rotational speeds and torques are adapted.\n\nOften, a transmission has multiple gear ratios (or simply \"gears\") with the ability to switch between them as speed varies. This switching may be done manually (by the operator) or automatically. Directional (forward and reverse) control may also be provided. Single-ratio transmissions also exist, which simply change the speed and torque (and sometimes direction) of motor output.\n\nIn motor vehicles, the transmission generally is connected to the engine [[crankshaft]] via a flywheel or clutch or fluid coupling, partly because internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed. The output of the transmission is transmitted via the [[driveshaft]] to one or more [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]], which drives the wheels. While a differential may also provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at either end of an axle to rotate at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel slippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation.\n\nConventional gear/belt transmissions are not the only mechanism for speed/torque adaptation. Alternative mechanisms include [[torque converter]]s and power transformation (e.g. [[diesel-electric transmission]] and [[hydraulic drive system]]). Hybrid configurations also exist. Automatic transmissions use a valve body to shift gears using fluid pressures in response to speed and throttle input. \n{{transmission types}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Interior view Pantigo Windmill East Hampton Suffolk County New York(2).png|thumb|left|Interior view of Pantigo Windmill, looking up into cap from floor\u2014cap rack, brake wheel, brake and wallower. Pantigo Windmill is located on James Lane, East Hampton, Suffolk County, Long Island, New York.]]Early transmissions included the right-angle drives and other gearing in [[windmill]]s, [[horse]]-powered devices, and [[steam engine]]s, in support of [[pump]]ing, [[mill (grinding)|mill]]ing, and [[Hoist (device)|hoist]]ing.\n\nMost modern gearboxes are used to increase [[torque]] while reducing the speed of a prime mover output shaft (e.g. a motor crankshaft). This means that the output shaft of a gearbox rotates at a slower rate than the input shaft, and this reduction in speed produces a [[mechanical advantage]], increasing torque. A gearbox can be set up to do the opposite and provide an increase in shaft speed with a reduction of torque. Some of the simplest gearboxes merely change the physical rotational direction of power transmission.\n\nMany typical [[automobile]] transmissions include the ability to select one of several [[gear ratio]]s. In this case, most of the gear ratios (often simply called \"gears\") are used to slow down the output speed of the engine and increase torque. However, the highest gears may be \"[[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]]\" types that increase the output speed.\n\n==Uses==\nGearboxes have found use in a wide variety of different&mdash;often [[:wikt:stationary|stationary]]&mdash;applications, such as [[wind turbine]]s.\n\nTransmissions are also used in [[agricultural]], [[industry|industrial]], [[construction]], [[mining]] and [[automotive]] equipment. In addition to ordinary transmission equipped with gears, such equipment makes extensive use of the hydrostatic drive and electrical [[adjustable-speed drive]]s.\n\n==Simple==\n[[Image:Helicopter Bristol 171 Sycamore main gear box and rotor head.jpg|left|thumb|The main gearbox and rotor of a [[Bristol Sycamore]] helicopter]]\nThe simplest transmissions, often called gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, an increase in speed), sometimes in conjunction with a right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in [[helicopter]]s, see picture). These are often used on [[Power take-off|PTO]]-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending from one side of the implement to another (as with [[manure spreader]]s, [[flail mower]]s, and [[forage wagon]]s). More complex equipment, such as [[silage]] choppers and [[snowblower]]s, have drives with outputs in more than one direction. So too [[Helicopter]]s use a split-torque gearbox where power is taken from the engine in two directions for the different rotors. [[File:Cambio H.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Gears from a five-speed + reverse gearbox from the 1600 Volkswagen Golf (2009).]]The gearbox in a [[wind turbine]] converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the [[electrical generator]]. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For [[Wind turbine aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand [[revolutions per minute|rpm]].) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft.<ref>{{Citation |last = Stiesdal |first = Henrik |title = The wind turbine: Components and operation |date = August 1999 |url = http://transmissionrepairguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/How-A-Turbine-Works.pdf |accessdate = 2009-10-06}}</ref> Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.<ref>{{Citation |first = W. |last = Musial |first2 = S. |last2 = Butterfield |first3 = B. |last3 = McNiff |title = Improving Wind TurbineGearbox Reliability |date = May 2007 |publisher = National Renewable Energy Laboratory |url = http://www.nrel.gov/wind/pdfs/41548.pdf |accessdate = July 2, 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120923074328/http://www.nrel.gov/wind/pdfs/41548.pdf |archivedate = September 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of where they are used, these simple transmissions all share an important feature: the gear ratio cannot be changed during use. It is fixed at the time the transmission is constructed.\n\nFor transmission types that overcome this issue, see [[Continuously variable transmission]], also known as CVT.\n\n==Multi-ratio systems==\n[[File:John Deere 3350 tractor cut transmission.JPG|thumb|left|[[Tractor]] transmission with 16 forward and 8 backward gears]]\n[[File:Amphicar gearbox.JPG|thumb|left|Amphicar gearbox cutaway w/optional shift for water going propellers]]\nMany applications require the availability of multiple [[gear ratio]]s. Often, this is to ease the starting and stopping of a mechanical system, though another important need is that of maintaining good [[fuel efficiency]].\n\n===Automotive basics===\nThe need for a transmission in an [[automobile]] is a consequence of the characteristics of the [[internal combustion engine]]. Engines typically operate over a range of 600 to about 7000 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]] (though this varies, and is typically less for diesel engines), while the car's wheels rotate between 0 rpm and around 1800 rpm.\n\nFurthermore, the engine provides its highest torque and power outputs unevenly across the rev range resulting in a [[torque band]] and a [[power band]]. Often the greatest torque is required when the vehicle is moving from rest or traveling slowly, while maximum power is needed at high speed. Therefore, a system is required that transforms the engine's output so that it can supply high torque at low speeds, but also operate at highway speeds with the motor still operating within its limits. Transmissions perform this transformation. [[Image:Powerband.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|A diagram comparing the power and torque bands of a \"torquey\" engine versus a \"peaky\" one]]\nThe dynamics of a car vary with speed: at low speeds, acceleration is limited by the inertia of vehicular gross mass; while at cruising or maximum speeds wind resistance is the dominant barrier.\n\nMany transmissions and [[gear]]s used in [[automotive]] and [[truck]] applications are contained in a [[cast iron]] case, though more frequently [[aluminium]] is used for lower weight especially in cars. There are usually three shafts: a mainshaft, a countershaft, and an idler shaft.\n\nThe mainshaft extends outside the case in both directions: the input shaft towards the engine, and the output shaft towards the rear axle (on rear wheel drive cars. Front wheel drives generally have the engine and transmission mounted transversely, the differential being part of the transmission assembly.) The shaft is suspended by the main [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and is split towards the input end. At the point of the split, a pilot bearing holds the shafts together. The gears and [[clutch]]es ride on the mainshaft, the gears being free to turn relative to the mainshaft except when engaged by the clutches.\n\n===Manual===\n{{Main|Manual transmission}}\n[[File:ZF-16S181-transmission-hous.jpg|thumb|16-speed (2x4x2) [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 16S181 \u2014 opened transmission housing ('''''2x4x'''''2)]]\n[[File:ZF-16S181-range.jpg|thumb|16S181 \u2014 opened [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary]] range housing (2x4'''''x2''''')]]\nManual transmissions come in two basic types:\n* A simple but rugged '''sliding-mesh''' or [[manual transmission#Unsynchronized transmission|unsynchronized/non-synchronous]] system, where straight-cut spur gear sets spin freely, and must be synchronized by the operator matching engine revs to road speed, to avoid noisy and damaging clashing of the gears\n* The now ubiquitous [[constant-mesh gearbox]]es, which can include non-synchronised, or [[Synchromesh gearbox|synchronized/synchromesh]] systems, where typically diagonal cut helical (or sometimes either straight-cut, or [[double helical gear|double-helical]]) gear sets are constantly \"meshed\" together, and a [[dog clutch]] is used for changing gears. On synchromesh boxes, friction cones or \"synchro-rings\" are used in addition to the dog clutch to closely match the rotational speeds of the two sides of the (declutched) transmission before making a full mechanical engagement.\n\nThe former type was standard in many vintage cars (alongside e.g. epicyclic and multi-clutch systems) before the development of constant-mesh manuals and hydraulic-epicyclic automatics, older heavy-duty [[truck]]s, and can still be found in use in some agricultural equipment. The latter is the modern standard for on- and off-road transport manual and automated manual transmission, although it may be found in many forms; e.g., non-synchronised straight-cut in racetrack or super-heavy-duty applications, non-synchro helical in the majority of heavy trucks and motorcycles and in certain classic cars (e.g. the Fiat 500), and partly or fully synchronised helical in almost all modern manual-shift passenger cars and light trucks.\n\nManual transmissions are the most common type outside [[North America]] and [[Australia]]. They are cheaper, lighter, usually give better performance, but the newest automatic transmissions and CVTs give better fuel economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130513/carnews/130519940|title=\nExperts predict nine-, 10-speed transmissions to dominate in North America|publisher=Autoweek|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130415/carnews/130419905|title=\nFord, GM work together on new nine-, 10-speed transmissions|publisher=Autoweek|date=April 15, 2013}}</ref> It is customary for new drivers to learn, and be tested, on a car with a manual gear change.

For example, reverse gear is usually unsynchronised, as the driver is only expected to engage it when the vehicle is at a standstill. Many older (up to 1970s) cars also lacked synchronisation on first gear (for various reasons\u2014cost, typically \"shorter\" overall gearing, engines typically having more low-end torque, the extreme wear on a frequently used first gear synchroniser ...), meaning it also could only be used for moving away from a stop unless the driver became adept at double-declutching and had a particular need to regularly downshift into the lowest gear.\n\nSome manual transmissions have an extremely low ratio for first gear, called a ''creeper gear'' or ''granny gear''. Such gears are usually not synchronized. This feature is common on pick-up trucks tailored to trailer-towing, farming, or construction-site work. During normal on-road use, the truck is usually driven without using the creeper gear at all, and second gear is used from a standing start. Some off-road vehicles, most particularly the Willys Jeep and its descendants, also had transmissions with \"granny first's\" either as standard or an option, but this function is now more often provided for by a low-range transfer gearbox attached to a normal fully synchronized transmission.\n\n===Non-synchronous===\n{{Main|Non-synchronous transmission}}\nSome commercial applications use non-synchronized manual transmissions that require a skilled operator. Depending on the country, many local, regional, and national laws govern operation of these types of vehicles (''see [[Commercial Driver's License]]''). This class may include [[Semi-trailer truck|commercial]], military, [[tractor|agricultural]], or [[engineering vehicle]]s. Some of these may use combinations of types for multi-purpose functions. An example is a [[power take-off]] (PTO) gear. The non-synchronous transmission type requires an understanding of gear range, torque, engine power, and multi-functional clutch and shifter functions. Also see [[Non-synchronous transmission#Double clutching|Double-clutching]], and [[Non-synchronous transmission#Clutch brake|Clutch-brake]] sections of the main article. [[Float shifting]] is the process of shifting gears without using the clutch.\n\n===Automatic===\n{{Main|Automatic transmission}}\n[[Image:Epicyclic gear ratios.png|thumb|[[Epicyclic gearing]] or planetary gearing as used in an automatic transmission.]]\n\nMost modern North American, and some European and Japanese cars have an [[automatic transmission]] that selects an appropriate gear ratio without any operator intervention. They primarily use [[hydraulics]] to select gears, depending on [[pressure]] exerted by fluid within the transmission assembly. Rather than using a [[clutch]] to engage the transmission, a fluid flywheel, or [[torque converter]] is placed in between the engine and transmission. It is possible for the driver to control the number of gears in use or select reverse, though precise control of which gear is in use may or may not be possible.\n\nAutomatic transmissions are easy to use. However, in the past, some automatic transmissions of this type have had a number of problems; they were complex and expensive, sometimes had reliability problems (which sometimes caused more expenses in repair), have often been less fuel-efficient than their manual counterparts (due to \"slippage\" in the torque converter), and their [[Shift Time|shift time]] was slower than a manual making them uncompetitive for racing. With the advancement of modern automatic transmissions, this has changed.<ref>{{cite web|title=All Pro Transmissions|publisher=All Pro Transmissions|url=https://allpromilwaukee.com/|accessdate=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to improve fuel efficiency of automatic transmissions include the use of [[torque converter]]s that lock up beyond a certain speed or in higher gear ratios, eliminating power loss, and overdrive gears that automatically actuate above certain speeds. In older transmissions, both technologies could be intrusive, when conditions are such that they repeatedly cut in and out as speed and such load factors as grade or wind vary slightly. Current computerized transmissions possess complex programming that both maximizes fuel efficiency and eliminates intrusiveness. This is due mainly to electronic rather than mechanical advances, though improvements in [[Continuously Variable Transmission|CVT]] technology and the use of automatic clutches have also helped. A few cars, including the 2013 Subaru Impreza<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&path=7&year=2013&make=Subaru&model=Impreza%20Wagon%20AWD&srchtyp=ymm|title=2013 Subaru Impreza Wagon AWD|publisher=fueleconomy.gov|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}</ref> and the 2012 model of the Honda Jazz sold in the UK, actually claim marginally better fuel consumption for the CVT version than the manual version.\n\nFor certain applications, the slippage inherent in automatic transmissions can be advantageous. For instance, in [[drag racing]], the automatic transmission allows the car to stop with the engine at a high rpm (the \"stall speed\") to allow for a very quick launch when the brakes are released. In fact, a common modification is to increase the stall speed of the transmission. This is even more advantageous for [[turbocharge]]d engines, where the turbocharger must be kept spinning at high rpm by a large flow of exhaust to maintain the [[boost pressure]] and eliminate the [[turbo lag]] that occurs when the throttle suddenly opens on an idling engine.\n\n===Automated manual===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Formula One]] -->\n{{Main|Semi-automatic transmission|Automated manual transmission}} {{Main|Electrohydraulic manual transmission}} \nAlso called '''Automated-clutch manual''', this is a hybrid form of transmission where an integrated electronic (usually electrohydraulic or pneumatic) control system handles manipulation of the [[clutch]] automatically, but the driver can still\u2014and may be required to\u2014take manual control of gear selection. This is sometimes erroneously called \"clutchless manual\", or (especially in older vehicles) a \"semi-automatic\" transmission. It can simply and best be described as a standard manual transmission, with an automated clutch, and automated clutch and gear shift control. Many of these transmissions allow the driver to fully delegate gear shifting choice to the control system, which then effectively acts as if it was a regular automatic transmission. They are generally designed using manual transmission \"internals\", and when used in passenger cars, have synchromesh operated helical constant mesh gear sets.\n\nEarly automated manual and semi-automatic systems used a variety of mechanical and hydraulic systems\u2014including centrifugal clutches, torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches\u2014and control schemes\u2014automatic declutching when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, centrifugal clutches with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.\u2014and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.\n\nMost modern implementations, however, are standard or slightly modified manual transmissions (and very occasionally modified automatics\u2014even including a few cases of CVTs with \"fake\" fixed gear ratios), with servo-controlled clutching and shifting under command of the central engine computer. These are intended as a combined replacement option both for more expensive and less efficient \"normal\" automatic systems, and for drivers who prefer manual shift but are no longer able to operate a clutch, and users are encouraged to leave the shift lever in fully automatic \"drive\" most of the time, only engaging manual-sequential mode for sporty driving or when otherwise strictly necessary.\n\nA [[dual-clutch]] transmission alternately uses two sets of internals, each with its own clutch, so that a \"gearchange\" actually only consists of one clutch engaging as the other disengages\u2014providing a supposedly \"seamless\" shift with no break in (or jarring reuptake of) power transmission. Each clutch's attached shaft carries half of the total input gear complement (with a shared output shaft), including synchronised dog clutch systems that pre-select which of its set of ratios is most likely needed at the next shift, under command of a computerised control system. Specific types of this transmission include: [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]].\n\nThere are also sequential manual transmissions that use the rotation of a drum to switch gears, much like those of a typical fully manual motorcycle.<ref>{{cite web |author= Marshall Brain |title=How Sequential Gearboxes Work |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/sequential-gearbox.htm |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref> These can be designed with a manual or automatic clutch system, and may be found both in automobiles (particularly track and rally racing cars), motorcycles (typically light \"step-thru\" type city utility bikes, e.g., the Honda Super Cub) and quadbikes (often with a separately engaged reversing gear), the latter two normally using a scooter-style centrifugal clutch.\n\n===Bicycle gearing===\n[[Image:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Shimano]] XT rear derailleur on a [[mountain bike]]]] \n{{Main|Bicycle gearing|Derailleur gears|Hub gear}}\n[[Bicycle]]s usually have a system for selecting different gear ratios. There are two main types: [[derailleur gears]] and [[hub gears]]. The derailleur type is the most common, and the most visible, using [[sprocket]] gears. Typically there are several gears available on the rear sprocket assembly, attached to the rear wheel. A few more sprockets are usually added to the front assembly as well. Multiplying the number of sprocket gears in front by the number to the rear gives the number of gear ratios, often called \"speeds\".\n\nHub gears use [[epicyclic gearing]] and are enclosed within the [[axle]] of the rear wheel. Because of the small space, they typically offer fewer different speeds, although at least one has reached [[Rohloff Speedhub|14 gear ratios]] and Fallbrook Technologies manufactures a [[NuVinci|transmission]] with technically infinite ratios.<ref name=rohloff14speed>{{cite web|url=http://www.rohloff.de/en/products/index.html |title=Rohloff 14-speed hub |publisher=Rohloff.de |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to fit bicycles with an enclosed gearbox, giving obvious advantages for better lubrication, dirt-sealing and shifting. These have usually been in conjunction with a shaft drive, as a gearbox with a traditional chain would (like the hub gear) still have many of the derailleur's disadvantages for an exposed chain. Bicycle gearboxes are enclosed in a box replacing the traditional [[bottom bracket]]. The requirement for a modified frame has been a serious drawback to their adoption. One of the most recent attempts to provide a gearbox for bicycles is the 18 speed Pinion P1.18.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Pinion sealed gearbox offers an alternative to those darn derailleurs\n  |date=13 March 2013\n  |author=Ben Coxworth\n  |publisher=Gizmag\n  |url=http://www.gizmag.com/pinion-p118-sealed-gearbox/26640/\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Pinion P1.18 Gearbox: First Ride \n  |date=6 June 2012\n  |author=Matt Wragg\n  |publisher=Pinkbike\n  |url=http://www.pinkbike.com/news/Pinion-Gearbox-First-Ride.html\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  |title=The Gearmakers\n  |publisher=Pinion \n  |url=http://pinion.eu/en/ \n  |accessdate=2014-04-29\n}}</ref> This gives an enclosed gearbox, but still a traditional chain. When fitted to a rear suspension bike, it also retains a derailleur-like jockey cage chain tensioner, although without the derailleur's low ground clearance.\n\nCauses for failure of bicycle gearing include: worn teeth, damage caused by a faulty chain, damage due to thermal expansion, broken teeth due to excessive pedaling force, interference by foreign objects, and loss of lubrication due to negligence.\n\n==Uncommon types==\n\n===Dual clutch transmission===\n{{Main|Dual clutch transmission}}\nThis arrangement is also sometimes known as a direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox. It seeks to combine the advantages of a conventional manual shift with the qualities of a modern automatic transmission by providing different clutches for odd and even speed selector gears. When changing gear, the engine torque is transferred from one gear to the other continuously, so providing gentle, smooth gear changes without either losing power or jerking the vehicle. Gear selection may be manual, automatic (depending on throttle/speed sensors), or a 'sports' version combining both options.\n\n===Continuously variable===\n{{Main|Continuously variable transmission}}\nThe continuously variable transmission (CVT) is a transmission in which the ratio of the rotational speeds of two shafts, as the input shaft and output shaft of a vehicle or other machine, can be varied continuously within a given range, providing an infinite number of possible ratios. The CVT allows the driver or a computer to select the relationship between the speed of the engine and the speed of the wheels within a continuous range. This can provide even better fuel economy if the engine constantly runs at a single speed. The transmission is, in theory, capable of a better user experience, without the rise and fall in speed of an engine, and the jerk felt when changing gears poorly.\n\nCVTs are increasingly found on small cars, and especially high-gas-mileage or [[hybrid car|hybrid]] vehicles. On these platforms, the torque is limited because the [[electric motor]] can provide torque without changing the speed of the engine. By leaving the engine running at the rate that generates the best gas mileage for the given operating conditions, overall mileage can be improved over a system with a smaller number of fixed gears, where the system may be operating at peak efficiency only for a small range of speeds. \nCVTs are also found in agricultural equipment; due to the high-torque nature of these vehicles, mechanical gears are integrated to provide tractive force at high speeds. The system is similar to that of a hydrostatic gearbox, and at 'inching speeds' relies entirely on hydrostatic drive. German tractor manufacturer [[Fendt]] pioneered the technology, developing its 'Vario [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_-LL0sCT-k]' transmission.\n\n===Infinitely variable===\nThe IVT is a specific type of CVT that includes not only an infinite number of gear ''ratios'', but an \"infinite\" ''range'' as well. This is a [[wiktionary:turn of phrase|turn of phrase]], it actually refers to CVTs that are able to include a \"zero ratio\", where the input shaft can turn without any motion of the output shaft while remaining in gear. The gear ratio in that case is not \"infinite\" but is instead \"undefined\".\n\nMost (if not all) IVTs result from the combination of a CVT with an epicyclic gear system with a fixed ratio. The combination of the fixed ratio of the epicyclic gear with a specific matching ratio in the CVT side results in zero output. For instance, consider a transmission with an epicyclic gear set to 1:\u22121 gear ratio; a 1:1 reverse gear. When the CVT side is set to 1:1 the two ratios add up to zero output. The IVT is always engaged, even during its zero output. When the CVT is set to higher values it operates conventionally, with increasing forward ratios.\n\nIn practice, the epicyclic gear may be set to the lowest possible ratio of the CVT, if reversing is not needed or is handled through other means. Reversing can be incorporated by setting the epicyclic gear ratio somewhat higher than the lowest ratio of the CVT, providing a range of reverse ratios.\n\n===Electric variable===\nThe Electric Variable Transmission (EVT) combines a transmission with an electric motor to provide the illusion of a single CVT. In the common implementation, a gasoline engine is connected to a traditional transmission, which is in turn connected to an epicyclic gear system's planet carrier. An electric motor/generator is connected to the central \"sun\" gear, which is normally un-driven in typical epicyclic systems. Both sources of power can be fed into the transmission's output at the same time, splitting power between them. In common examples, between one-quarter and half of the engine's power can be fed into the sun gear. Depending on the implementation, the transmission in front of the epicyclic system may be greatly simplified, or eliminated completely. EVTs are capable of continuously modulating output/input speed ratios like mechanical CVTs, but offer the distinct benefit of being able to also apply power from two different sources to one output, as well as potentially reducing overall complexity dramatically.\n\nIn typical implementations, the gear ratio of the transmission and epicyclic system are set to the ratio of the common driving conditions, say highway speed for a car, or city speeds for a bus. When the driver presses on the gas, the associated electronics interpret the pedal position and immediately set the gasoline engine to the RPM that provides the best gas mileage for that setting. As the gear ratio is normally set far from the maximum torque point, this set-up would normally result in very poor acceleration. Unlike gasoline engines, electric motors offer efficient torque across a wide selection of RPM, and are especially effective at low settings where the gasoline engine is inefficient. By varying the electrical load or supply on the motor attached to the sun gear, additional torque can be provided to make up for the low torque output from the engine. As the vehicle accelerates, the power to the motor is reduced and eventually ended, providing the illusion of a CVT.\n\nThe canonical example of the EVT is Toyota's [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]]. This implementation has no conventional transmission, and the sun gear always receives 28% of the torque from the engine. This power can be used to operate any electrical loads in the vehicle, recharging the batteries, powering the entertainment system, or running the air conditioning system. Any residual power is then fed back into a second motor that powers the output of the drivetrain directly. At highway speeds this additional generator/motor pathway is less efficient than simply powering the wheels directly. However, during acceleration, the electrical path is much more efficient than an engine operating so far from its torque point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prius.ecrostech.com/original/Understanding/ContinuouslyVariableTransmission.htm |title=The Prius 'Continuously Variable Transmission' |publisher=Prius.ecrostech.com |date=2001-10-10 |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> GM uses a similar system in the Allison Bus hybrid powertrains and the Tahoe and Yukon pick-up trucks, but these use a two-speed transmission in front of the epicyclic system, and the sun gear receives close to half the total power.\n\n==Non-direct==\n\n===Electric===\n{{main|Diesel-electric transmission}}\nElectric transmissions convert the mechanical power of the engine(s) to electricity with [[electric generator]]s and convert it back to mechanical power with [[electric motor]]s. Electrical or electronic [[adjustable-speed drive]] control systems are used to control the speed and torque of the motors. If the generators are driven by [[turbine]]s, such arrangements are called [[turbo-electric transmission]]. Likewise installations powered by [[diesel-engine]]s are called diesel-electric.\n\nDiesel-electric arrangements are used on many railway locomotives, ships, large [[mining]] trucks, and some [[bulldozers]]. In these cases, each driven wheel is equipped with its own electric motor, which can be fed varying electrical power to provide any required torque or power output for each wheel independently. This produces a much simpler solution for multiple driven wheels in very large vehicles, where drive shafts would be much larger or heavier than the electrical cable that can provide the same amount of power. It also improves the ability to allow different wheels to run at different speeds, which is useful for steered wheels in large construction vehicles.\n\n===Hydrostatic===\n:''See also [[Hydrostatic transmission|Continuously variable transmission > Hydrostatic CVTs]]''\nHydrostatic transmissions transmit all power hydraulically, using the components of [[hydraulic machinery]]. They are similar to electrical transmissions, but use hydraulic fluid as the power distribution system rather than electricity.\n\nThe transmission input drive is a central hydraulic pump and final drive unit(s) is/are a hydraulic motor, or hydraulic cylinder (see: ''[[swashplate]]''). Both components can be placed physically far apart on the machine, being connected only by flexible hoses. Hydrostatic drive systems are used on excavators, lawn tractors, forklifts, winch drive systems, heavy lift equipment, agricultural machinery, earth-moving equipment, etc. An arrangement for [http://pigeonsnest.co.uk/stuff/trilink/trilink.html motor-vehicle transmission] was probably used on the Ferguson ''[[formula one|F-1]]'' [[Ferguson P99|P99]] racing car in about 1961.\n\nThe [[Human Friendly Transmission]] of the [[Honda DN-01]] is hydrostatic.\n\n===Hydrodynamic===\nIf the hydraulic pump or hydraulic motor make use of the [[Hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] effects of the fluid flow, i.e. pressure due to a change in the fluid's momentum as it flows through vanes in a turbine. The pump and motor usually consist of rotating vanes without seals and are typically placed in proximity. The transmission ratio can be made to vary by means of additional rotating vanes, an effect similar to varying the pitch of an airplane [[Controllable pitch propeller|propeller]].\n\nThe [[torque converter]] in most automotive automatic transmissions is, in itself, a hydrodynamic transmission. Hydrodynamic transmissions are used in many passenger rail vehicles, those that are not using electrical transmissions. In this application the advantage of smooth power delivery may outweigh the reduced efficiency caused by turbulence energy losses in the fluid.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bearing reducer]]\n*[[Chain drive]]\n*[[Clutch]]\n*[[Epicyclic gearing]]\n*[[Hydraulic transmission (disambiguation)|Hydraulic transmission]]\n*[[Manual transmission]]\n*[[Motorcycle transmission]]\n*[[Transfer case]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=Automotive transmissions : fundamentals, selection, design and application |publisher=Springer|author1=Harald Naunheimer |author2=Peter Fietkau |author3=G Lechner|year=2011|edition=2nd|isbn=9783642162138|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16214-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|transmission}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Transmissions}}\n* {{Britannica|602934|Transmission (engineering)}}\n* {{YouTube|vOo3TLgL0kM|Manual Transmission Operation}} WeberAuto 2012-09-23\n*[https://www.agma.org/ American Gear Manufacturers Association]\n*[https://universalmotorcarslv.com/our-services/transmission-repair/ Universal Motorcars - Transmission Repair]\n{{Gears}}\n{{Powertrain}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transmission (Mechanics)}}\n[[Category:Mechanical power transmission| ]]\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Transmission (disambiguation)}}\n{{Redirect|Gearbox|the video game developer|Gearbox Software|the transmission component|gear train}}\n[[File:Gear reducer.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Single stage gear reducer]]\nA '''transmission''' is a [[machine (mechanical)|machine]] in a [[Power (physics)|power]] transmission system, which provides controlled application of the power. Often the term 5 speed transmission refers simply to the '''gearbox''' that uses [[gear]]s and [[gear train]]s to provide [[speed]] and [[torque]] conversions from a rotating power source to another device.<ref>{{cite book|author1= J. J. Uicker|author2= G. R. Pennock|author3= J. E.

Paul|year= 1979|title= Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery|publisher= Prentice Hall}}</ref>\n\nIn [[British English]], the term ''transmission'' refers to the whole [[drivetrain]], including [[clutch]], gearbox, prop shaft (for rear-wheel drive), [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], and final drive shafts. In [[American English|American]] English, however, the term refers more specifically to the gearbox alone, and detailed usage differs.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"usage\">In American English, a gearbox can be any housing containing a [[gear train]], even just one pair of bevel gears; a transmission is a type of gearbox that is used to dynamically change the speed-torque ratio such as in a vehicle; and [[automatic transmission]]s are usually called by that name only, although [[manual transmission]]s are often called gearboxes.</ref>\n\nThe most common use is in [[motor vehicle]]s, where the transmission adapts the output of the [[internal combustion engine]] to the drive wheels. Such engines need to operate at a relatively high [[rotational speed]], which is inappropriate for starting, stopping, and slower travel. The transmission reduces the higher engine speed to the slower wheel speed, increasing [[torque]] in the process. Transmissions are also used on pedal bicycles, fixed machines, and where different rotational speeds and torques are adapted.\n\nOften, a transmission has multiple gear ratios (or simply \"gears\") with the ability to switch between them as speed varies. This switching may be done manually (by the operator) or automatically. Directional (forward and reverse) control may also be provided. Single-ratio transmissions also exist, which simply change the speed and torque (and sometimes direction) of motor output.\n\nIn motor vehicles, the transmission generally is connected to the engine [[crankshaft]] via a flywheel or clutch or fluid coupling, partly because internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed. The output of the transmission is transmitted via the [[driveshaft]] to one or more [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]], which drives the wheels. While a differential may also provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at either end of an axle to rotate at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel slippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation.\n\nConventional gear/belt transmissions are not the only mechanism for speed/torque adaptation. Alternative mechanisms include [[torque converter]]s and power transformation (e.g. [[diesel-electric transmission]] and [[hydraulic drive system]]). Hybrid configurations also exist. Automatic transmissions use a valve body to shift gears using fluid pressures in response to speed and throttle input. \n{{transmission types}}\n\n==Explanation==\n[[File:Interior view Pantigo Windmill East Hampton Suffolk County New York(2).png|thumb|left|Interior view of Pantigo Windmill, looking up into cap from floor\u2014cap rack, brake wheel, brake and wallower. Pantigo Windmill is located on James Lane, East Hampton, Suffolk County, Long Island, New York.]]Early transmissions included the right-angle drives and other gearing in [[windmill]]s, [[horse]]-powered devices, and [[steam engine]]s, in support of [[pump]]ing, [[mill (grinding)|mill]]ing, and [[Hoist (device)|hoist]]ing.\n\nMost modern gearboxes are used to increase [[torque]] while reducing the speed of a prime mover output shaft (e.g. a motor crankshaft). This means that the output shaft of a gearbox rotates at a slower rate than the input shaft, and this reduction in speed produces a [[mechanical advantage]], increasing torque. A gearbox can be set up to do the opposite and provide an increase in shaft speed with a reduction of torque. Some of the simplest gearboxes merely change the physical rotational direction of power transmission.\n\nMany typical [[automobile]] transmissions include the ability to select one of several [[gear ratio]]s. In this case, most of the gear ratios (often simply called \"gears\") are used to slow down the output speed of the engine and increase torque. However, the highest gears may be \"[[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]]\" types that increase the output speed.\n\n==Uses==\nGearboxes have found use in a wide variety of different&mdash;often [[:wikt:stationary|stationary]]&mdash;applications, such as [[wind turbine]]s.\n\nTransmissions are also used in [[agricultural]], [[industry|industrial]], [[construction]], [[mining]] and [[automotive]] equipment. In addition to ordinary transmission equipped with gears, such equipment makes extensive use of the hydrostatic drive and electrical [[adjustable-speed drive]]s.\n\n==Simple==\n[[Image:Helicopter Bristol 171 Sycamore main gear box and rotor head.jpg|left|thumb|The main gearbox and rotor of a [[Bristol Sycamore]] helicopter]]\nThe simplest transmissions, often called gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, an increase in speed), sometimes in conjunction with a right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in [[helicopter]]s, see picture). These are often used on [[Power take-off|PTO]]-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending from one side of the implement to another (as with [[manure spreader]]s, [[flail mower]]s, and [[forage wagon]]s). More complex equipment, such as [[silage]] choppers and [[snowblower]]s, have drives with outputs in more than one direction. So too [[Helicopter]]s use a split-torque gearbox where power is taken from the engine in two directions for the different rotors. [[File:Cambio H.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Gears from a five-speed + reverse gearbox from the 1600 Volkswagen Golf (2009).]]The gearbox in a [[wind turbine]] converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the [[electrical generator]]. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For [[Wind turbine aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand [[revolutions per minute|rpm]].) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft.<ref>{{Citation |last = Stiesdal |first = Henrik |title = The wind turbine: Components and operation |date = August 1999 |url = http://transmissionrepairguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/How-A-Turbine-Works.pdf |accessdate = 2009-10-06}}</ref> Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.<ref>{{Citation |first = W. |last = Musial |first2 = S. |last2 = Butterfield |first3 = B. |last3 = McNiff |title = Improving Wind TurbineGearbox Reliability |date = May 2007 |publisher = National Renewable Energy Laboratory |url = http://www.nrel.gov/wind/pdfs/41548.pdf |accessdate = July 2, 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120923074328/http://www.nrel.gov/wind/pdfs/41548.pdf |archivedate = September 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of where they are used, these simple transmissions all share an important feature: the gear ratio cannot be changed during use. It is fixed at the time the transmission is constructed.\n\nFor transmission types that overcome this issue, see [[Continuously variable transmission]], also known as CVT.\n\n==Multi-ratio systems==\n[[File:John Deere 3350 tractor cut transmission.JPG|thumb|left|[[Tractor]] transmission with 16 forward and 8 backward gears]]\n[[File:Amphicar gearbox.JPG|thumb|left|Amphicar gearbox cutaway w/optional shift for water going propellers]]\nMany applications require the availability of multiple [[gear ratio]]s. Often, this is to ease the starting and stopping of a mechanical system, though another important need is that of maintaining good [[fuel efficiency]].\n\n===Automotive basics===\nThe need for a transmission in an [[automobile]] is a consequence of the characteristics of the [[internal combustion engine]]. Engines typically operate over a range of 600 to about 7000 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]] (though this varies, and is typically less for diesel engines), while the car's wheels rotate between 0 rpm and around 1800 rpm.\n\nFurthermore, the engine provides its highest torque and power outputs unevenly across the rev range resulting in a [[torque band]] and a [[power band]]. Often the greatest torque is required when the vehicle is moving from rest or traveling slowly, while maximum power is needed at high speed. Therefore, a system is required that transforms the engine's output so that it can supply high torque at low speeds, but also operate at highway speeds with the motor still operating within its limits. Transmissions perform this transformation. [[Image:Powerband.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|A diagram comparing the power and torque bands of a \"torquey\" engine versus a \"peaky\" one]]\nThe dynamics of a car vary with speed: at low speeds, acceleration is limited by the inertia of vehicular gross mass; while at cruising or maximum speeds wind resistance is the dominant barrier.\n\nMany transmissions and [[gear]]s used in [[automotive]] and [[truck]] applications are contained in a [[cast iron]] case, though more frequently [[aluminium]] is used for lower weight especially in cars. There are usually three shafts: a mainshaft, a countershaft, and an idler shaft.\n\nThe mainshaft extends outside the case in both directions: the input shaft towards the engine, and the output shaft towards the rear axle (on rear wheel drive cars. Front wheel drives generally have the engine and transmission mounted transversely, the differential being part of the transmission assembly.) The shaft is suspended by the main [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and is split towards the input end. At the point of the split, a pilot bearing holds the shafts together. The gears and [[clutch]]es ride on the mainshaft, the gears being free to turn relative to the mainshaft except when engaged by the clutches.\n\n===Manual===\n{{Main|Manual transmission}}\n[[File:ZF-16S181-transmission-hous.jpg|thumb|16-speed (2x4x2) [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 16S181 \u2014 opened transmission housing ('''''2x4x'''''2)]]\n[[File:ZF-16S181-range.jpg|thumb|16S181 \u2014 opened [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary]] range housing (2x4'''''x2''''')]]\nManual transmissions come in two basic types:\n* A simple but rugged '''sliding-mesh''' or [[manual transmission#Unsynchronized transmission|unsynchronized/non-synchronous]] system, where straight-cut spur gear sets spin freely, and must be synchronized by the operator matching engine revs to road speed, to avoid noisy and damaging clashing of the gears\n* The now ubiquitous [[constant-mesh gearbox]]es, which can include non-synchronised, or [[Synchromesh gearbox|synchronized/synchromesh]] systems, where typically diagonal cut helical (or sometimes either straight-cut, or [[double helical gear|double-helical]]) gear sets are constantly \"meshed\" together, and a [[dog clutch]] is used for changing gears. On synchromesh boxes, friction cones or \"synchro-rings\" are used in addition to the dog clutch to closely match the rotational speeds of the two sides of the (declutched) transmission before making a full mechanical engagement.\n\nThe former type was standard in many vintage cars (alongside e.g. epicyclic and multi-clutch systems) before the development of constant-mesh manuals and hydraulic-epicyclic automatics, older heavy-duty [[truck]]s, and can still be found in use in some agricultural equipment. The latter is the modern standard for on- and off-road transport manual and automated manual transmission, although it may be found in many forms; e.g., non-synchronised straight-cut in racetrack or super-heavy-duty applications, non-synchro helical in the majority of heavy trucks and motorcycles and in certain classic cars (e.g. the Fiat 500), and partly or fully synchronised helical in almost all modern manual-shift passenger cars and light trucks.\n\nManual transmissions are the most common type outside [[North America]] and [[Australia]]. They are cheaper, lighter, usually give better performance, but the newest automatic transmissions and CVTs give better fuel economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130513/carnews/130519940|title=\nExperts predict nine-, 10-speed transmissions to dominate in North America|publisher=Autoweek|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130415/carnews/130419905|title=\nFord, GM work together on new nine-, 10-speed transmissions|publisher=Autoweek|date=April 15, 2013}}</ref> It is customary for new drivers to learn, and be tested, on a car with a manual gear change.

For example, reverse gear is usually unsynchronised, as the driver is only expected to engage it when the vehicle is at a standstill. Many older (up to 1970s) cars also lacked synchronisation on first gear (for various reasons\u2014cost, typically \"shorter\" overall gearing, engines typically having more low-end torque, the extreme wear on a frequently used first gear synchroniser ...), meaning it also could only be used for moving away from a stop unless the driver became adept at double-declutching and had a particular need to regularly downshift into the lowest gear.\n\nSome manual transmissions have an extremely low ratio for first gear, called a ''creeper gear'' or ''granny gear''. Such gears are usually not synchronized. This feature is common on pick-up trucks tailored to trailer-towing, farming, or construction-site work. During normal on-road use, the truck is usually driven without using the creeper gear at all, and second gear is used from a standing start. Some off-road vehicles, most particularly the Willys Jeep and its descendants, also had transmissions with \"granny first's\" either as standard or an option, but this function is now more often provided for by a low-range transfer gearbox attached to a normal fully synchronized transmission.\n\n===Non-synchronous===\n{{Main|Non-synchronous transmission}}\nSome commercial applications use non-synchronized manual transmissions that require a skilled operator. Depending on the country, many local, regional, and national laws govern operation of these types of vehicles (''see [[Commercial Driver's License]]''). This class may include [[Semi-trailer truck|commercial]], military, [[tractor|agricultural]], or [[engineering vehicle]]s. Some of these may use combinations of types for multi-purpose functions. An example is a [[power take-off]] (PTO) gear. The non-synchronous transmission type requires an understanding of gear range, torque, engine power, and multi-functional clutch and shifter functions. Also see [[Non-synchronous transmission#Double clutching|Double-clutching]], and [[Non-synchronous transmission#Clutch brake|Clutch-brake]] sections of the main article. [[Float shifting]] is the process of shifting gears without using the clutch.\n\n===Automatic===\n{{Main|Automatic transmission}}\n[[Image:Epicyclic gear ratios.png|thumb|[[Epicyclic gearing]] or planetary gearing as used in an automatic transmission.]]\n\nMost modern North American, and some European and Japanese cars have an [[automatic transmission]] that selects an appropriate gear ratio without any operator intervention. They primarily use [[hydraulics]] to select gears, depending on [[pressure]] exerted by fluid within the transmission assembly. Rather than using a [[clutch]] to engage the transmission, a fluid flywheel, or [[torque converter]] is placed in between the engine and transmission. It is possible for the driver to control the number of gears in use or select reverse, though precise control of which gear is in use may or may not be possible.\n\nAutomatic transmissions are easy to use. However, in the past, some automatic transmissions of this type have had a number of problems; they were complex and expensive, sometimes had reliability problems (which sometimes caused more expenses in repair), have often been less fuel-efficient than their manual counterparts (due to \"slippage\" in the torque converter), and their [[Shift Time|shift time]] was slower than a manual making them uncompetitive for racing. With the advancement of modern automatic transmissions, this has changed.<ref>{{cite web|title=All Pro Transmissions|publisher=All Pro Transmissions|url=https://allpromilwaukee.com/|accessdate=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to improve fuel efficiency of automatic transmissions include the use of [[torque converter]]s that lock up beyond a certain speed or in higher gear ratios, eliminating power loss, and overdrive gears that automatically actuate above certain speeds. In older transmissions, both technologies could be intrusive, when conditions are such that they repeatedly cut in and out as speed and such load factors as grade or wind vary slightly. Current computerized transmissions possess complex programming that both maximizes fuel efficiency and eliminates intrusiveness. This is due mainly to electronic rather than mechanical advances, though improvements in [[Continuously Variable Transmission|CVT]] technology and the use of automatic clutches have also helped. A few cars, including the 2013 Subaru Impreza<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&path=7&year=2013&make=Subaru&model=Impreza%20Wagon%20AWD&srchtyp=ymm|title=2013 Subaru Impreza Wagon AWD|publisher=fueleconomy.gov|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}</ref> and the 2012 model of the Honda Jazz sold in the UK, actually claim marginally better fuel consumption for the CVT version than the manual version.\n\nFor certain applications, the slippage inherent in automatic transmissions can be advantageous. For instance, in [[drag racing]], the automatic transmission allows the car to stop with the engine at a high rpm (the \"stall speed\") to allow for a very quick launch when the brakes are released. In fact, a common modification is to increase the stall speed of the transmission. This is even more advantageous for [[turbocharge]]d engines, where the turbocharger must be kept spinning at high rpm by a large flow of exhaust to maintain the [[boost pressure]] and eliminate the [[turbo lag]] that occurs when the throttle suddenly opens on an idling engine.\n\n===Automated manual===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Formula One]] -->\n{{Main|Semi-automatic transmission|Automated manual transmission}} {{Main|Electrohydraulic manual transmission}} \nA hybrid form of transmission where an integrated (usually electrohydraulic or pneumatic) control system handles manipulation of the [[clutch]] automatically, but the driver can still\u2014and may be required to\u2014take manual control of gear selection. This is sometimes erroneously called \"clutchless manual\", or (especially in older vehicles) a \"semi-automatic\" transmission. It can simply and best be described as a standard manual transmission, with an automated clutch, and automated clutch and gear shift control. Many of these transmissions allow the driver to fully delegate gear shifting choice to the control system, which then effectively acts as if it was a regular automatic transmission. They are generally designed using manual transmission \"internals\", and when used in passenger cars, have synchromesh operated helical constant mesh gear sets.\n\nEarly automated manual and semi-automatic systems used a variety of mechanical and hydraulic systems\u2014including centrifugal clutches, torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches\u2014and control schemes\u2014automatic declutching when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, centrifugal clutches with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.\u2014and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.\n\nMost modern implementations, however, are standard or slightly modified manual transmissions (and very occasionally modified automatics\u2014even including a few cases of CVTs with \"fake\" fixed gear ratios), with servo-controlled clutching and shifting under command of the central engine computer. These are intended as a combined replacement option both for more expensive and less efficient \"normal\" automatic systems, and for drivers who prefer manual shift but are no longer able to operate a clutch, and users are encouraged to leave the shift lever in fully automatic \"drive\" most of the time, only engaging manual-sequential mode for sporty driving or when otherwise strictly necessary.\n\nA [[dual-clutch]] transmission alternately uses two sets of internals, each with its own clutch, so that a \"gearchange\" actually only consists of one clutch engaging as the other disengages\u2014providing a supposedly \"seamless\" shift with no break in (or jarring reuptake of) power transmission. Each clutch's attached shaft carries half of the total input gear complement (with a shared output shaft), including synchronised dog clutch systems that pre-select which of its set of ratios is most likely needed at the next shift, under command of a computerised control system. Specific types of this transmission include: [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]].\n\nThere are also sequential manual transmissions that use the rotation of a drum to switch gears, much like those of a typical fully manual motorcycle.<ref>{{cite web |author= Marshall Brain |title=How Sequential Gearboxes Work |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/sequential-gearbox.htm |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref> These can be designed with a manual or automatic clutch system, and may be found both in automobiles (particularly track and rally racing cars), motorcycles (typically light \"step-thru\" type city utility bikes, e.g., the Honda Super Cub) and quadbikes (often with a separately engaged reversing gear), the latter two normally using a scooter-style centrifugal clutch.\n\n===Bicycle gearing===\n[[Image:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Shimano]] XT rear derailleur on a [[mountain bike]]]] \n{{Main|Bicycle gearing|Derailleur gears|Hub gear}}\n[[Bicycle]]s usually have a system for selecting different gear ratios. There are two main types: [[derailleur gears]] and [[hub gears]]. The derailleur type is the most common, and the most visible, using [[sprocket]] gears. Typically there are several gears available on the rear sprocket assembly, attached to the rear wheel. A few more sprockets are usually added to the front assembly as well. Multiplying the number of sprocket gears in front by the number to the rear gives the number of gear ratios, often called \"speeds\".\n\nHub gears use [[epicyclic gearing]] and are enclosed within the [[axle]] of the rear wheel. Because of the small space, they typically offer fewer different speeds, although at least one has reached [[Rohloff Speedhub|14 gear ratios]] and Fallbrook Technologies manufactures a [[NuVinci|transmission]] with technically infinite ratios.<ref name=rohloff14speed>{{cite web|url=http://www.rohloff.de/en/products/index.html |title=Rohloff 14-speed hub |publisher=Rohloff.de |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to fit bicycles with an enclosed gearbox, giving obvious advantages for better lubrication, dirt-sealing and shifting. These have usually been in conjunction with a shaft drive, as a gearbox with a traditional chain would (like the hub gear) still have many of the derailleur's disadvantages for an exposed chain. Bicycle gearboxes are enclosed in a box replacing the traditional [[bottom bracket]]. The requirement for a modified frame has been a serious drawback to their adoption. One of the most recent attempts to provide a gearbox for bicycles is the 18 speed Pinion P1.18.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Pinion sealed gearbox offers an alternative to those darn derailleurs\n  |date=13 March 2013\n  |author=Ben Coxworth\n  |publisher=Gizmag\n  |url=http://www.gizmag.com/pinion-p118-sealed-gearbox/26640/\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Pinion P1.18 Gearbox: First Ride \n  |date=6 June 2012\n  |author=Matt Wragg\n  |publisher=Pinkbike\n  |url=http://www.pinkbike.com/news/Pinion-Gearbox-First-Ride.html\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n  |title=The Gearmakers\n  |publisher=Pinion \n  |url=http://pinion.eu/en/ \n  |accessdate=2014-04-29\n}}</ref> This gives an enclosed gearbox, but still a traditional chain. When fitted to a rear suspension bike, it also retains a derailleur-like jockey cage chain tensioner, although without the derailleur's low ground clearance.\n\nCauses for failure of bicycle gearing include: worn teeth, damage caused by a faulty chain, damage due to thermal expansion, broken teeth due to excessive pedaling force, interference by foreign objects, and loss of lubrication due to negligence.\n\n==Uncommon types==\n\n===Dual clutch transmission===\n{{Main|Dual clutch transmission}}\nThis arrangement is also sometimes known as a direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox. It seeks to combine the advantages of a conventional manual shift with the qualities of a modern automatic transmission by providing different clutches for odd and even speed selector gears. When changing gear, the engine torque is transferred from one gear to the other continuously, so providing gentle, smooth gear changes without either losing power or jerking the vehicle. Gear selection may be manual, automatic (depending on throttle/speed sensors), or a 'sports' version combining both options.\n\n===Continuously variable===\n{{Main|Continuously variable transmission}}\nThe continuously variable transmission (CVT) is a transmission in which the ratio of the rotational speeds of two shafts, as the input shaft and output shaft of a vehicle or other machine, can be varied continuously within a given range, providing an infinite number of possible ratios. The CVT allows the driver or a computer to select the relationship between the speed of the engine and the speed of the wheels within a continuous range. This can provide even better fuel economy if the engine constantly runs at a single speed. The transmission is, in theory, capable of a better user experience, without the rise and fall in speed of an engine, and the jerk felt when changing gears poorly.\n\nCVTs are increasingly found on small cars, and especially high-gas-mileage or [[hybrid car|hybrid]] vehicles. On these platforms, the torque is limited because the [[electric motor]] can provide torque without changing the speed of the engine. By leaving the engine running at the rate that generates the best gas mileage for the given operating conditions, overall mileage can be improved over a system with a smaller number of fixed gears, where the system may be operating at peak efficiency only for a small range of speeds. \nCVTs are also found in agricultural equipment; due to the high-torque nature of these vehicles, mechanical gears are integrated to provide tractive force at high speeds. The system is similar to that of a hydrostatic gearbox, and at 'inching speeds' relies entirely on hydrostatic drive. German tractor manufacturer [[Fendt]] pioneered the technology, developing its 'Vario [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_-LL0sCT-k]' transmission.\n\n===Infinitely variable===\nThe IVT is a specific type of CVT that includes not only an infinite number of gear ''ratios'', but an \"infinite\" ''range'' as well. This is a [[wiktionary:turn of phrase|turn of phrase]], it actually refers to CVTs that are able to include a \"zero ratio\", where the input shaft can turn without any motion of the output shaft while remaining in gear. The gear ratio in that case is not \"infinite\" but is instead \"undefined\".\n\nMost (if not all) IVTs result from the combination of a CVT with an epicyclic gear system with a fixed ratio. The combination of the fixed ratio of the epicyclic gear with a specific matching ratio in the CVT side results in zero output. For instance, consider a transmission with an epicyclic gear set to 1:\u22121 gear ratio; a 1:1 reverse gear. When the CVT side is set to 1:1 the two ratios add up to zero output. The IVT is always engaged, even during its zero output. When the CVT is set to higher values it operates conventionally, with increasing forward ratios.\n\nIn practice, the epicyclic gear may be set to the lowest possible ratio of the CVT, if reversing is not needed or is handled through other means. Reversing can be incorporated by setting the epicyclic gear ratio somewhat higher than the lowest ratio of the CVT, providing a range of reverse ratios.\n\n===Electric variable===\nThe Electric Variable Transmission (EVT) combines a transmission with an electric motor to provide the illusion of a single CVT. In the common implementation, a gasoline engine is connected to a traditional transmission, which is in turn connected to an epicyclic gear system's planet carrier. An electric motor/generator is connected to the central \"sun\" gear, which is normally un-driven in typical epicyclic systems. Both sources of power can be fed into the transmission's output at the same time, splitting power between them. In common examples, between one-quarter and half of the engine's power can be fed into the sun gear. Depending on the implementation, the transmission in front of the epicyclic system may be greatly simplified, or eliminated completely. EVTs are capable of continuously modulating output/input speed ratios like mechanical CVTs, but offer the distinct benefit of being able to also apply power from two different sources to one output, as well as potentially reducing overall complexity dramatically.\n\nIn typical implementations, the gear ratio of the transmission and epicyclic system are set to the ratio of the common driving conditions, say highway speed for a car, or city speeds for a bus. When the driver presses on the gas, the associated electronics interpret the pedal position and immediately set the gasoline engine to the RPM that provides the best gas mileage for that setting. As the gear ratio is normally set far from the maximum torque point, this set-up would normally result in very poor acceleration. Unlike gasoline engines, electric motors offer efficient torque across a wide selection of RPM, and are especially effective at low settings where the gasoline engine is inefficient. By varying the electrical load or supply on the motor attached to the sun gear, additional torque can be provided to make up for the low torque output from the engine. As the vehicle accelerates, the power to the motor is reduced and eventually ended, providing the illusion of a CVT.\n\nThe canonical example of the EVT is Toyota's [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]]. This implementation has no conventional transmission, and the sun gear always receives 28% of the torque from the engine. This power can be used to operate any electrical loads in the vehicle, recharging the batteries, powering the entertainment system, or running the air conditioning system. Any residual power is then fed back into a second motor that powers the output of the drivetrain directly. At highway speeds this additional generator/motor pathway is less efficient than simply powering the wheels directly. However, during acceleration, the electrical path is much more efficient than an engine operating so far from its torque point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prius.ecrostech.com/original/Understanding/ContinuouslyVariableTransmission.htm |title=The Prius 'Continuously Variable Transmission' |publisher=Prius.ecrostech.com |date=2001-10-10 |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> GM uses a similar system in the Allison Bus hybrid powertrains and the Tahoe and Yukon pick-up trucks, but these use a two-speed transmission in front of the epicyclic system, and the sun gear receives close to half the total power.\n\n==Non-direct==\n\n===Electric===\n{{main|Diesel-electric transmission}}\nElectric transmissions convert the mechanical power of the engine(s) to electricity with [[electric generator]]s and convert it back to mechanical power with [[electric motor]]s. Electrical or electronic [[adjustable-speed drive]] control systems are used to control the speed and torque of the motors. If the generators are driven by [[turbine]]s, such arrangements are called [[turbo-electric transmission]]. Likewise installations powered by [[diesel-engine]]s are called diesel-electric.\n\nDiesel-electric arrangements are used on many railway locomotives, ships, large [[mining]] trucks, and some [[bulldozers]]. In these cases, each driven wheel is equipped with its own electric motor, which can be fed varying electrical power to provide any required torque or power output for each wheel independently. This produces a much simpler solution for multiple driven wheels in very large vehicles, where drive shafts would be much larger or heavier than the electrical cable that can provide the same amount of power. It also improves the ability to allow different wheels to run at different speeds, which is useful for steered wheels in large construction vehicles.\n\n===Hydrostatic===\n:''See also [[Hydrostatic transmission|Continuously variable transmission > Hydrostatic CVTs]]''\nHydrostatic transmissions transmit all power hydraulically, using the components of [[hydraulic machinery]]. They are similar to electrical transmissions, but use hydraulic fluid as the power distribution system rather than electricity.\n\nThe transmission input drive is a central hydraulic pump and final drive unit(s) is/are a hydraulic motor, or hydraulic cylinder (see: ''[[swashplate]]''). Both components can be placed physically far apart on the machine, being connected only by flexible hoses. Hydrostatic drive systems are used on excavators, lawn tractors, forklifts, winch drive systems, heavy lift equipment, agricultural machinery, earth-moving equipment, etc. An arrangement for [http://pigeonsnest.co.uk/stuff/trilink/trilink.html motor-vehicle transmission] was probably used on the Ferguson ''[[formula one|F-1]]'' [[Ferguson P99|P99]] racing car in about 1961.\n\nThe [[Human Friendly Transmission]] of the [[Honda DN-01]] is hydrostatic.\n\n===Hydrodynamic===\nIf the hydraulic pump or hydraulic motor make use of the [[Hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] effects of the fluid flow, i.e. pressure due to a change in the fluid's momentum as it flows through vanes in a turbine. The pump and motor usually consist of rotating vanes without seals and are typically placed in proximity. The transmission ratio can be made to vary by means of additional rotating vanes, an effect similar to varying the pitch of an airplane [[Controllable pitch propeller|propeller]].\n\nThe [[torque converter]] in most automotive automatic transmissions is, in itself, a hydrodynamic transmission. Hydrodynamic transmissions are used in many passenger rail vehicles, those that are not using electrical transmissions. In this application the advantage of smooth power delivery may outweigh the reduced efficiency caused by turbulence energy losses in the fluid.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bearing reducer]]\n*[[Chain drive]]\n*[[Clutch]]\n*[[Epicyclic gearing]]\n*[[Hydraulic transmission (disambiguation)|Hydraulic transmission]]\n*[[Manual transmission]]\n*[[Motorcycle transmission]]\n*[[Transfer case]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=Automotive transmissions : fundamentals, selection, design and application |publisher=Springer|author1=Harald Naunheimer |author2=Peter Fietkau |author3=G Lechner|year=2011|edition=2nd|isbn=9783642162138|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16214-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|transmission}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Transmissions}}\n* {{Britannica|602934|Transmission (engineering)}}\n* {{YouTube|vOo3TLgL0kM|Manual Transmission Operation}} WeberAuto 2012-09-23\n*[https://www.agma.org/ American Gear Manufacturers Association]\n*[https://universalmotorcarslv.com/our-services/transmission-repair/ Universal Motorcars - Transmission Repair]\n{{Gears}}\n{{Powertrain}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transmission (Mechanics)}}\n[[Category:Mechanical power transmission| ]]\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n", "name_user": "Davism0703", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAutomated manual", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)"}

In 2015, eight of Noskowiak\u2019s works were on view at the Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania. The exhibition, named Weston's Women, only acknowledges Noskowiaks and other female artists in their relation to Weston. Her archives, including 494 prints, hundreds of negatives and many letters to Edward Weston, are now housed at the [[Center for Creative Photography]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last1=Rosenblum |first1=Naomi |title=A history of women photographers |date=2014 |publisher=Abbeville |location=New York |isbn=9780789212245}}\n* {{cite book|last1=University of Arizona.
