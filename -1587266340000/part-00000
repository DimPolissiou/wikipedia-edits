The mines attracted large numbers of settlers, particularly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. Feuds began between the different groups of Chinese immigrants and became so bitter that in the early 1870s, the British intervened and assumed control of the town.<ref>See pages 86\u201388, Chapter 8 Malaysian Confrontations, Send A Gunboat: The Victorian Navy and Supremacy at Sea, 1854\u20131904, by Antony Preston & John Major, Conway, an imprint of Anova Books Ltd, London, UK, 2007 Revised Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-85177-923-2}}</ref> Taiping was the capital for the districts of [[Larut, Matang and Selama]] in Perak. Before 1937, Taiping was the capital of the state of Perak and the centre of a long and drawn out war resulting in a change of rulership for the state. Taiping used to be known as Klian Pauh \u2013 ''Klian'' meaning mine while ''Pauh'' is a type of small mango.\n\n[[File:TaipingTown.PNG|thumb|left|Taiping town.]]\n[[File:Taipingperak.JPG|thumb|left|The colonial-era Larut, Matang and Selama Land and District Office.]]\n[[File:St. George's Institution, Malaysia 2.jpg|thumb|[[St. George's Institution, Malaysia|St. George's Institution]], a colonial boys' school established in 1915.]]\nLong Jaafar has been historically credited with the discovery of tin in Larut in 1848. According to legend, Long Jaafar had an elephant named Larut and he used to take this elephant with him when journeying between [[Bukit Gantang]] and Lubok Merbau. One day the elephant went missing and when the elephant was eventually found three days later Long Jaafar noticed tin ore embedded in the mud that was on the elephant's legs. It is said that this was how Larut got its name.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nEventually in 1850, Larut district was bestowed upon Long Jaafar by Raja Muda Ngah Ali and the Chiefs of Perak: the Temenggong, Panglima Bukit Gantang, Panglima Kinta, Syahbandar and Seri Adika Raja. Some time later, the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, died in 1857 and a series of succession disputes ensued. Unhappy with the abuse and favouritism of various royalties, rival Malay camps took sides with one or the other of the two great Chinese secret societies present in there at the time. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nLong Jaafar established and developed his administrative centre at [[Bukit Gantang]] and made Kuala Sungai Limau at Trong the principal harbour of the Larut Settlement. In 1857 Long Jaafar was succeeded by his son Ngah Ibrahim. Sultan Jaffar Muazzam Shah presented an acknowledgement letter to Ngah Ibrahim on 24 May 1858. This letter was signed by Sultan Jaffar, Raja Muda Ngah Ali and the Raja Bendahara of Perak. In the time of [[Ngah Ibrahim]] the Chinese increased in number and by early 1860 two large groups were formed by the Chinese, the \"Five Associations\" whose members worked in the mines of Klian Pauh and the \"Four Associations\" whose members worked in the mines of [[Kamunting|Klian Baharu]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nMining rights were given to the Hakka \"Five Associations\" or Go-Kuan (\u4e94\u9928 or \u4e94\u7fa4) and the Cantonese \"Four Associations\" or Si-Kuan (\u56db\u9928). [[Chung Keng Quee]] (\u912d\u666f\u8cb4) was leader of the Hakka Go-Kuan and the Hai San (\u6d77\u5c71) society that they belonged to, and began to operate his tin mines in Larut in 1860. Larut was destined to be plagued by four major wars between members of both the Cantonese Go-Kuan [[Ghee Hin]] Society (\u7fa9\u8208\u79c1\u6703\u9ee8) and the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] society. Many [[Hakka people|Hakka]] had fled China when the [[Taiping Rebellion]] broke out there and found work in the mines of [[Chung Keng Quee]] establishing his position over the mining area in Larut as leader of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] from 1860 to 1884.\n\nThe capital of Perak was moved from Bandar Baru (New Town) to Taiping after Datok Maharaja Lela assassinated the first [[British Resident]] of Perak Mr. [[James Wheeler Woodford Birch]] at [[Pasir Salak]] in 1875. In 1937, the capital of Perak was moved from Taiping to [[Ipoh]].\n\nThe town's mining industry continued to thrive; the country's first railway was built to transport tin from Taiping to Port Weld (now known as Kuala Sepetang) at the coast for export. The first train in Malaysia took its schedule on 1 June 1885.<ref>The Straits Times, 31 August 1931, Page 6\n</ref> {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nBy 1900, an English language school,<ref>Straits Times Weekly Issue, 12 November 1890, Page 3</ref> a newspaper,<ref>The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884\u20131942), 28 April 1894, Page 11</ref> and the Perak Museum (the oldest in Malaysia) had been established.<ref>The Straits Times, 6 March 1889, Page 2</ref>\n\nAlthough Taiping's economy declined with the dwindling tin deposits, tin mining still remains an important industry in the area as rubber and rice.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Taiping 2.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Taiping City]]\n[[File:taiping-night-view.jpg|thumb|Night view of Taiping City]]\nTaiping is situated on a plain to the west of the [[Bintang Mountains]].

The mines attracted large numbers of settlers, particularly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. Feuds began between the different groups of Chinese immigrants and became so bitter that in the early 1870s, the British intervened and assumed control of the town.<ref>See pages 86\u201388, Chapter 8 Malaysian Confrontations, Send A Gunboat: The Victorian Navy and Supremacy at Sea, 1854\u20131904, by Antony Preston & John Major, Conway, an imprint of Anova Books Ltd, London, UK, 2007 Revised Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-85177-923-2}}</ref> Taiping was the capital for the districts of [[Larut, Matang and Selama]] in Perak. Before 1937, Taiping was the capital of the state of Perak and the centre of a long and drawn out war resulting in a change of rulership for the state. Taiping used to be known as Klian Pauh \u2013 ''Klian'' meaning mine while ''Pauh'' is a type of small mango.\n\n[[File:TaipingTown.PNG|thumb|left|Taiping town.]]\n[[File:Taipingperak.JPG|thumb|left|The colonial-era Larut, Matang and Selama Land and District Office.]]\n[[File:St. George's Institution, Malaysia 2.jpg|thumb|[[St. George's Institution, Malaysia|St. George's Institution]], a colonial boys' school established in 1915.]]\nLong Jaafar has been historically credited with the discovery of tin in Larut in 1848. According to legend, Long Jaafar had an elephant named Larut and he used to take this elephant with him when journeying between [[Bukit Gantang]] and Lubok Merbau. One day the elephant went missing and when the elephant was eventually found three days later Long Jaafar noticed tin ore embedded in the mud that was on the elephant's legs. It is said that this was how Larut got its name.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nEventually in 1850, Larut district was bestowed upon Long Jaafar by Raja Muda Ngah Ali and the Chiefs of Perak: the Temenggong, Panglima Bukit Gantang, Panglima Kinta, Syahbandar and Seri Adika Raja. Some time later, the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, died in 1857 and a series of succession disputes ensued. Unhappy with the abuse and favouritism of various royalties, rival Malay camps took sides with one or the other of the two great Chinese secret societies present in there at the time. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nLong Jaafar established and developed his administrative centre at [[Bukit Gantang]] and made Kuala Sungai Limau at Trong the principal harbour of the Larut Settlement. In 1857 Long Jaafar was succeeded by his son Ngah Ibrahim. Sultan Jaffar Muazzam Shah presented an acknowledgement letter to Ngah Ibrahim on 24 May 1858. This letter was signed by Sultan Jaffar, Raja Muda Ngah Ali and the Raja Bendahara of Perak. In the time of [[Ngah Ibrahim]] the Chinese increased in number and by early 1860 two large groups were formed by the Chinese, the \"Five Associations\" whose members worked in the mines of Klian Pauh and the \"Four Associations\" whose members worked in the mines of [[Kamunting|Klian Baharu]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nMining rights were given to the Hakka \"Five Associations\" or Go-Kuan (\u4e94\u9928 or \u4e94\u7fa4) and the Cantonese \"Four Associations\" or Si-Kuan (\u56db\u9928). [[Chung Keng Quee]] (\u912d\u666f\u8cb4) was leader of the Hakka Go-Kuan and the Hai San (\u6d77\u5c71) society that they belonged to, and began to operate his tin mines in Larut in 1860. Larut was destined to be plagued by four major wars between members of both the Cantonese Go-Kuan [[Ghee Hin]] Society (\u7fa9\u8208\u79c1\u6703\u9ee8) and the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] society. Many [[Hakka people|Hakka]] had fled China when the [[Taiping Rebellion]] broke out there and found work in the mines of [[Chung Keng Quee]] establishing his position over the mining area in Larut as leader of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] from 1860 to 1884.\n\nThe capital of Perak was moved from Bandar Baru (New Town) to Taiping after Datok Maharaja Lela assassinated the first [[British Resident]] of Perak Mr. [[James Wheeler Woodford Birch]] at [[Pasir Salak]] in 1875. In 1937, the capital of Perak was moved from Taiping to [[Ipoh]].\n\nThe town's mining industry continued to thrive; the country's first railway was built to transport tin from Taiping to Port Weld (now known as Kuala Sepetang) at the coast for export. The first train in Malaysia took its schedule on 1 June 1885.<ref>The Straits Times, 31 August 1931, Page 6\n</ref> {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nBy 1900, an English language school,<ref>Straits Times Weekly Issue, 12 November 1890, Page 3</ref> a newspaper,<ref>The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884\u20131942), 28 April 1894, Page 11</ref> and the Perak Museum (the oldest in Malaysia) had been established.<ref>The Straits Times, 6 March 1889, Page 2</ref>\n\nAlthough Taiping's economy declined with the dwindling tin deposits, tin mining still remains an important industry in the area as rubber and rice.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Taiping 2.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Taiping City]]\nTaiping is situated on a plain to the west of the [[Bintang Mountains]].

The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (Shura yi Nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121)\n\n===1989===\nShortly before Imam Khomeini's death a change was made in the constitution allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader.

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B.

According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the [[Iranian Revolution]] because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful.

The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (Shura yi Nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121)\n\n===1989===\nShortly before Imam Khomeini's death a change was made in the constitution allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader. Khomeini had a falling out with his successor [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri]] who disapproved of human rights abuses by the Islamic Republic<ref>Keddie, Nikki R.; [[Yann Richard]] (2003).

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B. Tauris, 1997  p.73-75</ref> \"Khomeini is supposed to have written a letter to the Chairman of the assembly of Leadership Experts on 29.4.89 in which he emphasised that he had always been of the opinion that the marja'iyat was not a requirement for the office of leader.<ref name=asghar.p73/>\n\n==Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (Velayat-e faghih)==\n{{Main|Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist}}\n[[File:Ali Khamenei met with Hajj authorities 2018 09.jpg|thumb|Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] met with [[Hajj]] authorities, 2018]]\nThe constitution of Iran combines concepts of both [[democracy]] and [[theocracy]], theocracy in the form of Khomeini's concept of ''vilayat-e faqih'' (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist), as expressed in the ''Islamic Republic''.  According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the [[Iranian Revolution]] because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful. He became a very popular role model for [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] and hoped for the Iranian Revolution to be the first step to a much larger Islamic revolution, transcending Shia Islam, in the same way that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] wanted [[Russian Revolution|their revolution]] to be a world revolution, not just a [[Russia|Russian]] one.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W.
