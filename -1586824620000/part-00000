Collectively, the machines are Honda's most prolific sellers in the ATC market, and one of the most recognizable ATC's available.\n\nAll ATC200 models are equipped with a 192cc 4-Stroke Air-cooled Horizontal OHV engine.

Honda produced this ATC after market research determined that their products were being used for commercial and agricultural endeavors, and tailored the machine for those needs.\n\nATC200E \"Big Red\" came with a 5-speed  Auto-clutch transmission, with secondary dual-range (known as a \"Sub-Mission\" in Advertising) and chain final drive. It also featured front suspension, but maintained a rigid rear. This was the natural evolution of the prior atcs used for commercial applications, and is designed for utilitarian work. It also introduced Electric starting, and front and rear racks were standard equipment.\n\nATC200ES \"Big Red\",  produced in 1985, was a further evolution of the ATC200E, adding a reverse gear, rear suspension and shaft final drive. Power output was via a 5-speed  Auto-clutch transmission, but was now a single range. It is a utility ATC w/Electric starting, and front and rear racks were again standard equipment.\n\nThe ATC200M was released in 1984, providing front suspension, a 5-speed Auto-clutch single range transmission and Chain final drive. Electric Start was also a selling point. This is a mid-range model, intended to appeal to recreational riders, such as campers, hunters and fisherman. It came standard with a rear rack for cargo.\n\nThe ATC200S, produced from 1984-1986 was the 200cc line base-model, similar to the ATC200M but traded Electric start for shaft drive, and did not come standard with racks. It did have the same 5-speed Auto-clutch transmission.\n\nThe ATC200X, being offered from 1983\u20131987, is the longest consistently offered model in the 200cc line. It is also the most unique, as it was designed for sport riding. It was used for the 200cc class of ATC racing, arguable the most popular class raced in the United States.\n\nWhile the engine is the same as the recreation/utiity models, it features subtle tuning changes, kick starting, a unique 5-speed Manual clutch transmission and Chain final drive. It has no contingencies for factory racks, and features a sport tuned full suspension (Telescopic forks front/ Monoshock rear), the only model, besides the utilitarian set-up on the 200ES \"Big Red\", to do so.

Electric Start was also a selling point. This is a mid-range model, intended to appeal to recreational riders, such as campers, hunters and fisherman. It came standard with a rear rack for cargo. \n\nThe ATC200S, produced from 1984-1986 was the 200cc line base-model, similar to the ATC200M but traded Electric start for shaft drive, and did not come standard with racks. It did have the same 5-speed Auto-clutch transmission.\n\nThe ATC200X, being offered from 1983-1987, is the longest consistantly offered model in the 200cc line. It is also the most unique, as it was designed for sport riding. It was used for the 200cc class of ATC racing, arguable the most popular class raced in the United States.  \n\nWhile the engine is the same as the recreation/utiity models, it features subtle tuning changes, kick starting, a unique 5-speed Manual clutch transmission and Chain final drive. It has no contingencies for factory racks, and features a sport tuned full suspension (Telescopic forks front/ Monoshock rear), the only model, besides the utilitarian set-up on the 200ES \"Big Red\", to do so. It is also the only 200cc model to feature disc brakes, equipped both front and rear.\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, addeduncategorisedtags,typo(s) fixed: recieved \u2192 received, consistantly \u2192 consistently", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_ATC200"}
