In their form {{as of|2011|11|lc=y}}, Pentium processors are considered entry-level products that Intel rates as \"two stars\",<ref>{{cite web|title= Processor Rating|url=http://www.intel.com/en_uk/consumer/products/processors/ratings.htm |publisher=Intel| place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] |access-date=November 21, 2011}}</ref> meaning that they are above the low-end [[Intel Atom|Atom]] and [[Celeron]] series, but below the faster [[Intel Core]] lineup, and workstation [[Xeon]] series.\n\n[[File:Pentium 1993.png|thumb|Pentium sticker, around 1993]]\n\n{{As of|2017}}, Pentium processors have little more than their name in common with earlier Pentiums, which were Intel's flagship processor for over a decade until the introduction of the [[Intel Core]] line in 2006. They are based on both the architecture used in [[Intel Atom|Atom]] and that of Core processors. In the case of Atom architectures, Pentiums are the highest performance implementations of the architecture. Pentium processors with Core architectures prior to 2017 were distinguished from the faster, higher-end i-series processors by lower [[clock rate]]s and disabling some features, such as [[hyper-threading]], [[Intel VT|virtualization]] and sometimes L3 [[CPU cache|cache]].\n\nThe name Pentium is originally derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''penta'' (''\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1''), meaning \"five\", a reference to the prior numeric naming convention of Intel's 80x86 processors (8086\u201380486), with the [[Latin]] ending ''[[-ium]]''.\n\nIn 2017, Intel split Pentium into two line-ups. Pentium Silver aiming for low-power devices and shares architecture with Atom and Celeron. Pentium Gold aiming for entry-level desktop and using existing architecture, such as [[Kaby Lake]] or [[Coffee Lake]].\n\n==Overview==\n\n{{See also|List of Intel Pentium microprocessors}}\nDuring development, Intel generally identifies processors with [[codename]]s, such as ''Prescott'', ''Willamette'', ''Coppermine'', ''Katmai'', ''Klamath'', or ''Deschutes''.

Dual-core versions of the Pentium M were developed under the code name ''[[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]]'' and sold under the marketing names ''[[Core Duo]]'' and ''[[Pentium Dual-Core]]''. Unlike Pentium D, it integrated both cores on one chip. From this point, the [[Intel Core]] brand name was used for the mainstream Intel processors, and the Pentium brand became a low-end version between Celeron and Core. All Pentium M based designs including Yonah are for the mobile market.\n\n====Pentium M====\n{{Main|Pentium M|List of Intel Pentium M microprocessors}}\n{| class=wikitable\n! Core !!

The FSB frequency is increased from 667&nbsp;MHz to 800&nbsp;MHz, and the voltage is lowered. Intel released the first Penryn Core, the Pentium T4200, in December 2008. In June 2009, Intel released the first single-core processor to use the Pentium name, a [[Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage]] (CULV) Penryn core named Pentium SU2700.\n\nIn September 2009, Intel introduced the Pentium SU4000 series together with the Celeron SU2000 and Core 2 Duo SU7000 series, which are dual-core CULV processors based on Penryn-3M and using 800&nbsp;MHz FSB. The Pentium SU4000 series has 2 MB L2 cache but is otherwise basically identical to the other two lines.\n\n===Nehalem microarchitecture based===\nThe [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] microarchitecture was introduced in late 2008 as a successor to the Core microarchitecture, and in early 2010, a new ''Pentium'' G6950 processor based on the ''[[Clarkdale (microprocessor)|Clarkdale]]'' design was introduced based on the ''[[Westmere (CPU)|Westmere]]'' refresh of Nehalem, which were followed by the mobile P6xxx based on [[Arrandale (microprocessor)|Arrandale]] a few months later.\n\n{{Main|List of Intel Pentium microprocessors}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

They are based on both the architecture used in [[Intel Atom|Atom]] and that of Core processors. In the case of Atom architectures, Pentiums are the highest performance implementations of the architecture. Pentium processors with Core architectures prior to 2017 were distinguished from the faster, higher-end i-series processors by lower [[clock rate]]s and disabling some features, such as [[hyper-threading]], [[Intel VT|virtualization]] and sometimes L3 [[CPU cache|cache]].\n\nThe name Pentium is originally derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''penta'' (''\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1''), meaning \"five\", a reference to the prior numeric naming convention of Intel's 80x86 processors (8086\u201380486), with the [[Latin]] ending ''[[-ium]]''.\n\nIn 2017, Intel split Pentium into two line-ups.

The FSB frequency is increased from 667&nbsp;MHz to 800&nbsp;MHz, and the voltage is lowered. Intel released the first Penryn Core, the Pentium T4200, in December 2008. In June 2009, Intel released the first single-core processor to use the Pentium name, a [[Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage]] (CULV) Penryn core named Pentium SU2700.\n\nIn September 2009, Intel introduced the Pentium SU4000 series together with the Celeron SU2000 and Core 2 Duo SU7000 series, which are dual-core CULV processors based on Penryn-3M and using 800&nbsp;MHz FSB. The Pentium SU4000 series has 2 MB L2 cache but is otherwise basically identical to the other two lines.\n\n===Nehalem microarchitecture based===\nThe [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] microarchitecture was introduced in late 2008 as a successor to the Core microarchitecture, and in early 2010, a new ''Pentium'' G6950 processor based on the ''[[Clarkdale (microprocessor)|Clarkdale]]'' design was introduced based on the ''[[Westmere (CPU)|Westmere]]'' refresh of Nehalem, which were followed by the mobile P6xxx based on [[Arrandale (microprocessor)|Arrandale]] a few months later.\n\n{{Main|List of Intel Pentium microprocessors}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

Valesius reburied the altar after three days of games. Sacrifices were offered to this altar during the [[Secular games|''Ludi Saeculares'']] or ''Ludi Tarentini''.

However, [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s remark is a clear example of ''[[interpretatio Romana]]'': what Caesar meant was that the Gauls all claimed descent from a Gaulish god that reminded him of the Roman D\u012bs Pater, a [[scholia]] on the [[Pharsalia]] equates Dis Pater with [[Taranis]], the chief sky deity in the [[Gauls|Gaulish religion]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&id=Rf8HAQAAIAAJ&dq|title=\u00c9tudes celtiques|last=Vendryes|first=Joseph|date=1958|publisher=Les Belles Lettres|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=57|language=fr}}</ref> Different possible candidates exist for this role in [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion]], such as Gaulish [[Sucellus]], Irish [[Donn]] and Welsh [[Beli Mawr]], among others.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''D\u012bs'' is a contraction of the adjective ''d\u012bves'' ('wealthy, rich'), probably derived from Latin ''d\u012bvus, d\u012bus'' ('godlike, divine') via the form ''*deui-ot'' or ''*deui-et'' ('who is like the gods, protected by the gods').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=|pp=173\u2013174}}<ref>Kurt Latte, ''R\u00f6mische Religionsgeschichte'', part 5, vol. 4 of ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft'', C.H.Beck, 1976, {{ISBN|978-3-406-01374-4}}, p. 247.</ref> The occurrence of the deity D\u012bs together with ''Pater'' ('father') may be due to association with ''Di(e)spiter'' ([[Jupiter]]).{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\n[[Cicero]] gave a similar etymology in ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', suggesting the meaning 'father of riches', and comparing the deity to the Greek name [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] (''Plouton'', \u03a0\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd), meaning \"the rich one\", a title bestowed upon the Greek god [[Hades]].\n\n==Mythology==\n\nD\u012bs Pater eventually became associated with death and the [[underworld]] because mineral wealth such as gems and precious metals came from underground, wherein lies the realm of the dead, i.e. [[Hades]]' ([[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto's]]) domain. \n\nIn being conflated with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], D\u012bs Pater took on some of the latter's [[Greek mythology|mythological]] attributes, being one of the three sons of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] (Greek [[Cronus]]) and [[Ops]] (Greek [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]), along with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Greek [[Zeus]]) and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] (Greek [[Poseidon]]).

Every hundred years, a festival was celebrated in his name. According to legend, a round marble altar, ''Altar of D\u012bs Pater and Proserpina'' ({{lang-la|Ara Ditis Patris et Proserpinae}}), was miraculously discovered by the servants of a [[Sabine]] called Valesius, the ancestor of the first [[consul]]. The servants were digging in the [[Tarentum (Campus Martius)|Tarentum]] on the edge of the [[Campus Martius]] to lay foundations following instructions given to Valesius's children in dreams, when they found the altar {{convert|20|ft|0}} underground. Valesius reburied the altar after three days of games. Sacrifices were offered to this altar during the [[Secular games|''Ludi Saeculares'']] or ''Ludi Tarentini''. It may have been uncovered for each occasion of the games, to be reburied afterwards, a clearly [[chthonic]] tradition of worship. It was rediscovered in 1886&ndash;87 beneath the Corso Vittorio Emanuele in [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nash|title=Pictorial Dictionary of Ancient Rome Volume 1| page=57| publisher=London: A.
