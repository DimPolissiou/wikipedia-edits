The character is drawn from the original [[Japan]]ese [[Tiger Mask]] [[anime]]. The trademark of the character is to always wear a mask and tights in an almost identical design to that of his perennial rival only with entirely black and silver coloring.\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to the storyline set forth by the original anime, Black Tiger is a wrestler trained and sent by a [[Yakuza]]-like organisation called the Tiger's Cave. The Tiger's Cave desire vengeance upon the wrestler Tiger Mask, a former trainee of theirs, for publicly turning his back on them and no longer paying them monetary tributes. With the anime's protagonist translated by [[Antonio Inoki]] to actual NJPW wrestling events (in the form of [[Satoru Sayama]]) it was perhaps inevitable that his arch-enemy would also appear in the promotion.\n\nThe wrestlers portraying Black Tiger have always been [[gaijin]], somewhat of a throwback to the days in which non-Japanese were portrayed as heels to fight against national heroes such as [[Rikid\u014dzan]] to promote national pride after [[World War II]], paralleling the way American promotions would often portray wrestlers depicted as, or indeed actually being from, foreign countries as villains pitted against American-born heroes. In other countries this has varied. Black Tiger IV was a member of [[Team Japan]] during the [[TNA 2006 World X-Cup Tournament]] and during his [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|CMLL]] career Black Tiger III was overtly portrayed as being Japanese.\n\n==Incarnations of Black Tiger==\n\n===Black Tiger I===\n[[Mark Rocco|Mark \"Rollerball\" Rocco]], an established British wrestler, was the first to assume the persona in 1982 to oppose the original Tiger Mask, [[Satoru Sayama]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Pope|first=Kristian|title=Tuff Stuff Professional Wrestling Field Guide: Legend and Lore|year=2005|publisher=KP Books|location=Iola, WI|isbn=0-89689-267-0|page=373}}</ref><ref name=life92>Guerrero, Eddie.

Sayama left NJPW in 1983 and the rights to Tiger Mask were purchased by [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] the following year for the use of [[Mitsuharu Misawa]]. AJPW were not to create a Black Tiger counterpart. Rocco continued to portray Black Tiger in NJPW until 1990, and has the distinction of being the first man to wrestle as Black Tiger outside Japan, having faced [[George Takano|The Cobra]] at Madison Square Garden in a World Wrestling Federation match on December 28, 1984.\n\n===Black Tiger II===\nIn August 1993 Black Tiger made a return, this time portrayed by [[Eddie Guerrero]].<ref name=life92/> His Tiger Mask rival at this time was [[Koji Kanemoto]]. Kanemoto unmasked in January 1994, while Guerrero was a finalist in the 1994 Super Grade Junior Heavyweight Tag League with [[The Great Sasuke]], came third in the 1994 and 1995 [[Best of the Super Juniors]] tournaments and was victorious in 1996.\n\n===Black Tiger III===\nFollowing the fall of WCW, alumnus [[C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Gonz\u00e1lez]], better known as Mexican star Silver King began wrestling for NJPW through their working relationship with his home promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]. [[Tiger Mask IV]] would not sign with NJPW until early 2003 and the highlight of Black Tiger III's Japanese run would be a failed attempt at the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] alongside his real-life brother [[Dr. Wagner, Jr.]] before he devoted himself full-time to his CMLL career. Gonz\u00e1lez continued to use the Black Tiger name in Mexican independent companies even after CMLL repackaged him as \"El Bronco\" following NJPW unveiling Black Tiger IV in 2005. His final match under the persona came when he lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Mask versus Mask]] match to [[L.A. Park]] on February 4, 2006.<ref name=\"TigerIII\">{{cite news|title=Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = BLack Tiger III|location=[[Mexico]]|id=Tomo I|page=34|date=July 2007|language=Spanish}}</ref> He briefly wrestled under the persona again in 2017, teaming with Black Tiger VII to take on Dr Wagner Jr. and [[El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr.]].\n\n===Black Tiger IV===\nIn 2005 [[Rocky Romero]] debuted as Black Tiger IV by NJPW and immediately thrust into a feud with [[Tiger Mask IV]], facing him for the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] on May 14. He made his debut for [[Ring of Honor]] in America, making him the first Black Tiger to wrestle as Black Tiger in America since Mark Rocco. After winning the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] on August 25 he defeated Tiger Mask for his title on October 8, defending them until losing both to Tiger Mask on February 19, 2006. Black Tiger would join [[Jyushin Thunder Liger]]'s CTU faction and represent NJPW as a member of Team Japan in [[TNA 2006 World X-Cup Tournament|TNA Wrestling's World X-Cup]]. Black Tiger IV returned to New Japan in February 2009, joining [[Great Bash Heel|GBH]] and restarting his feud with Tiger Mask IV. On April 5, 2009, at ''Resolution '09'' Tiger Mask IV defeated Black Tiger IV in a title vs. mask match. After the match Romero removed his mask and then raised the arm of Tiger Mask thus ending his run as Black Tiger.\n\n===Black Tiger V===\nBlack Tiger's fifth Generation (V) arrived in NJPW at Tokyo Dome February 15, 2009, attacking Tiger Mask IV. For the next couple of months, the new Black Tiger disappeared and was replaced at shows by Black Tiger IV. On April 5, 2009, at ''Resolution '09'' after Tiger Mask had defeated Black Tiger IV for the last time, he was once again attacked by the fifth Black Tiger, who gave him a [[Professional wrestling throws#Death Valley driver|Death Valley Driver]] and then unmasked him. On June 20, 2009, at [[Dominion 6.20]], Tiger Mask defeated Black Tiger V in a mask vs. mask match. After the match Black Tiger removed his mask revealing himself as [[Tatsuhito Takaiwa]], breaking the Black Tiger tradition of foreigners under the mask. Takaiwa reprised his role as Black Tiger V in 2011 in [[Toryumon Mexico]], where he lost the mask for the second time on May 14, 2011, to [[\u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/?p=5343|title=Ultimo Dragon gana la mascara Black Tiger V|date=2011-05-15|last=Liz\u00e1rraga|first=Alfonso|accessdate=2011-05-16|work=The Gladiatores|language=Spanish}}</ref> Despite losing his mask twice, Takaiwa continues to make appearances as Black Tiger V.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/103525/|script-title=ja:\u5409\u6c5f\u3068\u9ed2\u864e\u304c\u300c\u3082\u3082\u30af\u30ed\u8ecd\u300d\u7d50\u6210|date=2013-02-13|accessdate=2013-02-13|work=[[Tokyo Sports]]|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n===Black Tiger VI===\nBlack Tiger's sixth generation (VI), [[Tomohiro Ishii]], had the shortest run under the mask.

Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 Pro is the first water-resistant OnePlus phone, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a Sony IMX586 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP Sony IMX471 ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it opts to crop out from the wide sensor. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15

more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 Pro is the first water-resistant OnePlus phone, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a Sony IMX 586 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP Sony IMX 471 ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it opts to crop out from the wide sensor. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of new 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|www.oneplus.com/8}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-bef\n| before = [[OnePlus 7T|OnePlus 7T & 7T Pro]]\n}}\n{{S-ttl\n| title = OnePlus 8 & 8 Pro\n| years = 2020\n}}\n{{S-inc|recent\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{OnePlus|state=collapsed}}\n{{Android smartphones}}\n\n[[Category:OnePlus mobile phones]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) devices]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras]]\n", "name_user": "Ghostofakina", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fmt", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_8"}

It was among the twelve original baronies of Achaea, but was conquered by the [[Byzantine]]s in 1320.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Akova Castle (Gortynia, Greece).jpg|thumb|left|View of the ruins of the Akova Castle.]]\nThe Barony of Akova was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the [[Peloponnese]] by the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]], and was one of the original twelve secular [[feudal barony|baronies]] within the [[Principality of Achaea]]. Along with the [[Barony of Patras]], Akova was one of the two largest and most important baronies of the Principality, with twenty-four knight's fiefs attached to it.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller (1921), pp. 71\u201372</ref><ref>Bon (1969), pp. 104, 394</ref> The barony's capital was the fortress of [[Akova Castle|Akova]] or Mattegrifon (\"Kill-Greek\", \"''Grifon''\" being a French term for the Greeks) built on the mountainous area known in the ''[[Chronicle of the Morea]]'' as [[Mesarea]], separating [[Elis]] from [[Arcadia]] and dominating the upper valley of the [[Alpheios]] river, by the baronial family of de Rosi\u00e8res, of [[County of Burgundy|Burgundian]] origin.<ref name=\"Miller\"/><ref>Bon (1969), pp. 104, 393\u2013394</ref>\n\nThe only known baron of the barony's early period is [[Walter of Rosi\u00e8res]], who is first recorded in a list of fief folders in 1228/30 and by the ''Chronicle'' as having died childless, ca. 1273. To fill the period down to 1209, [[Karl Hopf]] hypothesized that there were two barons, father and son, named Walter, but, as A. Bon points out, the existence of a now-forgotten baron before 1228/30 is equally possible.<ref>Bon (1969), pp. 104\u2013105, 394</ref> Walter's sole heir was [[Margaret of Passavant]], his sister's daughter by [[John of Nully]], [[Baron of Passavant]]. Margaret had resided in [[Constantinople]] as a hostage to the [[Byzantine]] court since 1262, and on her return to the Principality, she tried to claim her inheritance but was unable to do so, since by Achaean feudal law, any heir had to bring his claim within at least two years and two days from the death of the last holder, or the claim was forfeit. As Margaret had delayed her arrival, Prince [[William II of Villehardouin]] had already confiscated the Barony of Akova (Passavant having been lost to the Byzantines). Margaret's claims became the subject of a celebrated legal dispute, which was abjudicated in a parliament held at [[Glarentsa]], probably in 1276. Even though she married the influential [[John of Saint Omer]] to promote her claims, the parliament found in favour of the Prince, who nevertheless ceded a third of the barony (8 fiefs) to Margaret and John, while the remainder, along with the fortress of Akova itself, became a fief of William's youngest daughter, [[Margaret of Villehardouin|Margaret]].<ref>Bon (1969), pp. 105, 147\u2013148, 394</ref>\n\nMargaret of Villehardouin augmented her domains in 1297 through the donation of a few fiefs and castles by her sister, Princess [[Isabella of Villehardouin|Isabella]].<ref>Bon (1969), pp. 172, 394\u2013395</ref> In ca. 1311, Margaret sought, by virtue of her descent, to claim the Principality, or at least a portion of it, from the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] [[Kings of Naples]] who had controlled it since 1278. To this end, in February 1314 she wedded her only daughter, [[Isabel of Sabran]], to [[Ferdinand of Majorca]], and passed her titles and claims to them. She then returned to Achaea, where she was imprisoned by the Angevin ''[[bailli]]'' [[Nicholas le Maure]] and died in captivity in February or March 1315. Ferdinand invaded Achaea and tried to claim the Principality from [[Louis of Burgundy]], but fell in the [[Battle of Manolada]] in July 1316. In the wake of Margaret's death and the Majorcan invasion, the Barony of Akova was confiscated and added to the princely domain.<ref>Bon (1969), pp. 190\u2013193, 395</ref><ref>Topping (1975), pp. 110\u2013114</ref> Five years later, [[Battle of Saint George|in 1320]], Akova along with the castles of [[Karytaina]], [[Polyphengos]], and [[Saint George in Skorta]], fell to the Byzantines under [[Andronikos Asen]].<ref>Bon (1969), pp. 202, 395</ref><ref>Topping (1975), p. 117</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{La Mor\u00e9e franque}}\n* {{Essays on the Latin Orient}}\n* {{Setton-A History of the Crusades | volume = 3 | chapter = The Morea, 1364\u20131460 | pages = 141\u2013166 | last = Topping | first = Peter | chapterurl=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=article&did=History.CrusThree.i0017&id=History.CrusThree }}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Akova, Barony of}}\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1209]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1320]]\n[[Category:Medieval Arcadia]]\n[[Category:Medieval Elis]]\n[[Category:Baronies of the Principality of Achaea]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox former subdivision\n|_noautocat             = no\n|native_name            = \n|conventional_long_name = Barony of Akova\n|common_name            = Akova\n|subdivision            = Barony\n|nation                 = the [[Principality of Achaea]]\n|status_text            = \n|government_type        = Feudal lordship\n<!-- Titles and names of the first and last leaders and their deputies -->\n|title_leader           = Baron \n|leader1                = \n|year_leader1           = \n<!-- General information -->\n|capital                = [[Akova Castle|Akova]] \n|coordinates            = {{Coord|37|43|N|21|57|E|display=inline,title}}\n|year_start             = 1209\n|year_end               = 1320\n|event_start            = \n|event_end              = [[Byzantine]] reconquest\n|event1                 = Parliament of Glarentsa\n|date_event1            = 1276\n|life_span              = \n|era                    = [[Middle Ages]]\n|image_flag             = \n|flag_type              = \n|flag                   = \n|image_coat             = \n|symbol_type            = \n|symbol                 = \n|image_map              = Peloponnese Middle Ages map-en.svg\n|image_map_caption      = Map of the Peloponnese with its principal locations during the late Middle Ages\n|p1                     = \n|flag_p1                = \n|s1                     = Despotate of the Morea\n|flag_s1                = Byzantine imperial flag, 14th century, square.svg\n|footnotes              = \n}}\nThe '''Barony of Akova''' was a medieval [[Frankokratia|Frankish]] fiefdom of the [[Principality of Achaea]], located in the mountains of eastern [[Elis]] in the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula in [[Greece]], centred on the fortress of [[Akova Castle|Akova]] or Mattegrifon (situated near [[Vyziki]] in the [[Tropaia]] municipal unit).
