More than three times the size of and 28 times brighter than the Sun, Caph has an absolute magnitude of +1.16. It was once an A-type star with about double the Sun's mass.<ref name=apj732_2/> It is now in the process of cooling and expanding to become a [[red giant]]. Its core is likely to have used up its hydrogen and is shrinking and heating, while its outer envelope of hydrogen is expanding and cooling. Stars do not spend much time in this state and are relatively uncommon. Caph's [[stellar corona|corona]] is unusually weak.<ref name=kaler2002/><!-- cites previous five sentences -->\n\n\u03b2 Cassiopeiae is a [[variable star]] of the [[Delta Scuti variable|Delta Scuti type]], in fact the second brightest of such stars in the sky after [[Altair]].<ref name=apj619_2_1072/> It is a monoperiodic pulsator,<ref name=poretti2000/> with a brightness that ranges from magnitude +2.25 to +2.31 with a period of 2.5 hours.<ref name=kaler2002/> This type of variable includes subgiant or [[main sequence]] stars of spectral classes F5\u2013A0, having masses between 1.5\u20132.5 [[solar mass]]es and nearing the end of their core hydrogen fusion lifetime.<ref name=poretti2000/> Their pulsations are related to the same helium [[instability strip]] on the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]] as that of classical [[Cepheid]]s. Delta Scuti stars are located at the intersection of the strip with the main sequence.<ref name=percy2007/>\n\nThis star is rotating at about 92% of its critical speed, completing 1.12 rotations every day. This is giving the star an [[oblate spheroid]] shape with an equatorial bulge that is 24% larger than the polar radius. This shape is causing the polar region to have a higher temperature than the equator: the temperature difference is about 1,000&nbsp;K.

This is giving the star an [[oblate spheroid]] shape with an equatorial bulge that is 24% larger than the polar radius.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

It extends at least 5&nbsp;kilometers below the continental surface and 10.5&nbsp;kilometers below the sea surface, with temperatures that may exceed 100\u00b0C. \n\nAbove the surface living organisms consume organic matter and oxygen. Lower down, these are not available, so they make use of \"edibles\" ([[electron acceptor]]s) such as hydrogen released from rocks by various chemical processes, methane, reduced sulfur compounds and ammonium. They \"breathe\" [[electron donor]]s such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is very little energy at greater depths, and metabolism can be up to a million times slower than at the surface.

The rotary motor model used by bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

Survivalist phytoplankton has a high N:P ratio (>30) and contains an abundance of resource-acquisition machinery to sustain growth under scarce resources. Bloomer phytoplankton has a low N:P ratio (<10), contains a high proportion of growth machinery and is adapted to exponential growth. Generalist phytoplankton has similar N:P to the Redfield ratio and contain relatively equal resource-acquisition and growth machinery.<ref name=\"Arrigo2005\"/>\n\nThe [[f-ratio]] is the fraction of total [[primary production]] fuelled by [[nitrate]] (as opposed to that fuelled by other [[nitrogen]] [[chemical compound|compounds]] such as [[ammonium]]).

They are [[heterotrophic]] (other-feeding), meaning they cannot produce their own food and must consume instead other plants or animals as food. In particular, this means they eat phytoplankton.\n\nZooplankton are generally larger than phytoplankton, mostly still microscopic but some can be seen with the naked eye. Many [[protozoan]]s (single-celled [[#Marine protists|protists]] that prey on other microscopic life) are zooplankton, including [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, [[radiolarian]]s, some [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[#Marine microanimals|marine microanimals]]. Macroscopic zooplankton (not covered further here) include pelagic [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s and [[tunicate]]s, as well as planktonic [[chaetognatha|arrow worms]] and [[Polychaete|bristle worms]].\n\n'''Microzooplankton: major grazers of the plankton...'''\n<gallery mode=packed heights=144px style=float:left;>\nFile:Copepod 2 with eggs.jpg|[[Copepod]]s eat phytoplankton.

Their name comes from the Latin for \"radius\". They catch prey by extending parts of their body through the holes.
