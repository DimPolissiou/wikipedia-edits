A contango market is also known as a normal market, or carrying-cost market.\n\nThe opposite market condition to contango is known as [[backwardation]]. \"A market is 'in backwardation' when the futures price is below the spot price for a particular commodity. This is favorable for investors who have long positions since they want the futures price to rise to the level of the current spot price\".<ref name=\"investopedia_contango\" />\n\nThe futures or [[forward curve]] would ''typically'' be upward sloping (i.e. \"normal\"), since contracts for further dates would typically trade at even higher prices. (The curves in question plot market prices for various contracts at different maturities \u2014 cf. [[term structure of interest rates]]) \"In broad terms, backwardation reflects the majority market view that spot prices will move down, and contango that they will move up.

Such costs include [[warehousing]] fees and [[interest]] forgone on money tied up (or the time-value-of money, etc.), less income from [[leasing]] out the commodity if possible (''e.g.'' [[gold]]).<ref>{{cite web | first = Izabella | last = Kaminska | title = It's the BIS| url = http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/07/08/281601/the-bis/ | work = [[FT Alphaville]] | date = 8 July 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-01 }}</ref> For perishable commodities, price differences between near and far delivery are not a contango.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Different delivery dates are in effect entirely different commodities in this case, since fresh [[Egg (food)|eggs]] today will not still be fresh in 6 months' time, 90-day [[Government bond|treasury bills]] will have matured, etc.\n\n== Description ==\nA normal [[forward curve]] depicting the prices of multiple contracts, all for the same good, but of different maturities, slopes upward. For example, a forward oil contract for twelve months in the future is selling for $100 today, while today's spot price is $75. The expected spot price twelve months in the future may actually still be $75. To purchase a contract at more than $75 supposes a loss (the \"loss\" would be $25 if the contract were purchased for $100) to the agent who \"bought forward\" as opposed to waiting a year to buy at the spot price when oil is actually needed. But even so, there is utility for the forward buyer in the deal. Experience tells major end users of commodities (such as gasoline refineries, or cereal companies that use great quantities of grain) that spot prices are unpredictable. Locking in a future price puts the purchaser \"first in line\" for delivery even though the contract will, as it matures, converge on the spot price as shown in the graph. In uncertain markets where end users must constantly have a certain input of a stock of goods, a combination of forward (future) and spot buying reduces uncertainty. An oil refiner might purchase 50% spot and 50% forward, getting an average price of $87.50 averaged for one barrel spot ($75) and the one barrel bought forward ($100). This strategy also results in unanticipated, or \"windfall\" profits: If the contract is purchased forward twelve months at $100 and the actual price is $150, the refiner will take delivery of one barrel of oil at $100 and the other at a spot price of $150, or $125 averaged for two barrels: a gain of $25 per barrel relative to spot prices.\n\nSellers like to \"sell forward\" because it locks in an income stream. Farmers are the classic example: by selling their crop forward when it is still in the ground they can lock in a price, and therefore an income, which helps them qualify, in the present, for credit.\n\nThe graph of the \"life of a single futures contract\" (as shown above on the right) will show it converging towards the spot price. The contango contract for future delivery, selling today, is at a price premium relative to buying the commodity today and taking delivery. The backwardation contract selling today is lower than the spot price, and its trajectory will take it upward to the spot price when the contract closes. Paper assets are no different: for example, an insurance company has a constant stream of income from premiums and a constant stream of payments for claims. Income must be invested in new assets and existing assets must be sold to pay off claims. By investing in the purchase and sale of some bonds \"forward\" in addition to buying spot, an insurance company can smooth out changes in its portfolio and anticipated income.\n\nThe Oil Storage contango was introduced to the market in early 1990 by the Swedish-based oil storage company Scandinavian Tank Storage AB and its founder [[Lars Valentin Jacobsson]] by using huge military storage installations to bring down the \"calculation\" cost of storage to create a contango situation out of a \"flat\" market.\n\nContango is a potential trap for unwary investors. [[Exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) provide an opportunity for small investors to participate in commodity futures markets, which is tempting in periods of low interest rates. Between 2005 and 2010 the number of futures-based commodity ETFs rose from 2 to 95, and total assets rose from $3.9 billion to nearly $98 billion in the same period.<ref name=\"cuitripped\">Carolyn Cui, \"Getting Tripped Up by the Contango: A futures-market quirk can hurt commodities returns\u2014if investors aren't aware of it,\" ''The Wall Street Journal'', 17 December 2010, pp. C5, C8.</ref> Because the normal course of a futures contract in a market in contango is to decline in price, a fund composed of such contracts buys the contracts at the high price (going forward) and closes them out later at the usually lower spot price. The money raised from the low priced, closed out contracts will not buy the same number of new contracts going forward. Funds can and have lost money even in fairly stable markets. There are strategies to mitigate this problem, including allowing the ETF to create a stock of precious metals for the purpose of allowing investors to speculate on fluctuations in its value. But storage costs will be quite variable, an example being that copper ingots require considerably more storage space, and thus carrying cost, than gold, and command lower prices in world markets: it is unclear how well a model that works for gold will work with other commodities.<ref name=\"cuitripped\" /> Industrial scale buyers of major commodities, particularly when compared to small retail investors, retain an advantage in futures markets. The raw material cost of the commodity is only one of many factors that influence their final costs and prices. Contango pricing strategies that catch small investors by surprise are more familiar to the managers of a large firm, who must decide whether to take delivery of a product today, at today's spot price, and store it themselves, or pay more for a forward contract, and let someone else do the storage for them.<ref>Tatyana Shumsky and Carolyn Cui, \"Trader Holds $3 Billion of Copper in London,\" ''The Wall Street Journal'', 21 December 2010, quoting a trader: \"'Holding ready-for-delivery metals on an exchange isn't a cheap undertaking for traders, who are responsible for paying insurance, storage and financing costs.\" And 'the end game is to find somebody to buy something you have already bought for a higher price,' Mr. Threkeld says. 'The recent boom in metal prices has enabled traders to purchase the physical metal, sell a futures contract at a much higher price and still make a profit after paying for storage and insurance.'\"</ref>\n\nThe contango should not exceed the cost of carry, because producers and consumers can compare the [[futures contract]] price against the spot price plus storage, and choose the better one. Arbitrageurs can sell one and buy the other for a theoretically risk-free profit (see [[Rational pricing#Futures|rational pricing\u2014futures]]). The EU describes the two groups of players in the commodity futures market, hedgers (commodity producers and commodity users) or arbitrageurs/speculators (non-commercial investors).<ref name=\"CEC2008\" />\n\nIf there is a near-term shortage, the price comparison breaks down and contango may be reduced or perhaps even be reversed altogether into a state called [[backwardation]]. In that state, near prices become higher than far (i.e., future) prices because consumers prefer to have the product sooner rather than later (see [[convenience yield]]), and\nbecause there are few holders who can make an [[arbitrage]] profit by selling the spot and buying back the future. A market that is steeply backwardated\u2014''i.e.'', one where there is a very steep premium for material available for immediate delivery\u2014often indicates a perception of a current ''shortage'' in the underlying commodity. By the same token, a market that is deeply in contango may indicate a perception of a current supply ''surplus'' in the commodity.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006 a perception of an impending supply shortage allowed traders to take advantages of the contango in the [[crude oil]] market. Traders simultaneously bought oil and sold futures forward. This led to large numbers of tankers loaded with oil sitting idle in ports acting as floating warehouses.<ref>{{cite web | last = Davidson| first = Adam| authorlink = Adam Davidson (journalist) | title = Analyst: Blame Investors for High Gas Prices| publisher = [[NPR News]] | date = August 24, 2006| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5705263| accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> (see: [[Oil-storage trade]]) It was estimated that perhaps a $10\u201320 per barrel premium was added to spot price of oil as a result of this.\n\nIf such was the case, the premium may have ended when global oil storage capacity became exhausted; the contango would have deepened as the lack of storage supply to soak up excess oil supply would have put further pressure on spot prices. However, as crude and gasoline prices continued to rise between 2007 and 2008 this practice became so contentious that in June 2008 the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], the [[Federal Reserve]], and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) decided to create task forces to investigate whether this took place.<ref>{{cite web | last = Mandaro| first = Laura| title = CFTC to probe energy speculation with Fed, SEC| publisher = The Wall Street Journal marketwatch.com| date = June 10, 2008| url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/cftc-probe-energy-speculation-fed/story.aspx?guid=%7B31AEE5F8-E83C-4719-B142-DAE42E0909F1%7D| accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref>\n\nA crude oil contango occurred again in January 2009, with arbitrageurs storing millions of barrels in tankers to profit from the contango (see [[oil-storage trade]]). But by the summer, that price curve had flattened considerably. The contango exhibited in crude oil in 2009 explained the discrepancy between the headline spot price increase (bottoming at $35 and topping $80 in the year) and the various tradeable instruments for crude oil (such as rolled contracts or longer-dated futures contracts) showing a much lower price increase.<ref>{{cite web | last = Liberty| first = Jez| authorlink = Jez liberty | title = Crude Oil, Contango and Roll Yield for Commodity Trading | url = http://www.automated-trading-system.com/crude-oil-contango-and-roll-yield-for-commodity-trading/ }}</ref> The [[United States Oil Fund|USO]] ETF also failed to replicate crude oil's spot price performance.\n\n== Interest rates ==\nIf short-term [[interest rates]] were expected to fall in a contango market, this would narrow the spread between a futures contract and an underlying asset in good supply. This is because the cost of carry will fall due to the lower interest rate, which in turn results in the difference between the price of the future and the underlying growing smaller (i.e. narrowing). An investor would be advised to buy the spread in these circumstances: this is a [[calendar spread]] trade where the trader buys the near-dated instrument and simultaneously sells the far-dated instrument (i.e. the future).<ref name=\"SII\">{{cite book|last=Morrissey |first=Bob |title=Derivatives: The Official Learning and Reference Manual |publisher=The Securities & Investment Institute |date=January 2009 |location=London, United Kingdom |pages=72\u201377 |url=http://www.sii.org.uk/ |isbn=978-1-906917-11-1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006153135/http://www.sii.org.uk/ |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIf, on the other hand, the spread between a future traded on an underlying asset and the spot price of the underlying asset was set to widen, possibly due to a rise in short-term interest rates, then an investor would be advised to sell the spread (i.e. a [[calendar spread]] where the trader sells the near-dated instrument and simultaneously buys the future on the underlying).<ref name=\"SII\" />\n\n== 2007\u20132008 world food price crisis ==\nIn a 2010 article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', Frederick Kaufman argued the [[S&P GSCI|Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]] caused a [[demand shock]] in wheat and a contango market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, contributing to the [[2007\u20132008 world food price crisis]].<ref>[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/07/0083022 The Food Bubble: How Wall Street Starved Millions and got away with it], by Frederick Kaufman, ''Harper's'', 2010 July</ref><ref>[http://www.pacificfreepress.com/news/1/6629-the-great-food-bubble-swindle-starving-the-multitudes-for-fun-and-profit.html Democracy Now (radio show)], Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzales, Interview with Frederick Kaufman, 2010 7 17</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificfreepress.com/news/1/6154-a-global-food-bubble.pdf |title=Global Food Bubble |date=6 May 2010 |publisher=Pacific Free Press |author=TRNN&nbsp;\u2014 Jayati Ghosh |accessdate=30 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn a June 2010 article in ''[[The Economist]]'', the argument is made that index-tracking funds (to which Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was linked) did not cause the bubble.

In the past on the [[London Stock Exchange]], contango was a fee paid by a buyer to a seller when the buyer wished to defer settlement of the trade they had agreed. The charge was based on the interest forgone by the seller not being paid.\n\nThe purpose was normally speculative. Settlement days were on a fixed schedule (such as fortnightly) and a speculative buyer did not have to take delivery and pay for stock until the following settlement day, and on that day could \"carry over\" their position to the next by paying the contango fee. This practice was common before 1930, but came to be used less and less, particularly after options were reintroduced in 1958. It was prevalent in some exchanges such as [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) where it is still referred to as [[Badla (stock trading)|Badla]].<ref>[http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/iimiimawp/1253.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427143332/http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/iimiimawp/1253.htm |date=April 27, 2010 }}</ref> Futures trading based on defined lot sizes and fixed settlement dates has taken over in BSE to replace the forward trade, which involved flexible contracts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThis fee was similar in character to the present meaning of contango, ''i.e.'', future delivery costing more than immediate delivery, and the charge representing cost of carry to the holder.\n\nThe [[Commission of the European Communities]], in a report on agricultural commodity speculation, defined backwardation and contango in relation to spot prices: \"The futures price may be either higher or lower than the spot price. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, the market is said to be in backwardation.

In uncertain markets where end users must constantly have a certain input of a stock of goods, a combination of forward (future) and spot buying reduces uncertainty. An oil refiner might purchase 50% spot and 50% forward, getting an average price of $87.50 averaged for one barrel spot ($75) and the one barrel bought forward ($100). This strategy also results in unanticipated, or \"windfall\" profits: If the contract is purchased forward twelve months at $100 and the actual price is $150, the refiner will take delivery of one barrel of oil at $100 and the other at a spot price of $150, or $125 averaged for two barrels: a gain of $25 per barrel relative to spot prices.\n\nSellers like to \"sell forward\" because it locks in an income stream. Farmers are the classic example: by selling their crop forward when it is still in the ground they can lock in a price, and therefore an income, which helps them qualify, in the present, for credit.\n\nThe graph of the \"life of a single futures contract\" (as shown above on the right) will show it converging towards the spot price. The contango contract for future delivery, selling today, is at a price premium relative to buying the commodity today and taking delivery. The backwardation contract selling today is lower than the spot price, and its trajectory will take it upward to the spot price when the contract closes. Paper assets are no different: for example, an insurance company has a constant stream of income from premiums and a constant stream of payments for claims. Income must be invested in new assets and existing assets must be sold to pay off claims. By investing in the purchase and sale of some bonds \"forward\" in addition to buying spot, an insurance company can smooth out changes in its portfolio and anticipated income.\n\nThe Oil Storage contango was introduced to the market in early 1990 by the Swedish-based oil storage company Scandinavian Tank Storage AB and its founder [[Lars Jacobsson]] by using huge military storage installations to bring down the \"calculation\" cost of storage to create a contango situation out of a \"flat\" market.\n\nContango is a potential trap for unwary investors. [[Exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) provide an opportunity for small investors to participate in commodity futures markets, which is tempting in periods of low interest rates. Between 2005 and 2010 the number of futures-based commodity ETFs rose from 2 to 95, and total assets rose from $3.9 billion to nearly $98 billion in the same period.<ref name=\"cuitripped\">Carolyn Cui, \"Getting Tripped Up by the Contango: A futures-market quirk can hurt commodities returns\u2014if investors aren't aware of it,\" ''The Wall Street Journal'', 17 December 2010, pp. C5, C8.</ref> Because the normal course of a futures contract in a market in contango is to decline in price, a fund composed of such contracts buys the contracts at the high price (going forward) and closes them out later at the usually lower spot price. The money raised from the low priced, closed out contracts will not buy the same number of new contracts going forward. Funds can and have lost money even in fairly stable markets. There are strategies to mitigate this problem, including allowing the ETF to create a stock of precious metals for the purpose of allowing investors to speculate on fluctuations in its value. But storage costs will be quite variable, an example being that copper ingots require considerably more storage space, and thus carrying cost, than gold, and command lower prices in world markets: it is unclear how well a model that works for gold will work with other commodities.<ref name=\"cuitripped\" /> Industrial scale buyers of major commodities, particularly when compared to small retail investors, retain an advantage in futures markets. The raw material cost of the commodity is only one of many factors that influence their final costs and prices. Contango pricing strategies that catch small investors by surprise are more familiar to the managers of a large firm, who must decide whether to take delivery of a product today, at today's spot price, and store it themselves, or pay more for a forward contract, and let someone else do the storage for them.<ref>Tatyana Shumsky and Carolyn Cui, \"Trader Holds $3 Billion of Copper in London,\" ''The Wall Street Journal'', 21 December 2010, quoting a trader: \"'Holding ready-for-delivery metals on an exchange isn't a cheap undertaking for traders, who are responsible for paying insurance, storage and financing costs.\" And 'the end game is to find somebody to buy something you have already bought for a higher price,' Mr. Threkeld says. 'The recent boom in metal prices has enabled traders to purchase the physical metal, sell a futures contract at a much higher price and still make a profit after paying for storage and insurance.'\"</ref>\n\nThe contango should not exceed the cost of carry, because producers and consumers can compare the [[futures contract]] price against the spot price plus storage, and choose the better one. Arbitrageurs can sell one and buy the other for a theoretically risk-free profit (see [[Rational pricing#Futures|rational pricing\u2014futures]]). The EU describes the two groups of players in the commodity futures market, hedgers (commodity producers and commodity users) or arbitrageurs/speculators (non-commercial investors).<ref name=\"CEC2008\" />\n\nIf there is a near-term shortage, the price comparison breaks down and contango may be reduced or perhaps even be reversed altogether into a state called [[backwardation]]. In that state, near prices become higher than far (i.e., future) prices because consumers prefer to have the product sooner rather than later (see [[convenience yield]]), and\nbecause there are few holders who can make an [[arbitrage]] profit by selling the spot and buying back the future. A market that is steeply backwardated\u2014''i.e.'', one where there is a very steep premium for material available for immediate delivery\u2014often indicates a perception of a current ''shortage'' in the underlying commodity. By the same token, a market that is deeply in contango may indicate a perception of a current supply ''surplus'' in the commodity.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006 a perception of an impending supply shortage allowed traders to take advantages of the contango in the [[crude oil]] market. Traders simultaneously bought oil and sold futures forward. This led to large numbers of tankers loaded with oil sitting idle in ports acting as floating warehouses.<ref>{{cite web | last = Davidson| first = Adam| authorlink = Adam Davidson (journalist) | title = Analyst: Blame Investors for High Gas Prices| publisher = [[NPR News]] | date = August 24, 2006| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5705263| accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> (see: [[Oil-storage trade]]) It was estimated that perhaps a $10\u201320 per barrel premium was added to spot price of oil as a result of this.\n\nIf such was the case, the premium may have ended when global oil storage capacity became exhausted; the contango would have deepened as the lack of storage supply to soak up excess oil supply would have put further pressure on spot prices. However, as crude and gasoline prices continued to rise between 2007 and 2008 this practice became so contentious that in June 2008 the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], the [[Federal Reserve]], and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) decided to create task forces to investigate whether this took place.<ref>{{cite web | last = Mandaro| first = Laura| title = CFTC to probe energy speculation with Fed, SEC| publisher = The Wall Street Journal marketwatch.com| date = June 10, 2008| url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/cftc-probe-energy-speculation-fed/story.aspx?guid=%7B31AEE5F8-E83C-4719-B142-DAE42E0909F1%7D| accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref>\n\nA crude oil contango occurred again in January 2009, with arbitrageurs storing millions of barrels in tankers to profit from the contango (see [[oil-storage trade]]). But by the summer, that price curve had flattened considerably. The contango exhibited in crude oil in 2009 explained the discrepancy between the headline spot price increase (bottoming at $35 and topping $80 in the year) and the various tradeable instruments for crude oil (such as rolled contracts or longer-dated futures contracts) showing a much lower price increase.<ref>{{cite web | last = Liberty| first = Jez| authorlink = Jez liberty | title = Crude Oil, Contango and Roll Yield for Commodity Trading | url = http://www.automated-trading-system.com/crude-oil-contango-and-roll-yield-for-commodity-trading/ }}</ref> The [[United States Oil Fund|USO]] ETF also failed to replicate crude oil's spot price performance.\n\n== Interest rates ==\nIf short-term [[interest rates]] were expected to fall in a contango market, this would narrow the spread between a futures contract and an underlying asset in good supply. This is because the cost of carry will fall due to the lower interest rate, which in turn results in the difference between the price of the future and the underlying growing smaller (i.e. narrowing). An investor would be advised to buy the spread in these circumstances: this is a [[calendar spread]] trade where the trader buys the near-dated instrument and simultaneously sells the far-dated instrument (i.e. the future).<ref name=\"SII\">{{cite book|last=Morrissey |first=Bob |title=Derivatives: The Official Learning and Reference Manual |publisher=The Securities & Investment Institute |date=January 2009 |location=London, United Kingdom |pages=72\u201377 |url=http://www.sii.org.uk/ |isbn=978-1-906917-11-1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006153135/http://www.sii.org.uk/ |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIf, on the other hand, the spread between a future traded on an underlying asset and the spot price of the underlying asset was set to widen, possibly due to a rise in short-term interest rates, then an investor would be advised to sell the spread (i.e. a [[calendar spread]] where the trader sells the near-dated instrument and simultaneously buys the future on the underlying).<ref name=\"SII\" />\n\n== 2007\u20132008 world food price crisis ==\nIn a 2010 article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', Frederick Kaufman argued the [[S&P GSCI|Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]] caused a [[demand shock]] in wheat and a contango market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, contributing to the [[2007\u20132008 world food price crisis]].<ref>[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/07/0083022 The Food Bubble: How Wall Street Starved Millions and got away with it], by Frederick Kaufman, ''Harper's'', 2010 July</ref><ref>[http://www.pacificfreepress.com/news/1/6629-the-great-food-bubble-swindle-starving-the-multitudes-for-fun-and-profit.html Democracy Now (radio show)], Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzales, Interview with Frederick Kaufman, 2010 7 17</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificfreepress.com/news/1/6154-a-global-food-bubble.pdf |title=Global Food Bubble |date=6 May 2010 |publisher=Pacific Free Press |author=TRNN&nbsp;\u2014 Jayati Ghosh |accessdate=30 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn a June 2010 article in ''[[The Economist]]'', the argument is made that index-tracking funds (to which Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was linked) did not cause the bubble.

In the past on the [[London Stock Exchange]], contango was a fee paid by a buyer to a seller when the buyer wished to defer settlement of the trade they had agreed. The charge was based on the interest forgone by the seller not being paid.\n\nThe purpose was normally speculative. Settlement days were on a fixed schedule (such as fortnightly) and a speculative buyer did not have to take delivery and pay for stock until the following settlement day, and on that day could \"carry over\" their position to the next by paying the contango fee. This practice was common before 1930, but came to be used less and less, particularly after options were reintroduced in 1958. It was prevalent in some exchanges such as [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) where it is still referred to as [[Badla (stock trading)|Badla]].<ref>[http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/iimiimawp/1253.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427143332/http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/iimiimawp/1253.htm |date=April 27, 2010 }}</ref> Futures trading based on defined lot sizes and fixed settlement dates has taken over in BSE to replace the forward trade, which involved flexible contracts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThis fee was similar in character to the present meaning of contango, ''i.e.'', future delivery costing more than immediate delivery, and the charge representing cost of carry to the holder.\n\nThe [[Commission of the European Communities]], in a report on agricultural commodity speculation, defined backwardation and contango in relation to spot prices: \"The futures price may be either higher or lower than the spot price. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, the market is said to be in backwardation. It is often called 'normal backwardation' as the futures buyer is rewarded for risk he takes off the producer.

Keynes argued that if hedgers are net short, speculators must be net long. Speculators will not go net long unless the futures price is expected to rise.

The oil market now attracts investor money which currently far exceeds the gap between producer and consumer. Contango used to be the 'normal' for the oil market. Since c. 2008-9, investors are hedging against \"inflation, US dollar weakness and possible geopolitical events,\" instead of investing in the front end of the oil market.

Such burnout sometimes leads to permanent disability or suicidal behaviour. It need not be caused by workplace stress, but can also be caused by the stress of social interaction or other sources.<ref>https://www.seattlechildrens.org/globalassets/documents/health-and-safety/autism/autism_206_raymaker_slides.pdf, https://www.facebook.com/seattlechildrens/videos/vl.948687718589668/380037906042266/?type=1</ref><ref>https://www.goodtherapy/blog/autistic-burnout-an-often-misunderstood-element-of-autism-080620197</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/AIA-10-2018-0042| title=Helping autistic women thrive| year=2019| last1=Zener| first1=Dori| journal=Advances in Autism| volume=5| issue=3| pages=143\u2013156}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1186/s13229-020-0313-1|pmid = 31969977|title = Behavioral effects of multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in autism: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with long-term follow-up|year = 2020|last1 = Bernaerts|first1 = Sylvie|last2 = Boets|first2 = Bart|last3 = Bosmans|first3 = Guy|last4 = Steyaert|first4 = Jean|last5 = Alaerts|first5 = Kaat|journal = Molecular Autism|volume = 11|pages = 6|pmc = 6964112}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZwfujkNBGk</ref> [[Spoon theory]] is sometimes used to understand people in this situation.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Distinction Between Avoidance Behaviours, Social Fatigue and Burn out |url=http://functionallegacymindset.com.au/a-distinction-between-avoidance-behaviours-social-fatigue-and-burn-out/ |website=Functional Legacy Mindset}}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with other conditions ===\nA growing body of evidence suggests that burnout is etiologically, clinically, and [[nosology|nosologically]] similar to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref>Bianchi, E., Schonfeld, I.S., & Laurent, E.

In addition to the typical [[melancholic]] depression, there is a multi-millennia-old defined syndrome called \"[[acedia]]\" (which can be considered a [[phlegmatic]] depression). Those suffering from acedia experience some fear and sadness as the depressed do, but much less of it. Those suffering from acedia are more likely to have trouble doing anything useful than standard depression. But the main defining feature of acedia is an impairment of the senses.

In addition to the typical [[melancholic]] depression, there is a multi-millennia-old defined syndrome called \"[[acedia]]\" (which can be considered a [[phlegmatic]] depression). Those suffering from acedia experience some fear and sadness as the depressed do, but much less of it. Those suffering from acedia are more likely to have trouble doing anything useful than standard depression. But the main defining feature of acedia is an impairment of the senses.

A common indication of this mismatch is work overload, which sometimes involves a worker who survives a round of layoffs, but after the layoffs the worker finds that he or she is doing too much with too few resources.

The territory, with its native population, was split between the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the Russian Empire. After 1804, an equivalent to Congress Poland within the Austrian Empire was the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], also commonly referred to as \"Austrian Poland\".

It was mostly composed of [[Poles]], [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]], ethnic [[German minority in Poland|Germans]] and a small Russian minority.

The Kingdom was created on part of the Polish territory that had been [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] replacing, after Napoleon's defeat, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], set up by Napoleon in 1807. After Napoleon's 1812 defeat, the fate of the Duchy of Warsaw was \ndependent on Russia. Prussia insisted on the Duchy being completely eliminated, but after Russian troops reached Paris in 1812, Tsar Alexander I originally intended to annex to the Duchy the Lithuanian-Belarusian lands, now controlled by the Tsardom, which used to be a part of the [[First Polish Republic]] and to unite thus created Polish country with Russia. Both Austria and the United Kingdom disapproved of that idea, Austria issuing a memorandum on returning to the 1795 resolutions, this idea supported by the United Kingdom under [[George IV]] and Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Robert Jenkinson]] and the British delegate to the Congress, [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh]], so in effect the Tsar, after the so-called Hundred Days, established the Kingdom of Poland and the 1815 Congress of Vienna approved. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with Warsaw) and, after crushing an [[November Uprising|insurrection in 1831]], the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities.<ref>W.

Over the next 30 years a series of measures bound Congress Poland ever more closely to Russia. In 1863 the [[January Uprising]] broke out, but lasted only two years before being crushed.

He could [[veto]] the councils' decisions; other than that, his decisions had to be [[Countersign (legal)|countersign]]ed by the appropriate [[Minister (government)|government minister]]. The Viceroy exercised broad powers and could nominate candidates for most senior government posts (ministers, [[senator]]s, judges of the High Tribunal, councilors of state, [[referendary|referendaries]], [[bishop]]s, and [[archbishop]]s). He had no competence in the realms of finances and foreign policy; his military competence varied.\n\nThe office of \"namiestnik\" or Viceroy was never abolished; however, after the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] it disappeared.

In particular, he controlled all the military forces in the region and oversaw the judicial systems (he could impose [[death sentence]]s without trial). He could also issue \"[[Declaration (law)|declarations]] with the force of law,\" which could alter existing laws.\n\n===Administrative Council===\n{{Main|Administrative Council}}\nThe ''Administrative Council'' ({{Lang-pl|Rada Administracyjna}}) was a part of [[Council of State (Kingdom of Poland)|Council of State]] of the Kingdom. Introduced by the [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland]] in 1815, it was composed of 5 ministers, special nominees of the King and the Viceroy of the Kingdom of Poland. The Council executed the King's will and ruled in the cases outside the ministers competence and prepared projects for the Council of State..\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Administrative divisions of Congress Poland in 1830 ENG.png|thumb|Administrative divisions of Congress Poland in 1830]]\n{{main|Administrative division of Congress Poland}}\n\nThe administrative divisions of the Kingdom changed several times over its history, and various smaller reforms were also carried out which either changed the smaller administrative units or merged/split various subdivisions.\n\nImmediately after its creation in 1815, the Kingdom of Poland was divided into [[Department (country subdivision)|departments]], [[Administrative division of Duchy of Warsaw|a relic]] from the times of the French-dominated [[Duchy of Warsaw]].\n\nOn 16 January 1816 the administrative division was reformed, with the departments being replaced with more traditionally Polish [[voivodeship]]s (of which there were eight), [[obw\u00f3d]]s and [[powiat]]s. On 7 March 1837, in the aftermath of the [[November Uprising]] earlier that decade, the administrative division was reformed again, bringing Congress Poland closer to the structure of the [[Russian Empire]], with the introduction of [[guberniya]]s ([[governorate]], Polish spelling ''{{lang|pl|gubernia}}''). In 1842 the [[powiat]]s were renamed [[okr\u0119g]]s, and the [[obw\u00f3d]]s were renamed powiats. In 1844 several governorates were merged with others, and some others renamed; five governorates remained.\n\nIn 1867, following the failure of the [[January Uprising]], further reforms were instituted which were designed to bring the administrative structure of Poland (now ''de facto'' the [[Vistulan Country]]) closer to that of the Russian Empire. It divided larger governorates into smaller ones, introduced the [[gmina]] (a new lower level entity), and restructured the existing five governorates into 10. The 1912 reform created a new governorate \u2013 [[Kholm Governorate (Russian Empire)|Kholm Governorate]] \u2013 from parts of the [[Sedlets Governorate|Sedlets]] and [[Lublin Governorate]]s. It was split off from the Vistulan Country and made part of the [[Southwestern Krai]] of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>[[Norman Davies]], ''God's Playground: A History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-231-12819-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&pg=PA531&dq=God%27s+Playground+1912&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=ACfU3U3vzQDskhc2RDZQ7aO05qXue7YPuQ#PPA278,M1 Print, p. 278]</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:FOS reklama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An advertisement of [[camera]]s made by a Polish company ''FOS'' (1905).

The beginnings were difficult due to floods and intense diplomatic relationship with [[Prussia]]. It was not until 1822 when Prince [[Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki|Francis Xavier Drucki-Lubecki]] negotiated to open the Polish market to the world.<ref name=\"druckilubecki.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.druckilubecki.pl/polityka-gospodarcza/|title=Polityka gospodarcza  \u2013  druckilubecki.pl|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> He also tried to introduce appropriate protective duties.

With the abolition of border customs in 1851 and further economic growth, Polish cities were gaining wealth and importance. Most notably, [[Warsaw]], being associated with the construction of railway lines and bridges, gained priority in the entire Russian market.\n\nAlthough the economic and industrial progress occurred rapidly, most of the farms, called ''[[folwark]]s'', chose to rely on [[serfs]] and paid workforce. Only a few have experimented by obtaining proper machinery and plowing equipment from [[England]].<ref name=\"sciaga.pl\"/> New crops were being cultivated like [[sugar beet]], which marked the beginning of Polish sugar refineries. The use of iron cutters and plows was also favoured among the farmers. During the [[January Uprising]] the occupying authorities sought to deprive peasant insurgents of their popularity among [[Szlachta|landed gentry]].<ref name=\"sciaga.pl\"/> Taxes were raised and the overall economic situation of commoners worsened. The noblemen and landowners were, on the other hand, provided with more privileges, rights and even financial support in the form of [[bribery]]. The aim of this was to weaken their support for the rebellion against the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nCongress Poland was the largest supplier of [[zinc]] in Europe. The development of zinc industry took place at the beginning of the 19th century. It was mostly caused by the significant increase of demand for zinc mainly in industrialized countries of [[Western Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aul.uni.lodz.pl/t/2005nr78/s.pdf|format=PDF|author=Rafa\u0142 Kowalczyk|title=DEVELOPMENT OF ZINC INDUSTRY IN THE KINGDOM OF POLAND 1815\u20131904|website=Aul.uni.lodz.pl|accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1899, Aleksander Ginsberg founded the company ''FOS'' (''Fabryka Przyrz\u0105d\u00f3w Optycznych''-\"Factory of Optical Equipment\") in Warsaw.

The sources are also unclear as to when Congress Poland (or Vistula land) officially ended; some argue it ended when the German and Austro-Hungarian occupying authorities assumed control; others, that it ended with the creation of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1917; finally, some argue that it occurred only with the creation of the independent [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]] in 1918.

In 1915, during [[World War I]], it was replaced by the [[Central Powers]] with the nominal [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]],{{Ref label|a|a|none}} until Poland [[National Independence Day (Poland)|regained independence]] in 1918. \n\nFollowing the [[partitions of Poland]] at the end of the 18th century, Poland ceased to exist as an independent state for 123 years. The territory, with its native population, was split between the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the Russian Empire. After 1804, an equivalent to Congress Poland within the Austrian Empire was the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], also commonly referred to as \"Austrian Poland\". The area incorporated into Prussia and subsequently the [[German Empire]] had little autonomy and was merely a province \u2013 the [[Province of Posen]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Poland enjoyed considerable political autonomy as guaranteed by the liberal [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland|constitution]]. However, its rulers, the [[Emperor of All Russia|Russian Emperors]], generally disregarded any restrictions on their power.

The Kingdom was created on part of the Polish territory that had been [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] replacing, after Napoleon's defeat, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], set up by Napoleon in 1807. After Napoleon's 1812 defeat, the fate of the Duchy of Warsaw was \ndependent on Russia. Prussia insisted on the Duchy being completely eliminated, but after Russian troops reached Paris in 1812, Tsar Alexander I originally intended to annex to the Duchy the Lithuanian-Belarusian lands, now controlled by the Tsardom, which used to be a part of the [[First Polish Republic]] and to unite thus created Polish country with Russia. Both Austria and the United Kingdom disapproved of that idea, Austria issuing a memorandum on returning to the 1795 resolutions, this idea supported by the United Kingdom under [[George IV]] and Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Robert Jenkinson]] and the British delegate to the Congress, [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh]], so in effect the Tsar, after the so-called Hundred Days, established the Kingdom of Poland and the 1815 Congress of Vienna approved. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with Warsaw) and, after crushing an [[November Uprising|insurrection in 1831]], the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities.<ref>W.

Over the next 30 years a series of measures bound Congress Poland ever more closely to Russia. In 1863 the [[January Uprising]] broke out, but lasted only two years before being crushed.

The Viceroy was chosen by the King from among the noble citizens of the Russian Empire or the Kingdom of Poland. The Viceroy supervised the entire [[public administration]] and, in the monarch's absence, chaired the [[Council of State (Kingdom of Poland)|Council of State]], as well as the [[Administrative Council]]. He could [[veto]] the councils' decisions; other than that, his decisions had to be [[Countersign (legal)|countersign]]ed by the appropriate [[Minister (government)|government minister]].

In particular, he controlled all the military forces in the region and oversaw the judicial systems (he could impose [[death sentence]]s without trial). He could also issue \"[[Declaration (law)|declarations]] with the force of law,\" which could alter existing laws.\n\n===Administrative Council===\n{{Main|Administrative Council}}\nThe ''Administrative Council'' ({{Lang-pl|Rada Administracyjna}}) was a part of [[Council of State (Kingdom of Poland)|Council of State]] of the Kingdom. Introduced by the [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland]] in 1815, it was composed of 5 ministers, special nominees of the King and the Viceroy of the Kingdom of Poland. The Council executed the King's will and ruled in the cases outside the ministers competence and prepared projects for the Council of State..\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Administrative divisions of Congress Poland in 1830 ENG.png|thumb|Administrative divisions of Congress Poland in 1830]]\n{{main|Administrative division of Congress Poland}}\n\nThe administrative divisions of the Kingdom changed several times over its history, and various smaller reforms were also carried out which either changed the smaller administrative units or merged/split various subdivisions.\n\nImmediately after its creation in 1815, the Kingdom of Poland was divided into [[Department (country subdivision)|departments]], [[Administrative division of Duchy of Warsaw|a relic]] from the times of the French-dominated [[Duchy of Warsaw]].\n\nOn 16 January 1816 the administrative division was reformed, with the departments being replaced with more traditionally Polish [[voivodeship]]s (of which there were eight), [[obw\u00f3d]]s and [[powiat]]s. On 7 March 1837, in the aftermath of the [[November Uprising]] earlier that decade, the administrative division was reformed again, bringing Congress Poland closer to the structure of the [[Russian Empire]], with the introduction of [[guberniya]]s ([[governorate]], Polish spelling ''{{lang|pl|gubernia}}''). In 1842 the [[powiat]]s were renamed [[okr\u0119g]]s, and the [[obw\u00f3d]]s were renamed powiats. In 1844 several governorates were merged with others, and some others renamed; five governorates remained.\n\nIn 1867, following the failure of the [[January Uprising]], further reforms were instituted which were designed to bring the administrative structure of Poland (now ''de facto'' the [[Vistulan Country]]) closer to that of the Russian Empire. It divided larger governorates into smaller ones, introduced the [[gmina]] (a new lower level entity), and restructured the existing five governorates into 10. The 1912 reform created a new governorate \u2013 [[Kholm Governorate (Russian Empire)|Kholm Governorate]] \u2013 from parts of the [[Sedlets Governorate|Sedlets]] and [[Lublin Governorate]]s. It was split off from the Vistulan Country and made part of the [[Southwestern Krai]] of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>[[Norman Davies]], ''God's Playground: A History of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-231-12819-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&pg=PA531&dq=God%27s+Playground+1912&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=ACfU3U3vzQDskhc2RDZQ7aO05qXue7YPuQ#PPA278,M1 Print, p. 278]</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:FOS reklama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An advertisement of [[camera]]s made by a Polish company ''FOS'' (1905).

Most notably, [[Warsaw]], being associated with the construction of railway lines and bridges, gained priority in the entire Russian market.\n\nAlthough the economic and industrial progress occurred rapidly, most of the farms, called ''[[folwark]]s'', chose to rely on [[serfs]] and paid workforce. Only a few have experimented by obtaining proper machinery and plowing equipment from [[England]].<ref name=\"sciaga.pl\"/> New crops were being cultivated like [[sugar beet]], which marked the beginning of Polish sugar refineries. The use of iron cutters and plows was also favoured among the farmers. During the [[January Uprising]] the occupying authorities sought to deprive peasant insurgents of their popularity among [[Szlachta|landed gentry]].<ref name=\"sciaga.pl\"/> Taxes were raised and the overall economic situation of commoners worsened. The noblemen and landowners were, on the other hand, provided with more privileges, rights and even financial support in the form of [[bribery]]. The aim of this was to weaken their support for the rebellion against the [[Russian Empire]].\n\nCongress Poland was the largest supplier of [[zinc]] in Europe. The development of zinc industry took place at the beginning of the 19th century. It was mostly caused by the significant increase of demand for zinc mainly in industrialized countries of [[Western Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aul.uni.lodz.pl/t/2005nr78/s.pdf|format=PDF|author=Rafa\u0142 Kowalczyk|title=DEVELOPMENT OF ZINC INDUSTRY IN THE KINGDOM OF POLAND 1815\u20131904|website=Aul.uni.lodz.pl|accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1899, Aleksander Ginsberg founded the company ''FOS'' (''Fabryka Przyrz\u0105d\u00f3w Optycznych''-\"Factory of Optical Equipment\") in Warsaw. It was the only firm in the Russian Empire which crafted and produced [[cameras]], [[telescopes]], [[Objective (optics)|objectives]] and [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopes]]. Following the outbreak of [[World War I]] the factory was moved to [[St. Petersburg]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Population<br/> <sup>(by year)</sup>\n|width       = 10.5em\n|state       = collapsed\n|percentages = off\n|source      = Golab (1977)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Golab |first1=Caroline |title=Immigrant Destinations |date=1977 |publisher=[[Temple University Press]] |isbn=978-0877221098 |page=91}}</ref>\n|1814 |2,815,000  \n|1820 |3,520,355 \n|1825 |3,911,000\n|1830 |3,998,000\n|1835 |4,188,112\n|1840 |4,488,009 \n|1845 |4,798,658\n|1850 |4,810,735\n|1855 |4,673,869 \n|1860 |4,840,466\n|1865 |5,336,210\n|1870 |6,078,564\n|1875 |6,515,153\n|1880 |7,104,864 \n|1885 |7,687,893 \n|1890 |8,256,562 \n|1897 |9,402,253\n|1904 |11,588,585\n|1909 |11,935,318\n|1913 |13,058,000\n}}\n[[Russian Empire Census|Demographic composition in 1897]], by language:<ref>{{cite web |title=Russian Empire Census of 1897 |url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=2 |website=demoscope.ru |accessdate=30 September 2019 |language=ru}}</ref>\n* [[Polish language|Polish]] \u2013 71.8% (6,755,503);\n* [[Jewish language|Jewish]] \u2013 13.5% (1,267,194);\n* [[German language|German]] \u2013 4.3% (407,274);\n* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] \u2013 3.6% (335,337);\n* [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] \u2013 3.2% (305,322);\n* [[Russian language|Russian]] \u2013 2.8% (267,160);\n* [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] \u2013 0.3% (29,347).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland]]\n* [[Grand Duchy of Posen]]\n* [[History of Poland (1795\u20131918)]]\n* [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] (1809\u20131917)\n* [[Pale of Settlement]]\n* [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Great Retreat]] \u2013 the withdrawal of Russian forces from Poland in 1915\n\n==Notes==\n'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Sources agree that after the fall of the [[January Uprising]] in 1864, the autonomy of Congress Poland was drastically reduced.

The sources are also unclear as to when Congress Poland (or Vistula land) officially ended; some argue it ended when the German and Austro-Hungarian occupying authorities assumed control; others, that it ended with the creation of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1917\u20131918)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1917; finally, some argue that it occurred only with the creation of the independent [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]] in 1918.

[[Image:Pat O Donnell.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|Patrick D. O'Donnell at 83 years]]\n\n==Background==\nHe was born in the Kerries [[Tralee]], [[County Kerry]], only child of [[Denis O'Donnell]], and Hannah Leane, and was also known as \"Paddy\" or \"P.D.\".  He was a direct descendant of John O'Donnell of [[Ardfert]], and descended from an [[O'Donnell of Tyrconnell]], following on the implantation of O'Donnells in Ardfert by Prince [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell]] en route to the [[Battle of Kinsale]] in 1601, as recorded in the [[Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland]]. He married Stephanie Sarah Teresa [[Tyndall]] in 1952, daughter of [[David P. Tyndall]] and Sarah n\u00e9e Gaynor, and they lived in [[Fingal]], north Dublin. They had three children, Frank (see [[Francis Martin O'Donnell]]), Sally, and Nola. He was a cousin of [[Maurice Gerard Moynihan]], with shared interests in historical matters.\n\n==Education==\nHe was educated in Tralee [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] Schools and joined the [[Irish Army]] in 1940. He successfully completed management and [[psychology]] courses at the School of Management at Rathmines Technical School. He graduated from the Irish Military College in [[the Curragh]], and was commissioned in 1943. He also graduated from the Infantry School on 13 April 1949, with distinction. Later he attended the Public Relations Institute of Ireland in the early 1960s, and conducted public relations campaigns for the visit of US President [[John F. Kennedy]] to Ireland in 1962\n\n==Military career==\n[[Image:PDOD-Lt-Honour Guard.jpeg|thumb|left|O'Donnell in Honour Guard when Lieutenant, 1950s]] He served during the \"Emergency\" as the period of the [[Second World War]] was known in then-neutral Ireland. He served briefly, with commendation, as a United Nations Military Observer with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] ([[UNTSO]]), during the years 1965\u20131967, successively in Jerusalem, [[Tiberias]], and [[Damascus]].\n\nLater, he held senior responsibilities in the Observer Corps (the Irish Army's unit for mitigation and preparedness in the event of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]), [[military intelligence]], and border security. An amateur artist in his spare time, he designed the insignia of the 5th Infantry Battalion. He rose to the rank of [[Commandant]] (Major) before retirement. He was awarded the United Nations Medal by the United Nations Secretary-General on 30 November 1965, and the United Nations Peacekeepers Medal by the Irish Government in 1991, in recognition of his service in the cause of world peace.\n\n==Historical interests==\n[[Image:Hugo O'Donnell and Patrick Denis O'Donnell.jpg|thumb|left|Patrick D. O'Donnell (right) greeting young Count Hugo O'Donnell (now Duke of Tetuan) of Lucena, Spain, in Dublin in 1963]] He was keenly interested in Irish and Middle Eastern history and was a member of the O'Donnell Clan Association. He was very active in O'Donnell Clan research for many decades, and at one time represented the Irish Defence Forces and the Military History Society in these matters. He frequently corresponded also with the Spanish and Austrian members of the clan of the O'Donnells of Tyrconnell. Of note, he also wrote a published series on the history of military barracks in Ireland, and lectured at the Old Dublin Society. He also researched [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]]'s death, discovered his tomb, and published several articles on evidence that it was an assassination rather than suicide.\n\nIn 1980, he also published the first Map of the War of Independence, showing ambushes, raids, burnings and other incidents in the early 1920s. He wrote several series on topics of American military history.  Some of his written material on military technology has been used for instructional purposes at the US [[Armed Forces Staff College]] in Norfolk, Virginia. In December 1994, he presented his military memorabilia and artefacts to the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. (''Evening Press'', 20 December 1994)\n\nHe also wrote on Irish non-military history including legends of famous castles such as Castlemartin and [[Ballyheigue]], where a tale of a ghostly appearance was picked up later by the American expert on the paranormal, [[Hans Holzer]], in his book ''The Lively Ghosts of Ireland''. He was best known abroad for his book ''The Irish Faction Fighters of the 19th Century'', (published by Anvil Books, Dublin, 1975), a sociological analysis of rural inter-clan feuding, and its exploitation as a form of control to contain rising agrarian agitation in the 19th century in Ireland.\n\n [[Image:PDOD-Commandant.jpeg|thumb|right|Comdt. P.D. O'Donnell during Papal Visit to Ireland, Dublin, 1979]] He was frequently consulted as an authority on various historical matters, and was often cited at home and abroad in other works. He wrote over 1,000 articles and was a frequent contributor to leading Irish newspapers and periodicals, including ''[[An Cosant\u00f3ir]]'', the journal of the [[Irish Army]], and ''[[The Irish Sword]]'', the journal of the Irish Military History Society.

He wrote several series on topics of American military history.  Some of his written material on military technology has been used for instructional purposes at the US [[Armed Forces Staff College]] in Norfolk, Virginia. In December 1994, he presented his military memorabilia and artefacts to the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. (''Evening Press'', 20 December 1994)\n\nHe also wrote on Irish non-military history including legends of famous castles such as Castlemartin and [[Ballyheigue]], where a tale of a ghostly appearance was picked up later by the American expert on the paranormal, [[Hans Holzer]], in his book ''The Lively Ghosts of Ireland''. He was best known abroad for his book ''The Irish Faction Fighters of the 19th Century'', (published by Anvil Books, Dublin, 1975), a sociological analysis of rural inter-clan feuding, and its exploitation as a form of control to contain rising agrarian agitation in the 19th century in Ireland.\n\n [[Image:PDOD-Commandant.jpeg|thumb|right|Comdt.
