The son of [[Guy, Constable of Cyprus]] (son of [[Hugh III of Cyprus]]), and [[Eschive d'Ibelin (1253\u20131312)|Eschiva of Ibelin]], Hugh succeeded his father as [[Constable of Cyprus]] in 1318, and later succeeded to the throne of [[Cyprus]] on the death of his uncle [[Henry II of Jerusalem|Henry II]], since Henry II had no son. He was a member of the [[House of Poitiers-Lusignan]].\n\n==History==\nHugh appears to have been content to rule Cyprus, as he prevented his son, [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter I]], from going to Western Europe to recruit support for a new [[crusade]] to recover their [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. In 1344, he joined a league with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] which burnt a Turkish fleet in [[Smyrna]] and [[Smyrniote crusades|captured the city]]. In 1345 the allies defeated the Turks at [[Imbros]] by land and sea, but Hugh could see little benefit for his kingdom in these endeavors and withdrew from the league.\n\nHe was crowned as King of Cyprus at [[Saint Sophia Cathedral, Nicosia]], on 15 April or 25 April 1324. In the same year, on 13 May, he was crowned at [[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Famagusta]] as King of Jerusalem. As a leader, King Hugh signed an agreement with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], which had to do with the activities of the Venician merchants who were settling in Cyprus. That caused problems with the Republic of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] who were rivals of the Venetians; however he negotiated with them and had agreement in 1329. The Genoese demanded that Hugh pay the debit of his uncle Henry II. He died in Nicosia.\n\nDuring his reign, he was strict about issues relating to justice. When his two sons left without his permission for a trip in Europe, he arrested the man who helped them to leave the island, he imprisoned and tortured him, and he cut off a hand and a foot before he hanged him in April 1349. He managed to bring back his two sons and he imprisoned them.\n\nOther sources show that he was well educated and had an interest in art, literature, and philosophy and had much knowledge of Latin literature. He owned a summer villa in [[Lapithos]] and organised philosophical meetings. The Italian writer [[Boccaccio]], wrote ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium]]'' at the request of Hugh IV.\n\nHugh resigned the crown to his son, Peter I (rather than his grandson Hugh) in 1358, and died on 10 October 1359 in [[Nicosia]].\n\n==Family==\nHugh was married twice, both times to ladies of the [[House of Ibelin]], whose fathers were both named \"Guy of Ibelin\", one being Count of Jaffa and the other Seneschal of Cyprus.\n* Hugh's first marriage was in 1307/1310 to Marie d'Ibelin (1294 \u2013 before 30 June 1318), daughter of [[Guy of Ibelin (died 1304)|Guy of Ibelin]] (1250\u20131304), [[Count of Jaffa]], and wife and cousin Marie d'Ibelin, Lady of [[Askalon]] and [[Naumachia]].{{sfn|Edbury|1991|p=143}}  They had:\n** Guy of Lusignan (c. 1316 or 1315\u20131316 \u2013 soon before 24 September 1343 and buried in [[Nicosia]]), [[Constable of Cyprus]] (1336\u20131338) and titular [[Prince of Galilee]] ca. 1320.{{sfn|Edbury|1991|p=143}} He married by proxy at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Bourbon]] on 29 November 1328 and in person at [[Selimiye Mosque, Nicosia|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]] on 15\u201330 January 1330 [[Marie of Bourbon, Latin Empress|Marie of Bourbon]] (1315\u20131387 in [[Naples]] and buried there), [[Principality of Achaea|Princess of Achaia]].
