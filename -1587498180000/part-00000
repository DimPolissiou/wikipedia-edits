Originally called Vajk until baptized) at [[Esztergom]] on Christmas Day 1000. The first kings of the kingdom were from the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]]. He fought against [[Kopp\u00e1ny]] and in 998, with [[Bavaria]]n help, defeated him near [[Veszpr\u00e9m]]. The Catholic Church received powerful support from Stephen I, who with Christian Hungarians and German knights wanted a Christian kingdom established in Central Europe. [[Stephen I of Hungary]] was [[canonized]] as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[saint]] in 1083 and an [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] saint in 2000.\n\nAfter his death, a period of revolts and conflict for supremacy ensued between the royalty and the nobles. In 1051 armies of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] tried to conquer Hungary, but they were defeated at [[V\u00e9rtes Mountain]]. The armies of the Holy Roman Empire continued to suffer defeats; the second greatest battle was at the town now called [[Bratislava]], in 1052. Before 1052 Peter Orseolo, a supporter of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was overthrown by king [[Samuel Aba of Hungary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csongrad-megye.hu/turizmus/szoborpark/03.htm|title=Aba S\u00e1muel|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sulinet.hu/oroksegtar/data/100_falu/Feldebro/pages/003_aba.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206061247/http://www.sulinet.hu/oroksegtar/data/100_falu/Feldebro/pages/003_aba.htm |date=6 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] along with other [[regalia]]]]\n\nThis period of revolts ended during the reign of [[B\u00e9la I of Hungary|B\u00e9la I]]. Hungarian chroniclers praised [[B\u00e9la I of Hungary|B\u00e9la I]] for introducing new currency, such as the silver denarius, and for his benevolence to the former followers of his nephew, Solomon. The second greatest Hungarian king, also from the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, was [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], who stabilized and strengthened the kingdom. He was also canonized as a saint. Under his rule Hungarians successfully fought against the Cumans and acquired parts of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]] in 1091. Due to a dynastic crisis in Croatia, with the help of the local nobility who supported his claim, he managed to swiftly seize power in northern parts of the Croatian kingdom ([[Slavonia]]), as he was a claimant to the throne due to the fact that his sister was married to the late Croatian king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Zvonimir]] who died childless.\n\n[[File:Europe mediterranean 1190 cropped.jpg|thumb|Hungary (including [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croatia]]) in 1190, during the rule of [[B\u00e9la III]]]]\n\nHowever, kingship over all of Croatia would not be achieved until the reign of his successor [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]].

In 1242, after the end of the Mongol invasion, numerous fortresses to defend against future invasion were erected by [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]. In gratitude, the Hungarians acclaimed him as the \"Second Founder of the Homeland\", and the Hungarian Kingdom again became a considerable force in Europe. In 1260 [[B\u00e9la IV]] lost the War of Babenberg Succession, his army was defeated at the [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]] by the united Bohemian forces. However, in 1278 [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] and Austrian troops fully destroyed the Bohemian army at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]].\n[[File:Hungary 13th cent.png|thumb|Local autonomies (including [[Kuns\u00e1g|Cumania]], [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons]]) in the late 13th century]]\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{main|Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)}}\n\nThe \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty died out in 1301 with the death of [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]]. Subsequently, Hungary was ruled by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] until the end of the 14th century, and then by several non-dynastic rulers - notably [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Matthias Corvinus]] - until the early 16th century.\n\n==== The Anjou Age ====\n[[File:Chronicon Pictum I Karoly Robert.jpg|thumb|King [[Charles I of Hungary]]]]\n[[File:Magyarorsz\u00e1g a k\u00f6z\u00e9pkorban.png|thumb|The administrative divisions of medieval Hungary]]\n\nWhen Andrew III's predecessor, [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]], was assassinated in 1290, another nobleman was set up as titular King of Hungary: [[Charles Martel of Anjou]]. Charles Martel was the son of King [[Charles II of Naples]] and [[Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples|Mary of Hungary]], the sister of Ladislaus IV. However, Andrew III took the crown for himself, and ruled without inconvenience after Charles Martel's death in 1295.\n\nUpon Andrew's death in 1301, the throne was claimed by Charles Martel's son, Charles Robert. After a period of instability, he was finally crowned King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] in 1310. He implemented considerable economic reforms, and defeated the remaining nobility who were in opposition to royal rule, led by [[M\u00e1t\u00e9 Cs\u00e1k III]]. The kingdom of Hungary reached an age of prosperity and stability under Charles I. The gold mines of the Kingdom were extensively worked and soon Hungary reached a prominent standing in European gold production. The [[Hungarian forint|forint]] was introduced as a currency, replacing the ''denars'', and soon after Charles's reforms were implemented, the economy of the Kingdom started to prosper again, having fallen into a parlous state following the Mongol invasion.\n\nCharles exalted the cult to Saint Ladislaus I, using him as a symbol of bravery, justice and purity. He also venerated his uncle, [[Louis of Toulouse|Saint Louis of Toulouse]]. On the other hand, he gave importance to the cults of the princesses [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Saint Elizabeth]] and [[Saint Margaret of Hungary|Saint Margaret]], which added relevance to the lineage inheritance through the feminine branches.<ref>A szentek \u00e9lete I. (szerk. Dr. Di\u00f3s Istv\u00e1n), Szent Istv\u00e1n T\u00e1rsulat, 1984.</ref>\n\nCharles restored the royal power which had fallen into feudal lords' hands, and then made the lords swear loyalty to him. For this, he founded in 1326 the [[Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)|Order of Saint George]], which was the first secular [[chivalric order]] in the world, and included the most important noblemen of the Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Louis I (Heroes Square).jpg|thumb|[[Louis I of Hungary]] on [[H\u0151s\u00f6k tere|Heroes Square]], [[Budapest]]]]\n\nCharles married four times. His fourth wife was [[Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary|Elizabeth]], the daughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I of Poland]]. When Charles died in 1342, his eldest son by Elizabeth succeeded him as [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. In the first years of his reign, Louis was advised closely by his mother, making her one of the most influential personalities in the Kingdom.\n\nCharles had arranged the marriage of his second son, [[Andrew, Duke of Calabria|Andrew]], with his cousin [[Joanna I of Naples|Joanna]], the granddaughter of King [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]], in 1332. Robert died in 1343, bequeathing his kingdom to Joanna but excluding the claim of Andrew. In 1345, a group of noble Neapolitan conspirators murdered Andrew at [[Aversa]]. Almost immediately, Louis [[Neapolitan campaigns of Louis the Great|declared war on Naples]], conducting a first campaign in 1347\u20131348 and a second in 1350. He eventually signed a peace with Joanna in 1352. Louis also waged wars against the [[Serbian Empire]] and the [[Golden Horde]], restoring the Hungarian monarchs' authority over territories along the frontiers which had been lost during the previous decades.\n\nIn 1370 Louis's uncle, [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III of Poland]], died without male issue. Louis succeeded him, thus establishing the first [[union of Hungary and Poland]]. This lasted until 1382, when Louis himself died without male issue; his two daughters, [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]] and [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], then ascended the thrones of Hungary and Poland respectively.\n\n==== The Age of Sigismund ====\n[[File:Pisanello 024b.jpg|thumb|upright|left|King [[Sigismund of Hungary]]]]\n\n[[Louis I of Hungary]] always kept good and close relationships with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV of Luxembourg]] and finally proclaimed Charles's son [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] to succeed him as King of Hungary. Sigismund became a renowned king who created many improvements in the Hungarian law system and who rebuilt the palaces of Buda and Visegr\u00e1d. He brought materials from Austria and Bohemia and ordered the creation of the most luxurious building in all central Europe. In his laws can be seen the traces of the early [[mercantilism]]. He worked hard to keep the nobility under his control. A great part of his reign was dedicated to the fight with the Ottoman Empire, which started to extend its frontiers and influence to Europe. In 1396 was fought the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] against the Ottomans, which resulted in a defeat for the Hungarian-French forces led by Sigismund and [[Philip of Artois, Count of Eu]]. However, Sigismund continued to successfully contain the Ottoman forces outside of the Kingdom for the rest of his life.\n\nLosing popularity among the Hungarian nobility, Sigismund soon became victim of an attempt against his rule, and [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus of Anjou-Durazzo]] (the son of the murdered King of Naples Charles II of Hungary) was called in and crowned. Since the ceremony was not performed with the Hungarian Holy Crown, and in the city of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], it was considered illegitimate. Ladislaus stayed only few days in Hungarian territory and soon left it,  no longer an inconvenience for Sigismund. In 1408 he founded the [[Order of the Dragon]], which included the most of the relevant monarchs and noblemen of that region of Europe in that time. This was just a first step for what was coming. In 1410 he was elected [[King of the Romans]], making him the supreme monarch over the German territories. He had to deal with the [[Hussite]] movement, a religious reformist group that was born in Bohemia, and he presided at the [[Council of Constance]], where the theologist founder [[Jan Hus]], was judged. In 1419 Sigismund inherited the [[Crown of Bohemia]] after the death of his brother [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus of Luxembourg]], obtaining the formal control of three medieval states, but he struggled for control of Bohemia until the peace agreement with the Hussites and his coronation in 1436. In 1433 was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope and ruled until his death in 1437, leaving as his only heir his daughter [[Elizabeth of Luxembourg]] and her husband. The marriage of Elizabeth was arranged with the Duke [[Albert II, King of the Romans|Albert V of Austria]], who was later crowned as King Albert of Hungary in 1437.\n\n==== Hunyadi family{{anchor|The Hunyadi family}} ====\n[[File:Matthias Corvinus.jpg|thumb|upright|Matthias Corvinus as depicted in [[Johannes de Thurocz]]'s [[Chronica Hungarorum]]]]\n[[File:Map of Hungary in 1490.png|thumb|upright|Western conquests of [[Matthias Corvinus]]]]\n\nThe Hungarian kingdom's golden age was during the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458\u20131490), the son of [[John Hunyadi]]. His nickname was \"Matthias the Just\". He further improved the Hungarian economy and practised astute diplomacy in place of military action whenever possible. Matthias did undertake campaigning when necessary. From 1485 until his death, he occupied Vienna, aiming to limit the influence and meddling of the Holy Roman Empire in Hungary's affairs.\n\nAt the time of the initial Ottoman encroachment, the Hungarians successfully resisted conquest. John Hunyadi was leader of the [[Crusade of Varna]], in which the Hungarians tried to expel the Turks from the Balkans. Initially, they were successful, but later at the [[Battle of Varna]], the Ottomans won a decisive if [[Pyrrhic victory]]. [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland|Wladyslaw III]] was decapitated during this battle.\n\nIn 1456, John Hunyadi delivered a crushing defeat of the Ottomans at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]]. The [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)#Noon Bell|Noon Bell]] commemorates the fallen Christian warriors. In the 15th century, the [[Black Army of Hungary]] was a modern mercenary army, with the [[Hussar]]s the most skilled troops of the [[Hungarian cavalry]]. In 1479, under the leadership of [[P\u00e1l Kinizsi]], the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the [[Battle of Breadfield]]. The army of Hungary destroyed its enemies almost every time when Matthias was king.\n\nMatthias died without legitimate heir, and was thus succeeded by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellon]] (1490\u20131516), the son of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]]. In turn, Vladislaus was succeeded by his son [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] (1516\u201326).\n\nIn 1526, at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] led by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] annihilated the Hungarian army. In trying to escape, Louis II drowned in the Csele Creek. The leader of the Hungarian army, [[P\u00e1l Tomori]], also died in the battle.\n\n==Early modern history{{anchor|Kingdom of Hungary between 1526 and 1867}}==\n{{Main|Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)}}\n\n=== The divided kingdom ===\n{{See also|Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars|Ottoman Hungary|Royal Hungary|Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)}}\n\nDue to a serious defeat by the Ottomans ([[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]]) the central authority collapsed. The majority of Hungary's ruling elite elected [[John Z\u00e1polya]] (10 November 1526). A small minority of aristocrats sided with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], who was Archduke of [[Austria]], and was related to Louis by marriage. Due to previous agreements that the [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburgs]] would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without heirs, Ferdinand was elected king by a rump [[Diet of Hungary|diet]] in December 1526.\n\nAlthough the borders shifted frequently during this period, the three parts can be identified, more or less, as follows:\n* [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Royal Hungary]], which consisted of northern and western territories where Ferdinand I was recognized as king of Hungary. This part is viewed as defining the continuity of the Kingdom of Hungary. The territory along with Ottoman Hungary suffered greatly from the nearly constant wars taking place.\n* [[Ottoman Hungary]] The [[Great Alf\u00f6ld]] (i.e. most of present-day Hungary, including south-eastern Transdanubia and the [[Banat]]), partly without north-eastern present-day Hungary.\n* [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom]] under the [[Szapolyai]]. Note that this territory, often under Ottoman influence, was different from Transylvania proper and included various other territories sometimes referred to as [[Partium]]. Later the entity was called [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]].\n\n[[File:Reprise ch\u00e2teau Buda 1686.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Battle of Buda (1686)]]: Hungarians and the [[Holy League (1684)]] reconquering Buda]]\n\nOn 29 February 1528, King [[John I of Hungary]] received the support of the Ottoman Sultan. A three-sided conflict ensued as Ferdinand moved to assert his rule over as much of the Hungarian kingdom as he could. By 1529 the kingdom had been split into two parts: Habsburg Hungary and the \"eastern-Kingdom of Hungary\". At this time there were no Ottomans on Hungarian territories, except Srem's important castles. In 1532, [[Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107]] defended [[K\u0151szeg]] and stopped a powerful Ottoman army. By 1541, the fall of [[Buda Castle|Buda]] marked a further division of Hungary into three areas. The country remained divided until the end of the 17th century.\n\nOn 1 May 1566, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] led an Ottoman invasion of Habsburg-controlled Hungary, the Ottoman forces of which was one of the most sizable armies he had led in his rule of 46 years.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen R|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1326\u20131699.|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|year=2003|isbn=0-415-96913-1|location=New York (USA)|pages=55}}</ref> After reaching Belgrade and met with [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]] on 27 June, Suleiman I learned of that a Croatian-Hungarian nobleman, [[Nikola IV Zrinski]], Ban of Croatia, accomplished an attacked on an Ottoman military camp at Sikl\u00f3s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Shelton|first=Edward|title=The book of battles: or, Daring deeds by land and sea|publisher=Houlston and Wright|year=1867|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=82-83}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen R.|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1326\u20131699|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|year=2003|isbn=0-415-96913-1|location=New York, USA|pages=55-56}}</ref> Suleiman I held off his attack of Eger for the time being, and began to set off towards Nikola IV Zrinski's fortress at [[Szigetv\u00e1r]]. From the 2 August to the 7 September, the Ottoman forces had laid siege to the fortress with a force, at the least, of 150,000 against Zrinski's 2,300 defenders. While the [[Siege of Szigetv\u00e1r|siege]] turned into a victory for the Ottomans, it came at the cost of: 25,000 Ottoman soldiers and Suleiman I, who before the final battle of Szigetv\u00e1r, due to natural causes of old age and illness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the following centuries there were numerous attempts to push back the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces, such as the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] or Thirteen Years' War (29 July 1593 \u2013 1604/11 November 1606) led by a coalition of Christian forces. In 1644 the Winter Campaign by [[Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] burnt the crucial Suleiman Bridge of [[Osijek]] in eastern [[Slavonia]], interrupting a Turkish supply line in Hungary. At the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)]], Austrians and Hungarians defeated the Turkish army.\n\nAfter the Ottoman siege of Vienna failed in 1683, the Habsburgs went on the offensive against the Turks. By the end of the 17th century, they managed to invade the remainder of the historical Kingdom of Hungary and the principality of Transylvania. For a while in 1686, the capital Buda was again free from the Ottoman Empire, with the aid of other Europeans.\n\n=== The Kuruc age ===\n{{Main|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence}}\n[[File:Georg Philipp Rugendas Anfall is gewagt, die M\u00f6chten mit angreiffen.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Kuruc-Labanc, [[kuruc]] preparing to attack traveling coach and riders, c. 1705]]\n[[File:Kingdom of Hungary counties.svg|thumb|Counties of the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]] around 1880]]\n\nR\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence (1703\u20131711) was the first significant freedom fight in Hungary against absolutist Habsburg rule. It was fought by a group of noblemen, wealthy and high-ranking progressives who wanted to put an end to the inequality of power relations, led by Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi (II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Ferenc in Hungarian). Its main aims were to protect the rights of the different social orders, and to ensure the economic and social development of the country. Due to the adverse balance of forces, the political situation in Europe and internal conflicts the freedom fight was eventually suppressed, but it succeeded in keeping Hungary from becoming an integral part of the Habsburg Empire, and its constitution was kept, even though it was only a formality.\n\nAfter the departure of the Ottomans, the Habsburgs dominated the Hungarian Kingdom. The Hungarians' renewed desire for freedom led to R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence. The most important reasons of the war were the new and higher taxes and a renewed Protestant movement. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was a Hungarian nobleman, son of the legendary heroine ''[[Jelena Zrinska|Ilona Zr\u00ednyi]]''. He spent a part of his youth in Austrian captivity. The ''Kurucs'' were troops of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. Initially, the [[Kuruc]] army attained several important victories due to their superior light cavalry. Their weapons were mostly pistols, light sabre and ''[[fokos]]''. At the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1705)]], [[J\u00e1nos Botty\u00e1n]] decisively defeated the Austrian army. The Hungarian colonel [[\u00c1d\u00e1m Balogh]] nearly captured [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], the King of Hungary and Emperor of Austria.\n\nIn 1708, the Habsburgs finally defeated the main Hungarian army at [[Battle of Trencs\u00e9n]], and this diminished the further effectiveness of the Kuruc army. While the Hungarians were exhausted by the fights, the Austrians defeated the French army in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. They could send more troops to Hungary against the rebels.

Throughout the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary had its own diet (parliament) and constitution, but the members of the Governor's Council (''Helytart\u00f3tan\u00e1cs'', the office of the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]]) were appointed by the Habsburg monarch, and the superior economic institution, the [[Hungarian Chamber]], was directly subordinated to the [[Court Chamber]] in [[Vienna]].\n\nThe Hungarian language reform started under the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. The reform age of Hungary was started by [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] a Hungarian noble, who built one of the greatest bridges of Hungary, the [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge]].

The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 sought to redress the long suppressed desire for political change, namely independence. The Hungarian National Guard was created by young Hungarian patriots in 1848. In literature, this was best expressed by the greatest poet of the revolution, [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]].\n\nAs war broke out with Austria, Hungarian military successes, which included the campaigns of the Hungarian general, [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], forced the Austrians on the defensive. One of the most famous battles of the revolution, the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]], was fought on 29 September 1848, when the Hungarian revolutionary army led by Lieutenant-General J\u00e1nos M\u00f3ga defeated the troops of the Croatian Ban [[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]]. Fearing defeat, the Austrians pleaded for Russian help. The combined forces of the two empires quelled the revolution. The desired political changes of 1848 were again suppressed until the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]].\n\n'''Population 1910 (without Croatia-Slavonia)'''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.antikvarium.hu/konyv/torteneti-statisztikai-idosorok-1867-1992-i-567680|title=T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti statisztikai id\u0151sorok 1867-1992 I.: N\u00e9pess\u00e9g-n\u00e9pmozgalom|last=Fajth|first=G\u00e1sp\u00e1r|last2=Dr Gyulay|first2=Ferenc|last3=Dr Klinger|first3=Andr\u00e1s|last4=Dr Harcsa|first4=Istv\u00e1n|last5=Kamar\u00e1s|first5=Ferenc|last6=Dr Csah\u00f3k|first6=Istv\u00e1n|last7=Dr Ehrlich|first7=\u00c9va|isbn=9789637070433|language=Hungarian}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n| style=\"background:#ddffdd;\" |'''Ethnicity'''\n! style=\"background:#ddffdd;\" |'''Number'''\n! style=\"background:#ddffdd;\" |Percentage\n|-\n|Hungarian\n|align=\"center\"|9 944 627\n|align=\"center\"|54.44 %\n|-\n|Romanian\n|align=\"center\"|2 948 186\n|align=\"center\"|16.14 %\n|-\n|Slovak\n|align=\"center\"|1 946 357\n|align=\"center\"|10.65 %\n|-\n|German\n|align=\"center\"|1 903 357\n|align=\"center\"|10.42 %\n|-\n|Ruthenian\n|align=\"center\"|464 270\n|align=\"center\"|2.54 %\n|-\n|Serbian\n|align=\"center\"|461 516\n|align=\"center\"|2.52 %\n|-\n|Croatian\n|align=\"center\"|194 808\n|align=\"center\"|1.06 %\n|-\n|Other\n|align=\"center\"|401 412\n|align=\"center\"|2.19 %\n|-\n|All\n|align=\"center\"|18 264 533\n|align=\"center\"|100 %\n|}\n\n== Austria-Hungary (1867\u20131918) ==\n{{Main|Kingdom of Hungary (1867\u20131918)}}\n[[File:Ferenc J\u00f3zsef koron\u00e1z\u00e1sa Bud\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Coronation]] of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] and [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elisabeth]] at [[Matthias Church]], [[Buda]], 8 June 1867]]\nFollowing the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the Habsburg Monarchy became the \"dual monarchy\" of [[Austria-Hungary]]. The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the existence of the Dual Monarchy. Technological change accelerated industrialization and urbanization. The capitalist way of production spread throughout the Empire during its fifty-year existence and obsolete medieval institutions continued to disappear. By the early 20th century, most of the Empire began to experience rapid economic growth. The [[GNP per capita]] grew roughly 1.45% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1.00%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).\n\nThe lands of the Hungarian Crown (comprising the Kingdom of Hungary proper, into which Transylvania was fully incorporated, and the [[Kingdom of Croatia\u2013Slavonia]], which maintained a distinct identity and internal autonomy) were granted equal status with the Austrian Empire. Each of the two states comprising Austria-Hungary exercised considerable independence, with certain institutions, notably the reigning house, defence, foreign affairs, and finances for common expenditures, remaining under joint management. This arrangement lasted until 1918, when the [[Central Powers]] went down in defeat in World War I.\n\n== Transitions (1918 to 1920) == <!-- may need a better heading (see TALK) -->\n\n=== Two short-lived republics === <!-- may need a better heading (see TALK#Transitions (1918 to 1920) -->\n{{Main|Hungarian Democratic Republic|Hungarian Soviet Republic}}\n\nThe '''Hungarian Soviet Republic''' or '''Hungarian Republic of Councils''' ({{lang-hu|Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g}}<ref>[http://hu.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Forradalmi_Korm\u00e1nyz\u00f3tan\u00e1cs_XXVI._sz\u00e1m\u00fa_rendelete A Forradalmi Korm\u00e1nyz\u00f3tan\u00e1cs XXVI. sz\u00e1m\u00fa rendelete (in Hungarian)]</ref> or ''Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Szocialista Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ges Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g''<ref>Official name of the state between 23 June and 1 August according to the constitution, see: [http://hu.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Magyarorsz\u00e1gi_Szocialista_Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ges_Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g_alkotm\u00e1nya A Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Szocialista Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ges Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g alkotm\u00e1nya (in Hungarian)]</ref>) was a short-lived independent [[communist state]] established in [[Hungary]].\n\nIt lasted only from 21 March until 1 August 1919.

The areas that were allocated to neighbouring countries in total (and each of them separately) possessed a majority of non-Hungarian population, but more than 3.3 million ethnic Hungarians were left outside the new borders of Hungary.

Horthy appointed Count [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] as Prime Minister in July 1920. His government issued a [[numerus clausus]] law, limiting admission of \"political insecure elements\" (these were often Jews) to universities and, in order to quiet rural discontent, took initial steps towards fulfilling a promise of major land reform by dividing about 3,850&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> from the largest estates into smallholdings. Teleki's government resigned, however, after [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]] unsuccessfully attempted to retake Hungary's throne in March 1921. The return of King Charles produced split parties between conservatives who favored a Habsburg restoration and nationalist right-wing radicals who supported election of a Hungarian king. Count [[Istv\u00e1n Bethlen]], a non-affiliated right-wing member of the parliament, took advantage of this rift forming a new Party of Unity under his leadership. Horthy then appointed Bethlen prime minister. Charles IV died soon after he failed a second time to reclaim the throne in October 1921. (For more detail on Charles's attempts to retake the throne, see ''[[Charles IV of Hungary's conflict with Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]''.)\n\n[[File:RetratoIstvanBethlen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Istv\u00e1n Bethlen]], the Prime Minister of Hungary]]\n\nAs prime minister, Bethlen dominated Hungarian politics between 1921 and 1931. He fashioned a political machine by amending the electoral law, providing jobs in the expanding bureaucracy to his supporters, and manipulating elections in rural areas. Bethlen restored order to the country by giving the radical counterrevolutionaries payoffs and government jobs in exchange for ceasing their campaign of terror against Jews and leftists. In 1921, he made a deal with the Social Democrats and trade unions (called Bethlen-Peyer Pact), agreeing, among other things, to legalize their activities and free political prisoners in return for their pledge to refrain from spreading [[Magyarization|anti-Hungarian]] propaganda, calling political strikes, and organizing the peasantry. Bethlen brought Hungary into the [[League of Nations]] in 1922 and out of international isolation by signing a treaty of friendship with [[Italy]] in 1927. The revision of the Treaty of Trianon rose to the top of Hungary's political agenda and the strategy employed by Bethlen consisted by strengthening the economy and building relations with stronger nations. Revision of the treaty had such a broad backing in Hungary that Bethlen used it, at least in part, to deflect criticism of his economic, social, and political policies.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] induced a drop in the standard of living and the political mood of the country shifted further toward the right. In 1932 Horthy appointed a new prime-minister, [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]], who changed the course of Hungarian policy towards closer cooperation with Germany. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s signed a trade agreement with Germany that drew Hungary's economy out of depression but made Hungary dependent on the German economy for both raw materials and markets. On 2 November 1938, as the result of the [[First Vienna Award]] parts of Czechoslovakia - [[Upper Hungary|Southern Slovakia]] and a part of Carpathian Ruthenia - were returned to Hungary, an area amounting to 11,927&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a population of 869,299 (86.5% of which were Hungarians according to the 1941 census). Between 5 November and 10 November, Hungarian armed forces peacefully occupied the newly transferred territories.<ref>Thomas, ''The Royal Hungarian Army in World War II'', pg. 11</ref> Hitler later promised to transfer all of Slovakia to Hungary in exchange for a military alliance, but his offer was rejected. Instead, Horthy chose to pursue a territorial revision to be decided along ethnic lines. In March 1939, the Czecho-Slovak Republic was dissolved, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded it]], and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was established. On 14 March, [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]] declared itself to be an independent state.\n\nOn 15 March, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] declared itself to be an independent state. Hungary rejected the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine and, between 14 March and 18 March, Hungarian armed forces occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and ousted the government of [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]. By contrast, Hungary recognized the Nazi [[puppet state]] of Slovakia led by the [[Clerical fascism|Clerical Fascist]] [[Jozef Tiso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3430.htm|title=Slovakia|publisher=}}</ref> In September 1940, with troops massing on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border, war was averted by the [[Second Vienna Award]]. This award transferred the northern half of [[Transylvania]] to Hungary, with a total area of 43,492&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a total population of 2,578,100 with a 53.5% Hungarian majority according to the 1941 census. By dividing Transylvania between Romania and Hungary, Hitler was able to ease tensions in Hungary. In October 1940, the Germans initiated a reciprocity policy between Romania and Hungary which was continued until the end of World War II. The region of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Sub-Carpathia]] was given special autonomous status with the intention that (eventually) it would be self-governed by the Ruthenian minority.\n\n=== During World War II 1941\u20131945{{anchor|During World War II 1941\u20131945}} ===\n{{Main|Hungary during World War II}}\n[[File:Kingdom of Hungary (1942).svg|thumb|The Kingdom of Hungary in 1942, during World War II]]\n\nAfter being granted part of southern Czechoslovakia and Subcarpathia by the Germans and Italians in the [[First Vienna Award]] of 1938, and then northern Transylvania in the [[Second Vienna Award]] of 1940, Hungary participated in their first military maneuvers on the side of the Axis powers in 1941. Thus, the Hungarian army was part of the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], gaining some more territory and joining the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] in the process. On 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Hungary joined the German effort and declared war on the Soviet Union on 26 June, and entered [[World War II]] on the side of the Axis. In late 1941, the Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front experienced success at the [[Battle of Uman]]. By 1943, after the [[Hungarian Second Army]] suffered extremely heavy losses at the river Don, the Hungarian government sought to negotiate a surrender with the Allies. On 19 March 1944, as a result of this duplicity, German troops occupied Hungary in what was known as [[Operation Margarethe]]. By then it was clear that Hungarian politics would be suppressed according to Hitler's intention to hold the country in the war on the side of the Nazi Third Reich because of its strategic location. On 15 October 1944, Horthy made a token effort to disengage Hungary from the war. The Germans launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and Horthy's regime was replaced by a [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|fascist puppet government]] under the pro-German [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] leader [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], thus effectively ending the possibility for independent actions in the war. However, the form of government was only changed to a republic two years later.\n\n=== Transitioning into a republic ===\nFollowing its [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|occupation of Hungary in 1944]], the [[Soviet Union]] imposed harsh conditions allowing the Russians to seize important material assets and control internal affairs.<ref name=\"wettig51\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=51}}</ref> After the [[Red Army]] set up police organs to persecute \n\"class enemies\", the Soviets assumed that the impoverished Hungarian populace would support the Communists in the coming elections.<ref name=\"wettig85\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=85}}</ref> The Communists fared poorly, receiving only 17% of the vote, resulting in a [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|coalition government]] under Prime Minister [[Zolt\u00e1n Tildy]].<ref>Norton, Donald H.

The Soviet occupation was then restored, lasting until 1989 when the Communists agreed to give up their monopoly on power, paving the way for [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|free elections in March 1990]]. In today's republic, the Kingdom is regarded as one long stage in the development of the state.

He fought against [[Kopp\u00e1ny]] and in 998, with [[Bavaria]]n help, defeated him near [[Veszpr\u00e9m]]. The Catholic Church received powerful support from Stephen I, who with Christian Hungarians and German knights wanted a Christian kingdom established in Central Europe. [[Stephen I of Hungary]] was [[canonized]] as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[saint]] in 1083 and an [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] saint in 2000.\n\nAfter his death, a period of revolts and conflict for supremacy ensued between the royalty and the nobles. In 1051 armies of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] tried to conquer Hungary, but they were defeated at [[V\u00e9rtes Mountain]]. The armies of the Holy Roman Empire continued to suffer defeats; the second greatest battle was at the town now called [[Bratislava]], in 1052.

Hungarian chroniclers praised [[B\u00e9la I of Hungary|B\u00e9la I]] for introducing new currency, such as the silver denarius, and for his benevolence to the former followers of his nephew, Solomon. The second greatest Hungarian king, also from the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, was [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], who stabilized and strengthened the kingdom. He was also canonized as a saint. Under his rule Hungarians successfully fought against the Cumans and acquired parts of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]] in 1091. Due to a dynastic crisis in Croatia, with the help of the local nobility who supported his claim, he managed to swiftly seize power in northern parts of the Croatian kingdom ([[Slavonia]]), as he was a claimant to the throne due to the fact that his sister was married to the late Croatian king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Zvonimir]] who died childless.\n\n[[File:Europe mediterranean 1190 cropped.jpg|thumb|Hungary (including [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croatia]]) in 1190, during the rule of [[B\u00e9la III]]]]\n\nHowever, kingship over all of Croatia would not be achieved until the reign of his successor [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]].

In 1242, after the end of the Mongol invasion, numerous fortresses to defend against future invasion were erected by [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]. In gratitude, the Hungarians acclaimed him as the \"Second Founder of the Homeland\", and the Hungarian Kingdom again became a considerable force in Europe. In 1260 [[B\u00e9la IV]] lost the War of Babenberg Succession, his army was defeated at the [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]] by the united Bohemian forces. However, in 1278 [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] and Austrian troops fully destroyed the Bohemian army at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]].\n[[File:Hungary 13th cent.png|thumb|Local autonomies (including [[Kuns\u00e1g|Cumania]], [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons]]) in the late 13th century]]\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{main|Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)}}\n\nThe \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty died out in 1301 with the death of [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]]. Subsequently, Hungary was ruled by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] until the end of the 14th century, and then by several non-dynastic rulers - notably [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Matthias Corvinus]] - until the early 16th century.\n\n==== The Anjou Age ====\n[[File:Chronicon Pictum I Karoly Robert.jpg|thumb|King [[Charles I of Hungary]]]]\n[[File:Magyarorsz\u00e1g a k\u00f6z\u00e9pkorban.png|thumb|The administrative divisions of medieval Hungary]]\n\nWhen Andrew III's predecessor, [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]], was assassinated in 1290, another nobleman was set up as titular King of Hungary: [[Charles Martel of Anjou]]. Charles Martel was the son of King [[Charles II of Naples]] and [[Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples|Mary of Hungary]], the sister of Ladislaus IV. However, Andrew III took the crown for himself, and ruled without inconvenience after Charles Martel's death in 1295.\n\nUpon Andrew's death in 1301, the throne was claimed by Charles Martel's son, Charles Robert. After a period of instability, he was finally crowned King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] in 1310. He implemented considerable economic reforms, and defeated the remaining nobility who were in opposition to royal rule, led by [[M\u00e1t\u00e9 Cs\u00e1k III]]. The kingdom of Hungary reached an age of prosperity and stability under Charles I. The gold mines of the Kingdom were extensively worked and soon Hungary reached a prominent standing in European gold production. The [[Hungarian forint|forint]] was introduced as a currency, replacing the ''denars'', and soon after Charles's reforms were implemented, the economy of the Kingdom started to prosper again, having fallen into a parlous state following the Mongol invasion.\n\nCharles exalted the cult to Saint Ladislaus I, using him as a symbol of bravery, justice and purity. He also venerated his uncle, [[Louis of Toulouse|Saint Louis of Toulouse]]. On the other hand, he gave importance to the cults of the princesses [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Saint Elizabeth]] and [[Saint Margaret of Hungary|Saint Margaret]], which added relevance to the lineage inheritance through the feminine branches.<ref>A szentek \u00e9lete I. (szerk. Dr. Di\u00f3s Istv\u00e1n), Szent Istv\u00e1n T\u00e1rsulat, 1984.</ref>\n\nCharles restored the royal power which had fallen into feudal lords' hands, and then made the lords swear loyalty to him. For this, he founded in 1326 the [[Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)|Order of Saint George]], which was the first secular [[chivalric order]] in the world, and included the most important noblemen of the Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Louis I (Heroes Square).jpg|thumb|[[Louis I of Hungary]] on [[H\u0151s\u00f6k tere|Heroes Square]], [[Budapest]]]]\n\nCharles married four times. His fourth wife was [[Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary|Elizabeth]], the daughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I of Poland]]. When Charles died in 1342, his eldest son by Elizabeth succeeded him as [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. In the first years of his reign, Louis was advised closely by his mother, making her one of the most influential personalities in the Kingdom.\n\nCharles had arranged the marriage of his second son, [[Andrew, Duke of Calabria|Andrew]], with his cousin [[Joanna I of Naples|Joanna]], the granddaughter of King [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]], in 1332. Robert died in 1343, bequeathing his kingdom to Joanna but excluding the claim of Andrew. In 1345, a group of noble Neapolitan conspirators murdered Andrew at [[Aversa]]. Almost immediately, Louis [[Neapolitan campaigns of Louis the Great|declared war on Naples]], conducting a first campaign in 1347\u20131348 and a second in 1350. He eventually signed a peace with Joanna in 1352. Louis also waged wars against the [[Serbian Empire]] and the [[Golden Horde]], restoring the Hungarian monarchs' authority over territories along the frontiers which had been lost during the previous decades.\n\nIn 1370 Louis's uncle, [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III of Poland]], died without male issue. Louis succeeded him, thus establishing the first [[union of Hungary and Poland]]. This lasted until 1382, when Louis himself died without male issue; his two daughters, [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]] and [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], then ascended the thrones of Hungary and Poland respectively.\n\n==== The Age of Sigismund ====\n[[File:Pisanello 024b.jpg|thumb|upright|left|King [[Sigismund of Hungary]]]]\n\n[[Louis I of Hungary]] always kept good and close relationships with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV of Luxembourg]] and finally proclaimed Charles's son [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] to succeed him as King of Hungary. Sigismund became a renowned king who created many improvements in the Hungarian law system and who rebuilt the palaces of Buda and Visegr\u00e1d. He brought materials from Austria and Bohemia and ordered the creation of the most luxurious building in all central Europe. In his laws can be seen the traces of the early [[mercantilism]]. He worked hard to keep the nobility under his control. A great part of his reign was dedicated to the fight with the Ottoman Empire, which started to extend its frontiers and influence to Europe. In 1396 was fought the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] against the Ottomans, which resulted in a defeat for the Hungarian-French forces led by Sigismund and [[Philip of Artois, Count of Eu]]. However, Sigismund continued to successfully contain the Ottoman forces outside of the Kingdom for the rest of his life.\n\nLosing popularity among the Hungarian nobility, Sigismund soon became victim of an attempt against his rule, and [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus of Anjou-Durazzo]] (the son of the murdered King of Naples Charles II of Hungary) was called in and crowned. Since the ceremony was not performed with the Hungarian Holy Crown, and in the city of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], it was considered illegitimate. Ladislaus stayed only few days in Hungarian territory and soon left it,  no longer an inconvenience for Sigismund. In 1408 he founded the [[Order of the Dragon]], which included the most of the relevant monarchs and noblemen of that region of Europe in that time. This was just a first step for what was coming. In 1410 he was elected [[King of the Romans]], making him the supreme monarch over the German territories. He had to deal with the [[Hussite]] movement, a religious reformist group that was born in Bohemia, and he presided at the [[Council of Constance]], where the theologist founder [[Jan Hus]], was judged. In 1419 Sigismund inherited the [[Crown of Bohemia]] after the death of his brother [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus of Luxembourg]], obtaining the formal control of three medieval states, but he struggled for control of Bohemia until the peace agreement with the Hussites and his coronation in 1436. In 1433 was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope and ruled until his death in 1437, leaving as his only heir his daughter [[Elizabeth of Luxembourg]] and her husband. The marriage of Elizabeth was arranged with the Duke [[Albert II, King of the Romans|Albert V of Austria]], who was later crowned as King Albert of Hungary in 1437.\n\n==== Hunyadi family{{anchor|The Hunyadi family}} ====\n[[File:Matthias Corvinus.jpg|thumb|upright|Matthias Corvinus as depicted in [[Johannes de Thurocz]]'s [[Chronica Hungarorum]]]]\n[[File:Map of Hungary in 1490.png|thumb|upright|Western conquests of [[Matthias Corvinus]]]]\n\nThe Hungarian kingdom's golden age was during the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458\u20131490), the son of [[John Hunyadi]]. His nickname was \"Matthias the Just\". He further improved the Hungarian economy and practised astute diplomacy in place of military action whenever possible. Matthias did undertake campaigning when necessary. From 1485 until his death, he occupied Vienna, aiming to limit the influence and meddling of the Holy Roman Empire in Hungary's affairs.\n\nAt the time of the initial Ottoman encroachment, the Hungarians successfully resisted conquest. John Hunyadi was leader of the [[Crusade of Varna]], in which the Hungarians tried to expel the Turks from the Balkans. Initially, they were successful, but later at the [[Battle of Varna]], the Ottomans won a decisive if [[Pyrrhic victory]]. [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland|Wladyslaw III]] was decapitated during this battle.\n\nIn 1456, John Hunyadi delivered a crushing defeat of the Ottomans at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]]. The [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)#Noon Bell|Noon Bell]] commemorates the fallen Christian warriors. In the 15th century, the [[Black Army of Hungary]] was a modern mercenary army, with the [[Hussar]]s the most skilled troops of the [[Hungarian cavalry]]. In 1479, under the leadership of [[P\u00e1l Kinizsi]], the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the [[Battle of Breadfield]]. The army of Hungary destroyed its enemies almost every time when Matthias was king.\n\nMatthias died without legitimate heir, and was thus succeeded by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellon]] (1490\u20131516), the son of [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]]. In turn, Vladislaus was succeeded by his son [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] (1516\u201326).\n\nIn 1526, at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], the forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] led by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] annihilated the Hungarian army. In trying to escape, Louis II drowned in the Csele Creek. The leader of the Hungarian army, [[P\u00e1l Tomori]], also died in the battle.\n\n==Early modern history{{anchor|Kingdom of Hungary between 1526 and 1867}}==\n{{Main|Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)}}\n\n=== The divided kingdom ===\n{{See also|Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars|Ottoman Hungary|Royal Hungary|Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)}}\n\nDue to a serious defeat by the Ottomans ([[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]]) the central authority collapsed. The majority of Hungary's ruling elite elected [[John Z\u00e1polya]] (10 November 1526). A small minority of aristocrats sided with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], who was Archduke of [[Austria]], and was related to Louis by marriage. Due to previous agreements that the [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburgs]] would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without heirs, Ferdinand was elected king by a rump [[Diet of Hungary|diet]] in December 1526.\n\nAlthough the borders shifted frequently during this period, the three parts can be identified, more or less, as follows:\n* [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Royal Hungary]], which consisted of northern and western territories where Ferdinand I was recognized as king of Hungary. This part is viewed as defining the continuity of the Kingdom of Hungary. The territory along with Ottoman Hungary suffered greatly from the nearly constant wars taking place.\n* [[Ottoman Hungary]] The [[Great Alf\u00f6ld]] (i.e. most of present-day Hungary, including south-eastern Transdanubia and the [[Banat]]), partly without north-eastern present-day Hungary.\n* [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom]] under the [[Szapolyai]]. Note that this territory, often under Ottoman influence, was different from Transylvania proper and included various other territories sometimes referred to as [[Partium]]. Later the entity was called [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]].\n\n[[File:Reprise ch\u00e2teau Buda 1686.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Battle of Buda (1686)]]: Hungarians and the [[Holy League (1684)]] reconquering Buda]]\n\nOn 29 February 1528, King [[John I of Hungary]] received the support of the Ottoman Sultan. A three-sided conflict ensued as Ferdinand moved to assert his rule over as much of the Hungarian kingdom as he could. By 1529 the kingdom had been split into two parts: Habsburg Hungary and the \"eastern-Kingdom of Hungary\". At this time there were no Ottomans on Hungarian territories, except Srem's important castles. In 1532, [[Nikola Juri\u0161i\u0107]] defended [[K\u0151szeg]] and stopped a powerful Ottoman army. By 1541, the fall of [[Buda Castle|Buda]] marked a further division of Hungary into three areas.

In 1644 the Winter Campaign by [[Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] burnt the crucial Suleiman Bridge of [[Osijek]] in eastern [[Slavonia]], interrupting a Turkish supply line in Hungary. At the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)]], Austrians and Hungarians defeated the Turkish army.\n\nAfter the Ottoman siege of Vienna failed in 1683, the Habsburgs went on the offensive against the Turks. By the end of the 17th century, they managed to invade the remainder of the historical Kingdom of Hungary and the principality of Transylvania. For a while in 1686, the capital Buda was again free from the Ottoman Empire, with the aid of other Europeans.\n\n=== The Kuruc age ===\n{{Main|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence}}\n[[File:Georg Philipp Rugendas Anfall is gewagt, die M\u00f6chten mit angreiffen.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Kuruc-Labanc, [[kuruc]] preparing to attack traveling coach and riders, c. 1705]]\n[[File:Kingdom of Hungary counties.svg|thumb|Counties of the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]] around 1880]]\n\nR\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence (1703\u20131711) was the first significant freedom fight in Hungary against absolutist Habsburg rule. It was fought by a group of noblemen, wealthy and high-ranking progressives who wanted to put an end to the inequality of power relations, led by Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi (II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Ferenc in Hungarian). Its main aims were to protect the rights of the different social orders, and to ensure the economic and social development of the country. Due to the adverse balance of forces, the political situation in Europe and internal conflicts the freedom fight was eventually suppressed, but it succeeded in keeping Hungary from becoming an integral part of the Habsburg Empire, and its constitution was kept, even though it was only a formality.\n\nAfter the departure of the Ottomans, the Habsburgs dominated the Hungarian Kingdom. The Hungarians' renewed desire for freedom led to R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence. The most important reasons of the war were the new and higher taxes and a renewed Protestant movement. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi was a Hungarian nobleman, son of the legendary heroine ''[[Jelena Zrinska|Ilona Zr\u00ednyi]]''. He spent a part of his youth in Austrian captivity. The ''Kurucs'' were troops of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. Initially, the [[Kuruc]] army attained several important victories due to their superior light cavalry. Their weapons were mostly pistols, light sabre and ''[[fokos]]''. At the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1705)]], [[J\u00e1nos Botty\u00e1n]] decisively defeated the Austrian army. The Hungarian colonel [[\u00c1d\u00e1m Balogh]] nearly captured [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], the King of Hungary and Emperor of Austria.\n\nIn 1708, the Habsburgs finally defeated the main Hungarian army at [[Battle of Trencs\u00e9n]], and this diminished the further effectiveness of the Kuruc army. While the Hungarians were exhausted by the fights, the Austrians defeated the French army in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. They could send more troops to Hungary against the rebels. Transylvania became part of Hungary again starting at the end of the 17th century, and was led by governors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603323/Transylvania|title=Transylvania - region, Romania|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Grand%20Principality%20of%20Transylvania|title=Grand Principality of Transylvania|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Age of Enlightenment ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)}}\n[[File:Hungarians in Hungary (1890).png|thumb|Distribution of Hungarians in the Kingdom of Hungary and the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (1890)]]\n[[File:Ethnographic map of hungary 1910 by teleki carte rouge.jpg|thumb| Ethnic map of the Hungary proper publicized by the Hungarian Trianon delegation.

The reform age of Hungary was started by [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] a Hungarian noble, who built one of the greatest bridges of Hungary, the [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge]].

The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 sought to redress the long suppressed desire for political change, namely independence. The Hungarian National Guard was created by young Hungarian patriots in 1848. In literature, this was best expressed by the greatest poet of the revolution, [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]].\n\nAs war broke out with Austria, Hungarian military successes, which included the campaigns of the Hungarian general, [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], forced the Austrians on the defensive. One of the most famous battles of the revolution, the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]], was fought on 29 September 1848, when the Hungarian revolutionary army led by Lieutenant-General J\u00e1nos M\u00f3ga defeated the troops of the Croatian Ban [[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]]. Fearing defeat, the Austrians pleaded for Russian help. The combined forces of the two empires quelled the revolution.

The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the existence of the Dual Monarchy. Technological change accelerated industrialization and urbanization. The capitalist way of production spread throughout the Empire during its fifty-year existence and obsolete medieval institutions continued to disappear. By the early 20th century, most of the Empire began to experience rapid economic growth. The [[GNP per capita]] grew roughly 1.45% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1.00%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).\n\nThe lands of the Hungarian Crown (comprising the Kingdom of Hungary proper, into which Transylvania was fully incorporated, and the [[Kingdom of Croatia\u2013Slavonia]], which maintained a distinct identity and internal autonomy) were granted equal status with the Austrian Empire. Each of the two states comprising Austria-Hungary exercised considerable independence, with certain institutions, notably the reigning house, defence, foreign affairs, and finances for common expenditures, remaining under joint management. This arrangement lasted until 1918, when the [[Central Powers]] went down in defeat in World War I.\n\n== Transitions (1918 to 1920) == <!-- may need a better heading (see TALK) -->\n\n=== Two short-lived republics === <!-- may need a better heading (see TALK#Transitions (1918 to 1920) -->\n{{Main|Hungarian Democratic Republic|Hungarian Soviet Republic}}\n\nThe '''Hungarian Soviet Republic''' or '''Hungarian Republic of Councils''' ({{lang-hu|Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g}}<ref>[http://hu.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Forradalmi_Korm\u00e1nyz\u00f3tan\u00e1cs_XXVI._sz\u00e1m\u00fa_rendelete A Forradalmi Korm\u00e1nyz\u00f3tan\u00e1cs XXVI. sz\u00e1m\u00fa rendelete (in Hungarian)]</ref> or ''Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Szocialista Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ges Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g''<ref>Official name of the state between 23 June and 1 August according to the constitution, see: [http://hu.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Magyarorsz\u00e1gi_Szocialista_Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ges_Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g_alkotm\u00e1nya A Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Szocialista Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ges Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g alkotm\u00e1nya (in Hungarian)]</ref>) was a short-lived independent [[communist state]] established in [[Hungary]].\n\nIt lasted only from 21 March until 1 August 1919.

Horthy appointed Count [[P\u00e1l Teleki]] as Prime Minister in July 1920. His government issued a [[numerus clausus]] law, limiting admission of \"political insecure elements\" (these were often Jews) to universities and, in order to quiet rural discontent, took initial steps towards fulfilling a promise of major land reform by dividing about 3,850&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> from the largest estates into smallholdings. Teleki's government resigned, however, after [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]] unsuccessfully attempted to retake Hungary's throne in March 1921. The return of King Charles produced split parties between conservatives who favored a Habsburg restoration and nationalist right-wing radicals who supported election of a Hungarian king. Count [[Istv\u00e1n Bethlen]], a non-affiliated right-wing member of the parliament, took advantage of this rift forming a new Party of Unity under his leadership. Horthy then appointed Bethlen prime minister. Charles IV died soon after he failed a second time to reclaim the throne in October 1921. (For more detail on Charles's attempts to retake the throne, see ''[[Charles IV of Hungary's conflict with Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]''.)\n\n[[File:RetratoIstvanBethlen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Istv\u00e1n Bethlen]], the Prime Minister of Hungary]]\n\nAs prime minister, Bethlen dominated Hungarian politics between 1921 and 1931. He fashioned a political machine by amending the electoral law, providing jobs in the expanding bureaucracy to his supporters, and manipulating elections in rural areas. Bethlen restored order to the country by giving the radical counterrevolutionaries payoffs and government jobs in exchange for ceasing their campaign of terror against Jews and leftists. In 1921, he made a deal with the Social Democrats and trade unions (called Bethlen-Peyer Pact), agreeing, among other things, to legalize their activities and free political prisoners in return for their pledge to refrain from spreading [[Magyarization|anti-Hungarian]] propaganda, calling political strikes, and organizing the peasantry. Bethlen brought Hungary into the [[League of Nations]] in 1922 and out of international isolation by signing a treaty of friendship with [[Italy]] in 1927. The revision of the Treaty of Trianon rose to the top of Hungary's political agenda and the strategy employed by Bethlen consisted by strengthening the economy and building relations with stronger nations. Revision of the treaty had such a broad backing in Hungary that Bethlen used it, at least in part, to deflect criticism of his economic, social, and political policies.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] induced a drop in the standard of living and the political mood of the country shifted further toward the right. In 1932 Horthy appointed a new prime-minister, [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]], who changed the course of Hungarian policy towards closer cooperation with Germany. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s signed a trade agreement with Germany that drew Hungary's economy out of depression but made Hungary dependent on the German economy for both raw materials and markets. On 2 November 1938, as the result of the [[First Vienna Award]] parts of Czechoslovakia - [[Upper Hungary|Southern Slovakia]] and a part of Carpathian Ruthenia - were returned to Hungary, an area amounting to 11,927&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a population of 869,299 (86.5% of which were Hungarians according to the 1941 census). Between 5 November and 10 November, Hungarian armed forces peacefully occupied the newly transferred territories.<ref>Thomas, ''The Royal Hungarian Army in World War II'', pg. 11</ref> Hitler later promised to transfer all of Slovakia to Hungary in exchange for a military alliance, but his offer was rejected. Instead, Horthy chose to pursue a territorial revision to be decided along ethnic lines. In March 1939, the Czecho-Slovak Republic was dissolved, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded it]], and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was established. On 14 March, [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]] declared itself to be an independent state.\n\nOn 15 March, [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] declared itself to be an independent state. Hungary rejected the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine and, between 14 March and 18 March, Hungarian armed forces occupied the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia and ousted the government of [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]. By contrast, Hungary recognized the Nazi [[puppet state]] of Slovakia led by the [[Clerical fascism|Clerical Fascist]] [[Jozef Tiso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3430.htm|title=Slovakia|publisher=}}</ref> In September 1940, with troops massing on both sides of the Hungarian-Romanian border, war was averted by the [[Second Vienna Award]]. This award transferred the northern half of [[Transylvania]] to Hungary, with a total area of 43,492&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a total population of 2,578,100 with a 53.5% Hungarian majority according to the 1941 census. By dividing Transylvania between Romania and Hungary, Hitler was able to ease tensions in Hungary. In October 1940, the Germans initiated a reciprocity policy between Romania and Hungary which was continued until the end of World War II. The region of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Sub-Carpathia]] was given special autonomous status with the intention that (eventually) it would be self-governed by the Ruthenian minority.\n\n=== During World War II 1941\u20131945{{anchor|During World War II 1941\u20131945}} ===\n{{Main|Hungary during World War II}}\n[[File:Kingdom of Hungary (1942).svg|thumb|The Kingdom of Hungary in 1942, during World War II]]\n\nAfter being granted part of southern Czechoslovakia and Subcarpathia by the Germans and Italians in the [[First Vienna Award]] of 1938, and then northern Transylvania in the [[Second Vienna Award]] of 1940, Hungary participated in their first military maneuvers on the side of the Axis powers in 1941. Thus, the Hungarian army was part of the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], gaining some more territory and joining the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] in the process. On 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Hungary joined the German effort and declared war on the Soviet Union on 26 June, and entered [[World War II]] on the side of the Axis. In late 1941, the Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front experienced success at the [[Battle of Uman]]. By 1943, after the [[Hungarian Second Army]] suffered extremely heavy losses at the river Don, the Hungarian government sought to negotiate a surrender with the Allies. On 19 March 1944, as a result of this duplicity, German troops occupied Hungary in what was known as [[Operation Margarethe]]. By then it was clear that Hungarian politics would be suppressed according to Hitler's intention to hold the country in the war on the side of the Nazi Third Reich because of its strategic location. On 15 October 1944, Horthy made a token effort to disengage Hungary from the war. The Germans launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and Horthy's regime was replaced by a [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|fascist puppet government]] under the pro-German [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] leader [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], thus effectively ending the possibility for independent actions in the war. However, the form of government was only changed to a republic two years later.\n\n=== Transitioning into a republic ===\nFollowing its [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|occupation of Hungary in 1944]], the [[Soviet Union]] imposed harsh conditions allowing the Russians to seize important material assets and control internal affairs.<ref name=\"wettig51\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=51}}</ref> After the [[Red Army]] set up police organs to persecute \n\"class enemies\", the Soviets assumed that the impoverished Hungarian populace would support the Communists in the coming elections.<ref name=\"wettig85\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=85}}</ref> The Communists fared poorly, receiving only 17% of the vote, resulting in a [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|coalition government]] under Prime Minister [[Zolt\u00e1n Tildy]].<ref>Norton, Donald H.

The Soviet occupation was then restored, lasting until 1989 when the Communists agreed to give up their monopoly on power, paving the way for [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|free elections in March 1990]]. In today's republic, the Kingdom is regarded as one long stage in the development of the state. This sense of continuity is reflected in the republic's national symbols such as the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] and the [[Coat of arms of Hungary]], which are the same as when the monarchy was still in place.

This service would make use of a standard toilet and [[sewage]] lines to provide free Internet connectivity at a speed of 8&nbsp;Mbit/s (2&nbsp;Mbit/s upload) (or up to 32&nbsp;Mbit/s with a paid plan). The user would drop a weighted end of a long, Google-supplied fiber-optic cable in their toilet and flush it. Around 60&nbsp;minutes later, the end would be recovered and connected to the Internet by a \"Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)\". The user would then connect their end to a Google-supplied wireless router and run the Google-supplied installation media on a [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]] computer (\"Mac and Linux support coming soon\"). Alternatively, a user could request a professional installation, in which Google would deploy [[nanobot]]s through the plumbing to complete the process. The free service would be supported by \"discreet [[DNA sequencing]]\" of \"personal bodily output\" to display online ads that relate to culinary preferences and personal health.

This service would make use of a standard toilet and [[sewage]] lines to provide free Internet connectivity at a speed of 8&nbsp;Mbit/s (2&nbsp;Mbit/s upload) (or up to 32&nbsp;Mbit/s with a paid plan). The user would drop a weighted end of a long, Google-supplied fiber-optic cable in their toilet and flush it. Around 60&nbsp;minutes later, the end would be recovered and connected to the Internet by a \"Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)\". The user would then connect their end to a Google-supplied wireless router and run the Google-supplied installation media on a [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]] computer (\"Mac and Linux support coming soon\").

Their dynamic orbits occasionally force them into the inner Solar System, first becoming [[centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]], and then short-period comets.<ref name=book/>\n\nAccording to the [[Minor Planet Center]], which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, a KBO, strictly speaking, is any object that orbits exclusively within the defined Kuiper belt region regardless of origin or composition.

This suggests that, unlike the large [[moons of Jupiter]], [[Moons of Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Moons of Uranus|Uranus]], which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See [[Kuiper belt#Satellites|below]].)

The scattered disc was created when Neptune [[Nice model|migrated outward]] into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose [[apsis|perihelia]] are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc).

Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the [[scattered disc]] or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the [[Kirkwood gap]]s in the [[asteroid belt]]. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Large Scattered Planetesimals and the Excitation of the Small Body Belts |journal=Icarus |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=367 |first=Jean-Marc |last=Petit |first2=Alessandro |last2=Morbidelli |first3=Giovanni B. |last3=Valsecchi |url=http://www.obs-nice.fr/morby/papers/6166a.pdf |date=1998 |accessdate=June 23, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809103014/http://www.obs-nice.fr/morby/papers/6166a.pdf |archive-date=August 9, 2007 |url-status=dead  |bibcode=1999Icar..141..367P |doi=10.1006/icar.1999.6166 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:KBO diagram eccentricity.png|right|thumb|550px|The various dynamical classes of trans-Neptunian objects.]]\n\n=== Classical belt ===\n{{Main|Classical Kuiper belt object}}\nBetween the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances with Neptune, at approximately 42\u201348&nbsp;AU, the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur over an extended timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered.

If, for instance, an object orbits the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits, and if it reaches perihelion with Neptune a quarter of an orbit away from it, then whenever it returns to perihelion, Neptune will always be in about the same relative position as it began, because it will have completed {{frac|1|1|2}} orbits in the same time. This is known as the 2:3 (or 3:2) resonance, and it corresponds to a characteristic [[semi-major axis]] of about 39.4&nbsp;AU.

Scattered disc objects (SDOs) have very elliptical orbits, often also very inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of Solar System formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in a primordial belt, with later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, sending the objects outward, some into stable orbits (the KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, the scattered disc.<ref name=book/> Due to its unstable nature, the scattered disc is suspected to be the point of origin of many of the Solar System's short-period comets. Their dynamic orbits occasionally force them into the inner Solar System, first becoming [[centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]], and then short-period comets.<ref name=book/>\n\nAccording to the [[Minor Planet Center]], which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, a KBO, strictly speaking, is any object that orbits exclusively within the defined Kuiper belt region regardless of origin or composition. Objects found outside the belt are classed as scattered objects.<ref name=\"cen_sdo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Centaurs.html |title=List Of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects |work=IAU: Minor Planet Center |accessdate=October 27, 2010}}</ref> In some scientific circles the term \"Kuiper belt object\" has become synonymous with any icy minor planet native to the outer Solar System assumed to have been part of that initial class, even if its orbit during the bulk of Solar System history has been beyond the Kuiper belt (e.g. in the scattered-disc region). They often describe scattered disc objects as \"scattered Kuiper belt objects\".<ref>{{cite web |date=2005 |author=David Jewitt |title=The 1000 km Scale KBOs |work=University of Hawaii |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/kb/big_kbo.html |accessdate=July 16, 2006}}</ref> [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which is known to be more massive than Pluto, is often referred to as a KBO, but is technically an SDO.<ref name=\"cen_sdo\"/> A consensus among astronomers as to the precise definition of the Kuiper belt has yet to be reached, and this issue remains unresolved.\n\nThe centaurs, which are not normally considered part of the Kuiper belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward.

This suggests that, unlike the large [[moons of Jupiter]], [[Moons of Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Moons of Uranus|Uranus]], which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See [[Kuiper belt#Satellites|below]].) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Neptune's capture of its moon Triton in a binary-planet gravitational encounter |author=Craig B.

H. Tapley-Soper of The City Library, Exeter, writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nA discussion arose at the Plymouth meeting of [[the Devonshire Association]] in 1916 when it was suggested that this word should be recorded in the list of local verbal provincialisms.  Several members dissented from its inclusion on the ground that it is in common use throughout the country; and a naval officer who was present said that it has for years been a popular expression in the service for a tool or implement, the exact name of which is unknown or has for the moment been forgotten.  I have also frequently heard it applied by motor-cycle friends to the collection of fitments to be seen on motor cycles.  'His handle-bars are smothered in gadgets' refers to such things as speedometers, mirrors, levers, badges, mascots, &c., attached to the steering handles.  The 'jigger' or short-rest used in billiards is also often called a 'gadget'; and the name has been applied by local platelayers to the 'gauge' used to test the accuracy of their work.  In fact, to borrow from present-day Army slang, 'gadget' is applied to 'any old thing.'<ref name=\"notes_and_queries\">[[Notes and Queries]]: ''[http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/vols12-IV/issue85/index.dtl 1918 s12-IV: 281-282]'' (accessed June 2, 2010)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe usage of the term in military parlance extended beyond the navy.  In the book \"Above the Battle\" by Vivian Drake, published in 1918 by D. Appleton & Co., of New York and London, being the memoirs of a pilot in the British [[Royal Flying Corps]], there is the following passage: \"Our ennui was occasionally relieved by new gadgets -- \"gadget\" is the Flying Corps slang for invention! Some gadgets were good, some comic and some extraordinary.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0n7GCX1NUUIC&pg=PA126&dq=%22Above+the+Clouds%22+by+Vivian+Drake,#v=onepage&q=gadget&f=false Above the Battle, p.191] at Google Book Search</ref>\n\nBy the second half of the twentieth century, the term \"gadget\" had taken on the connotations of compactness and mobility. In the 1965 essay \"The Great Gizmo\" (a term used interchangeably with \"gadget\" throughout the essay), the architectural and design critic [[Reyner Banham]] defines the item as:\n\n<blockquote>\nA characteristic class of US products\u2013\u2013perhaps the most characteristic\u2013\u2013is a small self-contained unit of high performance in relation to its size and cost, whose function is to transform some undifferentiated set of circumstances to a condition nearer human desires.  The minimum of skills is required in its installation and use, and it is independent of any physical or social infrastructure beyond that by which it may be ordered from catalogue and delivered to its prospective user. A class of servants to human needs, these clip-on devices, these portable gadgets, have coloured American thought and action far more deeply\u2013\u2013I suspect\u2013\u2013than is commonly understood.<ref name=\"banham\">[[Reyner Banham]]. \"The Great Gizmo.\" ''Design by Choice.'' Ed. Penny Sparke. Rizzoli, 1981. p. 110.

There are several implementations based on existing software development techniques, like [[JavaScript]], form input, and various image formats.\n\n: {{Further|Google Desktop|Google Gadgets|Microsoft Gadgets|Dashboard software Apple Widgets}}\n\nThe earliest{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} documented use of the term ''gadget'' in context of [[software engineering]] was in 1985 by the developers of [[AmigaOS]], the [[operating system]] of the [[Amiga]] computers (''[[Intuition (Amiga)|intuition.library]]'' and also later '''''gad'''tools.library''). It denotes what other technological traditions call ''[[GUI widget]]''\u2014a control element in [[graphical user interface]]. This [[naming convention]] remains in continuing use (as of 2008) since then.\n\nThe X11<ref>[[X Window System protocols and architecture]]</ref> windows system 'Intrinsics'<ref>[[X Toolkit Intrinsics]]</ref> also defines gadgets and their relationship to widgets (buttons, labels etc.). The gadget was a windowless widget which was supposed to improve the performance of the application by reducing the memory load on the X server. A gadget would use the Window id of its parent widget and had no children of its own\n\nIt is not known whether other software companies are explicitly drawing on that inspiration when featuring the word in names of their technologies or simply referring to the generic meaning. The word ''widget'' is older in this context. In the movie \"[[Back to School]]\" from 1986 by Alan Metter, there is a scene where an economics professor Dr. Barbay, wants to start for educational purposes a fictional company that produces \"widgets: It's a fictional product.\"\n\n: {{Further|Workbench (AmigaOS)}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Domestic technology]]\n* [[Electronics]]\n* [[List of magazines writing about gadgets|Gadget Magazines]]\n* [[Gizmo (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Gadget Flow]]\n* ''[[Inspector Gadget]]''\n* [[Merchandising]]\n* [[Multi-tool]]\n* [[Widget (economics)|Widget]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Tools]]\n[[Category:Placeholder names]]\n[[Category:Software]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||other uses|Gadget (disambiguation)|Wikipedia Gadgets|:Wikipedia:Gadget}}\n[[File:Apple I Watch 2015 Model very cool.jpg|thumb|[[Smartwatch]]es are commonly used gadgets.]]\nA '''gadget''' is a small [[tool]] such as a [[machine]] that has a particular function, but is often thought of as a [[novelty]].<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gadget gadget - Definition from Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Gadgets are sometimes referred to as ''[[wikt:gizmo|gizmo]]s''.\n\n==History==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\nThe etymology of the word is disputed.

Gadgets were first used in the late 18th century.'' <ref name=\"Corning Museum of Glass\">[[Corning Museum of Glass]]: ''[https://www.cmog.org/glass-dictionary/gadget Glass Dictionary: Gadget}'' (accessed November 4, 2018)</ref> According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], there is anecdotal (not necessarily true) evidence for the use of \"gadget\" as a [[placeholder name]] for a technical item whose precise name one can't remember since the 1850s; with Robert Brown's 1886 book ''Spunyarn and Spindrift, A sailor boy\u2019s log of a voyage out and home in a China tea-clipper'' containing the earliest known usage in print.<ref name=\"quinion\">[[Michael Quinion]]: ''[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-gad1.htm World Wide Words: Gadget]'' (accessed February 6, 2008) Also in<!--according to http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-01-30-n75.html-->: Michael Quinion: ''Port Out, Starboard Home: The Fascinating Stories We Tell About the Words We Use''. {{ISBN|978-0-14-101223-0}}</ref>\n\nA widely circulated story holds that the word gadget was \"invented\" when Gaget, Gauthier & Cie, the company behind the [[repouss\u00e9]] construction of the [[Statue of Liberty]] (1886), made a small-scale version of the monument and named it after their firm; however this contradicts the evidence that the word was already used before in nautical circles, and the fact that it did not become popular, at least in the USA, until after World War I.<ref name=\"quinion\" /> Other sources cite a derivation from the French ''g\u00e2chette'' which has been applied to various pieces of a firing mechanism, or the French ''gag\u00e9e'', a small tool or accessory.<ref name=\"quinion\" /> \n\nThe October 1918 issue of [[Notes and Queries]] contains a multi-article entry on the word \"gadget\" (12 S. iv. 187). H. Tapley-Soper of The City Library, Exeter, writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nA discussion arose at the Plymouth meeting of [[the Devonshire Association]] in 1916 when it was suggested that this word should be recorded in the list of local verbal provincialisms.  Several members dissented from its inclusion on the ground that it is in common use throughout the country; and a naval officer who was present said that it has for years been a popular expression in the service for a tool or implement, the exact name of which is unknown or has for the moment been forgotten.  I have also frequently heard it applied by motor-cycle friends to the collection of fitments to be seen on motor cycles.  'His handle-bars are smothered in gadgets' refers to such things as speedometers, mirrors, levers, badges, mascots, &c., attached to the steering handles.  The 'jigger' or short-rest used in billiards is also often called a 'gadget'; and the name has been applied by local platelayers to the 'gauge' used to test the accuracy of their work.  In fact, to borrow from present-day Army slang, 'gadget' is applied to 'any old thing.'<ref name=\"notes_and_queries\">[[Notes and Queries]]: ''[http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/vols12-IV/issue85/index.dtl 1918 s12-IV: 281-282]'' (accessed June 2, 2010)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe usage of the term in military parlance extended beyond the navy.  In the book \"Above the Battle\" by Vivian Drake, published in 1918 by D. Appleton & Co., of New York and London, being the memoirs of a pilot in the British [[Royal Flying Corps]], there is the following passage: \"Our ennui was occasionally relieved by new gadgets -- \"gadget\" is the Flying Corps slang for invention! Some gadgets were good, some comic and some extraordinary.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0n7GCX1NUUIC&pg=PA126&dq=%22Above+the+Clouds%22+by+Vivian+Drake,#v=onepage&q=gadget&f=false Above the Battle, p.191] at Google Book Search</ref>\n\nBy the second half of the twentieth century, the term \"gadget\" had taken on the connotations of compactness and mobility. In the 1965 essay \"The Great Gizmo\" (a term used interchangeably with \"gadget\" throughout the essay), the architectural and design critic [[Reyner Banham]] defines the item as:\n\n<blockquote>\nA characteristic class of US products\u2013\u2013perhaps the most characteristic\u2013\u2013is a small self-contained unit of high performance in relation to its size and cost, whose function is to transform some undifferentiated set of circumstances to a condition nearer human desires.  The minimum of skills is required in its installation and use, and it is independent of any physical or social infrastructure beyond that by which it may be ordered from catalogue and delivered to its prospective user. A class of servants to human needs, these clip-on devices, these portable gadgets, have coloured American thought and action far more deeply\u2013\u2013I suspect\u2013\u2013than is commonly understood.<ref name=\"banham\">[[Reyner Banham]]. \"The Great Gizmo.\" ''Design by Choice.'' Ed. Penny Sparke. Rizzoli, 1981. p. 110. Originally appeared in ''Industrial Design'' 12 (September 1965): 58-59.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Other uses==\n\nThe first [[atomic bomb]] was nicknamed ''[[the gadget]]'' by the Scientists the [[Manhattan Project]], tested at the [[Trinity site]].\n\n==Application gadgets==\n\nIn the software industry, \"Gadget\" refers to computer programs that provide services without needing an independent application to be launched for each one, but instead run in an environment that manages multiple gadgets. There are several implementations based on existing software development techniques, like [[JavaScript]], form input, and various image formats.\n\n: {{Further|Google Desktop|Google Gadgets|Microsoft Gadgets|Dashboard software Apple Widgets}}\n\nThe earliest{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} documented use of the term ''gadget'' in context of [[software engineering]] was in 1985 by the developers of [[AmigaOS]], the [[operating system]] of the [[Amiga]] computers (''[[Intuition (Amiga)|intuition.library]]'' and also later '''''gad'''tools.library''). It denotes what other technological traditions call ''[[GUI widget]]''\u2014a control element in [[graphical user interface]]. This [[naming convention]] remains in continuing use (as of 2008) since then.\n\nThe X11<ref>[[X Window System protocols and architecture]]</ref> windows system 'Intrinsics'<ref>[[X Toolkit Intrinsics]]</ref> also defines gadgets and their relationship to widgets (buttons, labels etc.). The gadget was a windowless widget which was supposed to improve the performance of the application by reducing the memory load on the X server. A gadget would use the Window id of its parent widget and had no children of its own\n\nIt is not known whether other software companies are explicitly drawing on that inspiration when featuring the word in names of their technologies or simply referring to the generic meaning. The word ''widget'' is older in this context. In the movie \"[[Back to School]]\" from 1986 by Alan Metter, there is a scene where an economics professor Dr. Barbay, wants to start for educational purposes a fictional company that produces \"widgets: It's a fictional product.\"\n\n: {{Further|Workbench (AmigaOS)}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Domestic technology]]\n* [[Electronics]]\n* [[List of magazines writing about gadgets|Gadget Magazines]]\n* [[Gizmo (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Gadget Flow]]\n* ''[[Inspector Gadget]]''\n* [[Merchandising]]\n* [[Multi-tool]]\n* [[Widget (economics)|Widget]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Tools]]\n[[Category:Placeholder names]]\n[[Category:Software]]\n", "name_user": "Anypodetos", "label": "safe", "comment": "Remove spaces", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget"}

In 1975, the ''[[Frampton (album)|Frampton]]'' album was released. The album went to No. 32 in the US charts, and is certified [[Gold Album|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]].<ref name=60s70s />\n\nPeter Frampton had little commercial success with his early albums. This changed with Frampton's best-selling live album, ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]'', in 1976, from which \"[[Baby, I Love Your Way]]\", \"[[Show Me the Way (Peter Frampton song)|Show Me the Way]]\", and an edited version of \"[[Do You Feel Like We Do]]\", were hit singles. The latter two tracks also featured his use of the [[talk box]] guitar effect. The album was recorded in 1975, mainly at the [[Winterland|Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco, California]], where Humble Pie had previously enjoyed a good following. Frampton had a new line-up, with Americans [[Bob Mayo]] on keyboards and rhythm guitar and Stanley Sheldon on bass. Wills had been sacked by Frampton at the end of 1974, and Bown had left on the eve of ''Frampton Comes Alive'', to return to England and new fame with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. ''Frampton Comes Alive'' was released in early January, debuting on the charts on 14 February at number 191. The album was on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for 97 weeks, of which 55 were in the top 40, of which 10 were at the top. The album beat, among others, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'' to become the top selling album of 1976, and it was also the 14th best seller of 1977. With sales of eight million copies it became the biggest selling live album, although with others subsequently selling more it is now the fourth biggest.

The chemistry was still there for a while, as both Frampton and Marriott laid down some tracks in L.A. and prepared to do a \"Frampton-Marriott\" tour. However, Marriott abruptly returned to England in April and he died in a house fire less than 24 hours after his return. Broken up by Marriott's death, Frampton went off the road for a time, then reformed his old touring band with his old friends Bob Mayo and John Regan.  At least three songs, and possibly a fourth, from the ended Marriott-Frampton partnership were subsequently recorded; two ending up on Frampton's \"Shine On\" compilation, a third on his subsequent solo album.\n\nIn the late 1990s, he starred in an infomercial plugging the internationally successful eMedia Guitar Method, a piece of instructional software represented as an alternative to taking actual guitar lessons.

II]]'', which contained live versions of many of the songs from his 1980s and 1990s solo albums. ''Frampton Comes Alive! II'' was accompanied by a video release on DVD, recorded at [[The Fillmore]] Theatre on 15 June 1995. Although there was a large amount of marketing for the album, it did not sell well.<ref name=90s /> After ''Frampton Comes Alive!

The concerts each night started with the prerecorded thump of a microphone being turned on, familiar to many fans of the album, followed by the recorded voice of Jerry Pompili saying, \"If there was ever a musician that was an honorary member of San Francisco society, Mr. Peter Frampton\"...and then the crowd goes wild. He played the album song for song for 69 locations between 15 June 2011, and 22 October 2011, throughout the US.\n\nOn 11 June 2011, Frampton performed a live set for \"[[Guitar Center]] Sessions\" on [[DirecTV]].

Frampton had a new line-up, with Americans [[Bob Mayo]] on keyboards and rhythm guitar and Stanley Sheldon on bass.

He did, however, achieve a brief, moderate comeback of sorts in 1986 with the release of his ''[[Premonition (Peter Frampton album)|Premonition]]'' album, and the single \"Lying\", which became a big hit on the [[Mainstream Rock]] charts.

The chemistry was still there for a while, as both Frampton and Marriott laid down some tracks in L.A. and prepared to do a \"Frampton-Marriott\" tour. However, Marriott abruptly returned to England in April and he died in a house fire less than 24 hours after his return. Broken up by Marriott's death, Frampton went off the road for a time, then reformed his old touring band with his old friends Bob Mayo and John Regan.  At least three songs, and possibly a fourth, from the ended Marriott-Frampton partnership were subsequently recorded; two ending up on Frampton's \"Shine On\" compilation, a third on his subsequent solo album.\n\nIn the late 1990s, he starred in an infomercial plugging the internationally successful eMedia Guitar Method, a piece of instructional software represented as an alternative to taking actual guitar lessons.

As a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' on the insistence of her mother. Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action drama&nbsp;[[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance&nbsp;''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.

As a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' on the insistence of her mother. Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action drama&nbsp;[[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance&nbsp;''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.

Before the sequel, ''[[Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?]]'', began its run, Bolam appeared in films such as ''[[Half a Sixpence (film)|Half a Sixpence]]'' (1967), ''[[Otley (film)|Otley]]'' (1969), and ''[[O Lucky Man!]]'' (1973). The revived series, chronicling the further adventures of Bob and Terry, lasted for two series broadcast in 1973 and 1974 and a 45-minute 1974 Christmas Eve special.\n\nIn 1975, Bolam appeared alongside the original cast in a further [[BBC Radio]] series adapted from the 1973 TV series and in 1976 there was a further reunion in a feature film spin-off from the series, simply entitled ''[[The Likely Lads (film)|The Likely Lads]]''. Bolam's co-star Rodney Bewes revealed in 2005 that the two actors had not spoken since the film had been made, a period of over thirty years. The rift, according to Bewes, developed through his indiscreetly telling a journalist that when Bolam's wife revealed she was pregnant, Bolam was so startled that the car he was driving mounted a pavement and almost crashed into a lamp post.<ref name=echo>{{cite web |title=What did happen to the Likely Lads? |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/866712.what_did_happen_to_the_likely_lads/|publisher=Thenorthernecho.co.uk |date=7 August 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref> Bolam denied there was a rift between the two men when Bewes died in November 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last=Skopeliti|first=Clea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/22/james-bolam-denies-feud-with-likely-lads-co-star-rodney-bewes|title=James Bolam denies feud with Likely Lads co-star Rodney Bewes|work=The Guardian|date=|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nBolam is known for being guarded about his private life.

Before the sequel, ''[[Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?]]'', began its run, Bolam appeared in films such as ''[[Half a Sixpence (film)|Half a Sixpence]]'' (1967), ''[[Otley (film)|Otley]]'' (1969), and ''[[O Lucky Man!]]'' (1973). The revived series, chronicling the further adventures of Bob and Terry, lasted for two series broadcast in 1973 and 1974 and a 45-minute 1974 Christmas Eve special.\n\nIn 1975, Bolam appeared alongside the original cast in a further [[BBC Radio]] series adapted from the 1973 TV series and in 1976 there was a further reunion in a feature film spin-off from the series, simply entitled ''[[The Likely Lads (film)|The Likely Lads]]''. Bolam's co-star Rodney Bewes revealed in 2005 that the two actors had not spoken since the film had been made, a period of over thirty years. The rift, according to Bewes, developed through his indiscreetly telling a journalist that when Bolam's wife revealed she was pregnant, Bolam was so startled that the car he was driving mounted a pavement and almost crashed into a lamp post.<ref name=echo>{{cite web |title=What did happen to the Likely Lads? |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/866712.what_did_happen_to_the_likely_lads/|publisher=Thenorthernecho.co.uk |date=7 August 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref> Bolam denied there was a rift between the two men when Bewes died in November 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last=Skopeliti|first=Clea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/22/james-bolam-denies-feud-with-likely-lads-co-star-rodney-bewes|title=James Bolam denies feud with Likely Lads co-star Rodney Bewes|work=The Guardian|date=|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nBolam is known for being guarded about his private life.
