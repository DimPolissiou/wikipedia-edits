Derepression of the ''DUX4'' gene requires two genetic elements. First, there must be a mutation that allows ''DUX4'' transcription by causing DNA demethylation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array on chromosome 4, exposing a promotor region. Several mutations cause demethylation of the D4Z4 array,  upon which FSHD is subclassified into FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) and FSHD type 2 (FSHD2).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe second genetic element needed is a downstream allele that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA, increasing the likelihood of ''DUX4'' translation. The allele that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA is called a 4qA allele, which is a [[haplotype]] polymorphism. The 4qA allele contains a polyadenylation sequence.\n\n===FSHD1===\nFSHD due to deletion of D4Z4 repeats (termed 'D4Z4 contraction') is classified as FSHD type 1 (FSHD1 or FSHMD1A), which accounts for 95% of FSHD cases. The D4Z4 repeat is a 3.2 [[base pair|kilobase pair]] (kb) segment of DNA that is tandemly repeated in the [[subtelomeric]] region (4q35) of [[Chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]] of the [[human genome]]. Typically, chromosome 4 includes between 11 and 150 repetitions of D4Z4.<ref name=\"Quest March\u2013April 2007\"/> In FSHD1, there are 1\u201310 repetitions of D4Z4. If the entire D4Z4 repeat array is removed, there are birth defects, but no specific defects on skeletal muscle. There are both [[heterochromatin]] and [[euchromatin]] structures within D4Z4, as well the ''[[DUX4]]'' gene.<ref name=\"Quest March\u2013April 2007\"/><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dixit M, Ansseau E, Tassin A, etal |title=DUX4, a candidate gene of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, encodes a transcriptional activator of PITX1 |journal=Proc.

About 80% of FSHD2 cases are due to mutations in the ''SMCHD1'' gene on [[chromosome 18]] along with the presence of at least one 4qA allele. ''SMCHD1'' mutation reduces SMCHD1 protein expression. SMCHD1 normally methylates DNA, and a reduced level of SMCHD1 results in hypomethylation of the 4q D4Z4 region. With a permissive 4qA allele, DUX4 is able to be expressed, after which the molecular events are indistinguishable from FSHD1. Because ''SMCHD1'' is on a different chromosome than the 4qA allele, the two are inherited independently (they are [[Genetic linkage|unlinked]]), resulting in a digenic inheritance pattern. For example, one parent without FSHD can pass on the ''SMCHD1'' mutation, and the second parent without FSHD can pass on the 4qA allele, bearing a child with FSHD2. The remaining 20% of FSHD2 cases are presumably due to mutations at other unidentified genetic locations.<ref name=\"Lemmers 1370\u20131374\">{{Cite journal|title = Digenic inheritance of an SMCHD1 mutation and an FSHD-permissive D4Z4 allele causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2|last = Lemmers|first = RJ|date = Dec 2012|journal = Nature Genetics|doi = 10.1038/ng.2454|last2 = Tawil|first2 = R|volume = 44|pages = 1370\u20131374|last3 = Petek|first3 = LM|issue=12|display-authors=etal|pmid=23143600|pmc=3671095}}</ref><ref name=\"Wagner Review Article 2019\" />\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[File:DUX4 Signalling in FSHD.png|thumb|DUX4 signaling in FSHD-affected skeletal muscle.|400px]]\nAs of 2020, there seems to be a consensus that aberrant expression of ''DUX4'' in muscle is the cause of FSHD. However, it remains an area of active research how ''DUX4'' causes muscle damage. ''DUX4'' protein is a transcription factor that regulates many other genes. Some of these genes are involved in [[apoptosis]], such as p53, p21, MYC, and \u03b2-catenin. It seems that ''DUX4'' makes muscle cells more prone to apoptosis, although details of the mechanism are still unknown and contested. Other ''DUX4'' regulated genes are involved in oxidative stress, and it seems that ''DUX4'' expression lowers muscle cell tolerance of oxidative stress. Variation in the ability of individual muscles to handle oxidative stress could partially explain the muscle involvement patterns of FSHD. ''DUX4'' downregulates many genes involved in muscle development, including MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and Pax7. ''DUX4'' has shown to reduce muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and fusion. Estrogen seems to play a role on in modifying ''DUX4'' effects on muscle differentiation, which could explain why females are less affected than males. ''DUX4'' regulates a few genes that are involved in RNA quality control, and ''DUX4'' expression has been shown to cause accumulation of RNA with subsequent apoptosis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lim |first1=KRQ |last2=Nguyen |first2=Q |last3=Yokota |first3=T |title=DUX4 Signalling in the Pathogenesis of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy. |journal=International journal of molecular sciences |date=22 January 2020 |volume=21 |issue=3 |doi=10.3390/ijms21030729 |pmid=31979100}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n=== Genetic testing ===\nGenetic testing is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for FSHD diagnosis, as it is the most accurate and specific test.<ref name=\"Wagner Review Article 2019\" /> FSHD1 is likely if D4Z4 array length is shortened and an adjoining 4qA allele is present. Since the early 2000s, D4Z4 array length was assessed by [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) analysis, which involves digesting the DNA with [[restriction enzymes]] and analyzing resulting [[restriction fragment]] lengths with [[southern blot]]. A restriction fragment length less than 38 kilobases (kb) is considered shortened. In 2020, [[optical mapping]] became available for measuring D4Z4 array length, which is more precise and less labor intensive than southern blot. [[Next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) is not useful for diagnosing FSHD1, because the long D4Z4 repeats are not sequenceable by NGS.\n\nIf genetic testing for FSHD1 is negative, FSHD2 genetic testing is done. FSHD2 is likely if there is a lack of methylation at 4q35 and at least one 4qA allele is present. NGS can be used to detect an SMCHD1 mutation, which is usually present in FSHD2.\n\nWhen cost is prohibitive or a diagnosis of FSHD is not suspected as the cause of symptoms, patients and doctors may rely on one or more of the following tests, all of which are less [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive and less specific]].<ref name=\"FSHD Fact Sheet\">[http://www.mda.org/publications/fa-fshd.html FSHD Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306140617/http://www.mda.org/publications/fa-fshd.html |date=2006-03-06 }}, [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]], 11/1/2001</ref>\n=== Alternative testing ===\n* [[Creatine kinase]] (CK) blood level is often ordered when muscle damage is suspected.

EMG shows nonspecific signs of muscle damage or irritability.<ref name=\"Wagner Review Article 2019\" />\n* [[Nerve conduction velocity]] (NCV) measures the how fast signals travel from one part of a nerve to another. The nerve signals are measured with surface electrodes (similar to those used for an electrocardiogram) or needle electrodes.\n* [[Muscle biopsy]] involves surgical removal of a small piece of muscle, usually from the arm or leg. The biopsy is evaluated with a variety of [[biochemical]] tests. Biopsies from FSHD-affected muscles show nonspecific signs, such as presence of white blood cells and variation in muscle fiber size.

Derepression of the ''DUX4'' gene requires two genetic elements. First, there must be a mutation that allows ''DUX4'' transcription by causing DNA demethylation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array on chromosome 4, exposing a promotor region. Several mutations cause demethylation of the D4Z4 array,  upon which FSHD is subclassified into FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) and FSHD type 2 (FSHD2).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe second genetic element needed is a downstream allele that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA, increasing the likelihood of ''DUX4'' translation. The allele that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA is called a 4qA allele, which is a [[haplotype]] polymorphism. The 4qA allele contains a polyadenylation sequence.\n\n===FSHD1===\nFSHD due to deletion of D4Z4 repeats (termed 'D4Z4 contraction') is classified as FSHD type 1 (FSHD1 or FSHMD1A), which accounts for 95% of FSHD cases. The D4Z4 repeat is a 3.2 [[base pair|kilobase pair]] (kb) segment of DNA that is tandemly repeated in the [[subtelomeric]] region (4q35) of [[Chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]] of the [[human genome]]. Typically, chromosome 4 includes between 11 and 150 repetitions of D4Z4.<ref name=\"Quest March\u2013April 2007\"/> In FSHD1, there are 1\u201310 repetitions of D4Z4. If the entire D4Z4 repeat array is removed, there are birth defects, but no specific defects on skeletal muscle. There are both [[heterochromatin]] and [[euchromatin]] structures within D4Z4, as well the ''[[DUX4]]'' gene.<ref name=\"Quest March\u2013April 2007\"/><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dixit M, Ansseau E, Tassin A, etal |title=DUX4, a candidate gene of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, encodes a transcriptional activator of PITX1 |journal=Proc.

About 80% of FSHD2 cases are due to mutations in the ''SMCHD1'' gene on [[chromosome 18]] along with the presence of at least one 4qA allele. ''SMCHD1'' mutation reduces SMCHD1 protein expression. SMCHD1 normally methylates DNA, and a reduced level of SMCHD1 results in hypomethylation of the 4q D4Z4 region. With a permissive 4qA allele, DUX4 is able to be expressed, after which the molecular events are indistinguishable from FSHD1. Because ''SMCHD1'' is on a different chromosome than the 4qA allele, the two are inherited independently (they are [[Genetic linkage|unlinked]]), resulting in a digenic inheritance pattern. For example, one parent without FSHD can pass on the ''SMCHD1'' mutation, and the second parent without FSHD can pass on the 4qA allele, bearing a child with FSHD2. The remaining 20% of FSHD2 cases are presumably due to mutations at other unidentified genetic locations.<ref name=\"Lemmers 1370\u20131374\">{{Cite journal|title = Digenic inheritance of an SMCHD1 mutation and an FSHD-permissive D4Z4 allele causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2|last = Lemmers|first = RJ|date = Dec 2012|journal = Nature Genetics|doi = 10.1038/ng.2454|last2 = Tawil|first2 = R|volume = 44|pages = 1370\u20131374|last3 = Petek|first3 = LM|issue=12|display-authors=etal|pmid=23143600|pmc=3671095}}</ref><ref name=\"Wagner Review Article 2019\" />\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[File:DUX4 Signalling in FSHD.png|thumb|DUX4 signaling in FSHD-affected skeletal muscle.|400px]]\nAs of 2020, there seems to be a consensus that aberrant expression of ''DUX4'' in muscle is the cause of FSHD. However, it remains an area of active research how ''DUX4'' causes muscle damage. ''DUX4'' protein is a transcription factor that regulates many other genes. Some of these genes are involved in [[apoptosis]], such as p53, p21, MYC, and \u03b2-catenin. It seems that ''DUX4'' makes muscle cells more prone to apoptosis, although details of the mechanism are still unknown and contested. Other ''DUX4'' regulated genes are involved in oxidative stress, and it seems that ''DUX4'' expression lowers muscle cell tolerance of oxidative stress. Variation in the ability of individual muscles to handle oxidative stress could partially explain the muscle involvement patterns of FSHD. ''DUX4'' downregulates many genes involved in muscle development, including MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and Pax7. ''DUX4'' has shown to reduce muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and fusion. Estrogen seems to play a role on in modifying ''DUX4'' effects on muscle differentiation, which could explain why females are less affected than males. ''DUX4'' regulates a few genes that are involved in RNA quality control, and ''DUX4'' expression has been shown to cause accumulation of RNA with subsequent apoptosis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lim |first1=KRQ |last2=Nguyen |first2=Q |last3=Yokota |first3=T |title=DUX4 Signalling in the Pathogenesis of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy. |journal=International journal of molecular sciences |date=22 January 2020 |volume=21 |issue=3 |doi=10.3390/ijms21030729 |pmid=31979100}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n=== Genetic testing ===\nGenetic testing is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for FSHD diagnosis, as it is the most accurate and specific test.<ref name=\"Wagner Review Article 2019\" /> FSHD1 is likely if D4Z4 array length is shortened and an adjoining 4qA allele is present. Since the early 2000s, D4Z4 array length was assessed by [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) analysis, which involves digesting the DNA with [[restriction enzymes]] and analyzing resulting [[restriction fragment]] lengths with [[southern blot]]. A restriction fragment length less than 38 kilobases (kb) is considered shortened. In 2020, [[optical mapping]] became available for measuring D4Z4 array length, which is more precise and less labor intensive than southern blot. [[Next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) is not useful for diagnosing FSHD1, because the long D4Z4 repeats are not sequenceable by NGS.\n\nIf genetic testing for FSHD1 is negative, FSHD2 genetic testing is done. FSHD2 is likely if there is a lack of methylation at 4q35 and at least one 4qA allele is present. NGS can be used to detect an SMCHD1 mutation, which is usually present in FSHD2.\n\nWhen cost is prohibitive or a diagnosis of FSHD is not suspected as the cause of symptoms, patients and doctors may rely on one or more of the following tests, all of which are less [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive and less specific]].<ref name=\"FSHD Fact Sheet\">[http://www.mda.org/publications/fa-fshd.html FSHD Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306140617/http://www.mda.org/publications/fa-fshd.html |date=2006-03-06 }}, [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]], 11/1/2001</ref>\n=== Alternative testing ===\n* [[Creatine kinase]] (CK) blood level is often ordered when muscle damage is suspected.
