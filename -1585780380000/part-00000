It was founded in 1887 by a group of cottagers.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nBYC is located on an extension of land at the eastern end of [[Lac Desch\u00eanes]] near the Desch\u00eanes Rapids on the Ottawa River. A land block owned by the [[National Capital Commission]] on the south side of the harbour is leased to the BYC. The area immediately south of the property is occupied by residences of Britannia Bay. The harbour was built from an abandoned power canal, which lay beside the club property. This harbour has been expanded twice since its original development. The harbour water level is controlled by a system of stop logs at its entrance.\n\nBYC is a member of the Ontario Sailing Association, [[Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons]], and the [[Canadian Yachting Association]]. Its officers include a [[Commodore (yacht club)|Commodore]], vice-commodore, rear-commodore, secretary and treasurer.\n\n==Description==\nThe BYC is included in the City of Ottawa Inventory of [[Sports facilities]]. BYC provides access to 45 kilometres of sailing waters on the [[Ottawa River]].

Justice Livius Anglin Sherwood (1923\u20132002), magistrate (1960) provincial judge (1968\u201383) and federal court judge (1988\u201393), sailor and international sailing judge. The Main Harbour, which opens to the Ottawa River, is surrounded by Mauve Cove, Crimson Cove, and Blue Lagoon. The Inner Harbour is surrounded by Emerald Cay, Mauve Cove and Crimson Cove. Onshore there is a perimeter reserved for the exclusive use of members as well as camping on Baskin's beach. The Clubhouse's ''dragon sailboat bar'', ''Main Lounge'', ''Bruce Neuk'', ''Sunset Room'' restaurant and marquis tent provide casual and gourmet dining and social areas. Fuller Park is a popular social area for picnics.\n\n==Gardens==\nThe BYC has extensive [[Perennial garden]]s, [[Wildflower garden]]s, [[Waterways]] and [[Walkways]] with many plantings reflecting the blue and white club colours.\n\n==History==\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"150px\">\nImage:Britannia Boating Club now Britannia Yacht Club 1896 by William James Topley.jpg|Britannia Boating Club now Britannia Yacht Club 1896 by [[William James Topley]]\nImage:Britannia Boating Club, clubhouse c 1900 by Harmer William Morell, Pittaway.jpg|Designed by Charles Kivas Band (architect) the Britannia Boating Club House c 1906\u20135 on the pier.\nImage:Steamer GB Greene by James Ballantyne.jpg|Steamer GB Greene (1896\u20131945), Ottawa River, by James Ballantyne\nFile:Britannia War Canoe Champions 1902.JPG|Britannia War Canoe Champions 1902\nImage:Britannia Boat Club war canoe crew c 1906 at Britannia Yacht Club.JPG|Britannia Boat Club war canoe crew c 1906 at Britannia Yacht Club\n</gallery>\n</center>\nBy the 1830s, steamboats travelled for 10 or 11 months a year 48 kilometers up the [[Ottawa River]] from the Desch\u00eanes Rapids to the foot of the Rapids des Chats. The log drives, which resulted in 16-foot logs lying along the waterfront, ended in 1982.\n\nBy the 1870s, [[Britannia, Ottawa|Britannia Village]] was a summer resort for people who lived in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. In the 1870s, rails were laid towards the capital, linking the waterfront of [[Britania, Ottawa|Britannia Township]], Woodroffe and Westboro.  By 1871, Britannia Township consisted of a flag station of the Canadian Central Railway (CCRR), farmland, a few houses, shops, a mill and a Methodist church.\n\n===Britannia Aquatic Club===\n\n{{History of Ottawa}}\n\nThe Britannia Aquatic Club (BAC) was founded circa 1887 using a converted sawmill, cottages and boat storage built by John Cameron Jamieson, a lumberman, baker, and alderman as its headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19260412&id=AWouAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n9kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5999,4328003 |title=John Cameron Jamieson Obit |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>\n\n===Britannia Nautical Club===\nIn 1892, the Britannia Aquatic Club (BAC) changed its name to the Britannia Nautical Club (BNC), still using a converted Mill built in 1880\u201385 by John Cameron Jamieson as its headquarters. On August 29, 1891, the BNC held its first regatta which included sailing, paddling and rowing races. The mandate of the Club was to foster all kinds of water sports, and to hold regattas, sailing races, canoe, rowing and [[log rolling]] events.\n\n===Britannia Bay Boat House Club===\nIn 1895 the Britannia Boat House Club was granted an Act of Incorporation by Judge Ross. The board of directors consisted of Thomas H Kirby, C Jackson Booth, E.L. Brittain, Arthur Tache and William Wyld. In 1895, the Club ran its first annual regatta. In 1896 the Britannia Nautical Club changed its name to the Britannia Boat House Club.\n\nThe Edward Miall award for Junior Members who show improvement in their ability was founded in memory of three brothers, Alexander (22), Walter (19) and Eddy (16) Brothy and Peter Winfield (10), who drowned on July 26, 1895. Edward Miall, whose son Ray was rescued three hours later still clinging to his father's capsized skiff, sought to stress all-round proficiency in hope of presenting such tragedy in future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/07/27/106065596.pdf |title=Article in New York Times on the accident |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\nThe B.Y.C.

In 1898, Britannia Boat House Club's [[War Canoe]] beat a team crewed by the Ottawa Canoe Club to win the Canadian National Canoe Championship. This race was re-enacted as part of the BYC 125th celebrations on Saturday June 16, 2012.\n\nIn 1899, the [[Ottawa Electric Railway Company]] privately financed and built a double street-car Britannia line from Holland Avenue, which was in operation from 1900\u20131959 with off-peak service of 5 cars per hour to Britannia. Since the street-car operated on Sundays, its recreational developments at Britannia were profitable. Large numbers of people took the Britannia-on-the Bay street-car each summer from 1900 to the [[Second World War]] to a combined waterfront amusement park, summer resort and commuter village. In 1899, the Metropolitan Power Company was formed to construct a power house just north of the Britannia Boathouse Club with a 2000-foot canal to extend to the lower end of the Deschenes Rapids. Although the hydroelectric project was abandoned as unfeasible, the unfinished canal was used in 1951 by Past Commodores Thomas G. Fuller and Reginald G. Bruce with labour provided by volunteer Club members as the basis of the BYC protected harbour. Today, the BYC harbour provides 250 wet moorings, fuel and pump out facilities, for both sail and power boats. In the late 1800s upon the death of the a Charter member and custodian of the club records, E. Stockton, the administrators of his affairs sent the documents to the Township dump.\n\nThe Britannia Boat House Club was one of nine co-founders of the [[Canadian Canoe Association]] (CCA) in 1900. In 1900, Britannia Boathouse Club won the [[War canoe]] and the canoe race at the regatta hosted by Britannia. In 1900, the Club logo consisted of cross paddles and a burgee.

The mandate of the Club was to foster all kinds of water sports, and to hold regattas, sailing races, canoe, rowing and [[log rolling]] events.\n\n===Britannia Bay Boat House Club===\nIn 1895 the Britannia Boat House Club was granted an Act of Incorporation by Judge Ross. The board of directors consisted of Thomas H Kirby, C Jackson Booth, E.L. Brittain, Arthur Tache and William Wyld. In 1895, the Club ran its first annual regatta. In 1896 the Britannia Nautical Club changed its name to the Britannia Boat House Club.\n\nThe Edward Miall award for Junior Members who show improvement in their ability was founded in memory of three brothers, Alexander (22), Walter (19) and Eddy (16) Brothy and Peter Winfield (10), who drowned on July 26, 1895.

Since the street-car operated on Sundays, its recreational developments at Britannia were profitable. Large numbers of people took the Britannia-on-the Bay street-car each summer from 1900 to the [[Second World War]] to a combined waterfront amusement park, summer resort and commuter village. In 1899, the Metropolitan Power Company was formed to construct a power house just north of the Britannia Boathouse Club with a 2000-foot canal to extend to the lower end of the Deschenes Rapids. Although the hydroelectric project was abandoned as unfeasible, the unfinished canal was used in 1951 by Past Commodores Thomas G. Fuller and Reginald G. Bruce with labour provided by volunteer Club members as the basis of the BYC protected harbour. Today, the BYC harbour provides 250 wet moorings, fuel and pump out facilities, for both sail and power boats. In the late 1800s upon the death of the a Charter member and custodian of the club records, E. Stockton, the administrators of his affairs sent the documents to the Township dump.\n\nThe Britannia Boat House Club was one of nine co-founders of the [[Canadian Canoe Association]] (CCA) in 1900. In 1900, Britannia Boathouse Club won the [[War canoe]] and the canoe race at the regatta hosted by Britannia. In 1900, the Club logo consisted of cross paddles and a burgee.

The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as [[Upper Silesia]].\n\nPolitically the village belonged initially to the [[Duchy of Teschen]], formed in 1290 in the process of [[History of Poland#Fragmentation|feudal fragmentation of Poland]] and was ruled by a local branch of [[Piast dynasty]].

Their observation was subsequently recognized by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]] as demonstrating the previously unknown phenomenon of [[nuclear fission]].<ref name=\"NYT1988\">{{cite news |title=Hitler and the Bomb |agency=New York Times |date=December 11, 1988}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and education==\nStrassman was born in [[Boppard]], Germany, to his parents Richard Strassman and Julie Strassmann (n\u00e9e Bernsmann). He was the youngest of nine children. Strassmann grew up in [[Dusseldorf]]. Strassmann developed an interest in chemistry at a young age and conducted chemistry experiments in his parents' home. His family was of modest means, and his father died at a young age, making the family's financial problems worse. Financial considerations limited Strassmann's initial choices of where to pursue his [[higher education]] and what subjects they should be.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> \n\nStrassmann began his formal chemistry studies in 1920 at the [[Technical University of Hannover]], supporting himself financially by working as a tutor for other students. He received a diploma in [[chemical engineering]] in 1924, and his [[Ph.D.|doctorate]] in [[physical chemistry]] in 1929.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> His doctoral research was on the solubility and reactivity of iodine in [[carbonic acid]] in the gas phase. His doctoral research also enabled him to become experienced in [[analytical chemistry]].

When his scholarship expired in September 1932, Strassmann continued to work as a research student in Hahn's laboratory, without a [[stipend]] but also without having to pay tuition.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\nOn 20 July 1937 Strassmann married Maria Heckter Strassmann, also a chemist. They had a son, Martin.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\nHis wife Maria died of cancer in 1956.

He was [[blacklisted]] by the Nazi regime. As a result, he could not work in the chemical industry nor could he receive his [[habilitation]] as required to be an independent researcher in Germany at the time.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Sime\"/> [[Lise Meitner]] encouraged [[Otto Hahn]] to find an assistantship for Strassmann at half pay, and he eventually became a special assistant to Meitner and Hahn.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/> Strassmann considered himself fortunate, for \"despite my affinity for chemistry, I value my personal freedom so highly that to preserve it I would break stones for a living.\"<ref name=\"Sime\">{{Cite book|first=Ruth Lewin|last=Sime|authorlink=Ruth Lewin Sime|year=1996|title=Lise Meitner: A Life in Physics|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-08906-8|oclc=32893857|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/lisemeitnerlifei00sime|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/lisemeitnerlifei00sime/page/157 157]}}</ref> \n\nStrassman's wife Maria supported his refusal to join the Nazi Party.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Sime\"/>  During [[World War II]] they concealed a Jewish woman in their apartment for months, putting themselves and their three-year-old son at risk.<ref name=\"Yad Vashem\"/><ref name=\"Sime\"/> Strassman continued his research in radiochemistry during World War II, although he did not work on weapons development.

He was the youngest of nine children. Strassmann grew up in [[Dusseldorf]]. Strassmann developed an interest in chemistry at a young age and conducted chemistry experiments in his parents' home. His family was of modest means, and his father died at a young age, making the family's financial problems worse. Financial considerations limited Strassmann's initial choices of where to pursue his [[higher education]] and what subjects they should be.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> \n\nStrassmann began his formal chemistry studies in 1920 at the [[Technical University of Hannover]], supporting himself financially by working as a tutor for other students. He received a diploma in [[chemical engineering]] in 1924, and his [[Ph.D.|doctorate]] in [[physical chemistry]] in 1929.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> His doctoral research was on the solubility and reactivity of iodine in [[carbonic acid]] in the gas phase.
