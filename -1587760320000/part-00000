The first matches were played on 31 July 2011. The final was played on 14 April 2012, with [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] defeating [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]] 2\u20131 to win their fourth consecutive Ta\u00e7a da Liga.\n\n==Format==\nThis seasons' format consists of 3 rounds, plus knockout stages. In the first round, only [[Liga de Honra|second division]] teams play. All 16 teams are allocated into 4 groups of 4 teams each. Each team plays 3 matches and top two of each group advances. In the second round, teams that qualified from previous round are joined by the two [[Liga Sagres]] promoted teams and also the 6 worst in the top league in the previous season. There will be two-legged fixtures in which the winners will advance. The third round is where the remaining top 8 teams from previous season first division enter the competition. Again, as in the first round, the 16 teams are divided into 4 groups and each team will play 3 matches. However this time, only group winners advance. Both semi-finals and finals are one-legged fixtures.\n\n==Participating clubs==\n* Clubs starting from the First Round: [[F.C.

Benfica|Benfica]] defeating [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]] 2\u20131 to win their fourth consecutive Ta\u00e7a da Liga.\n\n==Format==\nThis seasons' format consists of 3 rounds, plus knockout stages. In the first round, only [[Liga de Honra|second division]] teams play. All 16 teams are allocated into 4 groups of 4 teams each. Each team plays 3 matches and top two of each group advances. In the second round, teams that qualified from previous round are joined by the two [[Liga Sagres]] promoted teams and also the 6 worst in the top league in the previous season. There will be two-legged fixtures in which the winners will advance. The third round is where the remaining top 8 teams from previous season first division enter the competition. Again, as in the first round, the 16 teams are divided into 4 groups and each team will play 3 matches. However this time, only group winners advance. Both semi-finals and finals are one-legged fixtures.\n\n==Participating clubs==\n* Clubs starting from the First Round: [[F.C.

In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by [[NPR]] (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]]; its television counterpart, [[PBS]], was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other). {{As of|2014|09|30|df=US}}, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).<ref>{{cite web |last=Waits |first=Jennifer |title=Number of U.S. Radio Stations on the Rise, Especially LPFM, according to New FCC Count |website=Radio Survivor |date=October 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/10/17/number-u-s-radio-stations-rise-especially-lpfm-according-latest-fcc-count/}}</ref>\n\nWell-known newspapers include ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref name=\"Shaffer2006\">{{cite book |author=Brenda Shaffer |title=The Limits of Culture: Islam and Foreign Policy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEOd-cDWVwQC&pg=PA116 |year=2006 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-19529-4 |page=116}}</ref> Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the [[Associated Press]] or [[Reuters]], for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] or [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]], which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's ''[[The Village Voice]]'' or Los Angeles' ''[[LA Weekly]]'', to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book]] began appearing in the 19th century.

An [[early access]] version of the game was released on December 16, 2016, and a 1.0 version of the game was released on February 6, 2019. The player is tasked with colonizing planets, creating structures, and mining resources. ''Astroneer'' has no set goal or storyline, though each planet holds challenges for players to complete. The [[PlayStation 4]] version was released on November 15, 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Astroneer gameplay.png|thumb|left|The astroneer reshapes the environment using the \"terrain tool\"]]\n\n''Astroneer'' is a [[Sandbox game|sandbox]] [[adventure game]] played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person view]]. Its [[open world]] planets, wherein [[terraforming]] can take place, are subject to [[procedural generation]], with the exception of some planet specific resources. The player controls an [[astronaut]] (called an astroneer) who navigates on foot, or by [[lunar rover|rover]] or [[spacecraft]].\n\n===Crafting===\nCraftable items include rovers, buggies, spaceshuttles, storage silos, atmospheric condensers, research chambers, component smelters, batteries, generators, turbines, and solar panels. For example, [[Ammonium]] can be converted into [[hydrazine]] fuel for an Astroneer's spacecraft, or used in its raw form to create a limited-use thruster. When low on oxygen, the Astroneer recharges by staying near craftable tethers, which can be chained over long distances to prevent suffocation. As of the game's full release, an \"[[oxygenator]]\" is required to provide extended reach of oxygen when tethering.\n \n===Terrain Tool===\nEvery Astroneer has a Terrain Tool, which allows the player to gather resources and reshape the landscape. Resources, such as organic material, quartz, lithium, ammonium, and resin, are neatly packaged by the Terrain Tool into convenient stacks. These stacks can then be snapped into slots on the Astoneer's backpack, storage units, research chambers, etc. Certain resources, such as titanite or clay, can be smelted or combined into more advanced materials. The Astroneer also has the option to research and craft upgrades to the Terrain Tool, which can be plugged and unplugged at will.\n\n===Backpack===\nOther than the Terrain Tool, the Backpack is the Astroneer's main tool. The Backpack functions as the player's inventory and HUD, with two quick-use slots, eight storage slots, a basic 3D printer, a small internal power supply (shown by a column of yellow segments), and a built-in oxygen tank (shown as a horizontal blue bar). The Terrain Tool, which also has three slots that can be used for storage, hangs from the side of the Backpack when not in use. The Backpack also contains the Research Catalogue, which the player uses to unlock new crafting blueprints.\n\n==Development==\n''Astroneer'' was announced in October 2015 by System Era Softworks<ref name=\"Frank-2015\" /> and is developed with the [[Unreal Engine 4]].<ref name=\"Rowe-2016\" /> The art style is composed of [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]]-less environments,<ref name=\"Totilo-2016\" /> conceptualized by artist John Liberto.<ref name=\"Plunkett-2015\" /> Co-founder and lead artist Paul Pepera died on March 27, 2017, 4 months after ''Astroneer'''s early access release.<ref name=\"Plunkett-2017\" /><ref name=\"Wawro-2017\" />\n\n==Release==\nOn December 16, 2016, ''Astroneer'' was given an early access release,<ref name=\"Warr-2016\" /> which was expected to last a year or two, according to the developer.<ref name=\"MacLeod-2016\" /> The post-alpha, full game release date was February 6, 2019 for Windows and Xbox One. Currently, the game can be purchased and downloaded through Steam with an original soundtrack for an added price. On November 15, 2019, ''Astroneer'' was released to the PlayStation 4.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 71/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/astroneer |title=ASTRONEER for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref><br />XONE: 73/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/astroneer |title=ASTRONEER for Xbox One Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The player controls an [[astronaut]] (called an astroneer) who navigates on foot, or by [[lunar rover|rover]] or [[spacecraft]].\n\n\n===Crafting===\nCraftable items include rovers, buggies, spaceshuttles, storage silos, atmospheric condensers, research chambers, component smelters, batteries, generators, turbines, and solar panels. For example, [[Ammonium]] can be converted into [[hydrazine]] fuel for an Astroneer's spacecraft, or used in its raw form to create a limited-use thruster. When low on oxygen, the Astroneer recharges by staying near craftable tethers, which can be chained over long distances to prevent suffocation. As of the game's full release, an \"[[oxygenator]]\" is required to provide extended reach of oxygen when tethering.\n \n===Terrain Tool===\nEvery Astroneer has a Terrain Tool, which allows the player to gather resources and reshape the landscape. Resources, such as organic material, quartz, lithium, ammonium, and resin, are neatly packaged by the Terrain Tool into convenient stacks. These stacks can then be snapped into slots on the Astoneer's backpack, storage units, research chambers, etc. Certain resources, such as titanite or clay, can be smelted or combined into more advanced materials. The Astroneer also has the option to research and craft upgrades to the Terrain Tool, which can be plugged and unplugged at will.\n\n===Backpack===\nOther than the Terrain Tool, the Backpack is the Astroneer's main tool. The Backpack functions as the player's inventory and HUD, with two quick-use slots, eight storage slots, a basic 3D printer, a small internal power supply (shown by a column of yellow segments), and a built-in oxygen tank (shown as a horizontal blue bar). The Terrain Tool, which also has three slots that can be used for storage, hangs from the side of the Backpack when not in use. The Backpack also contains the Research Catalogue, which the player uses to unlock new crafting blueprints.\n\n==Development==\n''Astroneer'' was announced in October 2015 by System Era Softworks<ref name=\"Frank-2015\" /> and is developed with the [[Unreal Engine 4]].<ref name=\"Rowe-2016\" /> The art style is composed of [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]]-less environments,<ref name=\"Totilo-2016\" /> conceptualized by artist John Liberto.<ref name=\"Plunkett-2015\" /> Co-founder and lead artist Paul Pepera died on March 27, 2017, 4 months after ''Astroneer'''s early access release.<ref name=\"Plunkett-2017\" /><ref name=\"Wawro-2017\" />\n\n==Release==\nOn December 16, 2016, ''Astroneer'' was given an early access release,<ref name=\"Warr-2016\" /> which was expected to last a year or two, according to the developer.<ref name=\"MacLeod-2016\" /> The post-alpha, full game release date was February 6, 2019 for Windows and Xbox One. Currently, the game can be purchased and downloaded through Steam with an original soundtrack for an added price. On November 15, 2019, ''Astroneer'' was released to the PlayStation 4.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PC: 71/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/astroneer |title=ASTRONEER for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref><br />XONE: 73/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/astroneer |title=ASTRONEER for Xbox One Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

''piscicida''''' (previously known as '''''Pasteurella piscicida''''') is a [[gram-negative]] rod-shaped [[bacterium]] that causes disease in [[fish]].\n\n==Disease==\nPasteurellosis is also described as photobacteriosis (due to the change in the taxonomic position), is caused by the [[halophilic]] bacterium ''Photobacterium damsalae'' subsp. ''piscicida'' (formerly ''Pasteurella piscicida'').\nIt was first isolated in mortalities occurring in natural populations of [[white perch]] (''Morone americanus'') and [[striped bass]] (''M. saxatilis'') in 1963 in [[Chesapeake Bay]], USA (''Snieszko ''et al.'', 1964''). Since 1969, this disease has been one of the most important in Japan, affecting mainly [[yellowtail (fish)|yellowtail]] (''Seriola quinqueradiata'') (Kusuda & Yamaoka, 1972). From 1990 it has caused economic losses in different European countries including France (Baudin-Laurencin ''et al.'', 1991), Italy (Ceschia ''et al.'', 1991), Spain (Toranzo ''et al.'', 1991), Greece (Bakopoulos ''et al.'', 1995), Turkey (Canand ''et al.'', 1996), Portugal (Baptista ''et al.'', 1996) and Malta (Bakopoulos ''et al.'', 1997). Gilthead sea bream (''Sparus aurata''), seabass (''Dicentrarchus labrax'') and sole (''Solea'' spp.) are the most affected species in Europe Mediterranean countries, as well as hybrid striped bass (''M. saxatilis'' x ''M. chrysops'') in the USA. However, the natural hosts of the pathogen are a wide variety of marine fish (Romalde & Magari\u00f1os, 1997).\n\nThis pathology is temperature dependent and occurs usually when water temperatures rise above 18-20&nbsp;\u00b0C. Below this temperature, fish can harbour the pathogen as subclinical infection and become carriers for long time periods (Romalde, 2002).\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Phdp.jpeg]] -->\n\n==Symptoms==\nPastereullosis is also known as pseudotubercullosis because it is characterized by the presence, in the chronic form of the disease, of creamy-white granulomatous nodules or whitish tubercules in several internal organs, composed of masses of bacterial cells, [[epithelial]] cells, and [[fibroblast]]s. The nodules are most prominent in internal viscera, particularly kidney and spleen, and the infection is accompanied by widespread internal necrosis (Evelyn, 1996; Romalde, 2002; Barnes ''et al.'', 2005). Anorexia with darkening of the skin as well as focused necrosis of the gills are the only external clinical signs often observed. These lesions are generally missing in the acute form. The disease is difficult to eradicate with [[antibiotics|antibiotic treatments]], and there is evidence that carriers under stressful conditions could suffer from reinfection (Le Breton, 1999).\n\n==Identification==\nMorphologically, the bacteria is a rod shaped cell, with no [[motility]].\nGram negative, with bipolar staining.\nThe presumptive identification of the pathogen is based on standard biochemical tests. In addition, although ''Ph. damsalae'' subsp. ''piscicida'' is not included in the API-20E code index, this miniaturised system can also be useful for its identification, since all strains display the same profile (2005004). Slide agglutination test using specific antiserum is needed for a confirmative identification of the microorganism (Romalde, 2002).\n\n[[Image:API Phdp.jpeg]]\n\n==Virulence==\nThe virulence of the pathogen implies the production of polysaccharide capsular layer, and extracellular products, and is also depending on iron availability (Lopez-Doriga ''et al.'', 2000). The bacteria spreads via infected phagocytes, mainly macrophages. This spread can be rapid, and lethal effects may occur within a few days of challenge, affecting tissues containing large numbers of the pathogens (Evelyn, 1996).\n\nNecrotizing fasciitis due to Photobacterium damsela in a man lashed by a stingray.

Peter Craige explains God's self-revelation through His participating in human history is referred to as \"[[Salvation History]].\"<ref name=\":3\" /> The main objective of God's participation is man's salvation. God participates in human history by acting through people and in the world that is both in need of salvation, and is thus imperfect.  God participates in the human activity of war through sinful human beings for His purpose of bringing salvation to the world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Studies conducted by scholars Friedrich Schwally, Johannes Pedersen, Patrick D.

War is considered evil. God's participation through evil human activity such as war, was for the sole purposes of both redemption and judgment.<ref name=\":3\" /> God's presence in these Old Testament wars does not justify or deem them holy, it serves to provide hope in a situation of hopelessness.<ref name=\":3\" /> The sixth commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill\" (Exodus 20:13) and the fundamental principle it holds true is that reverence for human life must be given the highest importance. The Old Testament points to a time when weapons of war shall be transformed into the instruments of peace, and the hope for the consummation of the Kingdom of God when there will be no more war.<ref name=\":3\" /> Wood points to the scriptures of Isaiah and Micah (Isaiah 2:2-4; 9:5; 11:1-9; and Micah 4:1-7) that express the pacifist view of God's plan to bring peace without violence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Ministry of Jesus===\n{{Overquotation|date=June 2016}}\nJesus appeared to teach pacifism during [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]] when he told his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian pacifism |last=Orr |first=Edgar W. |authorlink= |author2= |year=1958 |publisher=C.W.

The first was the interdenominational [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (\"FoR\"), founded in Britain in 1915 but soon joined by sister organizations in the U.S. and other countries. Today pacifist organizations serving specific denominations are more or less closely allied with the FoR: they include the [[Methodist Peace Fellowship]] (established in 1933), the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] (established in 1937), [[Pax Christi]] ([[Roman Catholic]], established in 1945), and so forth. The Network of Christian Peace Organisations (NCPO) is a UK-based ecumenical peace network of 28 organizations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ncpo.org.uk/about-the-ncpo |title=Network of Christian Peace Organisations |author= |authorlink= |year= |publisher= }}</ref> Some of these organizations do not take strictly pacifist positions, describing themselves instead as advocating [[nonviolence]], and some either have members who would not consider themselves Christians or are explicitly interfaith. However, they share historical and philosophical roots in Christian pacifism.\n\nIn some cases Christian churches, even if not necessarily committed to Christian pacifism, have supported particular campaigns of [[nonviolent resistance]], also often called [[civil resistance]]. Examples include the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (a grouping of churches in the southern United States) in supporting the [[Civil Rights Movement]]; the Chilean Catholic Church's support for the civic action against authoritarian rule in [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u201390)|Pinochet's Chile]] in the 1980s; and the Polish Catholic Church's support for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] in Poland in the 1980s.<ref>[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 58-74, 127-143 and 197-212.</ref>\n\n[[Walter Wink]] writes that \"There are three general responses to evil: (1) passivity, (2) violent opposition, and (3) the third way of militant nonviolence articulated by Jesus.

Peter Craige explains God's self-revelation through His participating in human history is referred to as \"[[Salvation History]].\"<ref name=\":3\" /> The main objective of God's participation is man's salvation.

Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira|Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira]] 2\u20131 to win their third title.\n\n==Format==\nThis seasons' format consists of 3 rounds, plus knockout stages. In the first round only [[Liga de Honra|second division]] teams play. All 16 teams are allocated into four groups of four teams each. Each team plays 3 matches and top two of each group advances. In the second round, teams that qualified from previous round are joined by the two [[Primeira Liga]] promoted teams and also the six-worst in the top league in the previous season. There will be two-legged fixtures in which the winners will advance. The third round is where the remaining top eight teams from previous season first division enter the competition. Again, as in the first round, the 16 teams are divided into four groups and each team will play three matches. However this time, only group winners advance. Both semi-finals and finals are one-legged fixtures.\n\n==Participating clubs==\n* Clubs starting from the First Round: [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]], [[G.D. Estoril Praia|Estoril]], [[C.D.

Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira|Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira]] 2\u20131 to win their third title.\n\n==Format==\nThis seasons' format consists of 3 rounds, plus knockout stages. In the first round only [[Liga de Honra|second division]] teams play. All 16 teams are allocated into four groups of four teams each. Each team plays 3 matches and top two of each group advances. In the second round, teams that qualified from previous round are joined by the two [[Primeira Liga]] promoted teams and also the six-worst in the top league in the previous season. There will be two-legged fixtures in which the winners will advance. The third round is where the remaining top eight teams from previous season first division enter the competition. Again, as in the first round, the 16 teams are divided into four groups and each team will play three matches. However this time, only group winners advance. Both semi-finals and finals are one-legged fixtures.\n\n==Participating clubs==\n* Clubs starting from the First Round: [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]], [[G.D. Estoril Praia|Estoril]], [[C.D.

An example of a pre-established text for an invocation is the [[Lord's Prayer]].\n\nAll religions in general use invoking prayers, [[liturgies]], or [[hymns]]; see for example the [[mantra]]s in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], the [[Egypt]]ian ''Coming Out by Day'' (aka ''[[Book of the Dead]]''), the [[Orphic]] Hymns and the many texts, still preserved, written in [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] characters on clay tablets, addressed to [[Shamash]], [[Ishtar]], and other deities.\n\n=== As alternative to prayer ===\nAn invocation can also be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=19423373|title = Atheist Delivers Invocation At Tulsa City Council Meeting For First Time Ever|date = Aug 30, 2012<!-- 9:27 PM EDT-->|publisher = KOTV.com}}</ref> Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers opening meetings. The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had before, used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in [[South Portland, Maine]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2938|title = Andrew Lovley's Secular Invocation|publisher = Secular Students Alliance|date = 2009-12-15 <!-- - 10:08 --> |author = Lyz}}</ref>\n\nIn this usage, it is comparable to an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] as an alternative for those who conscientiously object to taking [[oath]]s of any kind, be it for reasons of belief or [[non-belief]].\n\n== A form of possession ==\nThe word \"possession\" is used here in its neutral form to mean \"a state (sometimes psychological) in which an individual's normal personality is replaced by another\". This is also sometimes known as 'aspecting'.  This can be done as a means of communicating with or getting closer to a deity or spirit, and as such need not be viewed synonymously with [[demonic possession]].\n\nIn some religious traditions including [[Paganism]], [[Shamanism]] and [[Wicca]], \"invocation\" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from \"[[evocation]]\", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, [[Aleister Crowley]] states that\n\n<blockquote>\nTo \"invoke\" is to \"call in\", just as to \"evoke\" is to \"call forth\". This is the essential difference between the two branches of [[Magic (paranormal)|Magick]]. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the [[consciousness]]. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.<ref>[[Aleister Crowley]], ''Magick, Book 4'', p.147</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPossessive invocation may be attempted singly or, as is often the case in Wicca, in pairs - with one person doing the invocation (reciting the liturgy or prayers and acting as anchor), and the other person being invoked (allowing themselves to become a vessel for the spirit or deity). The person successfully invoked may be moved to speak or act in non-characteristic ways, acting as the deity or spirit; and they may lose all or some self-awareness while doing so. A communication might also be given via imagery (a [[religious vision]]). They may also be led to recite a text in the manner of that deity, in which case the invocation is more akin to ritual drama. The Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] is an example of such a pre-established recitation. See also the [[ritual]] of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]].\n\nThe ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to [[loa]] possession in the [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] tradition where devotees are described as being \"ridden\" or \"mounted\" by the deity or spirit. In 1995 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] journalist [[Carol Beckwith]] described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions:\n\n<blockquote>\nA woman splashed sand into her eyes, a man cut his belly with shards of glass but did not bleed, another swallowed fire. Nearby a believer, perhaps a yam farmer or fisherman, heated hand-wrought knives in crackling flames. Then another man brought one of the knives to his tongue. We cringed at the sight and were dumbfounded when, after several repetitions, his tongue had not even reddened.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Carol |last=Beckwith |title=The African Roots of Voodoo |publisher= National Geographic 188.2 |date=August 1995 |pages=102\u2013113 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPossessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where [[Odin]] is invoked to \"ride\" workers of [[seidr]] (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].  Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.<ref>[[Robert J Wallis]], ''Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans'', p.96 {{ISBN|0-415-30202-1}}</ref>\n\n== Command or conjuration ==\n{{main|Conjuration}}\nSome have performed invocation for the purpose of controlling or extracting favors from certain spirits or deities.  These invocations usually involve a commandment or threat against the entity invoked.\n\nThe following is a curious example of such an invocation, found engraved in [[cuneiform]] on a statue of the Assyrian [[demon]] [[Pazuzu]].  Although it seems to constitute an identification with the demon, it was actually considered a protective [[amulet]] with the power to command this entity not to harm people or their possessions.{{citation needed|reason=this is a potentially dangerous invocation, and its true purpose should be verified|date=March 2010}}\n\n<blockquote>\nI am Pazuzu, son of the king of the evil spirits, that one who descends impetuously from the mountains and bring the storms. That is the one I am.\n</blockquote>\n\nAnother example is found in the book [[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]] during the Conjuration of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], where the goddess is evoked into a piece of bread and threatened to grant a wish:\n\n:''I do not bake the bread, nor with it salt''\n:''Nor do I cook the honey with the wine''\n:''I bake the body and the blood and soul''\n:''The soul of (great) Diana that she shall''\n:''Know neither rest nor peace and ever be''\n:''In cruel suffering till she will grant what I request''\n:''What I do most desire''\n:''I beg it of her from my very heart!''\n:''And if the grace be granted, O Diana!''\n:''In honour of thee I will hold this feast''\n:''Feast and drain the goblet deep''\n:''We will dance and wildly leap''\n:''And if thou grant'st the grace which I require''\n:''Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps''\n:''Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!''\n\n== Self-identification with certain spirits ==\nInvocation can refer to taking on the qualities of the being invoked, such as the allure of [[Aphrodite]] or the ferocity of [[Kali]]. In this instance the being is literally called up from within oneself (as an [[archetype]]) or into oneself (as an external force), depending on the personal belief system of the invoker. The main difference between this type of invocation and the possessive category described above is that the former may appear more controlled, with self-identification and deity-identification mixed together. In practice, invocations may blend many or all of these categories.  See for example this Hymn to Astarte from the [[Songs of Bilitis]], first attributed to a contemporary of [[Sappho]] (but actually written by [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] in the 1890s):\n\n<blockquote>\nMother inexhaustible and incorruptible, creatures, born the first, engendered by thyself and by thyself conceived, issue of thyself alone and seeking joy within thyself, [[Astarte]]! \nOh! Perpetually fertilized, virgin and nurse of all that is, chaste and lascivious, pure and revelling, ineffable, nocturnal, sweet, breather of fire, foam of the sea! \nThou who accordest grace in secret, thou who unitest, thou who lovest, thou who seizest with furious desire the multiplied races of savage beasts and couplest the sexes in the wood. \nOh, irresistible Astarte! hear me, take me, possess me, oh, Moon! and thirteen times each year draw from my womb the sweet libation of my blood!<ref>From the Songs of Bilitis</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black Mass]]\n* [[Myth and ritual]]\n* [[Ritual]]\n* [[Servitor (chaos magic)]]\n* [[Witchcraft]]\n* [[Witches' Sabbath]]\n* [[Worship]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://duas-world.com Supplication] from the Quran and the Sunnah\n* [http://www.swagga.com/voodoo.htm Origins of Voodoo]\n\n\n[[Category:Prayer]]\n[[Category:Anthropology of religion]]\n[[Category:Ritual]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|religious and spiritual '''invocation'''|the term meaning starting computer software|execution (computers)|other uses|Invocation (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}\n\nAn '''invocation''' (from the [[Latin verbs|Latin verb]] ''invocare'' \"to call on, invoke, to give\") may take the form of:\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades invocation to muhammad.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Invocation'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\n*[[Supplication]], [[prayer]] or [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]].\n*A form of [[Spirit possession|possession]].\n*[[wikt:command|Command]] or [[conjuration]].\n*[[Self-identification]] with certain spirits.\n\nThese forms are described below, but are not mutually exclusive. \nSee also [[Theurgy]].\n\n== Supplication or prayer ==\nAs a supplication or prayer it implies to call upon [[God]], a god, [[goddess]], or person, etc. When a person calls upon God, a god, or goddess to ask for something (protection, a favour, his/her spiritual presence in a ceremony, etc.) or simply for [[worship]], this can be done in a pre-established form or with the invoker's own words or actions.

This can be done as a means of communicating with or getting closer to a deity or spirit, and as such need not be viewed synonymously with [[demonic possession]].\n\nIn some religious traditions including [[Paganism]], [[Shamanism]] and [[Wicca]], \"invocation\" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from \"[[evocation]]\", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, [[Aleister Crowley]] states that\n\n<blockquote>\nTo \"invoke\" is to \"call in\", just as to \"evoke\" is to \"call forth\". This is the essential difference between the two branches of [[Magic (paranormal)|Magick]]. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the [[consciousness]]. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.<ref>[[Aleister Crowley]], ''Magick, Book 4'', p.147</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPossessive invocation may be attempted singly or, as is often the case in Wicca, in pairs - with one person doing the invocation (reciting the liturgy or prayers and acting as anchor), and the other person being invoked (allowing themselves to become a vessel for the spirit or deity). The person successfully invoked may be moved to speak or act in non-characteristic ways, acting as the deity or spirit; and they may lose all or some self-awareness while doing so. A communication might also be given via imagery (a [[religious vision]]). They may also be led to recite a text in the manner of that deity, in which case the invocation is more akin to ritual drama. The Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] is an example of such a pre-established recitation. See also the [[ritual]] of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]].\n\nThe ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to [[loa]] possession in the [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] tradition where devotees are described as being \"ridden\" or \"mounted\" by the deity or spirit. In 1995 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] journalist [[Carol Beckwith]] described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions:\n\n<blockquote>\nA woman splashed sand into her eyes, a man cut his belly with shards of glass but did not bleed, another swallowed fire. Nearby a believer, perhaps a yam farmer or fisherman, heated hand-wrought knives in crackling flames. Then another man brought one of the knives to his tongue. We cringed at the sight and were dumbfounded when, after several repetitions, his tongue had not even reddened.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Carol |last=Beckwith |title=The African Roots of Voodoo |publisher= National Geographic 188.2 |date=August 1995 |pages=102\u2013113 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPossessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where [[Odin]] is invoked to \"ride\" workers of [[seidr]] (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].  Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.<ref>[[Robert J Wallis]], ''Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans'', p.96 {{ISBN|0-415-30202-1}}</ref>\n\n== Command or conjuration ==\n{{main|Conjuration}}\nSome have performed invocation for the purpose of controlling or extracting favors from certain spirits or deities.  These invocations usually involve a commandment or threat against the entity invoked.\n\nThe following is a curious example of such an invocation, found engraved in [[cuneiform]] on a statue of the Assyrian [[demon]] [[Pazuzu]].  Although it seems to constitute an identification with the demon, it was actually considered a protective [[amulet]] with the power to command this entity not to harm people or their possessions.{{citation needed|reason=this is a potentially dangerous invocation, and its true purpose should be verified|date=March 2010}}\n\n<blockquote>\nI am Pazuzu, son of the king of the evil spirits, that one who descends impetuously from the mountains and bring the storms. That is the one I am.\n</blockquote>\n\nAnother example is found in the book [[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]] during the Conjuration of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], where the goddess is evoked into a piece of bread and threatened to grant a wish:\n\n:''I do not bake the bread, nor with it salt''\n:''Nor do I cook the honey with the wine''\n:''I bake the body and the blood and soul''\n:''The soul of (great) Diana that she shall''\n:''Know neither rest nor peace and ever be''\n:''In cruel suffering till she will grant what I request''\n:''What I do most desire''\n:''I beg it of her from my very heart!''\n:''And if the grace be granted, O Diana!''\n:''In honour of thee I will hold this feast''\n:''Feast and drain the goblet deep''\n:''We will dance and wildly leap''\n:''And if thou grant'st the grace which I require''\n:''Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps''\n:''Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!''\n\n== Self-identification with certain spirits ==\nInvocation can refer to taking on the qualities of the being invoked, such as the allure of [[Aphrodite]] or the ferocity of [[Kali]]. In this instance the being is literally called up from within oneself (as an [[archetype]]) or into oneself (as an external force), depending on the personal belief system of the invoker. The main difference between this type of invocation and the possessive category described above is that the former may appear more controlled, with self-identification and deity-identification mixed together. In practice, invocations may blend many or all of these categories.  See for example this Hymn to Astarte from the [[Songs of Bilitis]], first attributed to a contemporary of [[Sappho]] (but actually written by [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] in the 1890s):\n\n<blockquote>\nMother inexhaustible and incorruptible, creatures, born the first, engendered by thyself and by thyself conceived, issue of thyself alone and seeking joy within thyself, [[Astarte]]! \nOh! Perpetually fertilized, virgin and nurse of all that is, chaste and lascivious, pure and revelling, ineffable, nocturnal, sweet, breather of fire, foam of the sea! \nThou who accordest grace in secret, thou who unitest, thou who lovest, thou who seizest with furious desire the multiplied races of savage beasts and couplest the sexes in the wood. \nOh, irresistible Astarte! hear me, take me, possess me, oh, Moon! and thirteen times each year draw from my womb the sweet libation of my blood!<ref>From the Songs of Bilitis</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black Mass]]\n* [[Myth and ritual]]\n* [[Ritual]]\n* [[Servitor (chaos magic)]]\n* [[Witchcraft]]\n* [[Witches' Sabbath]]\n* [[Worship]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://duas-world.com Supplication] from the Quran and the Sunnah\n* [http://www.swagga.com/voodoo.htm Origins of Voodoo]\n\n\n[[Category:Prayer]]\n[[Category:Anthropology of religion]]\n[[Category:Ritual]]\n", "name_user": "2603:9001:2003:7ae4:84b5:ccef:e788:e9f9", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAs alternative to prayer:Typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invocation"}

Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

charts showing the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

charts showing the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Due to his sudden and early death, Gibbons' output was not as large as that of his older contemporary [[William Byrd]], but he still managed to produce various [[secular]] and [[sacred]] [[polyphony|polyphonic]] vocal works, including [[Consort song (musical)|consort songs]], [[service (music)|services]], [[motets]], more than 40 [[anthem|full anthems]] and [[verse anthem|verse anthems]], a set of 20 [[madrigals]] as well as at least 20 keyboard works and various [[instrumental]] ensemble pieces including nearly 30 [[Fantasia (music)|fantasies]] for [[Viol|viols]]. He is well known for the 5-part verse anthem ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', the 8-part full anthem ''O Clap Your Hands Together'', 2 settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] and what is often thought to be the best known English madrigal: ''[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]''.\n\nBorn in [[Oxford]], [[Oxfordshire]], Gibbons was born into a musical family where his father, William Gibbons, was a [[wait (musician)|wait]],{{#tag:ref|This would indicate that William was either an instrumentalist, singer or perhaps both.|group=n}} his children being expected to follow his footsteps in the trade. It is not known with whom he studied composition, although it may have been with an older brother or his father. Gibbons was certainly acquainted with William Byrd and [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]], and the three later collectively published the first printed book of keyboard music, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]''. Since Bull was a student of Byrd it is possible that Gibbons was as well; however, there is no supporting evidence of this.\n\nIrrespective of his education, he was musically proficient enough to be appointed by [[James VI and I|King James I]] a [[Gentleman of the Chapel Royal|gentleman]] of the [[Chapel Royal]] around May of 1603 and a senior organist by 1605. By 1606 he had graduated from [[King's College, Cambridge]] with a [[Bachelor of Music]] and may have received a [[Doctor of Music]] from [[Oxford]] in May of 1622. The most important position achieved by Gibbons was his appointment in 1623 as the [[List of Westminster Abbey organists|organist]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] which he held for 2 years until his death on the June 5th, 1625.\n\nGibbons was the leading composer in early 17th century England and a pivotal [[Transition from Renaissance to Baroque in instrumental music|transitional figure]] from the end of the [[Renaissance]] to the beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]]. He was praised in his time by a visit in 1624 from the French ambassador, [[Charles de L'Aubespine]], who stated upon entering Westminster Abbey that \u201cAt the entrance, the organ was touched by the best finger of that age, Mr. Orlando Gibbons.\"{{sfn|Huray|2001}} Musicologist and composer, [[Frederick Ouseley]], dubbed him to be the \"English Palestrina\"<ref>Grove 1900, pp. 71</ref>{{#tag:ref|This is in reference to the revered polyphonic Italian composer, [[Giovanni Palestrina]].|group=n}} and the Canadian pianist [[Glenn Gould]] praised him highly and compared his music, especially for the keyboard, to the likes of [[Beethoven]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]].<ref>[https://www.orlandogibbons.com/gould-on-gibbons/ \"Gould and Gibbons\" Gould and Gibbons.] N.p, 2019.

his baptism.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Gibbons' father had previously lived in Cambridge where he was also the head of the town waits and around 1588, when Orlando was 4\u20135 years old, the Gibbons family moved back to Cambridge and William resumed his previous post there.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=11}}{{sfn|Turbet|2016}}\n\nOrlando was born into a musical family where not only was his father a musician but his oldest brother, [[Edward Gibbons|Edward]], was a composer and master of the choristers at [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]].{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=28}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=18}} His second brother, [[Ellis Gibbons|Ellis]], was a promising composer but died prematurely, while his third brother, Ferdinando, may have eventually taken their father's place as a

meant that he was likely instructed on various instruments by his father or older brothers.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} At the age of 12, he became a member of Edward's Choir of King's College, Cambridge on 14 February 1596{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=34\u201335}}He was a regular member of the choir until sometime in the [[Michaelmas term]] of 1598 and the [[Easter term]] (summer term) of same year he

However, from 1998\u20131999 Gibbons' name appeared sporadically in the chorus member logs, suggesting that, if not a clerical error, he sang continued to sing irregularly, perhaps for special occasions.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=33}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Gibbons' composition teacher is unknown, although it would make sense if it was an older or his father, due to them all being experienced musicians.{{sfn|Cummings}} Edward is often proposed as the most likely candidate by historians, as he was the oldest brother, had achieved a [[Bachelor of Music]] at King's College, Cambridge, and was already experienced as the master of the choruses at.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Another possible composition teacher is [[William Byrd]], who was at least 40 years his senior and the most respected English composer at the time.{{sfn|Milsom|2011}} Gibbons and Byrd along with the composer [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] later collectively published music and since Bull was a student of Byrd's, Gibbons may very well have been as well.{{sfn|Turbet|2016}} No matter how his musical education came about, Gibbons was known to be composing music by the end of his time at the choir in 1599, at age 15\u201316.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Cummings}}\n\n===Early career and marriage===\n[[File:James I of England Schloss Ambras.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Employer of Orlando Gibbons, [[James I of England]]]]\nGibbons' abilities had reached the point to allow him become a Musician of the [[Chapel Royal]] on 19 May 1603.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} His name appears at this time in a Cheque book from the Chapel Royal for services to [[King James I of England|King James I]], as he was likely Gentleman Extraordinary (unpaid substitute) awaiting the vacancy of a paid position.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} 1603 must have also been an emotionally taxing year, as even though he received his first position as a professional musician, both his mother and brother, Ellis, passed away.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Eventually Gibbons' awaited vacancy occurred with the death of Arthur Cook, so on 21 March 1605 he secured the prestigious position of [[Gentleman of the Chapel Royal]], as the junior chapel organist.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=29}}{{sfn|Wood|1815|p=406}} Edward Gibbon's friendship with the former organist, Arthur Cook, and the senior chapel organist, [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]], may have helped his younger brother secure this position.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=30}}{{sfn|Harper|2008}} Either way, becoming a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal at the age of only 21 would have been an impressive feat at the time and he kept this position until the end of his life.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=35}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=31}}\n\nThe next year, 1606, was a busy year as he married Elizabeth Patten on 17 February 1606.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=35}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=32}} Elizabeth was the daughter of John Patten, a [[Yeoman]] of the [[Vestry]] in the Chapel Royal, suggesting that he was well acquainted with Gibbons, something that likely helped arrange the marriage.{{sfn|Harley|1999|pp=32\u201333}} In fact, when John Patten died in 1623, he made Gibbons his sole heir, [[residuary estate|residuary legatee]] and left 200 pounds for his children.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=36}} The same year, shortly after his marriage, Orlando graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor in Music.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=36}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=33}} Gibbons and his wife lived in Woolstaple (now [[Bridge Street]]) which was in the [[parish]] of [[St Margaret's, Westminster]], the church where Gibbons' seven children{{#tag:ref|Gibbons and Patten's 7 children were, James, Alice, Christopher, Ann, Mary, Elizabeth and Orlando.{{sfn|Westminster Abbey}}|group=n}} would be baptised, including the well known composer, [[Christopher Gibbons]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Turbet|2016}}{{sfn|Huray|2001}}\n\n===Publishing and patronage===\nBy the 1610s Gibbons had become a composer of high repute and perhaps the best organist in England.{{sfn|Cummings}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=49}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=37}} This is the same time where Gibbons became a close friend of [[Christopher Hatton (died 1619)|Sir Christopher Hatton]], who became an important [[patron]] of his.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=38}} Hatton was the second cousin and heir of the more famous [[Christopher Hatton]], [[favourite]] of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I of England]].{{sfn|Harper|2008}} In fact, Hatton and his wife, Alice Fanshawe, were probably the namesakes of 2 of Gibbons' children, Ann Gibbons and the future composer [[Christopher Gibbons]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=37}}{{sfn|Harper|2008}}   The next years saw the publishing of various works by Gibbons, the first of which, his ''First Set of Madrigals and Motets'' was published in 1612 under the Patronage of Hatton.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} One of the Madrigals in the set was renowned and probably the most famous English Madrigal, ''[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]''.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=55}} Gibbons also dedicated the entire set of works to Hatton and claimed that most of it was composed in his house, specifically stating to him that the songs: \n\n{{quote|Were most of them composed in your owne house, and doe therefore properly belong unto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they speake you provided them, I onely furnished them with Tongues to utter the same name.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=37}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=36}}}}<!--Please note that the preceding quote may have grammatical errors in the context of modern english, but was recorded and written here in with exact old english spellings.-->\n\nThis quote has been interpreted in suggesting that Hatton wrote some or all of the poems that Gibbons set to music in his ''First Set of Madrigals and Motets,'' however, there is no evidence other than speculative to support this.{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=35}} Additionally, it is unlikely that Gibbons was a resident of Hatton's household, however their friendship suggests that Hatton may have set a room aside for him to compose.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}}\n\n{{multiple

England at the time. They collectively worked in the service of [[James I|James VI and I]] and published [[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]].}}\nSometime in 1612\u20131613, Gibbons had 6 works published in the first printed collection of keyboard music, [[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]], which included works by the older and important composers, [[William Byrd]] and [[John Bull]].{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=35}} This publication was to celebrate the marriage of the [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Duke Frederick V, the Elector of Palestine]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=43}} Compositions written sometime in the next couple of years, including various anthems dedicated to senior clergy, the pavan ''Lord Salisbury'' for Lord Salisbury and the wedding anthem ''Blessed are all they'' in 1613 for the Earl of Somerset suggest that he was well associated throughout the court.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} In 1614 [[William Leighton]] published ''The Teares and Lamentatacions of a Sorrowfull Soule'' with 2 contributions by Gibbons, ''O Lord how do my woes increase'' and ''O Lord, I lift my heart to Thee''.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=51}} Although he possibly started as early as 1605, Gibbons was the joint organist with [[Edmund Hooper (organist)|Edmund Hooper]] by at least 1615.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Westminster Abbey}} The same year he received two grants from King James I, worth 150 pounds total.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|pp=37\u201338}} These grants were: \n\n{{quote|For and in consideration of the good and faithful service heretofore done unto ourself by Orlando Gibbons our organist, and divers other good causes and considerations us thereunto moving.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|pp=37\u201338}}}}\n\nGibbons continued writing for James I, composing the anthem ''Great King of Gods'' and the court song ''Do not repine, fair sun'' in celebration of the King's 1617 visit to Scotland.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}\n\n===Late career===\nBy the late 1610s Gibbons was undoubtedly the most important musician and composer at court as William Byrd had retired in [[Essex]] and John Bull had fled to the [[Low Countries]] to avoid a charge of adultery.{{sfn|Turbet|2016}}{{sfn|Milsom|2011}}{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=34}}{{sfn|Neighbour|2001}} In 1617 Gibbons gained the position as keyboard player in an ensemble, organized by [[John Cooper (composer)|John Cooper]], for the privy chamber of Prince Charles (later [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]).{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=58}} He was the only keyboardist in a group of 17 musicians of whom the Prince himself was thought to have occasionally joined the musicians on either the [[Viol|Bass-Viol]] or [[Viol|Viol da Gamba]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=59}} It is likely that Gibbons was able to write for this ensemble and had pieces premiered by it.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} In addition to this, Gibbons probably gained a 3rd position in September 1619, attending the royal privy chamber of James I.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=62\u201363}} His next major work, ''Fantasies of Three Parts'' was published around 1620 and dedicated it to Edmund Wry. This seemingly random dedication has provoked much speculation. It may be because Wry could secure Gibbons a better post, or it may be an action of gratitude for having already secured him the post for the royal privy chamber of the King.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=63}}\n\nWhile once assumed to be fact, there is now much doubt as to if Gibbons received a Doctor of Music on 17 May 1622. In 1815, Wood stated:  \n\n{{quote|\"On the 17th of May, Orlando Gibbons, one of the organists of his majesty's chapel, did supplicate the venerable congregation that he might accumulate the degrees in music; but whether he was admitted to the one, or license to proceed in the other, it appears not.\"{{sfn|Wood|1815|p=406}}}}\n\nThis uncertainty has continued until present day and is made even more confusing by the use of Gibbon's 8 part full anthem, ''O clap your hands'', as the commencement song for [[William Heather|William Heather's]]{{#tag:ref|Often spelled as William Heyther.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=64}}|group=n}} honorary doctor of music on 17 May 1622.{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=42}}{{sfn|Mateer|2008}} Heather had financially supported [[William Camden|William Camden's]] creation and maintenance of the [[Camden Professor of Ancient History|Camden Professor of Ancient History chair]] and in return the university awarded Heather an honorary bachelor in music and Doctor of Music, even though he was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=65}} Author [[John Hawkins (author)|Sir John Hawkins]] and musicologists [[Edmund Fellowes]] and David Mateer confidently state that Gibbons achieved a Doctor of Music the same day as Heather and cite ''O clap your hands'' to actually be Gibbon's qualifying exercise for his degree.{{sfn|Hawkins|1853|p=573}}{{sfn|Mateer|2008}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}} Where as musicologists Peter Le Huray, John Harper and John Harley propose some concerns as to if Gibbons really achieved a Doctor in Music.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=64\u201366}} Specifically, Harley cites a record in the Cheque book of the Chapel Royal that refers to William Heather as \"doctor\" but Gibbons as \"senior organist.\"{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=66}} Harley also addresses a letter from Camden to William Piers from 18 May 1622, that says Gibbons is a Doctor of Music.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=65}} He suggests that the authenticity of the letter is uncertain, since the original letter doesn't survive, and that Camden could have written something such as \"G\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013s\" which an editor assumed to mean Gibbons.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=66}} However, the most convincing piece of evidence seems to be the absence of mentioning the supposed Doctor of Music on Gibbons' Cambridge monument that was erected in his memory when he died.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=65}} While the existing evidence seems to support that he never achieved a Doctor in Music, there is no indisputable evidence to confirm this claim.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=66}} \n\n===Final years and death===\n\nSometime in 1623, [[George Wither]] published ''Hymnes and Songs of the Church'' where Gibbons provided the tunes for most of the songs.{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=43}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=67}} The same year he succeeded [[John Parsons (organist)|John Parsons]] as the [[List of Westminster Abbey organists|organist]] at [[Westminster Abbey]], with [[Thomas Day]] as junior organist.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=68}} This was probably the most important position Gibbons had taken in his career thus far and on 7 May 1625 he officiated at the funeral of King James I.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=40}} \n\nDuring late May 1625, the English court was preparing to receive [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], whom the now [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] had recently [[Proxy marriage|married through proxy]] in France on 1 May 1625.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=41}} Gibbons and other Chapel Royal members had begun traveling to [[Canterbury]] on 31 May when Gibbons suddenly came down with an illness, probably a [[cerebral aneurysm]].{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=44}} He died at age 41 in [[Canterbury]] and was buried in [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=44}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=47}} His death was a shock to his peers and brought about a post-mortem, though the cause of death aroused less comment than the haste of his burial and his body not being returned to London.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=45}} His wife, Elizabeth, died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando's eldest brother, Edward, to care for the orphaned children.{{sfn|Wood|1815|p=406}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=50}}\n\n==Music==\nOne of the most versatile English composers of his time, Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]] for [[viol]]s, a number of [[madrigal]]s (the best-known being \"[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]\"), and many popular [[verse anthem]]s, all to English texts (the best known being \"Great Lord of Lords\"). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', which sets an [[Advent]] text for solo [[countertenor]] or [[tenor]], alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text's rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons's full anthems include the expressive ''O Lord, in thy wrath'', and the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] anthem ''O clap your hands together'' (after Psalm 47) for eight voices.\n\nHe contributed six pieces to the first printed collection of keyboard music in England, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' (to which he was by far the youngest of the three contributors), published in about 1611. Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in ''Pavane in D minor'' and ''Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard''.<ref>[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]]. 1972.

Then here upon (his death being so sudden) rumours were cast out that he did die of the plague, whereupon we . . . caused his body to be searched by certain women that were sworn to deliver the truth, who did affirm that they never saw a fairer corpse. Yet notwithstanding we to give full satisfaction to all did cause the skull to be opened in our presence & we carefully viewed the body, which we found also to be very clean without any show or spot of any contagious matter. In the brain we found the whole & sole cause of his sickness namely a great admirable blackness & syderation in the outside of the brain. Within the brain (being opened) there did issue out abundance of water intermixed with blood & this we affirm to be the only cause of his sudden death.<ref>[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], ''State Papers Domestic'', [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], 1625, III, 60, quoted in ''Thomas Tomkins: The Last Elizabethan'' by Anthony Boden (Ed) (Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot 2005, {{ISBN|0-754-6511-85}}, p.124).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis account is taken to mean that Gibbons died of a [[cerebral aneurysm]].<ref>{{cite book|title=What Killed the Great and Not So Great Composers?|author=Joseph W.

Due to his sudden and early death, Gibbons' output was not as large as that of his older contemporary [[William Byrd]], but he still managed to produce various [[secular]] and [[sacred]] [[polyphony|polyphonic]] vocal works, including [[Consort song (musical)|consort songs]], [[service (music)|services]], [[motets]], more than 40 [[anthem|full anthems]] and [[verse anthem|verse anthems]], a set of 20 [[madrigals]] as well as at least 20 keyboard works and various [[instrumental]] ensemble pieces including nearly 30 [[Fantasia (music)|fantasies]] for [[Viol|viols]]. He is well known for the 5-part verse anthem ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', the 8-part full anthem ''O Clap Your Hands Together'', 2 settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] and what is often thought to be the best known English madrigal: ''[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]''.\n\nBorn in [[Oxford]], [[Oxfordshire]], Gibbons was born into a musical family where his father, William Gibbons, was a [[wait (musician)|wait]],{{#tag:ref|This would indicate that William was either an instrumentalist, singer or perhaps both.|group=n}} his children being expected to follow his footsteps in the trade. It is not known with whom he studied composition, although it may have been with an older brother or his father. Gibbons was certainly acquainted with William Byrd and [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]], and the three later collectively published the first printed book of keyboard music, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]''. Since Bull was a student of Byrd it is possible that Gibbons was as well; however, there is no supporting evidence of this.\n\nIrrespective of his education, he was musically proficient enough to be appointed by [[James VI and I|King James I]] a [[Gentleman of the Chapel Royal|gentleman]] of the [[Chapel Royal]] around May of 1603 and a senior organist by 1605. By 1606 he had graduated from [[King's College, Cambridge]] with a [[Bachelor of Music]] and may have received a [[Doctor of Music]] from [[Oxford]] in May of 1622. The most important position achieved by Gibbons was his appointment in 1623 as the [[List of Westminster Abbey organists|organist]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] which he held for 2 years until his death on the June 5th, 1625.\n\nGibbons was the leading composer in early 17th century England and a pivotal [[Transition from Renaissance to Baroque in instrumental music|transitional figure]] from the end of the [[Renaissance]] to the beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]]. He was praised in his time by a visit in 1624 from the French ambassador, [[Charles de L'Aubespine]], who stated upon entering Westminster Abbey that \u201cAt the entrance, the organ was touched by the best finger of that age, Mr. Orlando Gibbons.\"{{sfn|Huray|2001}} Musicologist and composer, [[Frederick Ouseley]], dubbed him to be the \"English Palestrina\"<ref>Grove 1900, pp. 71</ref>{{#tag:ref|This is in reference to the revered polyphonic Italian composer, [[Giovanni Palestrina]].|group=n}} and the Canadian pianist [[Glenn Gould]] praised him highly and compared his music, especially for the keyboard, to the likes of [[Beethoven]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]].<ref>[https://www.orlandogibbons.com/gould-on-gibbons/ \"Gould and Gibbons\" Gould and Gibbons.] N.p, 2019. Web. 19 August 2019.</ref> Gibbons paved the way for a future generation of [[Chronological list of English classical composers|English composers]] by perfecting the Byrd's foundations of the [[English Madrigal School|English madrigal]] as well as both full and verse anthems, and especially by teaching music to his oldest son, [[Christopher Gibbons|Christopher]], who in turn taught [[John Blow]], [[Pelham Humfrey]] and most notably [[Henry Purcell]] the English pioneer of the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]].{{sfn|Turbet|2016}} The modern music critic [[John Rockwell]] claimed that the oeuvre of Gibbons: \"all attested not merely to a significant figure in music's past but to a composer who can still speak directly to the present.\"{{sfn|Rockwell|1984}}\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Birthplace and background===\nUp until the mid 20th century Orlando Gibbons was assumed to have been born in [[Cambridge]].{{sfn|Hawkins|1853|p=573}}{{sfn|Thewlis|1940|p=31}} This was accepted as fact by his contemporaries, stated in multiple early biographies and even recorded on a monument in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], that was erected in his memory soon after his death.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=32}} It is even possible that Gibbons himself thought that he was born in Cambridge, since he spent most of his life in Cambridge and only the first 4\u20135 years of his life in [[Oxford]].{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=32}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=7}} Matters are made more confusing as his father had lived in Cambridge for at least 10 years, 1\u20133 years before the birth of Orlando.{{sfn|Harley|1999|pp=5\u20139}} Therefore even though the 17th century biographer, [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], discovered a record of an 'Orlando Gibbons' being baptised in [[Carfax, Oxford|St. Martin's Church]], [[Oxford]], it was assumed to be either a mistake, or a reference to a someone else of the same name.{{sfn|Wood|1815|p=406}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=32}} However, modern historians have proved the claim that he was born in Cambridge to be incorrect. Not only was the baptismal record proved to be authentic, but it was discovered that Orlando's parents both resided in Oxford at the time of his birth, confirming that Orlando's birthplace was in [[Carfax, Oxford|St. Martin's Church]], [[Oxford]].{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=33}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=9}}{{sfn|Thewlis|1940|p=33}}\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:The first St Martin\u2019s Church

his baptism.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Gibbons' father had previously lived in Cambridge where he was also the head of the town waits and around 1588, when Orlando was 4\u20135 years old, the Gibbons family moved back to Cambridge and William resumed his previous post there.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=11}}{{sfn|Turbet|2016}}\n\nOrlando was born into a musical family where not only was his father a musician but his oldest brother, [[Edward Gibbons|Edward]], was a composer and master of the choristers at [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]].{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=28}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=18}} His

on 14 February 1596{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=34\u201335}}He was a regular member of the choir until sometime in the [[Michaelmas term]] of 1598 and the [[Easter term]] (summer term) of same year he

However, from 1998\u20131999 Gibbons' name appeared sporadically in the chorus member logs, suggesting that, if not a clerical error, he sang continued to sing irregularly, perhaps for special occasions.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=33}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Gibbons' composition teacher is unknown, although it would make sense if it was an older or his father, due to them all being experienced musicians.{{sfn|Cummings}} Edward is often proposed as the most likely candidate by historians, as he was the oldest brother, had achieved a [[Bachelor of Music]] at King's College, Cambridge, and was already experienced as the master of the choruses at.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Another possible composition teacher is [[William Byrd]], who was at least 40 years his senior and the most respected English composer at the time.{{sfn|Milsom|2011}} Gibbons and Byrd along with the composer [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] later collectively published music and since Bull was a student of Byrd's, Gibbons may very well have been as well.{{sfn|Turbet|2016}} No matter how his musical education came about, Gibbons was known to be composing music by the end of his time at the choir in 1599, at age 15\u201316.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Cummings}}\n\n===Early career and marriage===\n[[File:James I of England Schloss Ambras.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Employer of Orlando Gibbons, [[James I of England]]]]\nGibbons' abilities had reached the point to allow him become a Musician of the [[Chapel Royal]] on 19 May 1603.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} His name appears at this time in a Cheque book from the Chapel Royal for services to [[King James I of England|King James I]], as he was likely Gentleman Extraordinary (unpaid substitute) awaiting the vacancy of a paid position.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} 1603 must have also been an emotionally taxing year, as even though he received his first position as a professional musician, both his mother and brother, Ellis, passed away.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=24}} Eventually Gibbons' awaited vacancy occurred with the death of Arthur Cook, so on 21 March 1605 he secured the prestigious position of [[Gentleman of the Chapel Royal]], as the junior chapel organist.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=29}}{{sfn|Wood|1815|p=406}} Edward Gibbon's friendship with the former organist, Arthur Cook, and the senior chapel organist, [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]], may have helped his younger brother secure this position.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=30}}{{sfn|Harper|2008}} Either way, becoming a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal at the age of only 21 would have been an impressive feat at the time and he kept this position until the end of his life.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=35}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=31}}\n\nThe next year, 1606, was a busy year as he married Elizabeth Patten on 17 February 1606.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=35}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=32}} Elizabeth was the daughter of John Patten, a [[Yeoman]] of the [[Vestry]] in the Chapel Royal, suggesting that he was well acquainted with Gibbons, something that likely helped arrange the marriage.{{sfn|Harley|1999|pp=32\u201333}} In fact, when John Patten died in 1623, he made Gibbons his sole heir, [[residuary estate|residuary legatee]] and left 200 pounds for his children.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=36}} The same year, shortly after his marriage, Orlando graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor in Music.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=36}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=33}} Gibbons and his wife lived in Woolstaple (now [[Bridge Street]]) which was in the [[parish]] of [[St Margaret's, Westminster]], the church where Gibbons' seven children{{#tag:ref|Gibbons and Patten's 7 children were, James, Alice, Christopher, Ann, Mary, Elizabeth and Orlando.{{sfn|Westminster Abbey}}|group=n}} would be baptised, including the well known composer, [[Christopher Gibbons]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Turbet|2016}}{{sfn|Huray|2001}}\n\n===Publishing and patronage===\nBy the 1610s Gibbons had become a composer of high repute and perhaps the best organist in England.{{sfn|Cummings}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=49}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=37}} This is the same time where Gibbons became a close friend of [[Christopher Hatton (died 1619)|Sir Christopher Hatton]], who became an important [[patron]] of his.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=38}} Hatton was the second cousin and heir of the more famous [[Christopher Hatton]], [[favourite]] of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I of England]].{{sfn|Harper|2008}} In fact, Hatton and his wife, Alice Fanshawe, were probably the namesakes of 2 of Gibbons' children, Ann Gibbons and the future composer [[Christopher Gibbons]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=37}}{{sfn|Harper|2008}}   The next years saw the publishing of various works by Gibbons, the first of which, his ''First Set of Madrigals and Motets'' was published in 1612 under the Patronage of Hatton.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} One of the Madrigals in the set was renowned and probably the most famous English Madrigal, ''[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]''.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=55}} Gibbons also dedicated the entire set of works to Hatton and claimed that most of it was composed in his house, specifically stating to him that the songs: \n\n{{quote|Were most of them composed in your owne house, and doe therefore properly belong unto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they speake you provided them, I onely furnished them with Tongues to utter the same name.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=37}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=36}}}}<!--Please note that the preceding quote may have grammatical errors in the context of modern english, but was recorded and written here in with exact old english spellings.-->\n\nThis quote has been interpreted in suggesting that Hatton wrote some or all of the poems that Gibbons set to music in his ''First Set of Madrigals and Motets,'' however, there is no evidence other than speculative to support this.{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=35}} Additionally, it is unlikely that Gibbons was a resident of Hatton's household, however their friendship suggests that Hatton may have set a room aside for him to compose.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}}\n\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n|image1=William Byrd.jpg\n|image2=John Bull 1589.jpg\n|footer=Along with Gibbons, [[William Byrd]] and [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] were the most important composers in England at the time. They collectively worked in the service of [[James I|James VI and I]] and published [[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]].}}\nSometime in 1612\u20131613, Gibbons had 6 works published in the first printed collection of keyboard music, [[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]], which included works by the older and important composers, [[William Byrd]] and [[John Bull]].{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=35}} This publication was to celebrate the marriage of the [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Duke Frederick V, the Elector of Palestine]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=43}} Compositions written sometime in the next couple of years, including various anthems dedicated to senior clergy, the pavan ''Lord Salisbury'' for Lord Salisbury and the wedding anthem ''Blessed are all they'' in 1613 for the Earl of Somerset suggest that he was well associated throughout the court.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} In 1614 [[William Leighton]] published ''The Teares and Lamentatacions of a Sorrowfull Soule'' with 2 contributions by Gibbons, ''O Lord how do my woes increase'' and ''O Lord, I lift my heart to Thee''.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=51}} Although he possibly started as early as 1605, Gibbons was the joint organist with [[Edmund Hooper (organist)|Edmund Hooper]] by at least 1615.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Westminster Abbey}} The same year he received two grants from King James I, worth 150 pounds total.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|pp=37\u201338}} These grants were: \n\n{{quote|For and in consideration of the good and faithful service heretofore done unto ourself by Orlando Gibbons our organist, and divers other good causes and considerations us thereunto moving.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|pp=37\u201338}}}}\n\nGibbons continued writing for James I, composing the anthem ''Great King of Gods'' and the court song ''Do not repine, fair sun'' in celebration of the King's 1617 visit to Scotland.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}\n\n===Late career===\nBy the late 1610s Gibbons was undoubtedly the most important musician and composer at court as William Byrd had retired in [[Essex]] and John Bull had fled to the [[Low Countries]] to avoid a charge of adultery.{{sfn|Turbet|2016}}{{sfn|Milsom|2011}}{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=34}}{{sfn|Neighbour|2001}} In 1617 Gibbons gained the position as keyboard player in an ensemble, organized by [[John Cooper (composer)|John Cooper]], for the privy chamber of Prince Charles (later [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]).{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=58}} He was the only keyboardist in a group of 17 musicians of whom the Prince himself was thought to have occasionally joined the musicians on either the [[Viol|Bass-Viol]] or [[Viol|Viol da Gamba]].{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=59}} It is likely that Gibbons was able to write for this ensemble and had pieces premiered by it.{{sfn|Huray|2001}} In addition to this, Gibbons probably gained a 3rd position in September 1619, attending the royal privy chamber of James I.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=62\u201363}} His next major work, ''Fantasies of Three Parts'' was published around 1620 and dedicated it to Edmund Wry. This seemingly random dedication has provoked much speculation. It may be because Wry could secure Gibbons a better post, or it may be an action of gratitude for having already secured him the post for the royal privy chamber of the King.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=63}}\n\nWhile once assumed to be fact, there is now much doubt as to if Gibbons received a Doctor of Music on 17 May 1622. Wood stated in 1815 that \n\n{{quote|\"On the 17th of May, Orlando Gibbons, one of the organists of his majesty's chapel, did supplicate the venerable congregation that he might accumulate the degrees in music; but whether he was admitted to the one, or license to proceed in the other, it appears not.\"{{sfn|Wood|1815|p=406}}}}\n\nThis uncertainty has continued until present day and is made even more confusing by the use of Gibbon's 8 part full anthem, ''O clap your hands'', as the commencement song for [[William Heather|William Heather's]]{{#tag:ref|Often spelled as William Heyther.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=64}}|group=n}} honorary doctor of music on 17 May 1622.{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=42}}{{sfn|Mateer|2008}} Heather had financially supported [[William Camden|William Camden's]] creation and maintenance of the [[Camden Professor of Ancient History|Camden Professor of Ancient History chair]] and in return the university awarded Heather an honorary bachelor in music and Doctor of Music, even though he was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=65}} Author [[John Hawkins (author)|Sir John Hawkins]] and musicologists [[Edmund Fellowes]] and David Mateer confidently state that Gibbons achieved a Doctor of Music the same day as Heather and cite ''O clap your hands'' to actually be Gibbon's qualifying exercise for his degree.{{sfn|Hawkins|1853|p=573}}{{sfn|Mateer|2008}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=39}} Where as musicologists Peter Le Huray, John Harper and John Harley propose some concerns as to if Gibbons really achieved a Doctor in Music.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=64\u201366}} Specifically, Harley cites a record in the Cheque book of the Chapel Royal that refers to William Heather as \"doctor\" but Gibbons as \"senior organist.\"{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=66}} Harley also addresses a letter from Camden to William Piers from 18 May 1622, that says Gibbons is a Doctor of Music.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=65}} He suggests that the authenticity of the letter is uncertain, since the original letter doesn't survive, and that Camden could have written something such as \"G\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013s\" which an editor assumed to mean Gibbons.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=66}} However, the most convincing piece of evidence seems to be the absence of mentioning the supposed Doctor of Music on Gibbons' Cambridge monument that was erected in his memory when he died.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=65}} While the existing evidence seems to support that he never achieved a Doctor in Music, there is no indisputable evidence to confirm this claim.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=66}} \n\n===Final years and death===\n\nSometime in 1623, [[George Wither]] published ''Hymnes and Songs of the Church'' where Gibbons provided the tunes for most of the songs.{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=43}}{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=67}} The same year he succeeded [[John Parsons (organist)|John Parsons]] as the [[List of Westminster Abbey organists|organist]] at [[Westminster Abbey]], with [[Thomas Day]] as junior organist.{{sfn|Harley|1999|p=68}} This was probably the most important position Gibbons had taken in his career thus far and on 7 May 1625 he officiated at the funeral of King James I.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=40}} \n\nDuring late May 1625, the English court was preparing to receive [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], whom the now [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] had recently [[Proxy marriage|married through proxy]] in France on 1 May 1625.{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=41}} Gibbons and other Chapel Royal members had begun traveling to [[Canterbury]] on 31 May when Gibbons suddenly came down with an illness, probably a [[cerebral aneurysm]].{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=44}} He died at age 41 in [[Canterbury]] and was buried in [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=44}}{{sfn|Bridge|1920|p=47}} His death was a shock to his peers and brought about a post-mortem, though the cause of death aroused less comment than the haste of his burial and his body not being returned to London.{{sfn|Huray|2001}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=45}} His wife, Elizabeth, died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando's eldest brother, Edward, to care for the orphaned children.{{sfn|Wood|1815|p=406}}{{sfn|Fellowes|1951|p=50}}\n\n==Music==\nOne of the most versatile English composers of his time, Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]] for [[viol]]s, a number of [[madrigal]]s (the best-known being \"[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]\"), and many popular [[verse anthem]]s, all to English texts (the best known being \"Great Lord of Lords\"). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is ''[[This Is the Record of John]]'', which sets an [[Advent]] text for solo [[countertenor]] or [[tenor]], alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text's rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons's full anthems include the expressive ''O Lord, in thy wrath'', and the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] anthem ''O clap your hands together'' (after Psalm 47) for eight voices.\n\nHe contributed six pieces to the first printed collection of keyboard music in England, ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' (to which he was by far the youngest of the three contributors), published in about 1611. Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in ''Pavane in D minor'' and ''Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard''.<ref>[[Willi Apel|Apel, Willi]]. 1972.
