Each version of the system includes an intelligent ''brick'' computer that controls the system, a set of modular sensors and motors, and [[Lego]] parts from the [[Lego Technic|Technic]] line to create the mechanical systems.\n\nSince creation, there have been four generations of the Mindstorms platform: the original Robotics Invention System, NXT, NXT 2.0, and EV3. With each platform release, the motor and sensor capabilities expanded. The latest system, [[Lego Mindstorms EV3]], was released on September 1, 2013. Some robot competitions use this set, such as the [[FIRST Lego League]] and the [[World Robot Olympiad]].\n\n==History==\nThe original Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System was born out of a collaboration between The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] and the Lego group. In 1985, [[Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen]], then Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of The Lego Group, heard of the work of MIT's Seymour Papert and was struck by how similar his goals of learning through building were to those of The Lego Group's newly formed educational division. The Lego Group began a partnership with Papert's Media Lab, funding their research and sharing ideas.<ref name=Beland>{{cite thesis |last=Beland |first=Cristopher |date=Dec 15, 2000 |title= LEGO Mindstorms: The Structure of an Engineering (R)evolution|type=conference paper |chapter= |publisher= |docket=6.399J Structure of Engineering Revolutions |oclc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221436867_LEGO_Mindstorms |access-date=Mar 25, 2019}}</ref>{{rp|14}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=David |date=2013 |title= Brick by Brick: How Lego rewrote the rules of innovation and conquered the global toy industry |url=http://www.RobertsonInnovation.com/books/Brick-by-Brick |location=United States |publisher=Crown Publishing |pages=184\u2013185 |isbn=9780307951618 |author-link= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/10/mindstorms|title=Lego Mindstorms: A History of Educational Robots|last=|first=|date=2015-04-10|website=Hack Education|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref> Born out of this collaboration (and the work of Papert and collaborator Mitchel Resnik's Epistemology and Learning group) was the idea to have children use the [[Logo (programming language)|LOGO]] programming language to command Lego brick robots of their own design connected to a computer.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Resnick |first1=Mitchel |last2=Ocko |first2=Stephen |date=n.d. |title=LEGO/Logo: Learning Through and About Design\n |type=Research Paper |chapter= |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |docket= |oclc= |url=https://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ll.html |access-date=Mar 25, 2019}}</ref> In 1988 the Media Lab created a Lego Brick compatible computer that could be used to control a robot without connection to a desktop computer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm/papers/magical-machines.pdf|title=To Mindstorms and Beyond: Evolution of a Construction Kit for Magical Machines|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=MIT Media Laboratory|format=PDF|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref> There was interest within The Lego Group to commercialize this Brick compatible computer as soon as personal computers became widespread, and in 1996 The Lego Group began developing this computer into what would eventually be known as the Robotics Invention System.<ref name=Beland/>{{rp|25}}\n\nIn 1996, the newly formed Home Learning division of Lego Education began developing Media Lab's \u201cGrey Brick\u201d into an official product.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lan.lego.com/news/overview/lego-mindstorms-reflections-%E2%80%93-what-happened-before-the-announcement-in-january-1998-r173/ |title= LEGO Mindstorms reflections \u2013 What happened before the announcement in January 1998|last=Askildsen |first=Tormod |date=Dec 4, 2018 |website=lan.Lego.com |publisher= The LEGO Group |access-date=Mar 26, 2019 |quote=In 1995, (...)

But, a few critical incidents delayed us.}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-Mindstorm==\nBefore Mindstorms, Lego had previously done some experimentation with robotic sets. One of the main foundations of these sets was the Lego Technic system and its 4.5&nbsp;V and later 9&nbsp;V system for electrical peripherals that had been evolving through the 1980s.\n\n===Computer Interfaces===\nOne of the first examples of programmable Lego was the LEGO Interface-A adapter, used for the educational-only Lego Dacta TC-Logo system. These sets from the mid-late 1980s provided a dedicated hardware interface to control the Lego Technic 4.5&nbsp;V system using a computer, and for the first time it introduced electric Lego sensors. This interface was controlled from an IBM-PC or Apple-IIe by the use of a special version of [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]], a simple programming language designed for use in children's education. In the mid-1990s, the Lego Dacta Control Lab released as a follow-up for Lego 9&nbsp;V system, using a standard serial port rather than a custom hardware interface card. This move also introduced new 9&nbsp;V sensors, which would later become a key component for the first-generation Mindstorms sets. It is worth noting that the Control Lab had dedicated ports for active and passive sensors, while later products like first generation Mindstorms provided support for both kinds on the same ports.\n\n===Technic Control Center===\nThe control center (1990) was the first programmable standalone Lego product, in the sense of being able to store sequence-based programs and run them. It featured three output ports and manual control, and it was only capable of storing linear sequences of manual input plus timing information. It could store up to two programs at once.\n\nThe manual controls could be used to independently control the three motors. To record a program; the controller had to be put in programming mode, and then any manual control would be recorded to the program. Pauses could also be included in a program. When the recording was done, the controller could successfully recall and execute any manual action done during the recording. The executing program could be set to loop infinitely.\n\n===Cybermaster===\n[[Image:cybermaster.jpg|thumb|Lego Cybermaster]]\nCybermaster was mainly sold in Europe and Australia/New Zealand and was available for a short time in the United States via the Lego Club magazines.\nIt was aimed at an older audience as an early attempt of merging with robotics and Lego.\n\nThe brick shares many, especially software, features with the RCX but differs in appearance and technical specifications: one output (plus two built-in) and four sensors.\n\n* It uses [[radio frequency|RF]] (27&nbsp;MHz R/C band) instead of IR for communication.\n* It has two built-in motors with integrated [[tachometer]]s and [[speedometer]]s.\n* It is limited to passive sensors (a simple [[Analog-to-digital converter|A/D]] with internal pull-up resistors).\n* The sensors shipped with it are color-coded and have internal resistors in their open state (allowing the Pbrick to sense which sensor is attached to which port).\n* It has a fixed firmware (so it cannot be upgraded or replaced).\n* It has limited RAM for programs (395 bytes){{clarify|date=May 2015}} and only one program slot.\n\nDespite its obvious limitations it has a number of advantages over its 'big brother', the RCX.\n\n* The RF link has greater range and is omnidirectional.\n* The built-in tachometer and speedometer sensors on the internal motors provides the same function as the external rotation sensor to the RCX, but without using up sensor ports.\n\nThis makes it very useful for various mobile platforms and performing advanced motion/positioning tasks.\n\nIt talks the same protocol as the RCX but cannot communicate directly to it (due to IR vs RF) but with a repeater (a computer with 2 serial ports and a simple program) they can communicate indirectly.\n\n===Codepilot===\nSold as part of the Barcode Truck kit.\nThis unit was the first programmable brick (or Pbrick).\nIt features a single motor, a single touch sensor and a light sensor.\nIt is programmed by setting it to 'learn' and using the light sensor to feed barcoded commands. The command set is very limited.\nSince barcode is just a series of variances in light, this form of command entry was dubbed VLL (Visual Light Link) and has been used in several later Lego models.\n\n==Robotics Discovery Set and Droid/Darkside Developer Kit==\nThe Robotics Discovery Set was a more affordable and simpler package than the Robotics Invention Set. Instead of being based on the RCX, it had its own programmable brick called the Scout. An even simpler version of the Scout would be featured in two Star-Wars themed Mindstorms sets as well.\n\n===Scout===\nLego also released a blue computer called the ''Scout'', which has 2 sensor ports, 2 motor ports (plus one extra if linked with a Micro Scout using a [[fiber optic cable]]), and a built in light sensor, but no PC interface. It comes with the Robotics Discovery Set. The Scout can be programmed from a collection of built-in program combinations. In order to program the Scout, a user must enable \"power mode\" on it. The Scout can store one program.\n\nThe Scout is based on a [[Toshiba]] microcontroller with 32&nbsp;KB of ROM and 1&nbsp;KB of RAM, where about 400 bytes are available for user-programs. Due to the extremely limited amount of RAM, many predefined subroutines were provided in ROM. The Scout only supports passive external sensors, which means that only touch, temperature and other unpowered sensors can be used. The [[analog-to-digital converter]]s used in the Scout only have a resolution of 8 bits in contrast to the 10-bit converters of the RCX.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210104326/http://mindstorms.lego.com/products/rds/hackers.asp|title=ROBOTICS DISCOVERY SET - INFO FOR HACKERS|date=10 February 2001|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThere was a plan for Lego to create a booster set that allows you to program the Scout from a computer with a software such as RCX code. However, due to the complexity of this project, it was abandoned.\n\nThe RCX can control the Scout brick using the \"Send IR Message\" program block. The RCX does all of the controlling, and therefore can be programmed with the PC, while the Scout accepts commands. The Scout brick must have all of its options set to \"off\".\n\n===Micro Scout===\nThe Micro Scout was added as an entry level to Lego robotics. It is a very limited Pbrick with a single built-in light sensor and a single built-in motor. It has seven built-in programs and can be controlled by a Scout, Spybotics or RCX unit using VLL. Like the Scout, the Micro Scout is also based on a microcontroller from [[Toshiba]].\n\nThe unit was sold as part of the Droid Developer Kit (featuring [[R2-D2]]) and later the Darkside Developer Kit (featuring an [[AT-AT|AT-AT Imperial Walker]]).\n\n==Robotics Invention System==\nThe main core of the first generation of Mindstorms sets were the Robotics Invention System sets. These were based around the RCX (Robotic Command eXplorers) brick, and the 9&nbsp;V LEGO Technic peripherals available at the time. It also includes three touch-sensors and an optical sensor, using the technology from the earlier 9&nbsp;V sensors from the pre-Mindstorms sets.\n\n===RCX===\n[[Image:LegoMindstormsRCX.jpg|thumb|First-generation RCX programmable brick]] \nThe RCX is based on the Single-bit [[Renesas Technology|Renesas]] [[Hitachi H8|H8/300]] [[microcontroller]], including 32&nbsp;KB of ROM for low-level IO functions, along with 32&nbsp;KB of RAM to store high-level firmware and user programs. The RCX is programmed by [[upload]]ing a program using a dedicated [[infrared]] interface. After the user uploads a program, the RCX can run it on its own without needing access to a computer. Programs may take use of three sensor input ports and three 9&nbsp;V output ports, in addition to the IR interface, enabling several RCX bricks to communicate. A built-in [[LCD]] can display the battery level, the status of the input/output ports, which program is selected or running, and other information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mralligator.com/rcx/|title=RCX Internals|author=Kekoa Proudfoot|date=1999|website=mralligator.com|accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nVersion 1.0 RCX bricks feature a power adapter jack rather than solely batteries. In version 2.0 (as well as later 1.0s included in the RIS 1.5), the power adapter jack was removed. Power-adapter equipped RCX bricks were popular for stationary robotics projects (such as robot arms) or for controlling [[Lego train|Lego model trains]]. In the latter context, the RCX might be programmed with [[Digital Command Control]] (DCC) software to operate multiple wired trains.\n\nThe IR interface on the RCX is able to communicate with [[Lego Spybotics|Spybots]], [[#Scout|Scout Bricks]], [[Lego Trains]], and the NXT (using a third-party infrared link sensor). The RCX 1.0 IR receiver [[carrier frequency]] is 38.5&nbsp;kHz, while the RCX 2.0 IR carrier frequency is 76&nbsp;kHz. Both versions can transmit on either frequency. The RCX communicates with a computer using a [[Serial port|Serial]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] IR tower. As the RCX is discontinued, support for the interface is limited on more recent operating systems than Windows XP.\n\nAll versions of the RCX have a unique number printed on it, which could be registered on the now-defunct Lego Mindstorms RCX website. This was necessary to obtain technical support. The first RCX produced is marked \"000001\" and was on display at the Mindstorms 10th Anniversary event.<ref name=\"First_RCX\">{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brickjournal/3079324996/in/set-72157610670686416/|title=DSC03489.jpg|author=|date=|website=flickr.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion Packs===\nSix expansion-packs were made for the Robotics Invention System. Most expansion sets contains more parts and instructions, while other expansion sets were more ambitious. These sets include:\n\n* RoboSports\n* Extreme Creatures\n* Ultimate Accessory Set\n* Vision Command\n* Exploration Mars\n* Ultimate Builders Set\n\nNotable sets include the Ultimate Accessory Set, containing more sensors and an IR remote-control for sending commands to the RCX. Another notable set, Vision Command, came with a Lego Camera and dedicated software.

These packages allow us to teach engineering with both Lego bricks and LabVIEW to students from 5 to 50 years old. The versatility of the hardware and software allow a wide variety of possibilities in what students can build and program. From robots and remote sensing devices to kinetic sculptures. As students design and build their projects, they are motivated to learn the math and science they need to optimise their project. Both college students and kindergartners respond to this motivator. In the paper, we explain how we designed software to complement these projects in allowing automation and animation. The software uses LabVIEW, extending its capabilities to kindergartners and Lego bricks. Finally, we will show how we have used LabVIEW and Lego data acquisition to teach elementary school science, freshman engineering, instrumentation and experimentation, and how college seniors and graduate students have used both the hardware and software to solve various data acquisition problems}}</ref> using the [[National Instruments]] [[LabVIEW]] as an engine. In addition, the shipped software can be replaced with third party firmware and/or programming languages, including some of the most popular ones used by professionals in the embedded systems industry, like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]. One of the differences between the educational series, known as the \"Challenge Set\", and the consumer series, known as the \"Inventor Set\", is that it includes another touch sensor and several more gearing options. However, there are several other standouts between the two versions that one may not recognize unless doing a side by side analysis of what each offers. The version sold through LEGO Education is designed for a deeper level of learning or teaching that often happens in a classroom or school setting. The LEGO Education version comes with support called the Robot Educator. This includes 48 tutorials to walk the learner through the basics of coding to more sophisticated and complex concepts such as data logging. This resource to support the learner and/or educator are not included in the retail version of Mindstorms. It's always a good idea to reach out to a LEGO Education consultant to inquire of other differences as there are several more. The retail version was designed for more of a home/toy use vs the educator model was designed to support deeper learning with extra resources and pieces to do so. This is why the LEGO Education Mindstorms contains more sensors and parts than the retail version.\n\n==Community==\nThere is a strong community of professionals and hobbyists of all ages involved in the sharing of designs, programming techniques, creating third-party software and [[Dexter Industries|hardware]], and contributing of other ideas associated with Lego Mindstorms.

Each version of the system includes an intelligent ''brick'' computer that controls the system, a set of modular sensors and motors, and [[Lego]] parts from the [[Lego Technic|Technic]] line to create the mechanical systems.\n\nSince creation, there have been four generations of the Mindstorms platform: the original Robotics Invention System, NXT, NXT 2.0, and EV3. With each platform release, the motor and sensor capabilities expanded. The latest system, [[Lego Mindstorms EV3]], was released on September 1, 2013. Some robot competitions use this set, such as the [[FIRST Lego League]] and the [[World Robot Olympiad]].\n\n==History==\nThe original Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System was born out of a collaboration between The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] and the Lego group. In 1985, [[Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen]], then Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of The Lego Group, heard of the work of MIT's Seymour Papert and was struck by how similar his goals of learning through building were to those of The Lego Group's newly formed educational division. The Lego Group began a partnership with Papert's Media Lab, funding their research and sharing ideas.<ref name=Beland>{{cite thesis |last=Beland |first=Cristopher |date=Dec 15, 2000 |title= LEGO Mindstorms: The Structure of an Engineering (R)evolution|type=conference paper |chapter= |publisher= |docket=6.399J Structure of Engineering Revolutions |oclc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221436867_LEGO_Mindstorms |access-date=Mar 25, 2019}}</ref>{{rp|14}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=David |date=2013 |title= Brick by Brick: How Lego rewrote the rules of innovation and conquered the global toy industry |url=http://www.RobertsonInnovation.com/books/Brick-by-Brick |location=United States |publisher=Crown Publishing |pages=184\u2013185 |isbn=9780307951618 |author-link= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/10/mindstorms|title=Lego Mindstorms: A History of Educational Robots|last=|first=|date=2015-04-10|website=Hack Education|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref> Born out of this collaboration (and the work of Papert and collaborator Mitchel Resnik's Epistemology and Learning group) was the idea to have children use the [[Logo (programming language)|LOGO]] programming language to command Lego brick robots of their own design connected to a computer.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Resnick |first1=Mitchel |last2=Ocko |first2=Stephen |date=n.d. |title=LEGO/Logo: Learning Through and About Design\n |type=Research Paper |chapter= |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |docket= |oclc= |url=https://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ll.html |access-date=Mar 25, 2019}}</ref> In 1988 the Media Lab created a Lego Brick compatible computer that could be used to control a robot without connection to a desktop computer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm/papers/magical-machines.pdf|title=To Mindstorms and Beyond: Evolution of a Construction Kit for Magical Machines|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=MIT Media Laboratory|format=PDF|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref> There was interest within The Lego Group to commercialize this Brick compatible computer as soon as personal computers became widespread, and in 1996 The Lego Group began developing this computer into what would eventually be known as the Robotics Invention System.<ref name=Beland/>{{rp|25}}\n\nIn 1996, the newly formed Home Learning division of Lego Education began developing Media Lab's \u201cGrey Brick\u201d into an official product.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lan.lego.com/news/overview/lego-mindstorms-reflections-%E2%80%93-what-happened-before-the-announcement-in-january-1998-r173/ |title= LEGO Mindstorms reflections \u2013 What happened before the announcement in January 1998|last=Askildsen |first=Tormod |date=Dec 4, 2018 |website=lan.Lego.com |publisher= The LEGO Group |access-date=Mar 26, 2019 |quote=In 1995, (...)

But, a few critical incidents delayed us.}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-Mindstorm==\nBefore Mindstorms, Lego had previously done some experimentation with robotic sets. One of the main foundations of these sets was the Lego Technic system and its 4.5&nbsp;V and later 9&nbsp;V system for electrical peripherals that had been evolving through the 1980s.\n\n===Computer Interfaces===\nOne of the first examples of programmable Lego was the LEGO Interface-A adapter, used for the educational-only Lego Dacta TC-Logo system. These sets from the mid-late 1980s provided a dedicated hardware interface to control the Lego Technic 4.5&nbsp;V system using a computer, and for the first time it introduced electric Lego sensors. This interface was controlled from an IBM-PC or Apple-IIe by the use of a special version of [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]], a simple programming language designed for use in children's education. In the mid-1990s, the Lego Dacta Control Lab released as a follow-up for Lego 9&nbsp;V system, using a standard serial port rather than a custom hardware interface card. This move also introduced new 9&nbsp;V sensors, which would later become a key component for the first-generation Mindstorms sets. It is worth noting that the Control Lab had dedicated ports for active and passive sensors, while later products like first generation Mindstorms provided support for both kinds on the same ports.\n\n===Technic Control Center===\nThe control center (1990) was the first programmable standalone Lego product, in the sense of being able to store sequence-based programs and run them. It featured three output ports and manual control, and it was only capable of storing linear sequences of manual input plus timing information. It could store up to two programs at once.\n\nThe manual controls could be used to independently control the three motors. To record a program; the controller had to be put in programming mode, and then any manual control would be recorded to the program. Pauses could also be included in a program. When the recording was done, the controller could successfully recall and execute any manual action done during the recording. The executing program could be set to loop infinitely.\n\n===Cybermaster===\n[[Image:cybermaster.jpg|thumb|Lego Cybermaster]]\nCybermaster was mainly sold in Europe and Australia/New Zealand and was available for a short time in the United States via the Lego Club magazines.\nIt was aimed at an older audience as an early attempt of merging with robotics and Lego.\n\nThe brick shares many, especially software, features with the RCX but differs in appearance and technical specifications: one output (plus two built-in) and four sensors.\n\n* It uses [[radio frequency|RF]] (27&nbsp;MHz R/C band) instead of IR for communication.\n* It has two built-in motors with integrated [[tachometer]]s and [[speedometer]]s.\n* It is limited to passive sensors (a simple [[Analog-to-digital converter|A/D]] with internal pull-up resistors).\n* The sensors shipped with it are color-coded and have internal resistors in their open state (allowing the Pbrick to sense which sensor is attached to which port).\n* It has a fixed firmware (so it cannot be upgraded or replaced).\n* It has limited RAM for programs (395 bytes){{clarify|date=May 2015}} and only one program slot.\n\nDespite its obvious limitations it has a number of advantages over its 'big brother', the RCX.\n\n* The RF link has greater range and is omnidirectional.\n* The built-in tachometer and speedometer sensors on the internal motors provides the same function as the external rotation sensor to the RCX, but without using up sensor ports.\n\nThis makes it very useful for various mobile platforms and performing advanced motion/positioning tasks.\n\nIt talks the same protocol as the RCX but cannot communicate directly to it (due to IR vs RF) but with a repeater (a computer with 2 serial ports and a simple program) they can communicate indirectly.\n\n===Codepilot===\nSold as part of the Barcode Truck kit.\nThis unit was the first programmable brick (or Pbrick).\nIt features a single motor, a single touch sensor and a light sensor.\nIt is programmed by setting it to 'learn' and using the light sensor to feed barcoded commands. The command set is very limited.\nSince barcode is just a series of variances in light, this form of command entry was dubbed VLL (Visual Light Link) and has been used in several later Lego models.\n\n==Robotics Discovery Set and Droid/Darkside Developer Kit==\nThe Robotics Discovery Set was a more affordable and simpler package than the Robotics Invention Set. Instead of being based on the RCX, it had its own programmable brick called the Scout. An even simpler version of the Scout would be featured in two Star-Wars themed Mindstorms sets as well.\n\n===Scout===\nLego also released a blue computer called the ''Scout'', which has 2 sensor ports, 2 motor ports (plus one extra if linked with a Micro Scout using a [[fiber optic cable]]), and a built in light sensor, but no PC interface. It comes with the Robotics Discovery Set. The Scout can be programmed from a collection of built-in program combinations. In order to program the Scout, a user must enable \"power mode\" on it. The Scout can store one program.\n\nThe Scout is based on a [[Toshiba]] microcontroller with 32&nbsp;KB of ROM and 1&nbsp;KB of RAM, where about 400 bytes are available for user-programs. Due to the extremely limited amount of RAM, many predefined subroutines were provided in ROM. The Scout only supports passive external sensors, which means that only touch, temperature and other unpowered sensors can be used. The [[analog-to-digital converter]]s used in the Scout only have a resolution of 8 bits in contrast to the 10-bit converters of the RCX.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210104326/http://mindstorms.lego.com/products/rds/hackers.asp|title=ROBOTICS DISCOVERY SET - INFO FOR HACKERS|date=10 February 2001|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThere was a plan for Lego to create a booster set that allows you to program the Scout from a computer with a software such as RCX code. However, due to the complexity of this project, it was abandoned.\n\nThe RCX can control the Scout brick using the \"Send IR Message\" program block. The RCX does all of the controlling, and therefore can be programmed with the PC, while the Scout accepts commands. The Scout brick must have all of its options set to \"off\".\n\n===Micro Scout===\nThe Micro Scout was added as an entry level to Lego robotics. It is a very limited Pbrick with a single built-in light sensor and a single built-in motor. It has seven built-in programs and can be controlled by a Scout, Spybotics or RCX unit using VLL. Like the Scout, the Micro Scout is also based on a microcontroller from [[Toshiba]].\n\nThe unit was sold as part of the Droid Developer Kit (featuring [[R2-D2]]) and later the Darkside Developer Kit (featuring an [[AT-AT|AT-AT Imperial Walker]]).\n\n==Robotics Invention System==\nThe main core of the first generation of Mindstorms sets were the Robotics Invention System sets. These were based around the RCX (Robotic Command eXplorers) brick, and the 9&nbsp;V LEGO Technic peripherals available at the time. It also includes three touch-sensors and an optical sensor, using the technology from the earlier 9&nbsp;V sensors from the pre-Mindstorms sets.\n\n===RCX===\n[[Image:LegoMindstormsRCX.jpg|thumb|First-generation RCX programmable brick]] \nThe RCX is based on the Single-bit [[Renesas Technology|Renesas]] [[Hitachi H8|H8/300]] [[microcontroller]], including 32&nbsp;KB of ROM for low-level IO functions, along with 32&nbsp;KB of RAM to store high-level firmware and user programs. The RCX is programmed by [[upload]]ing a program using a dedicated [[infrared]] interface. After the user uploads a program, the RCX can run it on its own without needing access to a computer. Programs may take use of three sensor input ports and three 9&nbsp;V output ports, in addition to the IR interface, enabling several RCX bricks to communicate. A built-in [[LCD]] can display the battery level, the status of the input/output ports, which program is selected or running, and other information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mralligator.com/rcx/|title=RCX Internals|author=Kekoa Proudfoot|date=1999|website=mralligator.com|accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nVersion 1.0 RCX bricks feature a power adapter jack rather than solely batteries. In version 2.0 (as well as later 1.0s included in the RIS 1.5), the power adapter jack was removed. Power-adapter equipped RCX bricks were popular for stationary robotics projects (such as robot arms) or for controlling [[Lego train|Lego model trains]]. In the latter context, the RCX might be programmed with [[Digital Command Control]] (DCC) software to operate multiple wired trains.\n\nThe IR interface on the RCX is able to communicate with [[Lego Spybotics|Spybots]], [[#Scout|Scout Bricks]], [[Lego Trains]], and the NXT (using a third-party infrared link sensor). The RCX 1.0 IR receiver [[carrier frequency]] is 38.5&nbsp;kHz, while the RCX 2.0 IR carrier frequency is 76&nbsp;kHz. Both versions can transmit on either frequency. The RCX communicates with a computer using a [[Serial port|Serial]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] IR tower. As the RCX is discontinued, support for the interface is limited on more recent operating systems than Windows XP.\n\nAll versions of the RCX have a unique number printed on it, which could be registered on the now-defunct Lego Mindstorms RCX website. This was necessary to obtain technical support. The first RCX produced is marked \"000001\" and was on display at the Mindstorms 10th Anniversary event.<ref name=\"First_RCX\">{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/brickjournal/3079324996/in/set-72157610670686416/|title=DSC03489.jpg|author=|date=|website=flickr.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion Packs===\nSix expansion-packs were made for the Robotics Invention System. Most expansion sets contains more parts and instructions, while other expansion sets were more ambitious. These sets include:\n\n* RoboSports\n* Extreme Creatures\n* Ultimate Accessory Set\n* Vision Commander\n* Exploration Mars\n* Ultimate Builders Set\n\nNotable sets include the Ultimate Accessory Set, containing more sensors and an IR remote-control for sending commands to the RCX. Another notable set, Vision Commander, came with a Lego Camera and dedicated software. This software was capable of detecting different lightings, motion, and colors.\n\n==Lego Mindstorms NXT==\n{{Main|Lego Mindstorms NXT}}\n\nLego Mindstorms NXT was a programmable [[robotics]] kit released by [[Lego]] in July 2006, replacing the first-generation LEGO Mindstorms kit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=pressdetail&contentid=17278&countrycode=2057&yearcode=&archive=false|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708131613/http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=pressdetail&contentid=17278&countrycode=2057&yearcode=&archive=false|archivedate=2009-07-08 |title=What\u2019s NXT?

The Intelligent Brick is the \"brain\" of a Mindstorms machine. It lets the robot autonomously perform different operations. The kit also includes NXT-G, a graphical programming environment that enables the creation and downloading of programs to the NXT. The software also has instructions for 4 robots; Alpha-Rex (a humanoid), Tri-Bot (a car), Robo-Arm T-56 (a robotic arm), and Spike (a scorpion)\n\n===Lego Mindstorms NXT Educational Version===\nThis is the educational version of the NXT set from Lego Education, which is made for school use. Software was sold separately (but can be [https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/retiredproducts/nxt/software downloaded for free] now), and the Education Resource Set for the best use. It includes a light sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a sound sensor, three lamps and a pair of touch sensors. The first set consists of about 400 pieces, and the extra set consists of about 600 pieces. The Education Version is most suited for those who have older versions of Mindstorms sets around, mostly thanks to its three converter cables.\n\n==Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0==\n{{Main|Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0}}\nThe [[Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0]] was launched on 5 August 2009. It contains 619 pieces (includes sensors and motors), two Touch Sensors, an [[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] Sensor, and introduced a new Color Sensor.

These packages allow us to teach engineering with both Lego bricks and LabVIEW to students from 5 to 50 years old. The versatility of the hardware and software allow a wide variety of possibilities in what students can build and program. From robots and remote sensing devices to kinetic sculptures. As students design and build their projects, they are motivated to learn the math and science they need to optimise their project. Both college students and kindergartners respond to this motivator. In the paper, we explain how we designed software to complement these projects in allowing automation and animation. The software uses LabVIEW, extending its capabilities to kindergartners and Lego bricks. Finally, we will show how we have used LabVIEW and Lego data acquisition to teach elementary school science, freshman engineering, instrumentation and experimentation, and how college seniors and graduate students have used both the hardware and software to solve various data acquisition problems}}</ref> using the [[National Instruments]] [[LabVIEW]] as an engine. In addition, the shipped software can be replaced with third party firmware and/or programming languages, including some of the most popular ones used by professionals in the embedded systems industry, like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]. One of the differences between the educational series, known as the \"Challenge Set\", and the consumer series, known as the \"Inventor Set\", is that it includes another touch sensor and several more gearing options. However, there are several other standouts between the two versions that one may not recognize unless doing a side by side analysis of what each offers. The version sold through LEGO Education is designed for a deeper level of learning or teaching that often happens in a classroom or school setting. The LEGO Education version comes with support called the Robot Educator. This includes 48 tutorials to walk the learner through the basics of coding to more sophisticated and complex concepts such as data logging. This resource to support the learner and/or educator are not included in the retail version of Mindstorms. It's always a good idea to reach out to a LEGO Education consultant to inquire of other differences as there are several more. The retail version was designed for more of a home/toy use vs the educator model was designed to support deeper learning with extra resources and pieces to do so. This is why the LEGO Education Mindstorms contains more sensors and parts than the retail version.\n\n==Community==\nThere is a strong community of professionals and hobbyists of all ages involved in the sharing of designs, programming techniques, creating third-party software and [[Dexter Industries|hardware]], and contributing of other ideas associated with Lego Mindstorms.

{"title_page": "Genealogical DNA test", "text_new": "{{short description|DNA-based test}}\n{{For|a non-technical introduction to genetics in general|Introduction to genetics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{merge from|Genetic genealogy|date=October 2019}}\n{{genetic genealogy}}\n\nA '''genealogical DNA test''' is a [[DNA]]-based test which looks at specific locations of a person's [[genome]], in order to find or verify ancestral [[genealogical]] relationships or (with lower reliability) to estimate the [[ethnicity|ethnic]] mixture of an individual. Since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual will vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\n\nThree principal types of genealogical DNA tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and useful for different types of genealogical research: [[Genealogical DNA test#Autosomal DNA (atDNA) testing|autosomal]], [[Genealogical DNA test#Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing|mitochondrial]] (mtDNA), and [[Genealogical DNA test#Y chromosome (Y-DNA) testing|Y-DNA]].\n \nAutosomal tests may result in a large amount of DNA matches (other test persons that the individual may be related to), along mixed male and female lines, each match with an estimated distance in the family tree. However, due to the random nature of which and how much DNA is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise conclusions can only be made for close relations. Traditional [[genealogy|genealogical research]], and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. Autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\n\nMtDNA and Y-DNA tests are much more objective. However, they give considerably fewer DNA matches, if any, since they are limited to relationships along a strict [[Matrilineality|female line]] and a strict [[Patrilineality|male line]] respectively. MtDNA and Y-DNA tests are utilized to identify [[archeological culture]]s and migration paths of a person's ancestors along a strict mother's line or a strict father's line. Based on MtDNA and Y-DNA, a person's [[haplogroup]](s) can be identified. Only men can take Y-DNA tests, since women lack a Y chromosome.\n\n==DNA testing for consumers==\nThe first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing was the now defunct [[GeneTree]]. However, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based [[Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation]] (SMGF) which originated in 1999.<ref name=Wayne2006>{{cite journal|url=http://www.med.wayne.edu/news_media/scribe/PDF/Alum-06-SpringScribe%5B1%5D.pdf|title=CMMG alum launches multi-million dollar genetic testing company - Alum notes|publisher=Wayne State University, School of Medicine's alumni journal|volume=17|date=Spring 2006|page=1|accessdate=24 Jan 2013|issue=2|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053626/http://www2.med.wayne.edu/news_media/scribe/PDF/Alum-06-SpringScribe%5b1%5d.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nWhile in operation, SMGF provided free Y-Chromosome and mitochondrial DNA tests to thousands.<ref name=Blaine2006>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2007/11/06/how-big-is-the-genetic-genealogy-market/|title=How Big Is the Genetic Genealogy Market?|publisher=The Genetic Genealogist|accessdate=19 Feb 2009|date=2007-11-06}}</ref>\nLater, GeneTree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the Sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the [[Ancestry.com]] buyout of SMGF in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.familytreemagazine.com/articles/genealogy-websites/ancestry/ancestry-com-acquisition-means-changes-at-genetree-and-smgf-org/|title=Ancestry.com Acquisition Means Changes at GeneTree and SMGF.org|last=Dobush|first=Grace|date=2012-07-12|website=Family Tree|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref><ref name=SMGF2012>{{cite press release|url=http://corporate.ancestry.com/press/press-releases/2012/05/ancestry.com-dna-launches/|accessdate=1 July 2013|title=Ancestry.com Launches new AncestryDNA Service: The Next Generation of DNA Science Poised to Enrich Family History Research|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526104607/http://corporate.ancestry.com/press/press-releases/2012/05/ancestry.com-dna-launches/|archivedate=26 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[Family Tree DNA]], founded by [[Bennett Greenspan]] and Max Blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research.

This DNA sample can be obtained by a cheek-scraping (also known as a [[buccal swab]]), spit-cups, [[mouthwash]], and [[chewing gum]].  Typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as  [[23andMe]], [[AncestryDNA]], [[Family Tree DNA]], or [[MyHeritage]]. After following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample, it is returned to the supplier for analysis.\n\n==Types of tests==\nThere are three major types of genealogical DNA tests: [[Autosome|Autosomal]] and X-DNA, Y-DNA and mtDNA.\n* '''Autosomal''' tests look at chromosomes 1\u201322 and X. The autosomes (chromosomes 1\u201322) are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors. The X-chromosome follows a special inheritance pattern. Ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing.\n* '''Y-DNA''' looks at the Y-chromosome, which is inherited father to son, and so can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line.\n* '''mtDNA''' looks at the mitochondria, which is inherited from mother to child and so can be used to explore one's direct maternal line.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bettinger|2016|p=8}}</ref>\n\nY-DNA and mtDNA cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one's [[haplogroup]], which is unevenly distributed geographically.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/debunking/understanding-testing|title=Understanding genetic ancestry testing|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Molecular and Cultural Evolution Lab|publisher=University College London|access-date=2016-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407010200/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/debunking/understanding-testing|archive-date=7 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Direct-to-consumer DNA test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"African haplogroup\" or a \"Viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\"Claims of connections, therefore, between specific uniparental lineages and historical figures or historical migrations of peoples are merely speculative.\" {{Cite journal|last2=Novembre|first2=John|last3=Fullerton|first3=Stephanie M.|last4=Goldstein|first4=David B.|last5=Long|first5=Jeffrey C.|last6=Bamshad|first6=Michael J.|last7=Clark|first7=Andrew G.|date=2010-05-14|title=Inferring Genetic Ancestry: Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=86|issue=5|pages=661\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.03.011|pmid=20466090|pmc=2869013|issn=0002-9297|last1=Royal|first1=Charmaine D.}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Autosomal DNA (atDNA) testing=== <!-- a redirect target for links from other articles -->\n\n====Testing====\nAutosomal DNA is contained in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person's sex.<ref name=\":0\" /> Autosomal DNA recombines each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bettinger|2016|p=70}}</ref> These are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grand parents.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bettinger|2016|p=68}}</ref> Therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the [[genome]] at a particular location \u2013 known as [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s or SNPs) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half each generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of their markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of their markers from each great grandparent, etc. Inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA|title=Autosomal DNA \u2013 ISOGG Wiki|website=isogg.org|access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref> Generally, a genealogical DNA test might test about 700,000 SNPs (specific points in the genome).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smarterhobby.com/genealogy/best-dna-test/|title=Best Ancestry DNA Test 2018 - Which Testing Kit is Best & How to Choose|date=10 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shared-cM-Relationship-Tree.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shared DNA for different relatives]]\n\n====Reporting process====\nThe preparation of a report on the DNA in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\n* identification of the DNA base pair at specific SNP locations\n* comparison with previously stored results\n* interpretation of matches\n\n=====Base pair identification=====\nAll major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dna-explained.com/2017/09/05/concepts-imputation/|title=Concepts \u2013 Imputation|date=5 September 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The chip determines which SNP locations are tested. Different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. In addition, updated versions of the Illumina chip may test different sets of SNP locations. The list of SNP locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". The raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. For additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to GEDmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\n\n====Identification of Matches====\nThe major component of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive SNPs in common with a previously tested individual in the company's database, it can be inferred  that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dna-explained.com/2016/03/|title=March - 2016 - DNAeXplained \u2013 Genetic Genealogy|website=dna-explained.com}}</ref> If the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. Unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\n\nThe unit for segments of DNA is the [[centimorgan]] (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. The shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2017/01/06/the-danger-of-distant-matches/|title=The Danger of Distant Matches - The Genetic Genealogist|date=6 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref> An important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared DNA (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\n\n====Interpretation of Autosomal matches====\nMost companies will show the customers how many cMs they share, and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated, however due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. Some more distant cousins will not match at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isogg.org/wiki/Cousin_statistics|title=Cousin statistics - ISOGG Wiki|website=isogg.org}}</ref> Although information about specific SNPs can be used for some purposes (e.g. suggesting likely eye colour), the key information is the percentage of DNA shared by 2 individuals. This can indicate the closeness of the relationship. However, it does not show the roles of the 2 individuals - e.g. 50% shared suggests a parent - child relationship, but does not identify which individual is the parent.\n\nVarious advanced techniques and analysis can be done on this data. This includes features such as In-common/Shared Matches,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.familytreemagazine.com/premium/ancestry-dna-shared-matches-tutorial/|title=How to Use AncestryDNA Shared Matches - Family Tree|last=Combs-Bennett|first=Shannon|date=2015-12-03|work=Family Tree|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref> Chromosome Browsers<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.researchjournal.yourislandroutes.com/2018/03/myheritage-dna-ups-its-game-with-updated-chromosome-browser/|title=MyHeritage DNA Ups Its Game with Updated Chromosome Browser|last=Lassalle|first=Melody|date=2018-03-15|website=Genealogy Research Journal|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref> and Triangulation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.familytreemagazine.com/premium/triple-play-dna-matches-triangulation/|title=Triple Play: Triangulating Your DNA Matches - Family Tree|last=Southard|first=Diahan|date=2017-06-19|work=Family Tree|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref> This analysis is often required if DNA evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship.\n\n===X-chromosome DNA testing===\nThe X-chromosome SNP results are often included in Autosomal DNA tests.

A certain section of DNA is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. Typical tests test between 12 and 111 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match.

It can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups.\n\n[[File:Haplogroups europe.png|thumb|The most common Y-DNA-haplogroup in different regions in Europe]]\nAll human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], who lived probably between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago.<ref name=\"bottleneck\">{{cite journal | last1 = Karmin |display-authors=etal | year = 2015 | title = A recent bottleneck of Y chromosome diversity coincides with a global change in culture |journal=[[Genome Research]] | volume =  25| issue = 4| pages =  459\u201366| doi = 10.1101/gr.186684.114 | pmid=25770088 | pmc=4381518}} \"we date the Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in Africa at 254 (95% CI 192\u2013307) kya and detect a cluster of major non-African founder haplogroups in a narrow time interval at 47\u201352 kya, consistent with a rapid initial colonization model of Eurasia and Oceania after the out-of-Africa bottleneck.

Most significant of these new discoveries was in 2013 when the [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)#A00-AF6|haplogroup A00]] was discovered, which required theories about Y-chromosomal Adam to be significantly revised. The haplogroup was discovered when an African-American man tested STRs at FamilyTreeDNA and his results were found to be unusual. SNP testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" Y-chromosomal Adam and so a much older man became Y-Chromosomal Adam.\n\n===Using DNA test results===\n{{Main|Genetic genealogy}}\n\n====Ethnicity estimates====\nMany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally the world is specified into about 20\u201325 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each [[Autosome|Autosomal DNA]] marker tested to many population groups.<ref name=\":0\" /> The reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. Testing companies such as [[Ancestry.com]] will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-ancestry-update-to-dna-results-confuses-upsets-customers-20190429-cce6vv7ilvcb5dvquuxkv3iia4-story.html|title=Ancestry.com update changes ethnicity of customers|last=Alsup|first=Blake|date=29 April 2019|website=NY Daily News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-now/ancestrycom-changed-how-it-determines-ethnicity-and-people-are-upset/465-f0205386-1e13-4c92-899b-d2a92dfe698f|title=Ancestry.com changed how it determines ethnicity and people are upset|last=Daalder|first=Marc|date=18 September 2018|website=K5 News}}</ref> Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\n\n==Audience==\nThe interest in genealogical DNA tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.\n\n===Maternal origin tests===\nFor recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtDNA full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a ''nearly'' perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent 1 to 16 generations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smgf.org/pages/mt_interpretation.jspx |title=mtDNA matches |work=Smgf.org |accessdate=2011-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118135732/http://www.smgf.org./pages/mt_interpretation.jspx |archive-date=18 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In cultures lacking [[matrilineal surnames]] to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in ''traditional genealogy'', due to lack of ''matrilineal'' surnames (or matrinames), see [[Matriname]].<ref name=Sykes>Sykes, Bryan (2001).

These attempt to measure an individual's mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or AIM, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. Geneticist [[Adam Rutherford]] has written that these tests \"don\u2019t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past.

Only about 5% have the equivalent of one  great-grandparent of Native American ancestry. By the early 19th century, substantial families of Free Persons of Color had been established in the Chesapeake Bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and African women (servant, slave or free). Over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.<ref>Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/], accessed 15 February 2008</ref>\n\nAccording to authorities like Salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of African Americans taken in [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] came from regions of West Africa. The African-American movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since DNA testing became available. African Americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through [[Surname project|surname research]], [[census]] and property records, and other traditional means. Genealogical DNA testing may provide a tie to regional African heritage.\n\n====United States \u2013 Melungeon testing====\n{{Main|Melungeon DNA Project}}\n[[Melungeon]]s are one of numerous multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented that many of the Melungeon groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and the result of unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], accessed 15 February 2008</ref> Several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as Melungeon. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have Native American heritage as well. Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies\n\n====Native American ancestry====\n{{further|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nThe [[pre-columbian]] indigenous people of the United States are called \"Native Americans\" in American English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/native%2520american|title=Native American {{!}} Definition of Native American by Merriam-Webster|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-04}}</ref> Autosomal testing, Y-DNA, and mtDNA testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. A mitochondrial Haplogroup determination test based on mutations in [[Hypervariable Region]] 1 and 2 may establish whether a person's direct female line belongs to one of the canonical Native American Haplogroups, [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|A]], [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B]], [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C]], [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|D]] or [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X]]. The vast majority of Native American individuals belong to one of the five identified [[mtDNA]] [[Haplogroup]]s. Thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential Native American descent. However, DNA ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.co.uk/dna/legal/faq|title=AncestryDNA FAQ|website=www.ancestry.co.uk}}</ref> [[Tribe (Native American)|Native American tribes]] have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person's ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during [[treaty]]-making, relocation to [[Indian reservation|reservations]] or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the [[Dawes Rolls]].\n\n====Cohanim ancestry====\n{{Main|Y-chromosomal Aaron}}\nThe [[Kohen|Cohanim]] (or Kohanim) is a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] priestly line of descent in [[Judaism]]. According to the [[Torah|Bible]], the ancestor of the Cohanim is [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. Many believe that descent from Aaron is verifiable with a Y-DNA test: the first published study in genealogical Y-Chromosome DNA testing found that a significant percentage of Cohens had distinctively similar DNA, rather more so than general Jewish or Middle Eastern populations. These Cohens tended to belong to [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]], with Y-STR values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]] (CMH). This could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\n\nNevertheless, the original studies tested only six Y-STR markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. In response to the low resolution of the original 6-marker CMH, the testing company FTDNA released a 12-marker CMH signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of Cohens in Haplogroup J1.\n\nA further academic study published in 2009 examined more STR markers and identified a more sharply defined SNP haplogroup, [[Haplogroup J1e (Y-DNA)|J1e*]] (now J1c3, also called J-P58*) for the J1 lineage. The research found \"that 46.1% of Kohanim carry Y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (J-P58*) that likely originated in the Near East well before the dispersal of Jewish groups in the Diaspora. Support for a Near Eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of Bedouins, Yemenis (67%), and Jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from Saudi Arabia and the Near East (Fig. 4). Moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of J-58* in Jewish populations (\u00bb20%) and Kohanim (\u00bb46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-Jewish populations that hosted Jewish diaspora communities outside of the Near East.\"<ref name=\"Hammer2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammer MF, Behar DM, Karafet TM, Mendez FL, Hallmark B, Erez T, Zhivotovsky LA, Rosset S, Skorecki K | title = Extended Y chromosome haplotypes resolve multiple and unique lineages of the Jewish priesthood | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 126 | issue = 5 | pages = 707\u201317 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19669163 | pmc = 2771134 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-009-0727-5 }}</ref>\n\nRecent phylogenetic research for haplogroup J-M267 placed the \"Y-chromosomal Aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of J-L862, L147.1 (age estimate 5631-6778yBP yBP): YSC235>PF4847/CTS11741>YSC234>ZS241>ZS227>Z18271 (age estimate 2731yBP).<ref name=Mas2014>{{cite journal | last1 = Mas | first1 = V. | year = 2013 | title = Y-DNA Haplogroup J1 phylogenetic tree | journal =  | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | publisher =  Figshare| jstor =  | doi = 10.6084/m9.figshare.741212  }}</ref>\n\n====European testing====\n{{Further|Genetic history of Europe}}\n\n==Benefits==\n{{Main|Genetic genealogy}}\nGenealogical DNA tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing [[genealogy|genealogical research]]. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\n\n[[Y-DNA testing]] results are normally stated as probabilities: For example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) being within 8 generations,<ref>ftdna.com (kept uptodate). http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=9#922 \"FAQ: ...how should the genetic distance at 37 Y-chromosome STR markers be interpreted?\" Retrieved 2012-01-13.</ref> while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the MRCA being within only 5 generations back.<ref name=match111>ftdna.com (kept uptodate). http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=9#925 \"FAQ: ...how should the genetic distance at 111 Y-chromosome STR markers be interpreted?\" Retrieved 2012-01-13.</ref>\n\nAs presented above in [[mtDNA testing]], if a perfect match is found, the mtDNA test results can be helpful.

Since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual will vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\n\nThree principal types of genealogical DNA tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and useful for different types of genealogical research: [[Genealogical DNA test#Autosomal DNA (atDNA) testing|autosomal]], [[Genealogical DNA test#Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing|mitochondrial]] (mtDNA), and [[Genealogical DNA test#Y chromosome (Y-DNA) testing|Y-DNA]].\n \nAutosomal tests may result in a large amount of DNA matches (other test persons that the individual may be related to), along mixed male and female lines, each match with an estimated distance in the family tree. However, due to the random nature of which and how much DNA is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise conclusions can only be made for close relations. Traditional [[genealogy|genealogical research]], and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. Autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\n\nMtDNA and Y-DNA tests are much more objective. However, they give considerably fewer DNA matches, if any, since they are limited to relationships along a strict [[Matrilineality|female line]] and a strict [[Patrilineality|male line]] respectively. MtDNA and Y-DNA tests are utilized to identify [[archeological culture]]s and migration paths of a person's ancestors along a strict mother's line or a strict father's line. Based on MtDNA and Y-DNA, a person's [[haplogroup]](s) can be identified. Only men can take Y-DNA tests, since women lack a Y chromosome.\n\n==DNA testing for consumers==\nThe first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing was the now defunct [[GeneTree]]. However, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based [[Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation]] (SMGF) which originated in 1999.<ref name=Wayne2006>{{cite journal|url=http://www.med.wayne.edu/news_media/scribe/PDF/Alum-06-SpringScribe%5B1%5D.pdf|title=CMMG alum launches multi-million dollar genetic testing company - Alum notes|publisher=Wayne State University, School of Medicine's alumni journal|volume=17|date=Spring 2006|page=1|accessdate=24 Jan 2013|issue=2|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053626/http://www2.med.wayne.edu/news_media/scribe/PDF/Alum-06-SpringScribe%5b1%5d.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nWhile in operation, SMGF provided free Y-Chromosome and mitochondrial DNA tests to thousands.<ref name=Blaine2006>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2007/11/06/how-big-is-the-genetic-genealogy-market/|title=How Big Is the Genetic Genealogy Market?|publisher=The Genetic Genealogist|accessdate=19 Feb 2009|date=2007-11-06}}</ref>\nLater, GeneTree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the Sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the [[Ancestry.com]] buyout of SMGF in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.familytreemagazine.com/articles/genealogy-websites/ancestry/ancestry-com-acquisition-means-changes-at-genetree-and-smgf-org/|title=Ancestry.com Acquisition Means Changes at GeneTree and SMGF.org|last=Dobush|first=Grace|date=2012-07-12|website=Family Tree|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref><ref name=SMGF2012>{{cite press release|url=http://corporate.ancestry.com/press/press-releases/2012/05/ancestry.com-dna-launches/|accessdate=1 July 2013|title=Ancestry.com Launches new AncestryDNA Service: The Next Generation of DNA Science Poised to Enrich Family History Research|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526104607/http://corporate.ancestry.com/press/press-releases/2012/05/ancestry.com-dna-launches/|archivedate=26 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[Family Tree DNA]], founded by [[Bennett Greenspan]] and Max Blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research.

This DNA sample can be obtained by a cheek-scraping (also known as a [[buccal swab]]), spit-cups, [[mouthwash]], and [[chewing gum]].  Typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as  [[23andMe]], [[AncestryDNA]], [[Family Tree DNA]], or [[MyHeritage]].

Ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing.\n* '''Y-DNA''' looks at the Y-chromosome, which is inherited father to son, and so can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line.\n* '''mtDNA''' looks at the mitochondria, which is inherited from mother to child and so can be used to explore one's direct maternal line.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bettinger|2016|p=8}}</ref>\n\nY-DNA and mtDNA cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one's [[haplogroup]], which is unevenly distributed geographically.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/debunking/understanding-testing|title=Understanding genetic ancestry testing|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Molecular and Cultural Evolution Lab|publisher=University College London|access-date=2016-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407010200/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/debunking/understanding-testing|archive-date=7 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Direct-to-consumer DNA test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"African haplogroup\" or a \"Viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\"Claims of connections, therefore, between specific uniparental lineages and historical figures or historical migrations of peoples are merely speculative.\" {{Cite journal|last2=Novembre|first2=John|last3=Fullerton|first3=Stephanie M.|last4=Goldstein|first4=David B.|last5=Long|first5=Jeffrey C.|last6=Bamshad|first6=Michael J.|last7=Clark|first7=Andrew G.|date=2010-05-14|title=Inferring Genetic Ancestry: Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=86|issue=5|pages=661\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.03.011|pmid=20466090|pmc=2869013|issn=0002-9297|last1=Royal|first1=Charmaine D.}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Autosomal DNA (atDNA) testing=== <!-- a redirect target for links from other articles -->\n\n====Testing====\nAutosomal DNA is contained in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person's sex.<ref name=\":0\" /> Autosomal DNA recombines each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bettinger|2016|p=70}}</ref> These are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grand parents.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bettinger|2016|p=68}}</ref> Therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the [[genome]] at a particular location \u2013 known as [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s or SNPs) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half each generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of their markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of their markers from each great grandparent, etc. Inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA|title=Autosomal DNA \u2013 ISOGG Wiki|website=isogg.org|access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref> Generally, a genealogical DNA test might test about 700,000 SNPs (specific points in the genome).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smarterhobby.com/genealogy/best-dna-test/|title=Best Ancestry DNA Test 2018 - Which Testing Kit is Best & How to Choose|date=10 January 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shared-cM-Relationship-Tree.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shared DNA for different relatives]]\n\n====Reporting process====\nThe preparation of a report on the DNA in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\n* identification of the DNA base pair at specific SNP locations\n* comparison with previously stored results\n* interpretation of matches\n\n=====Base pair identification=====\nAll major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dna-explained.com/2017/09/05/concepts-imputation/|title=Concepts \u2013 Imputation|date=5 September 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The chip determines which SNP locations are tested. Different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. In addition, updated versions of the Illumina chip may test different sets of SNP locations. The list of SNP locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". The raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. For additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to GEDmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\n\n====Identification of Matches====\nThe major component of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive SNPs in common with a previously tested individual in the company's database, it can be inferred  that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dna-explained.com/2016/03/|title=March - 2016 - DNAeXplained \u2013 Genetic Genealogy|website=dna-explained.com}}</ref> If the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. Unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\n\nThe unit for segments of DNA is the [[centimorgan]] (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. The shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2017/01/06/the-danger-of-distant-matches/|title=The Danger of Distant Matches - The Genetic Genealogist|date=6 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref> An important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared DNA (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\n\n====Interpretation of Autosomal matches====\nMost companies will show the customers how many cMs they share, and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated, however due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate.

Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted from mother to child, thus a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using [[mtDNA]].

A certain section of DNA is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. Typical tests test between 12 and 111 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match. DNA companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are, in terms of generations or years,  based on the difference between their results.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bettinger|2016|p=35}}</ref>\n\n====SNP markers and Haplogroups====\n[[File:dna-SNP.svg|thumb|250px|Strand 1 differs from strand 2 at a single base pair location (a C \u2192 T polymorphism).]]A person's [[haplogroup]] can often be inferred from their STR results, but can be proven only with a Y-chromosome SNP test (Y-SNP test).\n\nA [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) is a change to a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence.

Most significant of these new discoveries was in 2013 when the [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)#A00-AF6|haplogroup A00]] was discovered, which required theories about Y-chromosomal Adam to be significantly revised. The haplogroup was discovered when an African-American man tested STRs at FamilyTreeDNA and his results were found to be unusual. SNP testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" Y-chromosomal Adam and so a much older man became Y-Chromosomal Adam.\n\n===Using DNA test results===\n{{Main|Genetic genealogy}}\n\n====Ethnicity estimates====\nMany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally the world is specified into about 20\u201325 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each [[Autosome|Autosomal DNA]] marker tested to many population groups.<ref name=\":0\" /> The reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. Testing companies such as [[Ancestry.com]] will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-ancestry-update-to-dna-results-confuses-upsets-customers-20190429-cce6vv7ilvcb5dvquuxkv3iia4-story.html|title=Ancestry.com update changes ethnicity of customers|last=Alsup|first=Blake|date=29 April 2019|website=NY Daily News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-now/ancestrycom-changed-how-it-determines-ethnicity-and-people-are-upset/465-f0205386-1e13-4c92-899b-d2a92dfe698f|title=Ancestry.com changed how it determines ethnicity and people are upset|last=Daalder|first=Marc|date=18 September 2018|website=K5 News}}</ref> Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\n\n==Audience==\nThe interest in genealogical DNA tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.\n\n===Maternal origin tests===\nFor recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtDNA full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a ''nearly'' perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent 1 to 16 generations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smgf.org/pages/mt_interpretation.jspx |title=mtDNA matches |work=Smgf.org |accessdate=2011-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118135732/http://www.smgf.org./pages/mt_interpretation.jspx |archive-date=18 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In cultures lacking [[matrilineal surnames]] to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in ''traditional genealogy'', due to lack of ''matrilineal'' surnames (or matrinames), see [[Matriname]].<ref name=Sykes>Sykes, Bryan (2001).

Only about 5% have the equivalent of one  great-grandparent of Native American ancestry. By the early 19th century, substantial families of Free Persons of Color had been established in the Chesapeake Bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and African women (servant, slave or free). Over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.<ref>Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/], accessed 15 February 2008</ref>\n\nAccording to authorities like Salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of African Americans taken in [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] came from regions of West Africa. The African-American movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since DNA testing became available. African Americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through [[Surname project|surname research]], [[census]] and property records, and other traditional means. Genealogical DNA testing may provide a tie to regional African heritage.\n\n====United States \u2013 Melungeon testing====\n{{Main|Melungeon DNA Project}}\n[[Melungeon]]s are one of numerous multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented that many of the Melungeon groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and the result of unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas.<ref>[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], accessed 15 February 2008</ref> Several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as Melungeon. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have Native American heritage as well. Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies\n\n====Native American ancestry====\n{{further|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nThe [[pre-columbian]] indigenous people of the United States are called \"Native Americans\" in American English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/native%2520american|title=Native American {{!}} Definition of Native American by Merriam-Webster|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-04}}</ref> Autosomal testing, Y-DNA, and mtDNA testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. A mitochondrial Haplogroup determination test based on mutations in [[Hypervariable Region]] 1 and 2 may establish whether a person's direct female line belongs to one of the canonical Native American Haplogroups, [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|A]], [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B]], [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C]], [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|D]] or [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X]]. The vast majority of Native American individuals belong to one of the five identified [[mtDNA]] [[Haplogroup]]s. Thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential Native American descent. However, DNA ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.co.uk/dna/legal/faq|title=AncestryDNA FAQ|website=www.ancestry.co.uk}}</ref> [[Tribe (Native American)|Native American tribes]] have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person's ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during [[treaty]]-making, relocation to [[Indian reservation|reservations]] or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the [[Dawes Rolls]].\n\n====Cohanim ancestry====\n{{Main|Y-chromosomal Aaron}}\nThe [[Kohen|Cohanim]] (or Kohanim) is a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] priestly line of descent in [[Judaism]]. According to the [[Torah|Bible]], the ancestor of the Cohanim is [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. Many believe that descent from Aaron is verifiable with a Y-DNA test: the first published study in genealogical Y-Chromosome DNA testing found that a significant percentage of Cohens had distinctively similar DNA, rather more so than general Jewish or Middle Eastern populations. These Cohens tended to belong to [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]], with Y-STR values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]] (CMH). This could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\n\nNevertheless, the original studies tested only six Y-STR markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. In response to the low resolution of the original 6-marker CMH, the testing company FTDNA released a 12-marker CMH signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of Cohens in Haplogroup J1.\n\nA further academic study published in 2009 examined more STR markers and identified a more sharply defined SNP haplogroup, [[Haplogroup J1e (Y-DNA)|J1e*]] (now J1c3, also called J-P58*) for the J1 lineage. The research found \"that 46.1% of Kohanim carry Y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (J-P58*) that likely originated in the Near East well before the dispersal of Jewish groups in the Diaspora. Support for a Near Eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of Bedouins, Yemenis (67%), and Jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from Saudi Arabia and the Near East (Fig. 4). Moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of J-58* in Jewish populations (\u00bb20%) and Kohanim (\u00bb46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-Jewish populations that hosted Jewish diaspora communities outside of the Near East.\"<ref name=\"Hammer2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammer MF, Behar DM, Karafet TM, Mendez FL, Hallmark B, Erez T, Zhivotovsky LA, Rosset S, Skorecki K | title = Extended Y chromosome haplotypes resolve multiple and unique lineages of the Jewish priesthood | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 126 | issue = 5 | pages = 707\u201317 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19669163 | pmc = 2771134 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-009-0727-5 }}</ref>\n\nRecent phylogenetic research for haplogroup J-M267 placed the \"Y-chromosomal Aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of J-L862, L147.1 (age estimate 5631-6778yBP yBP): YSC235>PF4847/CTS11741>YSC234>ZS241>ZS227>Z18271 (age estimate 2731yBP).<ref name=Mas2014>{{cite journal | last1 = Mas | first1 = V. | year = 2013 | title = Y-DNA Haplogroup J1 phylogenetic tree | journal =  | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | publisher =  Figshare| jstor =  | doi = 10.6084/m9.figshare.741212  }}</ref>\n\n====European testing====\n{{Further|Genetic history of Europe}}\n\n==Benefits==\n{{Main|Genetic genealogy}}\nGenealogical DNA tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing [[genealogy|genealogical research]]. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\n\n[[Y-DNA testing]] results are normally stated as probabilities: For example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) being within 8 generations,<ref>ftdna.com (kept uptodate). http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=9#922 \"FAQ: ...how should the genetic distance at 37 Y-chromosome STR markers be interpreted?\" Retrieved 2012-01-13.</ref> while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the MRCA being within only 5 generations back.<ref name=match111>ftdna.com (kept uptodate). http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=9#925 \"FAQ: ...how should the genetic distance at 111 Y-chromosome STR markers be interpreted?\" Retrieved 2012-01-13.</ref>\n\nAs presented above in [[mtDNA testing]], if a perfect match is found, the mtDNA test results can be helpful. In some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures (see [[Matrilineal surname]]).<ref name=Sykes />\n\nAutosomal DNA combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865667270/Adopted-man-finds-biological-family-with-help-of-AncestryDNA.html|title=Adopted man finds biological family with help of AncestryDNA|last=Randall|first=Caresa Alexander|date=2016-11-16|work=Deseret News|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref> has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buckskin-girl-case-groundbreaking-dna-tech-leads-to-id-of-1981-murder-victim/|title=\"Buckskin Girl\" case: DNA breakthrough leads to ID of 1981 murder victim|last=|first=|date=2018-03-12|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/news/2018/05/dna-doe-project-ids-2001-motel-suicide-using-genealogy|title=DNA Doe Project IDs 2001 Motel Suicide, Using Genealogy|last=Augenstein|first=Seth|date=2018-05-09|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2018-05-19}}</ref> and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/golden-state-killer-east-area-rapist-dna-genealogy/559070/|title=How a Genealogy Website Led to the Alleged Golden State Killer|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|date=2018-03-27|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/investigators-use-dna-genealogy-database-to-id-suspect-in-1987-double-homicide/|title=Investigators use DNA, genealogy database to ID suspect in 1987 double homicide|last=Green|first=Sara Jean|date=2018-05-18|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2018-05-19}}</ref> (for example, the [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] District Attorney's office used the \"open-source\" genetic genealogy site [[GEDmatch]] to find relatives of the suspect in the [[Golden State Killer]] case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611038/investigators-searched-a-million-peoples-dna-to-find-golden-state-serial-killer/|title=Investigators searched a million people's DNA to find Golden State serial killer|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article209987599.html|title='Open-source' genealogy site provided missing DNA link to East Area Rapist, investigator says|last1=Lillis|first1=Ryan|date=27 April 2018|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|access-date=27 April 2018|last2=Kasler|first2=Dale|last3=Chabria|first3=Anita}}</ref>).

For example, when the phage genome was mutated to reduce its number of DNA bases (from 6.4 kb to 221 bp),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Specthrie L, Bullitt E, Horiuchi K, Model P, Russel M, Makowski L | title = Construction of a microphage variant of filamentous bacteriophage | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 228 | issue = 3 | pages = 720\u20134 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 1469710 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(92)90858-h }}</ref>  then the number of p8 copies was decreased to fewer than 100, causing the p8 coat to shrink in order to fit the reduced genome. The phage appear to be limited at approximately twice the natural DNA content. However, deletion of a phage protein (p3) prevents full escape from the host ''E. coli'', and phage that are 10-20X the normal length with several copies of the phage genome can be seen shedding from the ''E. coli'' host.\n\nThere are four other proteins on the phage surface, two of which have been extensively studied. At one end of the filament are five copies of the surface exposed pIX (p9) and a more buried companion protein, pVII (p7). If p8 forms the shaft of the phage, p9 and p7 form the \"blunt\" end that is seen in the micrographs. These proteins are very small, containing only 33 and 32 amino acids respectively, though some additional residues can be added to the N-terminal portion of each which are then presented on the outside of the coat. At the other end of the phage particle are five copies of the surface exposed pIII (p3) and its less exposed accessory protein, pVI (p6). These form the rounded tip of the phage and are the first proteins to interact with the ''E. coli'' host during infection. p3 is also the last point of contact with the host as new phage bud from the bacterial surface.\n\n==Replication in ''E. coli''==\n\nBelow are steps involved with replication of M13 in ''E. coli''.\n\n* Viral (+) strand DNA enters [[cytoplasm]]\n* [[Complementary DNA|Complementary (-) strand]] is synthesized by bacterial enzymes\n* [[DNA Gyrase]], a [[type II topoisomerase]], acts on [[dsDNA|double-stranded DNA]]  and catalyzes formation of [[DNA supercoil|negative supercoils]] in double-stranded DNA\n* Final product is parental replicative form (RF) DNA\n* A phage protein, pII, nicks the (+) strand in the RF\n* 3'-hydroxyl acts as a primer in the creation of new viral strand\n* pII circulizes displaced viral (+) strand DNA\n* Pool of progeny double-stranded RF molecules produced\n* Negative strand of RF is template of transcription\n* mRNAs are translated into the phage proteins\n\nPhage proteins in the cytoplasm are pII, pX, and pV, and they are part of the replication process of DNA.
