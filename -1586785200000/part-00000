Other notable buildings by Wren include the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], and the south front of [[Hampton Court Palace]]. The [[Wren Building]], the main building at the [[College of William and Mary]], Virginia, is attributed to Wren.\n\nEducated in [[Latin]] and [[Aristotelian physics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], Wren was a founder of the [[Royal Society]] (president 1680\u20131682), and his scientific work was highly regarded by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Blaise Pascal]].\n\n== Life and works ==\nWren was born in [[East Knoyle]] in [[Wiltshire]], the only surviving son of [[Christopher Wren (priest)|Christopher Wren the Elder]] (1589\u20131658) and Mary Cox, the only child of the Wiltshire squire Robert Cox from [[Fonthill Bishop]]. Christopher Sr. was at that time the rector of East Knoyle and later [[Dean of Windsor]]. It was while they were living at East Knoyle that all their children were born; Mary, Catherine and Susan were all born by 1628 but then several children were born who died within a few weeks of their birth. Their son Christopher was born in 1632 then, two years later, another daughter named Elizabeth was born. Mary must have died shortly after the birth of Elizabeth, although there does not appear to be any surviving record of the date. Through Mary Cox, however, the family became well off financially for, as the only heir, she had inherited her father's estate.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |title=Wiltshire Council \u2013 Wiltshire Community History Get Wiltshire History Question Information |publisher=History.wiltshire.gov.uk |date=17 May 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311164641/http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |archive-date=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs a child Wren \"seem'd consumptive.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wren|Ames|Wren|1750}}</ref> Although a sickly child, he would survive into robust old age. He was first taught at home by a private tutor and his father. After his father's royal appointment as [[Dean of Windsor]] in March 1635, his family spent part of each year there, but little is known about Wren's life at Windsor. He spent his first eight years at East Knoyle and was educated by the Rev. William Shepherd, a local clergyman.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\"/>\n\nLittle is known of Wren's schooling thereafter, during dangerous times when his father's Royal associations would have required the family to keep a very low profile from the ruling Parliamentary authorities. It was a tough time in his life, but one which would go on to have a significant impact upon his later works. The story that he was at [[Westminster School]] between 1641 and 1646 is substantiated only by ''Parentalia'', the biography compiled by his son, a fourth Christopher, which places him there \"for some short time\" before going up to Oxford (in 1650); however, it is entirely consistent with headmaster [[Richard Busby|Doctor Busby]]'s well-documented practice of educating the sons of impoverished Royalists and Puritans alike, irrespective of current politics or his own position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/sir-christopher-wren|title=Sir Christopher Wren {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wadham College.jpg|thumb|[[Wadham College]], Oxford, where Wren was a student in 1650\u201351]]\nSome of Wren's youthful exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) showed that he received a thorough grounding in [[Latin]] and also learned to draw. According to ''Parentalia'', he was \"initiated\" in the principles of mathematics by Dr [[William Holder]], who married Wren's elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643. His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, ''Cerebri Anatome'' (1664), published by [[Thomas Willis]], which coined the term \"neurology.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-30/april-2017/five-depictions-brain|title=Five depictions of the brain - ''The Psychologist''|publisher=bps.org.uk|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref> During this time period, Wren manifested an interest in the design and construction of mechanical instruments. It was probably through Holder that Wren met [[Sir Charles Scarburgh]] whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nOn 25 June 1650, Wren entered [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Latin]] and the works of [[Aristotle]]. It is anachronistic to imagine that he received scientific training in the modern sense. However, Wren became closely associated with [[John Wilkins]], the Warden of Wadham. The [[Wilkins circle]] was a group whose activities led to the formation of the [[Royal Society]], comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers. This connection probably influenced Wren's studies of science and mathematics at Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1651, and two years later received M.A.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christopher Wren|last=Kerry|first=Downes|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199215249|location=New York|oclc=83977472}}</ref>\n\n===1653\u20131664===\nReceiving his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1653, Wren was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls' College]] in the same year and began an active period of research and experiment in Oxford. His days as a fellow of All Souls ended when Wren was appointed Professor of Astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London in 1657. He was provided with a set of rooms and a stipend and was required to give weekly lectures in both [[Latin]] and English to all who wished to attend; admission was free. Wren took up this new work with enthusiasm. He continued to meet the men with whom he had frequent discussions in Oxford. They attended his London lectures and in 1660, initiated formal weekly meetings. It was from these meetings that the Royal Society, England's premier scientific body, was to develop. He undoubtedly played a major role in the early life of what would become the Royal Society; his great breadth of expertise in so many different subjects helping in the exchange of ideas between the various scientists. In fact, the report on one of these meetings reads:\n\n{{quote|Memorandum November 28, 1660. These persons following according to the usual custom of most of them, met together at Gresham College to hear Mr Wren's lecture, viz. The [[Lord Brouncker]], [[Robert Boyle|Mr Boyle]], Mr Bruce, [[Sir Robert Moray]], [[Paul Neile|Sir Paule Neile]], Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, [[William Petty|Dr Petty]], Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill.

In addition to being a founder member of the Society, Wren was president of the Royal Society from 1680 to 1682.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nIn 1661, Wren was elected [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] of [[Astronomy]] at Oxford, and in 1669 he was appointed Surveyor of Works to Charles II. From 1661 until 1668 Wren's life was based in Oxford, although his attendance at meetings of the Royal Society meant that he had to make occasional trips to London.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nThe main sources for Wren's scientific achievements are the records of the Royal Society. His scientific works ranged from astronomy, [[optics]], the problem of finding [[longitude]] at sea, [[cosmology]], [[mechanics]], [[microscopy]], [[surveying]], medicine and [[meteorology]]. He observed, measured, dissected, built models and employed, invented and improved a variety of instruments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Windsor|first=Alan|date=March 1984|title=John Soane: The Making of an Architect Pierre de La Ruffini\u00e8re Du Prey|url=http://jsah.ucpress.edu/cgi/doi/10.2307/989987|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=43|issue=1|pages=84\u201385|doi=10.2307/989987}}</ref>\n\n===1665\u20131723===\n[[File:Library of St. Paul's Cathedral, London-24784264246.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Wren, 1673]]\nIt was probably around this time that Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied the architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, he made his first design for St Paul's. A week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 churches]]; however, it is not necessarily true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nWren was [[knight]]ed 14 November 1673. This honour was bestowed on him after his resignation from the Savilian chair in Oxford, by which time he had already begun to make his mark as an architect, both in services to the Crown and in playing an important part in rebuilding London after the Great Fire.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nAdditionally, he was sufficiently active in public affairs to be returned as [[Member of Parliament]] on four occasions.<ref name=HoC7>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/wren-sir-christopher-1632-1723|title=Sir Christopher Wren, 1632 - 1723 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> Wren first stood for [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in a by-election in 1667 for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University constituency]], losing by six votes to [[Charles Wheler|Sir Charles Wheler]].<ref name=HoC5>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/cambridge-university|title=Cambridge University, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> He was unsuccessful again in a by-election for the [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University constituency]] in 1674, losing to [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth|Thomas Thynne]].<ref name=HoC6>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/oxford-university|title=Oxford University, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> On his third attempt Wren was successful and he sat for [[Plympton Erle (UK Parliament constituency)|Plympton Erle]] during the [[Loyal Parliament]] of 1685 to 1687.<ref name=HoC4>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/plympton-erle|title=Plympton Erle, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> Wren was returned for [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|New Windsor]] on 11 January 1689 in the [[1689 English general election|general election]], but his election was declared void on 14 May 1689.<ref name=HoC1>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/new-windsor|title=New Windsor, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> He was elected again for New Windsor on [[1690 English general election|6 March 1690]], but this election was declared void on 17 May 1690.<ref name=HoC2>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/constituencies/new-windsor|title=New Windsor, 1690 - 1715 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> Over a decade later he was elected unopposed for [[Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Weymouth and Melcombe Regis]] at the [[December 1701 English general election|November 1701 general election]].

In 1669, the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir John Coghill of [[Bletchingdon]]. Little is known of Faith's life or demeanour, but a love letter from Wren survives, which reads, in part:\n\n{{quote|I have sent your Watch at last & envy the felicity of it, that it should be soe near your side & soe often enjoy your Eye.&nbsp;... .but have a care for it, for I have put such a spell into it; that every Beating of the Balance will tell you 'tis the Pulse of my Heart, which labors as much to serve you and more trewly than the Watch; for the Watch I beleeve will sometimes lie, and sometimes be idle & unwilling&nbsp;... but as for me you may be confident I shall never&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=184}} (Some time earlier, Faith had dropped her wristwatch into a pool of water. It had been sent to Wren in London for it to be repaired. This letter was part of a package.)</ref>}}\n\nThis brief marriage produced two children: Gilbert, born October 1672, who suffered from convulsions and died at about 18 months old, and Christopher, born February 1675. The younger Christopher was trained by his father to be an architect. It was this Christopher that supervised the topping out ceremony of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] in 1710 and wrote the famous ''[[Parentalia, or, Memoirs of the family of the Wrens]]''. Faith Wren died of [[smallpox]] on 3 September 1675. She was buried in the [[chancel]] of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] beside the infant Gilbert. A few days later Wren's mother-in-law, Lady Coghill, arrived to take the infant Christopher back with her to Oxfordshire to raise.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n[[File:Christopher Wren.jpeg|thumb|right|Wren, portrait c.1690 by [[John Closterman]]]]\nIn 1677, 17 months after the death of his first wife, Wren remarried, this time to Jane Fitzwilliam, daughter of [[William FitzWilliam, 2nd Baron FitzWilliam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p3878.htm#i38772 |title=the Peerage.com |publisher=the Peerage.com |date= |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and his wife Jane Perry, the daughter of a prosperous London merchant.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nShe was a mystery to Wren's friends and companions. [[Robert Hooke]], who often saw Wren two or three times every week, had, as he recorded in his diary, never even heard of her, and was not to meet her till six weeks after the marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=239}}</ref> As with the first marriage, this too produced two children: a daughter Jane (1677\u20131702); and a son William, \"Poor Billy\" born June 1679, who was developmentally delayed.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nLike the first, this second marriage was also brief. Jane Wren died of [[tuberculosis]] in September 1680. She was buried alongside Faith and Gilbert in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Wren was never to marry again; he lived to be over 90 years old and of those years was married only nine.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nBletchingdon was the home of Wren's brother-in-law William Holder who was rector of the local church. Holder had been a Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]]. An intellectual of considerable ability, he is said to have been the figure who introduced Wren to arithmetic and geometry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=C. S.

In 1712, the ''Letter Concerning Design'' of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], third [[Earl of Shaftesbury]], circulated in manuscript. Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren's cathedral, his taste and his long-standing control of royal works. Although Wren was appointed to the Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715. On 26 April 1718, on the pretext of failing powers, he was dismissed in favour of [[William Benson (architect)|William Benson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-30019|title=Wren, Sir Christopher (1632\u20131723), architect, mathematician, and astronomer {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|website=www.oxforddnb.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/30019|access-date=2019-06-16|year=2004|last1=Downes|first1=Kerry}}</ref>\n\nIn 1713, he bought the manor of [[Wroxall Abbey|Wroxall]], Warwickshire from the Burgoyne family, to which his son [[Christopher Wren Jr.|Christopher]] retired in 1716 after losing his post as Clerk of Works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol3/pp215-220|title=Parishes: Wroxall|publisher=British History Online|accessdate= 10 September 2018}}</ref> Several of Wren's descendants would be buried there in the [[Wren's Cathedral|Church of St Leonard]].\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral with tomb of Christopher Wren.jpg|thumb|left|Crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral, Wren's memorial on the left]]\nThe Wren family estate was at [[The Old Court House]] in the area of [[Hampton Court]].

According to Parentalia (pp.&nbsp;210\u2013211), his solid model of the moon attracted the attention of the King who commanded Wren to perfect it and present it to him. {{quote |text=''He contrived an artificial Eye, truly and dioptrically made (as large as a Tennis-Ball) representing the Picture as Nature makes it: The Cornea, and Crystalline were Glass, the other Humours, Water.'' |source= Parentalia, p.209}} \nHe experimented on terrestrial [[magnetism]] and had taken part in medical experiments while at [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]], performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In [[Gresham College]], he did experiments involving determining [[longitude]] through [[magnetism|magnetic]] variation and through lunar observation to help with [[navigation]], and helped construct a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the [[microscope]] and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet [[Saturn]] from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in ''De corpore saturni'' but before the work was published, [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and ''De corpore saturni'' was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. In 1658, he found the length of an arc of the [[cycloid]] using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression.\n\nA year into Wren's appointment as a [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] in [[Oxford]], the [[Royal Society]] was created and Wren became an active member. As Savilian Professor, Wren studied [[mechanics]] thoroughly, especially [[elastic collision]]s and [[pendulum]] motions. He also directed his far-ranging intelligence to the study of [[meteorology]]: in 1662, he invented the tipping bucket [[rain gauge]] and, in 1663, designed a \"weather-clock\" that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure. A working weather clock based on Wren's design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Introduction of Self-Registering Meteorological Instruments|first=Robert P.|last=Multhauf|journal=United States National Museum Bulletin|date=1961}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Wren experimented on muscle functionality, hypothesizing that the swelling and shrinking of muscles might proceed from a fermentative motion arising from the mixture of two heterogeneous fluids. Although this is incorrect, it was at least founded upon observation and may mark a new outlook on medicine: specialisation.\n\nAnother topic to which Wren contributed was [[optics]]. He published a description of an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors. Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution is a ruled surface. These results were published in 1669.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rstl.1669.0018|title = Generatio corporis cylindroidis hyperbolici, elaborandis lentibus hyperbolicis accommodati, auth.

[[Robert Hooke]] had theorised that planets, moving [[in vacuo]], describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, within the context of Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the [[Kepler's laws]] with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'', which was later to be expanded into the ''Principia''.<ref>[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness|Grattan-Guinness, Ivor]], ed.; ''Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics'', 1st ed., 2005, pp.&nbsp;64\u201365</ref>\n\nMentioned above are only a few of Wren's scientific works. He also studied other areas, ranging from agriculture, [[ballistics]], water and freezing, light and refraction, to name only a few. [[Thomas Birch]]'s ''History of the Royal Society'' (1756\u201357) is one of the most important sources of our knowledge not only of the origins of the Society, but also the day-to-day running of the Society. It is in these records that most of Wren's known scientific works are recorded.\n\n==Architectural career==\n\nIn Wren's age, the profession of architect as understood today did not exist. Since the early years of the 17th century it was not unusual for well-educated young men (''virtuosi'') to take up architecture as a gentlemanly activity, a pursuit widely accepted as a branch of applied mathematics. This is implicit in the writings of [[Vitruvius]] and explicit in such 16th century authors as [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]. When Wren was a student at Oxford, he became familiar with Vitruvius' ''De architectura'' and absorbed intuitively the fundamentals of architectural design. In 1668, building work began on Wren\u2019s designs for Emmanuel College Chapel in Cambridge and the Garden Quadrangle in Trinity College in Oxford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=776}}</ref> In English Medieval tradition, buildings had been constructed to the needs of the patron and the suggestions of building professionals, such as master carpenters or master bricklayers.\n\nThrough the Royal Society and his use of optics, the King noticed Wren's works. In 1661 he was approached by his cousin Matthew with a royal commission, as \"one of the best Geometers in Europe\", to direct the re-fortification of [[Tangier]]. Wren excused himself on grounds of health. Although this invitation may have arisen from Charles II's casual opportunism in matching people to tasks, Wren is believed to have been already on the way to practice as an architect. Before the end of 1661 Wren was unofficially advising on the repair of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] after two decades of its neglect and distress; his architectural interests were also evident to his associates at the time. Two years later, he set out on his only foreign journey, to Paris and the [[\u00cele-de-France]], during which he undertook the first-hand study of modern design and construction.\n\nBy this time, Wren had mastered and thoroughly understood the principles of architecture. Unlike several of his colleagues, who regarded it as a set of rules and formulas for design, he had acquired, understood, and exploited the necessary combination of reason and intuition, experience and imagination.<ref>''Sir Christopher Wren: Natural Cause of Beauty''</ref>\n\nWren's first architectural project was the chapel of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] in Cambridge, which his uncle [[Matthew Wren]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], asked him to design in 1663. The second was the design of the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in [[Oxford]], completed in 1668. This, the gift of Archbishop [[Gilbert Sheldon|Sheldon]] to his old university, was influenced by the form of the ancient [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, thus achieving a combination of classical and modern empirical design.\n\n===St Paul's Cathedral===\n[[File:P623 Christopher Wren's Plan for Rebuilding London after Great Fire of 1666.jpg|thumb|left|Wren's plan for rebuilding after the [[Great Fire of London]]]]\n[[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] has always been the highlight of Wren's reputation. His association with it spans his whole architectural career, including the 36 years between the start of the new building and the declaration by parliament of its completion in 1711.\n\nWren had been involved in repairs of the old cathedral since 1661. In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London]] reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to a ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September he ascertained the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1666. In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed.\n[[File:St Paul's - the Greek Cross design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's [[Greek Cross]] design for St Paul's.]]\n\nIt was not until 1670 that the pace of rebuilding started accelerating. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1670|second rebuilding act]] was passed that year, raising the tax on coal and thus providing a source of funds for rebuilding of churches destroyed within the [[City of London]]. Wren presented his initial \"First Model\" for St Paul's. This plan was accepted, and demolition of the old cathedral began. By 1672, however, this design seemed too modest, and Wren met his critics by producing a design of spectacular grandeur. This modified design, called \"Great Model\", was accepted by the King and the construction started in November 1673. However, this design failed to satisfy the [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] and clerical opinion generally; moreover, it had an economic drawback. Wren was confined to a \"cathedral form\" desired by the clergy. In 1674 he produced the rather meagre Classical-Gothic compromise known as the Warrant Design. However, this design, called so from the royal warrant of 14 May 1675 attached to the drawings, is not the design upon which work had begun a few weeks before.\n[[File:St Paul's - the final design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's cathedral as built.]]\n\nThe cathedral that Wren started to build bears only a slight resemblance to the Warrant Design. In 1697, the first service was held in the cathedral when Wren was 65. There was still, however, no dome. Finally in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] had withheld for 14 years since 1697. The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a [[balustrade]] around the proof line. This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt [[Parthian shot|parthian comment]] that \"ladies think nothing well without an edging\".<ref>Bolton and Hendry, eds., ''The Wren Society'', 20 vols.</ref>\n\n===Major architectural works in the 1670s and 1680s===\n[[File:Hampton Court 02.jpg|thumb|[[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131702)]]\nDuring the 1670s Wren received significant secular commissions which manifest both the maturity and the variety of his architecture and the sensitivity of his response to diverse briefs.\n\nAmong many of his remarkable designs at this time, the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|monument]] (1671\u201376)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> commemorating the Great Fire also involved [[Robert Hooke]], but Wren was in control of the final design, the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] (1675\u201376),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\">{{harvnb|Downes|1988|p=131}}</ref> and the [[Wren Library]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1676\u201384)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> were the most important ones.\n\n[[File:WrenLibraryCambridge.jpg|thumb|[[Wren Library]], Trinity College, Cambridge University]]\n\nIn 1682, Wren advised that the original statues of the King's Beasts on [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel, Windsor]] be removed. The pinnacles were left bare until 1925, when replica statues were installed.<ref>{{cite book|last=London|first=H. Stanford|title=The Queen's Beasts|publisher=Newman Neame|date=1953|page=15}}</ref>\n\nBy historical accident, all Wren's large-scale secular commissions dated from after the 1680s. At the age of 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, was ready for a monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relates both to the whole and to the people who used them. The first large project Wren designed, the [[Chelsea Hospital]] (1682\u201392),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfills its original function. The reconstruction of the state room at [[Windsor Castle]] was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting. This commission was in the hand of [[Hugh May]], who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works.\n\nBetween 1683 and 1685 he was much occupied in designing the [[King's House, Winchester]], where Charles II had hoped to spend his declining years, but which was never completed. When Wren promised that it would be complete within a year the King, who was conscious of his mortality, replied that \" a year is a great time in my life\".\n\nAfter the death of Charles II in 1685, Wren's attention was directed mainly to [[Whitehall]] (1685\u201387).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> The new king, [[James II of England|James II]], required a new chapel and also ordered a new gallery, council chamber and a riverside apartment for the [[Mary of Modena|Queen]]. Later, when James II was removed from the throne, Wren took on architectural projects such as [[Kensington Palace]] (1689\u201396)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and [[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131700).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/>\n\nThe erection of the present [[Windsor Guildhall]] was begun in 1687, under the direction of Sir [[Thomas Fitz]] (or Fiddes) but there is a story that on his death in 1689, the task was taken over by Sir Christopher Wren. It was completed at a cost of \u00a32687 - 1s - 6d. The new building was supported around its perimeter by stone columns, providing a covered area beneath as a venue for [[Corn exchange|corn markets]].\n\nThe story is widely told that the borough Council demanded that Wren should insert additional columns within the covered area, in order to support the weight of the heavy building above; Wren, however, was adamant that these were not necessary. Eventually the council insisted and, in due course, the extra supporting columns were built, but Wren made them slightly short, so that they do not quite touch the ceiling, hence proving his claim that they were not necessary. However, there is little evidence that Wren was ever involved in the design or construction of the Guildhall. It is now believed that the story grew out of Wren's connections with Windsor and that his son, also called Christopher Wren, who served as a [[Member of Parliament]] for Windsor, commissioned the statue of [[Prince George of Denmark]] in 1713 on the south end of the building and his name was engraved underneath. The pillars were probably moved into the cornmarket from the east side of the building when an extension was added in 1829.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Pamela |last1=Marson|first2=Brigitte |last2=Mitchell|title=Windsor Guildhall: History and Tour|year=2015|publisher=Friends of the Windsor & Royal Borough Museum|isbn=9780-9010-3309-3|page=7}}</ref> The gaps at the top of the pillars are now filled with tiles smaller than the capitals.\n\nWren did not pursue his work on architectural design as actively as he had before the 1690s, although he still played important roles in a number of royal commissions. In 1696 he was appointed Surveyor of [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Naval Hospital]],<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and in 1698 he was appointed [[Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey|Surveyor of Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jardine|2003|p=440}}</ref> He resigned the former role in 1716 but held the latter until his death, approving with a wavering signature<ref>Westminster Abbey Muniments</ref> [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]]'s revisions of Wren's own earlier designs for the great Archway of Westminster School.\n\n==Achievement and legacy==\n\nAt his death, Wren was 90 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]). Even the men he had trained and who owed much of their success to Wren's original and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were beginning to look past Wren's style. The [[Baroque]] school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back beyond him to [[Inigo Jones]]. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, but they could not forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral can be seen in the church of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve (now the [[Panth\u00e9on]]); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral|St Isaac's]] (1840\u201342) in [[Saint Petersburg]] to the [[United States Capitol|US Capitol]] at Washington, D.C. (1855\u201365).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649414/Sir-Christopher-Wren/8009/Concurrent-projects |title=Sir Christopher Wren (English architect) : Concurrent projects \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the potency of the influence of Wren's work on English architecture was reduced. The last major architect who admitted to being dependent on him was [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]],<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/edwin-lutyens From www.Answers.com re Lutyens]: ''Lutyens' Neo-Georgian work, which he jokingly referred to as his \"Wrennaissance Style\" (after the great English baroque architect Christopher Wren) is typified by the use of English baroque forms and details''.</ref> who died in 1944. With the purposeful elimination of historic influences from [[International Style (architecture)|international architecture in the early 20th century]], Wren's work gradually stopped being perceived as a mine of examples applicable to contemporary design.\n\n==Freemasonry==\n\nSince at least the 18th century, the Lodge of Antiquity No. 2, one of the four founding Masonic Lodges of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1717, has claimed Christopher Wren to have been its Master at the ''Goose and Gridiron'' at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] churchyard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |title=Manifesto of 1778 issued by The Lodge of Antiquity, formerly The Old Lodge of St Paul, &nbsp;to preserve the Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth |publisher=Lodgeroomus.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721114928/http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Whilst he was rebuilding the cathedral he is said to have been \"adopted\" on 18 May 1691 (that is, accepted as a sort of honorary member or patron, rather than an operative). Their 18th-century maul with its 1827 inscription claiming that it was used by Wren for the foundation stone of St. Paul's, belonging to the Lodge and on display in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, corroborates the story. [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]] made the claims in his widely circulated ''Constitutions'' while many of Wren's friends were still alive, but he made many highly creative claims as to the history or legends of Freemasonry. There is also a clear possibility of confusion between the operative workmen's lodges which might naturally have welcomed the boss, and the \"speculative\" or gentlemen's lodges which became highly fashionable just after Wren's death. By the standards of his time a gentleman like Wren would not generally join an artisan body{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}; however the workmen of St Paul's cathedral would naturally have sought the patronage or \"interest\" of their employer, and within Wren's lifetime there was a predominantly gentlemen's Lodge at the ''Rummer and Grapes'', a mile upriver at Westminster (where Wren had been to School).\n\nIn 1788, the Lodge of Antiquity thought they were buying a portrait of Wren which now dominates Lodge Room 10, in the same building as the Museum; but it is now identified with [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], not Wren. Nevertheless, this recorded event and many old records attest the fact that Antiquity thought that Wren had been its Master, at a time when it still held its minute books for the relevant years (which were lost by Preston at some date after 1778).\n\nThe evidence whether Wren was a speculative freemason is the subject of the Prestonian Lecture<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2011}}</ref> of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and [[Aubrey]]'s memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.\n\n==Trivia==\nAt one time Wren was credited with the design of the King's House at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]]. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings. Wren, who was not so tall, replied that \"They were high enough!\", at which the king crouched down until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted about saying, \"Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, I think they are high enough.\"<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Mark Noble (biographer)|first=Mark|last=Noble|title=Biographical History of England|url=https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog|date=1806|page=[https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog/page/n330 327]}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Wren appeared on the reverse of the first British [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|\u00a350 banknote]] (Series D) issued in modern time. The notes were printed between 1981 and 1994 and in circulation until 1996.\n\n==Gallery of architectural work==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Sheldonian Theatre Oxford.jpg|Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford University\nFile:Sheldonian Theatre Interior, Oxford, UK -

Other notable buildings by Wren include the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], and the south front of [[Hampton Court Palace]]. The [[Wren Building]], the main building at the [[College of William and Mary]], Virginia, is attributed to Wren.\n\nEducated in [[Latin]] and [[Aristotelian physics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], Wren was a founder of the [[Royal Society]] (president 1680\u20131682), and his scientific work was highly regarded by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Blaise Pascal]].\n\n== Life and works ==\nWren was born in [[East Knoyle]] in [[Wiltshire]], the only surviving son of [[Christopher Wren (priest)|Christopher Wren the Elder]] (1589\u20131658) and Mary Cox, the only child of the Wiltshire squire Robert Cox from [[Fonthill Bishop]]. Christopher Sr. was at that time the rector of East Knoyle and later [[Dean of Windsor]]. It was while they were living at East Knoyle that all their children were born; Mary, Catherine and Susan were all born by 1628 but then several children were born who died within a few weeks of their birth. Their son Christopher was born in 1632 then, two years later, another daughter named Elizabeth was born. Mary must have died shortly after the birth of Elizabeth, although there does not appear to be any surviving record of the date. Through Mary Cox, however, the family became well off financially for, as the only heir, she had inherited her father's estate.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |title=Wiltshire Council \u2013 Wiltshire Community History Get Wiltshire History Question Information |publisher=History.wiltshire.gov.uk |date=17 May 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311164641/http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |archive-date=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs a child Wren \"seem'd consumptive.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wren|Ames|Wren|1750}}</ref> Although a sickly child, he would survive into robust old age. He was first taught at home by a private tutor and his father. After his father's royal appointment as [[Dean of Windsor]] in March 1635, his family spent part of each year there, but little is known about Wren's life at Windsor. He spent his first eight years at East Knoyle and was educated by the Rev. William Shepherd, a local clergyman.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\"/>\n\nLittle is known of Wren's schooling thereafter, during dangerous times when his father's Royal associations would have required the family to keep a very low profile from the ruling Parliamentary authorities. It was a tough time in his life, but one which would go on to have a significant impact upon his later works. The story that he was at [[Westminster School]] between 1641 and 1646 is substantiated only by ''Parentalia'', the biography compiled by his son, a fourth Christopher, which places him there \"for some short time\" before going up to Oxford (in 1650); however, it is entirely consistent with headmaster [[Richard Busby|Doctor Busby]]'s well-documented practice of educating the sons of impoverished Royalists and Puritans alike, irrespective of current politics or his own position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/sir-christopher-wren|title=Sir Christopher Wren {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wadham College.jpg|thumb|[[Wadham College]], Oxford, where Wren was a student in 1650\u201351]]\nSome of Wren's youthful exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) showed that he received a thorough grounding in [[Latin]] and also learned to draw. According to ''Parentalia'', he was \"initiated\" in the principles of mathematics by Dr [[William Holder]], who married Wren's elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643. His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, ''Cerebri Anatome'' (1664), published by [[Thomas Willis]], which coined the term \"neurology.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-30/april-2017/five-depictions-brain|title=Five depictions of the brain - ''The Psychologist''|publisher=bps.org.uk|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref> During this time period, Wren manifested an interest in the design and construction of mechanical instruments. It was probably through Holder that Wren met [[Sir Charles Scarburgh]] whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nOn 25 June 1650, Wren entered [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Latin]] and the works of [[Aristotle]]. It is anachronistic to imagine that he received scientific training in the modern sense. However, Wren became closely associated with [[John Wilkins]], the Warden of Wadham. The [[Wilkins circle]] was a group whose activities led to the formation of the [[Royal Society]], comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers. This connection probably influenced Wren's studies of science and mathematics at Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1651, and two years later received M.A.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christopher Wren|last=Kerry|first=Downes|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199215249|location=New York|oclc=83977472}}</ref>\n\n===1653\u20131664===\nReceiving his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1653, Wren was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls' College]] in the same year and began an active period of research and experiment in Oxford. His days as a fellow of All Souls ended when Wren was appointed Professor of Astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London in 1657. He was provided with a set of rooms and a stipend and was required to give weekly lectures in both [[Latin]] and English to all who wished to attend; admission was free. Wren took up this new work with enthusiasm. He continued to meet the men with whom he had frequent discussions in Oxford. They attended his London lectures and in 1660, initiated formal weekly meetings. It was from these meetings that the Royal Society, England's premier scientific body, was to develop. He undoubtedly played a major role in the early life of what would become the Royal Society; his great breadth of expertise in so many different subjects helping in the exchange of ideas between the various scientists. In fact, the report on one of these meetings reads:\n\n{{quote|Memorandum November 28, 1660. These persons following according to the usual custom of most of them, met together at Gresham College to hear Mr Wren's lecture, viz. The [[Lord Brouncker]], [[Robert Boyle|Mr Boyle]], Mr Bruce, [[Sir Robert Moray]], [[Paul Neile|Sir Paule Neile]], Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, [[William Petty|Dr Petty]], Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill.

In addition to being a founder member of the Society, Wren was president of the Royal Society from 1680 to 1682.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nIn 1661, Wren was elected [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] of [[Astronomy]] at Oxford, and in 1669 he was appointed Surveyor of Works to Charles II. From 1661 until 1668 Wren's life was based in Oxford, although his attendance at meetings of the Royal Society meant that he had to make occasional trips to London.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nThe main sources for Wren's scientific achievements are the records of the Royal Society. His scientific works ranged from astronomy, [[optics]], the problem of finding [[longitude]] at sea, [[cosmology]], [[mechanics]], [[microscopy]], [[surveying]], medicine and [[meteorology]]. He observed, measured, dissected, built models and employed, invented and improved a variety of instruments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Windsor|first=Alan|date=March 1984|title=John Soane: The Making of an Architect Pierre de La Ruffini\u00e8re Du Prey|url=http://jsah.ucpress.edu/cgi/doi/10.2307/989987|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=43|issue=1|pages=84\u201385|doi=10.2307/989987}}</ref>\n\n===1665\u20131723===\n[[File:Library of St. Paul's Cathedral, London-24784264246.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Wren, 1673]]\nIt was probably around this time that Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied the architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, he made his first design for St Paul's. A week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 churches]]; however, it is not necessarily true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nWren was [[knight]]ed 14 November 1673.

In 1669, the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir John Coghill of [[Bletchingdon]]. Little is known of Faith's life or demeanour, but a love letter from Wren survives, which reads, in part:\n\n{{quote|I have sent your Watch at last & envy the felicity of it, that it should be soe near your side & soe often enjoy your Eye.&nbsp;... .but have a care for it, for I have put such a spell into it; that every Beating of the Balance will tell you 'tis the Pulse of my Heart, which labors as much to serve you and more trewly than the Watch; for the Watch I beleeve will sometimes lie, and sometimes be idle & unwilling&nbsp;... but as for me you may be confident I shall never&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=184}} (Some time earlier, Faith had dropped her wristwatch into a pool of water.

This letter was part of a package.)</ref>}}\n\nThis brief marriage produced two children: Gilbert, born October 1672, who suffered from convulsions and died at about 18 months old, and Christopher, born February 1675. The younger Christopher was trained by his father to be an architect. It was this Christopher that supervised the topping out ceremony of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] in 1710 and wrote the famous ''[[Parentalia, or, Memoirs of the family of the Wrens]]''. Faith Wren died of [[smallpox]] on 3 September 1675. She was buried in the [[chancel]] of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] beside the infant Gilbert. A few days later Wren's mother-in-law, Lady Coghill, arrived to take the infant Christopher back with her to Oxfordshire to raise.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n[[File:Christopher Wren.jpeg|thumb|right|Wren, portrait c.1690 by [[John Closterman]]]]\nIn 1677, 17 months after the death of his first wife, Wren remarried, this time to Jane Fitzwilliam, daughter of [[William FitzWilliam, 2nd Baron FitzWilliam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p3878.htm#i38772 |title=the Peerage.com |publisher=the Peerage.com |date= |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and his wife Jane Perry, the daughter of a prosperous London merchant.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nShe was a mystery to Wren's friends and companions. [[Robert Hooke]], who often saw Wren two or three times every week, had, as he recorded in his diary, never even heard of her, and was not to meet her till six weeks after the marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=239}}</ref> As with the first marriage, this too produced two children: a daughter Jane (1677\u20131702); and a son William, \"Poor Billy\" born June 1679, who was developmentally delayed.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nLike the first, this second marriage was also brief. Jane Wren died of [[tuberculosis]] in September 1680. She was buried alongside Faith and Gilbert in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Wren was never to marry again; he lived to be over 90 years old and of those years was married only nine.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nBletchingdon was the home of Wren's brother-in-law William Holder who was rector of the local church. Holder had been a Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]].

In 1712, the ''Letter Concerning Design'' of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], third [[Earl of Shaftesbury]], circulated in manuscript. Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren's cathedral, his taste and his long-standing control of royal works. Although Wren was appointed to the Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715.

According to Parentalia (pp.&nbsp;210\u2013211), his solid model of the moon attracted the attention of the King who commanded Wren to perfect it and present it to him. {{quote |text=''He contrived an artificial Eye, truly and dioptrically made (as large as a Tennis-Ball) representing the Picture as Nature makes it: The Cornea, and Crystalline were Glass, the other Humours, Water.'' |source= Parentalia, p.209}} \nHe experimented on terrestrial [[magnetism]] and had taken part in medical experiments while at [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]], performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In [[Gresham College]], he did experiments involving determining [[longitude]] through [[magnetism|magnetic]] variation and through lunar observation to help with [[navigation]], and helped construct a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the [[microscope]] and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet [[Saturn]] from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in ''De corpore saturni'' but before the work was published, [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and ''De corpore saturni'' was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. In 1658, he found the length of an arc of the [[cycloid]] using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression.\n\nA year into Wren's appointment as a [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] in [[Oxford]], the [[Royal Society]] was created and Wren became an active member. As Savilian Professor, Wren studied [[mechanics]] thoroughly, especially [[elastic collision]]s and [[pendulum]] motions. He also directed his far-ranging intelligence to the study of [[meteorology]]: in 1662, he invented the tipping bucket [[rain gauge]] and, in 1663, designed a \"weather-clock\" that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure. A working weather clock based on Wren's design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Introduction of Self-Registering Meteorological Instruments|first=Robert P.|last=Multhauf|journal=United States National Museum Bulletin|date=1961}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Wren experimented on muscle functionality, hypothesizing that the swelling and shrinking of muscles might proceed from a fermentative motion arising from the mixture of two heterogeneous fluids. Although this is incorrect, it was at least founded upon observation and may mark a new outlook on medicine: specialisation.\n\nAnother topic to which Wren contributed was [[optics]]. He published a description of an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors. Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution is a ruled surface. These results were published in 1669.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rstl.1669.0018|title = Generatio corporis cylindroidis hyperbolici, elaborandis lentibus hyperbolicis accommodati, auth.

[[Robert Hooke]] had theorised that planets, moving [[in vacuo]], describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, within the context of Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the [[Kepler's laws]] with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'', which was later to be expanded into the ''Principia''.<ref>[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness|Grattan-Guinness, Ivor]], ed.; ''Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics'', 1st ed., 2005, pp.&nbsp;64\u201365</ref>\n\nMentioned above are only a few of Wren's scientific works. He also studied other areas, ranging from agriculture, [[ballistics]], water and freezing, light and refraction, to name only a few. [[Thomas Birch]]'s ''History of the Royal Society'' (1756\u201357) is one of the most important sources of our knowledge not only of the origins of the Society, but also the day-to-day running of the Society. It is in these records that most of Wren's known scientific works are recorded.\n\n==Architectural career==\n\nIn Wren's age, the profession of architect as understood today did not exist. Since the early years of the 17th century it was not unusual for well-educated young men (''virtuosi'') to take up architecture as a gentlemanly activity, a pursuit widely accepted as a branch of applied mathematics. This is implicit in the writings of [[Vitruvius]] and explicit in such 16th century authors as [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]. When Wren was a student at Oxford, he became familiar with Vitruvius' ''De architectura'' and absorbed intuitively the fundamentals of architectural design. In 1668, building work began on Wren\u2019s designs for Emmanuel College Chapel in Cambridge and the Garden Quadrangle in Trinity College in Oxford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=776}}</ref> In English Medieval tradition, buildings had been constructed to the needs of the patron and the suggestions of building professionals, such as master carpenters or master bricklayers.\n\nThrough the Royal Society and his use of optics, the King noticed Wren's works. In 1661 he was approached by his cousin Matthew with a royal commission, as \"one of the best Geometers in Europe\", to direct the re-fortification of [[Tangier]]. Wren excused himself on grounds of health. Although this invitation may have arisen from Charles II's casual opportunism in matching people to tasks, Wren is believed to have been already on the way to practice as an architect. Before the end of 1661 Wren was unofficially advising on the repair of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] after two decades of its neglect and distress; his architectural interests were also evident to his associates at the time. Two years later, he set out on his only foreign journey, to Paris and the [[\u00cele-de-France]], during which he undertook the first-hand study of modern design and construction.\n\nBy this time, Wren had mastered and thoroughly understood the principles of architecture. Unlike several of his colleagues, who regarded it as a set of rules and formulas for design, he had acquired, understood, and exploited the necessary combination of reason and intuition, experience and imagination.<ref>''Sir Christopher Wren: Natural Cause of Beauty''</ref>\n\nWren's first architectural project was the chapel of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] in Cambridge, which his uncle [[Matthew Wren]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], asked him to design in 1663. The second was the design of the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in [[Oxford]], completed in 1668. This, the gift of Archbishop [[Gilbert Sheldon|Sheldon]] to his old university, was influenced by the form of the ancient [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, thus achieving a combination of classical and modern empirical design.\n\n===St Paul's Cathedral===\n[[File:P623 Christopher Wren's Plan for Rebuilding London after Great Fire of 1666.jpg|thumb|left|Wren's plan for rebuilding after the [[Great Fire of London]]]]\n[[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] has always been the highlight of Wren's reputation. His association with it spans his whole architectural career, including the 36 years between the start of the new building and the declaration by parliament of its completion in 1711.\n\nWren had been involved in repairs of the old cathedral since 1661. In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London]] reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to a ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September he ascertained the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1666. In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed.\n[[File:St Paul's - the Greek Cross design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's [[Greek Cross]] design for St Paul's.]]\n\nIt was not until 1670 that the pace of rebuilding started accelerating. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1670|second rebuilding act]] was passed that year, raising the tax on coal and thus providing a source of funds for rebuilding of churches destroyed within the [[City of London]]. Wren presented his initial \"First Model\" for St Paul's. This plan was accepted, and demolition of the old cathedral began. By 1672, however, this design seemed too modest, and Wren met his critics by producing a design of spectacular grandeur. This modified design, called \"Great Model\", was accepted by the King and the construction started in November 1673. However, this design failed to satisfy the [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] and clerical opinion generally; moreover, it had an economic drawback. Wren was confined to a \"cathedral form\" desired by the clergy. In 1674 he produced the rather meagre Classical-Gothic compromise known as the Warrant Design. However, this design, called so from the royal warrant of 14 May 1675 attached to the drawings, is not the design upon which work had begun a few weeks before.\n[[File:St Paul's - the final design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's cathedral as built.]]\n\nThe cathedral that Wren started to build bears only a slight resemblance to the Warrant Design. In 1697, the first service was held in the cathedral when Wren was 65. There was still, however, no dome. Finally in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] had withheld for 14 years since 1697. The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a [[balustrade]] around the proof line. This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt [[Parthian shot|parthian comment]] that \"ladies think nothing well without an edging\".<ref>Bolton and Hendry, eds., ''The Wren Society'', 20 vols.</ref>\n\n===Major architectural works in the 1670s and 1680s===\n[[File:Hampton Court 02.jpg|thumb|[[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131702)]]\nDuring the 1670s Wren received significant secular commissions which manifest both the maturity and the variety of his architecture and the sensitivity of his response to diverse briefs.\n\nAmong many of his remarkable designs at this time, the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|monument]] (1671\u201376)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> commemorating the Great Fire also involved [[Robert Hooke]], but Wren was in control of the final design, the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] (1675\u201376),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\">{{harvnb|Downes|1988|p=131}}</ref> and the [[Wren Library]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1676\u201384)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> were the most important ones.\n\n[[File:WrenLibraryCambridge.jpg|thumb|[[Wren Library]], Trinity College, Cambridge University]]\n\nIn 1682, Wren advised that the original statues of the King's Beasts on [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel, Windsor]] be removed. The pinnacles were left bare until 1925, when replica statues were installed.<ref>{{cite book|last=London|first=H. Stanford|title=The Queen's Beasts|publisher=Newman Neame|date=1953|page=15}}</ref>\n\nBy historical accident, all Wren's large-scale secular commissions dated from after the 1680s. At the age of 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, was ready for a monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relates both to the whole and to the people who used them. The first large project Wren designed, the [[Chelsea Hospital]] (1682\u201392),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfills its original function. The reconstruction of the state room at [[Windsor Castle]] was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting. This commission was in the hand of [[Hugh May]], who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works.\n\nBetween 1683 and 1685 he was much occupied in designing the [[King's House, Winchester]], where Charles II had hoped to spend his declining years, but which was never completed. When Wren promised that it would be complete within a year the King, who was conscious of his mortality, replied that \" a year is a great time in my life\".\n\nAfter the death of Charles II in 1685, Wren's attention was directed mainly to [[Whitehall]] (1685\u201387).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> The new king, [[James II of England|James II]], required a new chapel and also ordered a new gallery, council chamber and a riverside apartment for the [[Mary of Modena|Queen]]. Later, when James II was removed from the throne, Wren took on architectural projects such as [[Kensington Palace]] (1689\u201396)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and [[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131700).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/>\n\nThe erection of the present [[Windsor Guildhall]] was begun in 1687, under the direction of Sir [[Thomas Fitz]] (or Fiddes) but there is a story that on his death in 1689, the task was taken over by Sir Christopher Wren. It was completed at a cost of \u00a32687 - 1s - 6d. The new building was supported around its perimeter by stone columns, providing a covered area beneath as a venue for [[Corn exchange|corn markets]].\n\nThe story is widely told that the borough Council demanded that Wren should insert additional columns within the covered area, in order to support the weight of the heavy building above; Wren, however, was adamant that these were not necessary. Eventually the council insisted and, in due course, the extra supporting columns were built, but Wren made them slightly short, so that they do not quite touch the ceiling, hence proving his claim that they were not necessary. However, there is little evidence that Wren was ever involved in the design or construction of the Guildhall. It is now believed that the story grew out of Wren's connections with Windsor and that his son, also called Christopher Wren, who served as a [[Member of Parliament]] for Windsor, commissioned the statue of [[Prince George of Denmark]] in 1713 on the south end of the building and his name was engraved underneath. The pillars were probably moved into the cornmarket from the east side of the building when an extension was added in 1829.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Pamela |last1=Marson|first2=Brigitte |last2=Mitchell|title=Windsor Guildhall: History and Tour|year=2015|publisher=Friends of the Windsor & Royal Borough Museum|isbn=9780-9010-3309-3|page=7}}</ref> The gaps at the top of the pillars are now filled with tiles smaller than the capitals.\n\nWren did not pursue his work on architectural design as actively as he had before the 1690s, although he still played important roles in a number of royal commissions. In 1696 he was appointed Surveyor of [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Naval Hospital]],<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and in 1698 he was appointed [[Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey|Surveyor of Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jardine|2003|p=440}}</ref> He resigned the former role in 1716 but held the latter until his death, approving with a wavering signature<ref>Westminster Abbey Muniments</ref> [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]]'s revisions of Wren's own earlier designs for the great Archway of Westminster School.\n\n==Achievement and legacy==\n\nAt his death, Wren was 90 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]). Even the men he had trained and who owed much of their success to Wren's original and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were beginning to look past Wren's style. The [[Baroque]] school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back beyond him to [[Inigo Jones]]. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, but they could not forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral can be seen in the church of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve (now the [[Panth\u00e9on]]); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral|St Isaac's]] (1840\u201342) in [[Saint Petersburg]] to the [[United States Capitol|US Capitol]] at Washington, D.C. (1855\u201365).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649414/Sir-Christopher-Wren/8009/Concurrent-projects |title=Sir Christopher Wren (English architect) : Concurrent projects \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the potency of the influence of Wren's work on English architecture was reduced. The last major architect who admitted to being dependent on him was [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]],<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/edwin-lutyens From www.Answers.com re Lutyens]: ''Lutyens' Neo-Georgian work, which he jokingly referred to as his \"Wrennaissance Style\" (after the great English baroque architect Christopher Wren) is typified by the use of English baroque forms and details''.</ref> who died in 1944. With the purposeful elimination of historic influences from [[International Style (architecture)|international architecture in the early 20th century]], Wren's work gradually stopped being perceived as a mine of examples applicable to contemporary design.\n\n==Freemasonry==\n\nSince at least the 18th century, the Lodge of Antiquity No. 2, one of the four founding Masonic Lodges of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1717, has claimed Christopher Wren to have been its Master at the ''Goose and Gridiron'' at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] churchyard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |title=Manifesto of 1778 issued by The Lodge of Antiquity, formerly The Old Lodge of St Paul, &nbsp;to preserve the Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth |publisher=Lodgeroomus.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721114928/http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Whilst he was rebuilding the cathedral he is said to have been \"adopted\" on 18 May 1691 (that is, accepted as a sort of honorary member or patron, rather than an operative). Their 18th-century maul with its 1827 inscription claiming that it was used by Wren for the foundation stone of St. Paul's, belonging to the Lodge and on display in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, corroborates the story. [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]] made the claims in his widely circulated ''Constitutions'' while many of Wren's friends were still alive, but he made many highly creative claims as to the history or legends of Freemasonry. There is also a clear possibility of confusion between the operative workmen's lodges which might naturally have welcomed the boss, and the \"speculative\" or gentlemen's lodges which became highly fashionable just after Wren's death. By the standards of his time a gentleman like Wren would not generally join an artisan body{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}; however the workmen of St Paul's cathedral would naturally have sought the patronage or \"interest\" of their employer, and within Wren's lifetime there was a predominantly gentlemen's Lodge at the ''Rummer and Grapes'', a mile upriver at Westminster (where Wren had been to School).\n\nIn 1788, the Lodge of Antiquity thought they were buying a portrait of Wren which now dominates Lodge Room 10, in the same building as the Museum; but it is now identified with [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], not Wren. Nevertheless, this recorded event and many old records attest the fact that Antiquity thought that Wren had been its Master, at a time when it still held its minute books for the relevant years (which were lost by Preston at some date after 1778).\n\nThe evidence whether Wren was a speculative freemason is the subject of the Prestonian Lecture<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2011}}</ref> of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and [[Aubrey]]'s memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.\n\n==Trivia==\nAt one time Wren was credited with the design of the King's House at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]]. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings. Wren, who was not so tall, replied that \"They were high enough!\", at which the king crouched down until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted about saying, \"Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, I think they are high enough.\"<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Mark Noble (biographer)|first=Mark|last=Noble|title=Biographical History of England|url=https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog|date=1806|page=[https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog/page/n330 327]}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Wren appeared on the reverse of the first British [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|\u00a350 banknote]] (Series D) issued in modern time.
