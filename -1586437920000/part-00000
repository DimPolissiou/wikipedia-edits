As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.\n\nBut the other is the elder daughter of dark Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), and the son of Cronus  [i.e. [[Zeus]]] who sits above and dwells in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' (226\u2013232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:\n\n:And hateful Eris bore painful [[Ponos]] (\"Hardship\"),\n:[[Lethe]] (\"Forgetfulness\") and [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]] (\"Starvation\") and the tearful [[Algos|Algea]] (\"Pains\"),\n:[[Hysminai]] (\"Battles\"), [[Makhai]] (\"Wars\"), [[Phonoi]] (\"Murders\"), and [[Androctasiai|Androktasiai]] (\"Manslaughters\");\n:[[Neikea]] (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudea (\"Lies\"), Logoi (\"Stories\"), [[Amphillogiai]] (\"Disputes\")\n:[[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]] (\"Anarchy\") and [[At\u00eb|Ate]] (\"Ruin\"), near one another,\n:and [[Horkos]] (\"Oath\"), who most afflicts men on earth,\n:Then willing swears a false oath.<ref>Caldwell, p. 42 lines 226-232, with the meanings of the names (in parentheses), as given by Caldwell, p. 40 on lines 212&ndash;232.</ref>\n\n\nThe other Strife is presumably she who appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Book&nbsp;IV; equated with [[Enyo]] as sister of [[Ares]] and so presumably daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]:\n\n<blockquote>Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has [[Enyalius|a son whom she named Strife]].</blockquote>\n\nEnyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in Book 11, of the same work.\n\nThe most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the [[Trojan War]] by causing the [[Judgement of Paris]]. The goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been invited along with the rest of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]] to the forced wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], who would become the parents of [[Achilles]], but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.\n\nShe therefore (as mentioned at the ''[[Cypria|Kypria]]'' according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and [[Themis]]) tossed into the party the [[Apple of Discord]], a golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]] inscribed {{lang-grc|[[Kallisti|\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3]]|translit=t\u0113(i) kallist\u0113(i)}} &nbsp;\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"&nbsp;\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of [[Troy]], was appointed to select the fairest by [[Zeus]]. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris's decision, and also attempted to bribe him. [[Hera]] offered political power; [[Athena]] promised infinite wisdom; and [[Aphrodite]] tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta]]. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.\n\nIn [[Nonnus]]'s ''Dionysiaca'', 2.356, when [[Typhon]] prepares to battle with Zeus:\n\n<blockquote>Eris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mel\u00e9e, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (\"Victory\") led Zeus to battle.</blockquote>\n\nAnother story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of [[Polytekhnos]] and [[Aedon]]. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos's son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.\n\n==Cultural influences==\n===Discordianism===\n{{Main|Discordianism}}\nEris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] under the [[pen name]]s of \"[[Malaclypse the Younger]]\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation.\n\nA quote from the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear up the matter:\n\n{{quote|One day Mal-2 consulted his [[Pineal gland|Pineal Gland]] and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. \"They were,\" She added, \"victims of indigestion, you know.\"\n\nSuffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But she is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe [https://nombresdediosas.com/eris/ story of Eris] being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the ''Principia'', and is referred to as the [[Discordianism#The \"original snub\"|Original Snub]]. The ''Principia Discordia'' states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister [[Aneris]] (called the equivalent of [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/64.php |title=Page 57 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n\nDiscordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php|title=Principia Discordia - Page 49|website=www.principiadiscordia.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:\n\n{{Quote|text=I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe concept of Eris as developed by the ''Principia Discordia'' is used and expanded upon in the [[science fiction]] work ''[[The Illuminatus!

But she is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the ''Principia'', and is referred to as the [[Discordianism#The \"original snub\"|Original Snub]]. The ''Principia Discordia'' states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister [[Aneris]] (called the equivalent of [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/64.php |title=Page 57 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n\nDiscordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php|title=Principia Discordia - Page 49|website=www.principiadiscordia.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:\n\n{{Quote|text=I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe concept of Eris as developed by the ''Principia Discordia'' is used and expanded upon in the [[science fiction]] work ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (in which characters from ''Principia Discordia'' appear). In this work, Eris is a major character.<ref name=\"starship\">[http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm \"Robert Anton Wilson: Searching For Cosmic Intelligence\" by Jeffrey Elliot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614022635/http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm |date=June 14, 2006 }} Interview discussing novel (URL accessed 21 February 2006)</ref>\n\n===Other===\nThe classic [[fairy tale]] ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' is partly inspired by Eris's role in the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]].

[http://syngen.co.uk/ Synaptyclypse Generator]</ref>\n\nThe ''Principia Discordia'', if read literally, encourages the worship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], known in [[Latin]] as [[Discordia]], the goddess of disorder, or archetypes and ideals associated with her. Depending on the version of Discordianism, Eris might be considered the goddess exclusively of disorder or the goddess of disorder and chaos. Both views are supported by the ''Principia Discordia''. The ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic (order), the Eristic (disorder), and the notion that both are mere illusions. Due to these principles, a Discordian believes there is no distinction between order and disorder, since they are both man-made conceptual divisions of the pure element of chaos. An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is, chaos.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system,<ref>Rabinovitch, Shelly & Lewis, James.

[[Zeus]] believes that Eris is a troublemaker, so he does not invite her to [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]'s wedding. Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word ''kallisti'' ({{lang-grc|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7}}, to the prettiest one) inscribed in it. This, the [[Apple of Discord]], is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Holy Chao, and is traditionally described as being made of gold (although whether that gold was metallic or [[Acapulco Gold|Acapulco]] is noted as uncertain<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principia Discordia|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781387762668|location=|page=00018}}</ref>).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html|title=JUDGEMENT OF PARIS - Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref>\n\nSome recent interpretations of the original snub place Eris as being not at all mischievous with her delivery of the apple, but instead suggest that Eris was simply bringing the apple as a wedding present for Thetis. This interpretation would see Eris as innocent and her causing of chaos as a by-product of the other wedding guests' reaction upon seeing her at the wedding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scullion|first1=Sean|title=Liber Malorum - Children of the Apple|date=Nov 26, 2007|publisher=PagAnarchy Press|isbn=978-0955798405|page=375}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=Swiss, Tom |year= 2009|title= Tom Swiss: Eris and the so-called \"Apple of Discord\". |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtAEvbjr-o0}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n===Three core principles===\nThe ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic and Eristic principles representing order and disorder, and the notion that both are mere illusions. The following excerpt summarizes these principles:{{quote|text=The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.\n\nWith our concept-making apparatus called \"the brain\" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.\nThe ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled \"reality\" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see \"reality\" differently.\n\nIt is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.\nWe look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.\n\nWestern philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.\n\nDisorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like \"relation\", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is \"absence of female-ness\", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.\n\nThe belief that \"order is true\" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.\nThe point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.<ref>Malaclypse the Younger. ''Principia Discordia''. p. 49-50.</ref>}}\n\n=== Operation Mindfuck ===\n[[Operation Mindfuck]]{{Definition needed|date=February 2019}} is an important practice in the Discordian religion. The concept was developed by [[Kerry Thornley]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] in 1968<ref name=\"Gorightly\">{{cite book|last=Gorightly|first=Adam|title=The Beast of Adam Gorightly: Collected Rantings (1992-2004)|publisher=Virtualbookworm Publishing|year=2005|page=163|chapter=The Prankster or The Manchurian Candidate?|isbn=978-1-58939-781-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fH_R_iP3yQ8C|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref> and given its name by Wilson and [[Robert Shea]] in ''[[The Illuminatus!

It can be a singular noun by itself, meaning \"discord\", or, like ''principia'', be the plural of a noun \u2013 ''discordium'', also meaning \"discord\". In either case, the phrase consists of two juxtaposed nouns without a grammatical relationship.</ref>\n\n''Summa Universalia'' was another work by [[Malaclypse the Younger]], purported to be a summary of the universe.

[http://syngen.co.uk/ Synaptyclypse Generator]</ref>\n\nThe ''Principia Discordia'', if read literally, encourages the worship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], known in [[Latin]] as [[Discordia]], the goddess of disorder, or archetypes and ideals associated with her. Depending on the version of Discordianism, Eris might be considered the goddess exclusively of disorder or the goddess of disorder and chaos. Both views are supported by the ''Principia Discordia''. The ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic (order), the Eristic (disorder), and the notion that both are mere illusions. Due to these principles, a Discordian believes there is no distinction between order and disorder, since they are both man-made conceptual divisions of the pure element of chaos. An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is, chaos.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system,<ref>Rabinovitch, Shelly & Lewis, James.

The following excerpt summarizes these principles:{{quote|text=The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.\n\nWith our concept-making apparatus called \"the brain\" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.\nThe ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled \"reality\" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see \"reality\" differently.\n\nIt is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.\nWe look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.\n\nWestern philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.\n\nDisorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like \"relation\", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is \"absence of female-ness\", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.\n\nThe belief that \"order is true\" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.\nThe point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.<ref>Malaclypse the Younger. ''Principia Discordia''. p. 49-50.</ref>}}\n\n=== Operation Mindfuck ===\n[[Operation Mindfuck]]{{Definition needed|date=February 2019}} is an important practice in the Discordian religion.

It can be a singular noun by itself, meaning \"discord\", or, like ''principia'', be the plural of a noun \u2013 ''discordium'', also meaning \"discord\".
