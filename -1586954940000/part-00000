In the process, Hope runs into her old friend Landon, who is also Rafael's foster brother, but since the school for the supernatural is deemed to be too dangerous for humans, Landon is turned away. When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

The search uncovers another survivor of the bus explosion and while Alaric gets her to safety, Hope and Rafael find Landon, who swears he is not responsible for the bus, which Alaric corroborates when the woman starts breathing fire.

The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank to have acted as guarantor and to have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Dr. Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to a) establishment and financing of GrameenPhone, a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian government owned multinational Telenor by Dr Yunus, and b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Dr Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank.  The commission also examined the legal status of the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Dr. Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership.  The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Dr. Yunus.  Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Dr Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|title=Interim report of the Grameen Bank Commission|publisher=Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh|accessdate=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124442/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of ideas===\n{{see also|Impact of microcredit}}\nMicrofinance has been criticised in the foreign media.

The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank to have acted as guarantor and to have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Dr. Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to a) establishment and financing of GrameenPhone, a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian government owned multinational Telenor by Dr Yunus, and b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Dr Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank.  The commission also examined the legal status of the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Dr. Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership.  The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Dr. Yunus.  Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Dr Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|title=Interim report of the Grameen Bank Commission|publisher=Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh|accessdate=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124442/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of ideas===\n{{see also|Impact of microcredit}}\nMicrofinance has been criticised in the foreign media.

He and Adams also wrote the theme song \u201cThose Were the Days\u201d<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 ]</ref> for the television show ''[[All in the Family]]''. Strouse's songs have been heard on the radio throughout his career and have run the gamut from girl-band pop to hip hop. In 1958, his song \u201c[[Born Too Late (song)|Born Too Late]]\u201d was number seven on the Billboard charts, and in 1999 the quadruple platinum ''[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)]]'' by artist [[Jay-Z]] (which sampled \"It's The Hard Knock Life\" from ''Annie'') was the winner of a Grammy for Best Rap Album of the year & the Billboard R&B Album of the Year.\n\nStrouse's writing also extends into orchestral works, chamber music, piano concertos and opera. His ''Concerto America'', composed in 2002 to commemorate 9/11 and the spirit of New York City, premiered at The [[Boston Pops]] in 2002,<ref>Tommasini, Anthony.

In 1977, Strouse founded the ASCAP Musical Theatre Workshop in New York, through which many young composers and lyricists have found a forum for their work.\n\nA musical stage adaptation of the [[Paddy Chayefsky]] film ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' starring [[John C.
