The goal of the company is to increase the market share of Nissan and Mitsubishi in the kei car segment, which was about 15% at the time of company establishment to the target of 20%.\n\nAt the time of the establishment of NMKV, Nissan developed a successor of the Mitsubishi eK that was rebadged as Nissan Otti and planned to release it in the first half of 2013. The engine was newly developed. In March 6, 2013, the first jointly developed car, the third generation eK and the first generation Dayz was announced, and sales began in June of the same year.\n\nThe joint venture on the development of the third generation eK and Dayz has reduced costs by 30% compared to the predecessor model by procuring parts from outside Japan. In terms of vehicle design, one design proposal would include both Mitsubishi and Nissan front fascia designs. In addition, based on Mitsubishi's original engine [[Mitsubishi 3B2 engine|3B20 engine]], Nissan's technology was utilized to improve the [[compression ratio]] to 12:1 with regular gasoline specification. While the body panels are common parts, the several panels and bumpers are made differently. For joint development, Mitsubishi provided engines, manufacturing plants and development facilities to reduce costs, and Nissan provided safety equipment technologies that Mitsubishi does not have. In addition, the cost of procurement has been reduced for the Nissan side compared to the conventional OEM agreement (rebadge), and the fact that NMKV joint venture also solved the problem that Mitsubishi Motors could not generate the development cost alone.\n\nAs of June 2013, the development team had a total of 4 people. Each 2 people were from Nissan and Mitsubishi, and a total of 18 people in charge of development, 16 from Mitsubishi and 2 from Nissan.\n\nWhen the third generation eK Days was announced, both companies announced that it would jointly develop a super height wagon kei car as the second model. On March 25 of the same year, Nissan announced that the name of the car would be Dayz Roox, alongside an announcement of the design sketch. On October 3, Mitsubishi also announced that it would name the car as the eK space. Both cars went on sale on February 13, 2014.\n\nIn June 2013, Mitsubishi announced a policy to unify the future mini vehicle development with NMKV.\n\nNMKV stands for Nissan Mitsubishi Kei Vehicle.

The goal of the company is to increase the market share of Nissan and Mitsubishi in the kei car segment, which was about 15% at the time of company establishment to the target of 20%.\n\nAt the time of the establishment of NMKV, Nissan developed a successor of the Mitsubishi eK that was rebadged as Nissan Otti and planned to release it in the first half of 2013. The engine was newly developed. In March 6, 2013, the first jointly developed car, the third generation eK and the first generation Dayz was announced, and sales began in June of the same year.\n\nThe joint venture on the development of the third generation eK and Dayz has reduced costs by 30% compared to the predecessor model by procuring parts from outside Japan. In terms of vehicle design, one design proposal would include both Mitsubishi and Nissan front fascia designs. In addition, based on Mitsubishi's original engine [[Mitsubishi 3B2 engine|3B20 engine]], Nissan's technology was utilized to improve the [[compression ratio]] to 12:1 with regular gasoline specification. While the body panels are common parts, the several panels and bumpers are made differently. For joint development, Mitsubishi provided engines, manufacturing plants and development facilities to reduce costs, and Nissan provided safety equipment technologies that Mitsubishi does not have. In addition, the cost of procurement has been reduced for the Nissan side compared to the conventional OEM agreement (rebadge), and the fact that NMKV joint venture also solved the problem that Mitsubishi Motors could not generate the development cost alone.\n\nAs of June 2013, the development team had a total of 4 people. Each 2 people were from Nissan and Mitsubishi, and a total of 18 people in charge of development, 16 from Mitsubishi and 2 from Nissan.\n\nWhen the third generation eK Days was announced, both companies announced that it would jointly develop a super height wagon kei car as the second model. On March 25 of the same year, Nissan announced that the name of the car would be Dayz Roox, alongside an announcement of the design sketch. On October 3, Mitsubishi also announced that it would name the car as the eK space. Both cars went on sale on February 13, 2014.\n\nIn June 2013, Mitsubishi announced a policy to unify the future mini vehicle development with NMKV.\n\nNMKV stands for Nissan Mitsubishi Kei Vehicle. Despite that, the abbreviation was never announced officially by the company.\n\nNMKV have not started the development of light commercial vehicles in the kei car segment, as Nissan and Mitsubishi is still rebadging the Suzuki Carry and Suzuki Every.\n\nIn April 2016, MMC admitted that its employees had falsified [[fuel efficiency]] data for the eK Wagon, eK Space, Nissan Dayz and Nissan Dayz Roox. The resultant scandal culminated in Nissan acquiring a controlling interest in MMC the following month.<ref>[http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0002942202 \"Nissan to place MMC under its umbrella\"], The Japan News, May 12, 2016</ref>\n\n==Reference==\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, addeduncategorisedtags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMKV"}

Originally a major boys' public school in the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], it is now co-educational, enrolling pupils at 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board.\n\n== History ==\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed but re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. It was designed by former pupil [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'' this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold-War austerity. [[Stuart Westley]], Master of Haileybury until July 2009, was responsible for making the school fully co-educational.<ref>''The Times'', Obituaries, July 2006</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nHaileybury serves as a co-educational school for 11- to 18-year-olds.  Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield. The [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] Theatre functions as a modern auditorium with a fully equipped stage and back-stage. In 1997 the college chapel [[Pipe organ|organ]] was re-built by [[Klais Orgelbau|Klais]].\n\n==Sport==\nHaileybury is traditionally strong in [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] and retains honours boards with every rugby and cricket first team since 1863. Sports for girls include hockey, netball, lacrosse, tennis and cricket, with newly developed teams in football and rugby union. In addition to rugby and cricket, boys play hockey, football and tennis. Boys and girls represent the school in athletics, squash, swimming, [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]], cross country, badminton, biathlon, basketball, rowing and sailing.\n\n==Related schools==\n=== Haileybury Almaty ===\n{{main|Haileybury Almaty}}\nIn 2006/2007, Haileybury advised on the building of a Haileybury in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] where all English GCSEs are taught and the curriculum is taught similarly under the guidance of Haileybury. The school, opened in September 2008, is known as Haileybury Almaty.\n\nThe pupils are made up mostly of Kazakhstan citizens. They are all required to speak English. Academic year 2010\u201311 saw the first batch of pupils pass their IGCSE exams. Since August 2011, Haileybury Almaty has opened a [[Sixth form|6th form]]. In 2016, 11 pupils graduated from the 6th form with one getting admission to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College, Cambridge University]], and 6 securing places in [[University College London|University College, London]] (UCL). A second school, in the Kazakhstan capital [[Astana]], was opened in September 2011.<ref>\n{{cite news \n | title = UK public school for Kazakhstan\n | publisher = [[BBC]]\n | date = 25 January 2007\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6297881.stm\n | accessdate = 12 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Haileybury Astana ===\n{{main|Haileybury Astana}}\nFollowing the foundation of Haileybury Almaty, a sister school was opened in 2008 in [[Astana]], the capital city of [[Kazakhstan]]. Haileybury Astana provides education for boys and girls from the two to eighteen years of age under the leadership of Jonathan Ullmer MBE. It is an [[IB World School]] and also operates the [[International Primary Curriculum]] (IPC).\n\nThe School has grown rapidly since it was opened by the [[President of Kazakhstan]]. In 2017, the new IB Centre was opened by the Minister of Education. By 2018, the school had close to 650 pupils.\n\n=== Haileybury Turnford ===\n{{main|Haileybury Turnford}}\nIn September 2015, Turnford School in [[Turnford, Hertfordshire|Turnford]], Hertfordshire converted to [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] and was renamed Haileybury Turnford.

Originally a major boys' [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], it is now co-educational, enrolling pupils at 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board.\n\n== History ==\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed but re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. It was designed by former pupil [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'' this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold-War austerity. [[Stuart Westley]], Master of Haileybury until July 2009, was responsible for making the school fully co-educational.<ref>''The Times'', Obituaries, July 2006</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nHaileybury serves as a co-educational school for 11- to 18-year-olds.  Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield. The [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] Theatre functions as a modern auditorium with a fully equipped stage and back-stage. In 1997 the college chapel [[Pipe organ|organ]] was re-built by [[Klais Orgelbau|Klais]].\n\n==Sport==\nHaileybury is traditionally strong in [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] and retains honours boards with every rugby and cricket first team since 1863. Sports for girls include hockey, netball, lacrosse, tennis and cricket, with newly developed teams in football and rugby union. In addition to rugby and cricket, boys play hockey, football and tennis. Boys and girls represent the school in athletics, squash, swimming, [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]], cross country, badminton, biathlon, basketball, rowing and sailing.\n\n==Related schools==\n=== Haileybury Almaty ===\n{{main|Haileybury Almaty}}\nIn 2006/2007, Haileybury advised on the building of a Haileybury in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] where all English GCSEs are taught and the curriculum is taught similarly under the guidance of Haileybury. The school, opened in September 2008, is known as Haileybury Almaty.\n\nThe pupils are made up mostly of Kazakhstan citizens. They are all required to speak English. Academic year 2010\u201311 saw the first batch of pupils pass their IGCSE exams. Since August 2011, Haileybury Almaty has opened a [[Sixth form|6th form]]. In 2016, 11 pupils graduated from the 6th form with one getting admission to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College, Cambridge University]], and 6 securing places in [[University College London|University College, London]] (UCL). A second school, in the Kazakhstan capital [[Astana]], was opened in September 2011.<ref>\n{{cite news \n | title = UK public school for Kazakhstan\n | publisher = [[BBC]]\n | date = 25 January 2007\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6297881.stm\n | accessdate = 12 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Haileybury Astana ===\n{{main|Haileybury Astana}}\nFollowing the foundation of Haileybury Almaty, a sister school was opened in 2008 in [[Astana]], the capital city of [[Kazakhstan]]. Haileybury Astana provides education for boys and girls from the two to eighteen years of age under the leadership of Jonathan Ullmer MBE. It is an [[IB World School]] and also operates the [[International Primary Curriculum]] (IPC).\n\nThe School has grown rapidly since it was opened by the [[President of Kazakhstan]]. In 2017, the new IB Centre was opened by the Minister of Education. By 2018, the school had close to 650 pupils.\n\n=== Haileybury Turnford ===\n{{main|Haileybury Turnford}}\nIn September 2015, Turnford School in [[Turnford, Hertfordshire|Turnford]], Hertfordshire converted to [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] and was renamed Haileybury Turnford.

Left to right: Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Taiwanese Traditional Chinese.]]\n\nIn [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], '''CJK''' is a collective term for the [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] languages, all of which include [[Chinese characters]] and derivatives (collectively, '''CJK characters''') in their writing systems, sometimes paired with other scripts. Occasionally, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is included, making the abbreviation '''CJKV''', since Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters as well. Collectively, the CJKV characters often include ''[[h\u00e0nz\u00ec]]'' in [[Written Chinese|Chinese]], ''[[kanji]]'', ''[[kana]]'' in [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], ''[[hanja]]'', ''[[hangul]]'' in [[Korean language#Writing system|Korean]], and ''[[h\u00e1n t\u1ef1]]'' or ''[[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]]'' in [[Vietnamese language#Writing system|Vietnamese]].\n\n== Character repertoire ==\nStandard Mandarin Chinese and Standard Cantonese are written almost exclusively in Chinese characters. It requires over 3,000 characters for general [[literacy]], but up to 40,000 characters for reasonably complete coverage. Japanese uses fewer characters\u2014general literacy in Japanese can be expected with 2,136 characters. The use of Chinese characters in Korea is becoming increasingly rare, although idiosyncratic use of Chinese characters in proper names requires knowledge (and therefore availability) of many more characters.  However, even today, students in South Korea are taught 1,800 characters.\n\nOther scripts used for these languages, such as [[bopomofo]] and the [[Latin script|Latin]]-based [[pinyin]] for Chinese, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] for Japanese, and [[hangul]] for Korean, are not strictly \"CJK characters\", although CJK character sets almost invariably include them as necessary for full coverage of the target languages.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, [[Classical Chinese]] was the written language of government and scholarship in Vietnam. Popular literature in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was written in the ''[[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]]'' script, consisting of borrowed Chinese characters together with many characters created locally. By the end of the 1920s, both scripts had been replaced by writing in Vietnamese using the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=113\u2013115}}{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1997}}\n\nThe [[Sinology|sinologist]] Carl Leban (1971) produced an early survey of CJK encoding systems.\n\n== Encoding ==\nThe number of characters required for complete coverage of all these languages' needs cannot fit in the 256-character code space of 8-bit [[character encoding]]s, requiring at least a 16-bit fixed width encoding or multi-byte variable-length encodings.

Left to right: Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Taiwanese Traditional Chinese.]]\n\nIn [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], '''CJK''' is a collective term for the [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] languages, all of which include [[Chinese characters]] and derivatives (collectively, '''CJK characters''') in their writing systems, sometimes paired with other scripts. Occasionally, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is included, making the abbreviation '''CJKV''', since Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters as well. Collectively, the CJKV characters often include ''[[h\u00e0nz\u00ec]]'' in [[Written Chinese|Chinese]], ''[[kanji]]'', ''[[kana]]'' in [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], ''[[hanja]]'', ''[[hangul]]'' in [[Korean language#Writing system|Korean]], and ''[[h\u00e1n t\u1ef1]]'' or ''[[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]]'' in [[Vietnamese language#Writing system|Vietnamese]].\n\n== Character repertoire ==\nStandard Mandarin Chinese and Standard Cantonese are written almost exclusively in Chinese characters. It requires over 3,000 characters for general [[literacy]], but up to 40,000 characters for reasonably complete coverage. Japanese uses fewer characters\u2014general literacy in Japanese can be expected with 2,136 characters. The use of Chinese characters in Korea is becoming increasingly rare, although idiosyncratic use of Chinese characters in proper names requires knowledge (and therefore availability) of many more characters.  However, even today, students in South Korea are taught 1,800 characters.\n\nOther scripts used for these languages, such as [[bopomofo]] and the [[Latin script|Latin]]-based [[pinyin]] for Chinese, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] for Japanese, and [[hangul]] for Korean, are not strictly \"CJK characters\", although CJK character sets almost invariably include them as necessary for full coverage of the target languages.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, [[Classical Chinese]] was the written language of government and scholarship in Vietnam. Popular literature in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was written in the ''[[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]]'' script, consisting of borrowed Chinese characters together with many characters created locally. By the end of the 1920s, both scripts had been replaced by writing in Vietnamese using the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=113\u2013115}}{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1997}}\n\nThe [[Sinology|sinologist]] Carl Leban (1971) produced an early survey of CJK encoding systems.\n\n== Encoding ==\nThe number of characters required for complete coverage of all these languages' needs cannot fit in the 256-character code space of 8-bit [[character encoding]]s, requiring at least a 16-bit fixed width encoding or multi-byte variable-length encodings. The 16-bit fixed width encodings, such as those from [[Unicode]] up to and including version 2.0, are now deprecated due to the requirement to encode more characters than a 16-bit encoding can accommodate\u2014Unicode 5.0 has some 70,000 Han characters\u2014and the requirement by the Chinese government that software in China support the [[GB 18030]] character set.\n\nAlthough CJK encodings have common character sets, the encodings often used to represent them have been developed separately by different East Asian governments and software companies, and are mutually incompatible.

And he would have done it with that sort of interior satisfaction that springs from virtue.\"<ref name=FMA />\n\nFollowing his encounters with Jean Valjean during the [[June Rebellion]], in which he is first spared by Valjean and, later, spares him arrest, Javert experiences a deep torment caused by the compromise of his previous worldview. Where previously he has \"never in his life known anything but one straight line\", the kind behavior of Valjean compels him to see two: \"both equal straight\", and \"contradictory\". The profound confusion caused by this\u2014by the realization that the law is not infallible, that he himself is not irreproachable, and that there exists a superior force (identified by Hugo with God) to what he has known\u2014plunges him into such a despair that he commits suicide.<ref name=FMA />\n\nThe character of Javert is loosely based on [[Eug\u00e8ne Fran\u00e7ois Vidocq]], a criminal and adventurer who became a police official (though Vidocq wrote that he never arrested anyone who stole out of need).<ref>E.

Cricket House, p.135.</ref>\n\n== In the novel ==\n\n=== Part One: Fantine ===\nJavert first becomes familiar with the convict Jean Valjean as an assistant guard in the [[Bagne of Toulon]]. Years later, in 1823, Valjean is living under the name Monsieur Madeleine and serving as the mayor of a small town identified only as [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]], where he is a successful manufacturer. Javert arrived in 1820 to serve as an inspector with the local police. Javert suspects Madeleine's true identity and becomes convinced of it when he watches Madeleine demonstrate extraordinary strength by lifting a loaded cart off of a man trapped beneath it. Madeleine also antagonizes Javert by dismissing his attempt to arrest [[Fantine]], a prostitute detained for having a violent row with a street idler. Javert decides to denounce Valjean as an ex-convict, but learns from Parisian authorities that they have already arrested someone who calls himself Champmathieu whom they believe is really Valjean and whom several former convicts have already identified as Valjean.\n\nUnsure, Javert goes to [[Arras]] to see Champmathieu and satisfies himself that this is the real Valjean. He returns and visits Madeleine and asks him to dismiss him from the police because he \"has failed in respect, and in the gravest manner, towards a magistrate\" by suspecting Madeleine. He tells Madeleine: \"You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that does not suffice. Handing in one's resignation is honorable. I have failed in my duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.\" He condemns himself at length\u2014\"if I were not severe towards myself, all the justice that I have done would become injustice\"\u2014and begs to be dismissed.\n\nMadeleine/Valjean travels to the court in Arras, discloses his identity, and saves Champmathieu. He returns to Montreuil-sur-Mer, where Javert arrests him the next morning at Fantine's hospital bedside. Valjean asks for three days to bring Fantine's daughter [[Cosette]] to her, but Javert denies his request. Valjean escapes from the city jail, is later recaptured and returned to the galleys, and escapes a few months later, though the authorities think he has drowned.\n\n=== Part Two: Cosette ===\nJavert is recruited to be an inspector in the capital. Javert is informed of Valjean's presumed death (which the latter had feigned during his last escape) not long after it happens. Early in the year 1824, Javert hears of an alleged kidnapping: a foster child taken from the couple that kept her. When he hears that this is supposed to have taken place in Montfermeil (Valjean was captured just as he was trying to get there), he visits the Th\u00e9nardiers. Th\u00e9nardier, however, does not want to become involved with the police, and tells Javert that the girl was fetched by her grandfather, and that he saw the man's passport. In March of the same year, Javert hears of a man nicknamed \"the beggar who gives alms.\" Curious, he tracks the man to the Gorbeau House tenement, and recognizes Jean Valjean. When Valjean attempts to escape with Cosette, Javert chases them into what seems to him a dead end. Valjean evades capture by climbing over the stone wall of a convent and pulling Cosette up over the wall on a rope.\n\n=== Part Three: Marius ===\nIn 1832, Javert chances to meet Valjean once more while leading a squad of policemen in the capture of a gang which had been terrorizing Paris for years: [[Patron-Minette]]. The Th\u00e9nardiers, who have lost their inn, now live at Gorbeau House and are associated with the gang. Unbeknownst to Javert, the venerable elderly gentleman whom the Th\u00e9nardiers and Patron-Minette intend to extort is Jean Valjean. When [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]] overhears the plans for capturing Valjean, he informs the police of the imminent crime, and is introduced to inspector Javert, who gives him two pistols to fire a signal for when he and his team should enter the building. Javert does not have the opportunity to recognize Valjean upon saving him from the gang; however, Valjean recognizes Javert almost immediately and makes a quick escape out the window of the attic where the confrontation was taking place.\n\n=== Part Four: St. Denis ===\nDuring the [[1832 June Rebellion]], Javert, working undercover to gather information about the revolutionaries, joins a group of them at the barricade they have erected in the rue de la Chanvrerie. [[Gavroche]], a street urchin, recognizes him as a policeman and denounces him. They find on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with this motto: Supervision and vigilance, and on the other this note: \"JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two,\" and the signature of the Prefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet. The revolutionaries imprison him.\n\nWhen Valjean appears at the barricade with the intent of finding [[Marius Pontmercy|Marius]], the beloved of his adopted daughter, Javert and he recognize one another.\n\nValjean requests, as reward for protecting the barricade from soldiers and national guardsmen, that he be allowed to execute Javert. Enjolras, the leader of the insurrection, acquiesces, and Valjean leads Javert away from the barricade and into a side street. There, instead of killing Javert, Valjean cuts his bonds and implores him to run and save himself. He also gives Javert his address, in the unlikely case that he survives the uprising. Valjean then fires a shot into the air and returns to the barricade, where he tells everyone that the policeman is dead.\n\nAs the army storms the barricade, Valjean manages to grab the badly wounded Marius and dives into a sewer, where he wanders with Marius on his shoulders, despairing of finding an exit. A stroke of luck brings him face to face with [[Th\u00e9nardier]]. In the dark and muck of the sewer, neither party recognizes the other. Th\u00e9nardier assumes that Valjean is a robber who had just killed a well-to-do young man, and he offers to let Valjean out of the sewer if Valjean splits the loot found on Marius' person in half. Valjean pays him, and Th\u00e9nardier opens for him a sewer grate with a stolen government-issued key.\n\nValjean's joy at finally being out of the sewer does not last long. Valjean notices that he is observed by a tall figure, which is revealed to be Javert. Valjean repeats that he is ready to surrender, but he asks for Javert's help in delivering the wounded boy to safety. They travel to Valjean's house, and Javert says that he will wait for Valjean to come back downstairs. However, when Valjean looks out of the window, Javert is gone.\n\nJavert wanders the streets in emotional turmoil: his mind simply cannot reconcile the image he had carried through the years of Valjean as a brutal ex-convict with his acts of kindness on the barricades. Now, Javert can be justified neither in letting Valjean go nor in arresting him. For the first time in his life, Javert is faced with the situation where he cannot act ''lawfully'' without acting ''immorally'', and vice versa. Javert is unable to find a solution to this dilemma, and horrified at the sudden realization that Valjean was simultaneously a criminal and a good person \u2014 a conundrum which reveals deep flaws in his ethical system, and suggests to him the existence of a superior moral system. He feels that the only possible resolution for himself is in death, and\u2014after leaving for the prefect of police a brief letter addressing lapses in the Conciergerie \u2014 he drowns himself in the river [[Seine]].\n\n== Adaptations ==\n{{Main|Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\nSince the original publication of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in 1862, the character of Javert has appeared in a large number of adaptations in numerous types of media based on the novel, including [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Books|books]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Film|films]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014451/|title=Javert (Character) |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Musical|musicals]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plays|plays]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Games|games]], and web-comics.\n\n===Musical===\n{{See also|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables|Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)#Synopsis|l1=Synopsis of the musical}}\nIn the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|stage musical of the same name]], Javert is a central character.

Years later, in 1823, Valjean is living under the name Monsieur Madeleine and serving as the mayor of a small town identified only as [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]], where he is a successful manufacturer.

He feels that the only possible resolution for himself is in death, and\u2014after leaving for the prefect of police a brief letter addressing lapses in the Conciergerie \u2014 he drowns himself in the river [[Seine]].\n\n== Adaptations ==\n{{Main|Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\nSince the original publication of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in 1862, the character of Javert has appeared in a large number of adaptations in numerous types of media based on the novel, including [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Books|books]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Film|films]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014451/|title=Javert (Character) |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Musical|musicals]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Plays|plays]], [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables#Games|games]], and web-comics.\n\n===Musical===\n{{See also|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables|Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)#Synopsis|l1=Synopsis of the musical}}\nIn the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|stage musical of the same name]], Javert is a central character.

Yet, it is only within the past decade that the prevalence and ramifications of this practice have risen to international prominence, due to a dramatic increase in research and public action. Limited research has not yet identified all causes of child trafficking, however, it appears that poverty, humanitarian crisis, and lack of education contribute to high rates. A variety of potential solutions have accordingly been suggested and implemented, which can be categorized as four types of action: broad protection, prevention, law enforcement, and victim assistance.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/><ref name=\"Bianca Daw\"/>\n\nThe main international documents dealing with the trafficking of children are the 1989 UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the 1999 ILO [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]], and the 2000 UN [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children]].\n\n== Definition ==\nThe first major international instrument dealing with the trafficking of children is part of the 2000 UN [[Palermo protocols]], titled the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Article 3(a) of this document defines child trafficking as the \"recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and/or receipt\" of a child for the purpose of exploitation.<ref name=\"United Nations 2000\"/> The definition for child trafficking given here applies only to cases of trafficking that are transnational and/or involve organized criminal groups; in spite of this, child trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\">{{cite book |author1=ILO |author2=UNICEF |author3=UN.GIFT |author-link1=International Labour Organization |author-link2=UNICEF |author-link3=United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking |title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation \u2013 Textbook 1: Understanding Child Trafficking |year=2009 |url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/Textbook_1.pdf |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref> The ILO expands upon this definition by asserting that movement and exploitation are key aspects of child trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> The definition of \"child\" used here is that listed in the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which states, \"a child means every human being below the age of 18 years, unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.\"<ref name=\"United Nations 1989\">{{cite web |publisher=United Nations |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |year=1989 |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archive-date=June 11, 2010}}</ref> The distinction outlined in this definition is important, because some countries have chosen to set the \"age of majority\" lower than 18, thus influencing what exactly legally constitutes child trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n=== Related legal instruments ===\nMany international, regional, and national instruments deal with the trafficking of children.

Anti-trafficking legislation has been lauded as critical by the [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]], because it ensures that traffickers and trafficking victims are treated accordingly: for example, \"if migration laws are used to pursue traffickers, it is often the case that the victims too are prosecuted as illegal migrants, whereas if there is a specific category of 'trafficker' and 'trafficked person,' then it is more likely that the victim will be treated as such.\"<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> The existence of national laws regarding child trafficking also enables trafficking victims and/or their families to take appropriate civil action.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n== Types of child trafficking ==\nThe intended or actual after-sale use of the child is not always known.\n\n=== Forced labour ===\n{{see also|Child labour}}\nThe objective of child trafficking is often forced child labour.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Child labour refers specifically to children under a stipulated minimum age, usually 14 at the lowest, being required to work.<ref name=\"min age conv 1973\"/> [[UNICEF]] estimates that, in 2011, 150 million children aged 5\u201314 in developing countries were involved in child labour.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=UNICEF |title=State of the World's Children 2011: Adolescence, an Age of Opportunity |year=2011 |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc2011/pdfs/SOWC-2011-Main-Report_EN_02092011.pdf |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> Additionally, UNICEF states that current rates indicate that at least 100 million children will still be forced to work by 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_child_labour.html|title=Child labour|website=UNICEF|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> Within this number, the ILO reports that 60% of child workers work in agriculture.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\">{{cite web |publisher=ILO |title=Fast Facts on Child Labour |year=2010 |url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_126685.pdf |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> A comparative study between domestic child labor rates in urban and rural regions in sub-Saharan Africa reveals that 84.3% of child labourers are working in the rural sector. 99.8% of children age five to fourteen are engaged in child labor for some form of economic activity in these regions.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Adonteng-Kissi|first=Obed|date=October 2018|title=Parental perceptions of child labour and human rights: A comparative study of rural and urban Ghana|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|volume=84|pages=34\u201344|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.07.017|pmid=30041057|issn=0145-2134}}</ref> The ILO also estimates that 115 million children are engaged in hazardous work, such as the sex or drug trade.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\"/> Overall, child labor can take many forms, including domestic servitude, work in agriculture, service, and manufacturing industries. Also, according to several researchers, most children are forced into cheap and controllable labor, and work in homes, farms, factories, restaurants, and much more.{{sfnm |1a1=Beyrer |1y=2004 |1p=16 |2a1=Gozdziak |2a2=MacDonnell |2y=2007 |2p=171 |3a1=Vinkovic |3y=2010 |3p=88}} Children are cheap labor and additionally are able to complete jobs that adults cannot due to their size. One example for this is within the fishing industry in Ghana. Children can release fish easier from nets due to their small hands. Thereby their services are highly demanded and child labor remains a present consequence of child trafficking. Trafficked children may be sexually exploited, used in the armed forces and drug trades, and in child begging.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In terms of global trends, the ILO estimates that in 2004\u20132008, there was a 3% reduction in the incidence of child labor; this stands in contrast to a previous ILO report which found that in 2000\u20132004, there was a 10% reduction in child labor.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\"/> The ILO contends that, globally, child labour is slowly declining, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of child workers has remained relatively constant: 1 in 4 children aged 5\u201317 work in this region.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\"/> In 2018 UNICEF reported that 31% of total [[Child labour in Africa|child labor]] is located in West Africa. In this region, one in six children between the ages of six and fourteen is working. The report additionally finds that 43% of child labor in Sub-Saharan Africa is due to child migration and trafficking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-labour/|title=Child Labour|last=UNICEF|date=October 2019|website=UNICEF data|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Another major global trend concerns the number of child laborers in the 15-17 age group: in the past five years, a 20% increase in the number of these child workers has been reported.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\"/> A surprising example occurred in the United States as McCabe indicates that in the 1990s, huge companies such as Gap and Nike were using industry \"sweatshops\" that used trafficked children to make their desired products.<ref>{{cite news |last=McCabe |first=K.A. |year=2008 |title=In the Trafficking of Persons |location=New York |publisher=Petter Lang |page=81}}</ref> After further investigation of the child labor scandal the hazardous work conditions of the GAP company factories were exposed. Children were working in run-down and dangerous factories, were victims of abuse and got paid far below minimum wage. In the years that followed similar scandals were revealed in other parts of Asia and Africa.\n\nResponding to these cases members of the Secretary-General of the United Nations attempted to reduce the number of violations within corporate systems in 2011 by implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework, a report stating the guiding principles on transnational corporations and other business enterprises and human rights. Endorsed in Resolution 17/4 by the Human Rights Council on June 16, 2011, the report outlines three main principles. 1) The state\u2019s existing obligation to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms, 2) the role of business enterprises as specialized organs of society performing specialized functions, required to comply with all applicable laws and to respect human rights, and 3) the need for rights and obligations to be matched to appropriate and effective remedies when breached. The resolution attempted to establish a universal understanding of appropriate employment conditions and stated punishments for those firms who violate the guiding principles. In addition, research regarding the lasting consequences for labor whose rights were violated were revealed. Yet in 2018 it was found that still, 218million children are working full time, many of which are employed by factory owners to lower production costs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruggie|first=John|date=March 21, 2011|title=Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises|url=https://www.ohchr.org/documents/issues/business/A.HRC.17.31.pdf|journal=Human Rights Council|volume=17|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual exploitation ===\n{{Main|Commercial sexual exploitation of children}}\n{{Sex and the law}}\nThe [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] is a protocol of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, formally adopted by the UN in 2000.<ref name=\"www2.ohchr.org\">{{cite web |publisher=United Nations |title=Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography |year=2000 |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310131154/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm |archive-date=March 10, 2012}}</ref> Essentially, this protocol formally requires states to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography.<ref name=\"www2.ohchr.org\"/> According to the ILO, sexual exploitation of children includes all of the following practices and activities:<ref>{{cite web |publisher=ILO |title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children |url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>\n* \"The use of girls and boys in sexual activities remunerated in cash or in kind (commonly known as child prostitution) in the streets or indoors, in such places as brothels, discotheques, massage parlours, bars, hotels, restaurants, etc.\"\n* \"The trafficking of girls and boys and adolescents for the sex trade\"\n* \"Child sex tourism\"\n* \"The production, promotion and distribution of pornography involving children\"\n* \"The use of children in sex shows (public or private)\"\nThough measuring the extent of this practice is difficult due to its criminal and covert nature, the ILO estimates that there are as many as 1.8 million children sexually trafficked worldwide, while UNICEF's 2006 State of the World's Children Report reports this number to be 2 million.<ref name=\"ILO\">{{cite web|publisher=ILO |title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents: The ILO's Response |url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=UNICEF |title=The State of the World's Children: Excluded and Invisible |year=2006 |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/index.php |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> The ILO has found that girls involved in other forms of child labour \u2014 such as domestic service or street vending \u2014 are at the highest risk of being pulled into commercial child sex trafficking.<ref name=\"ILO\"/> Likewise, Kendall and Funk justifies how \"young girls age 12 and under are malleable and more easily trained into their prospective roles as prostitutes, and because virginity is highly prized by certain consumers willing to pay a premium\".{{sfn|Kendall|Funk|2012|p=31}} A variety of sources, including the ILO and scholars Erin Kunze and D.M.

begging ===\n[[File:Child-Beggers-Niger-Africa-Muntaka-Chasant-Wikipedia.jpg|left|thumb|320x320px|Forced child beggars in [[Niger]]]]\nForced child begging is a type of begging in which boys and girls under the age of eighteen are forced to beg through psychological and physical coercion.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\">{{cite news |ref=harv |last=Delap |first=Emily |title=Begging For Change: Research findings and recommendations on forced child begging in Albania/Greece, India, and Senegal |publisher=Anti-Slavery International |year=2009}}</ref> Begging is defined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review as \"the activity of asking for money as charity on the street\".<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\">{{cite journal |last=Cherneva |first=Iveta |title=Human Trafficking For Begging |journal=Buffalo Human Rights Law Review |volume=17 |year=2011 |page=25 |publisher=LexisNexis Academic: Law Reviews}}</ref> There is evidence to suggest that forced begging is one industry that children are trafficked into, with a recent UNICEF study reporting that 13% of trafficking victims in South Eastern Europe have been trafficked for the purpose of forced begging.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> The UN protocol affirms that \"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article.\"<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> With this definition the transportation of a child to an urban center for the purposes of begging constitutes trafficking regardless of whether this process was enforced by a third party or family member.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> The severity of this form of trafficking is starting to gain global recognition, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the [[European Union]], the ILO, and the UN, among others, beginning to emphasize its pertinence.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> The European Union's Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking includes child begging as one form of trafficking, stating \"trafficking in human beings is an abhorrent and worrying phenomenon involving coercive sexual exploitation, labor exploitation in conditions akin to slavery, exploitation in begging and juvenile delinquency as well as domestic servitude.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.belgium.iom.int/STOPConference/Conference%20Papers/brudeclaration.pdf |url-access=subscription |title=Brussels Declaration

2012 |year=2002}}</ref> This issue is especially difficult to regulate given that forced begging is often imposed by family members, with parental power leveraged over a child to ensure that begging is carried out.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/>\n\n==== Demographics ====\nBy definition child begging occurs in persons younger than eighteen, though forced begging has been found by UNICEF to exist among children as young as the age of two.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Incidences of this practice have been recorded by the [[World Bank]] in South and Central Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and West Africa.<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\">{{cite web |publisher=World Bank |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/244362-1239390842422/6012763-1239905793229/Human_Trafficking.pdf |title=Social Development Notes: Conflict, Crime, and Violence |year=2009}}</ref>\n\nMost research, such as studies done by UNICEF, suggests that boys are much more likely than girls to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.<ref name=\"UNICEF 2006\">{{cite news |title=Action to Prevent Child Trafficking Report |publisher=UNICEF |year=2006}}</ref> In Albania, where forced begging is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/>\n\nWhile concrete figures are difficult to determine, the ILO recently reported that there are at least 600,000 children involved in forced begging.{{sfn|Craig|2010|p=29}} The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\">{{cite journal |last=Pumin |first=Yin |title=Saving Child Panhandlers |journal=Beijing Review |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=18\u201319 |url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/print/txt/2011-02/27/content_334049_2.htm |date=February 9, 2011}}</ref> Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by [[Human Rights Watch]] projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging.{{sfn|Wells|2010|p=10}} Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though there is no way of knowing whether it was through forced means.<ref name=\"unicef.org\">{{cite web |publisher=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/ZIM_01-805.pdf |title=Study On Street Children In Zimbabwe |year=2011}}</ref>\n\nGang networks involving forced begging have been found to occur in populations of 500 or greater.<ref name=\"Burke, Jason 2011\">{{cite newspaper |last1=Burke |first1=Jason |last2=Hammadi |first2=Saad |title=Bangladesh Arrest Uncovers Evidence of Children Forced to Beg |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=January 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Motivations ====\n\n===== Economic factors =====\nForced begging is a profitable practice in which exploiters are motivated by economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked for the purpose of begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30\u201340,000 USD for the profiteer.{{sfn|Delap|2009|p=6}} Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing [[Capability approach|capabilities]]. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families.{{sfn|Delap|2009|p=12}} UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/>\n\n===== Political factors =====\nAccording to the World Bank forced begging is most commonly found in the Middle East and countries of West Africa, where laws prohibiting begging are scarce and heavy regulation of trafficking absent.<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\"/> In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/> Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back onto the streets, which does little to combat the issue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |title=A Generation's Future Goes Begging |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |date=September 7, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===== Cultural factors =====\nThere are several cultural factors that support begging. In Europe begging is found in a number of minority cultures, especially popular within Roma and nomadic communities.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> In Turkey familial networks of beggars have been documented across three generations, making it deeply ingrained within their survival schemas.<ref name=\"Craig, Gary 2010\">{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Craig |first=Gary |title=Child Slavery Now |location=Portland |publisher=The Policy Press |year=2010}}</ref> It is important to note that while these may be culturally rooted practices, juvenile begging by way of familial pressure still falls under the realm of forced begging.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> The transport of children, even one's own, for the purposes of exploitation through begging is a form of trafficking outlined by the United Nations.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/>\n\nAnother cultural practice is the resolution of familial debts through the kidnapping and exploitation of one of their children.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sidner |first=Sarah |url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/04/gang-profits-from-maimed-child-beggars/ |title=Gang Profits from Maimed Child Beggars |work=CNN Freedom Project |year=2011}}</ref>\n\n==== General abuses ====\nUNICEF has found that children who are forced to beg by third parties are often removed from their families, surrender the majority of their income to their exploiter, endure unsafe work and living conditions, and are at times maimed to increase profits.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/><ref name=\"UNICEF 2006\"/> The process of [[Mutilation|maiming]], popularized by the film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'', is common given that according to the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review children with apparent special needs often make upwards of three times as much as other children who beg.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> In addition to inflictions such as blindness and loss of limbs, other physical abuses for the purposes of heightening profits include pouring chili pepper on a child's tongue to give the appearance of impeded speech, the use of opium to elicit cries, and administering forced injections of drugs that will increase a child's energy and alertness.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Testimonies against trafficking ring gang leaders have discussed the detainment of individuals in small cells devoid of food, water, and light to make victims weak and feeble, and thus more likely to elicit donations.<ref name=\"Burke, Jason 2011\"/>\n\nThe conditions in which begging takes place commonly expose children to further physical and verbal abuse, including sexual victimization and police brutality.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Research completed by Human Rights Watch revealed that when begging hours are completed for the day children often do not have proper shelter, adequate food, or access to healthcare where they reside.<ref name=\"Wells 2010\">{{cite news |ref=harv |last=Wells |first=Matthew |title=Off the Backs of the Children: Forced Begging and Other Abuses Against Talibes in Senegal |location=New York |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=2010}}</ref> Furthermore, many of the gangs which run networks of forced begging have heavy drug involvement, thus the children under their control are often turned into drug addicts in order for them to become further reliant on their exploiters.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/>\n\n==== Long-term implications ====\nStudies have shown that children forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars have been shown to engage in a cyclical process of continuing this practice cross-generationally.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Interviews conducted by UNICEF show that children who beg have little hope for the future and do not believe their circumstances will improve.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/> Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/> Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/>\n\n==== Solutions ====\n\n===== International action =====\nA victim-centered human rights approach to combating trafficking has been internationally renowned as the best possible strategy when addressing this issue, with recourse focusing on punishing the exploiter and rehabilitating the child.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> Some countries who emphasize this method include the United States, with the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]] affirming \"victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\"<ref name=\"TVPA 2000\">{{cite news |publisher=United States |title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 |page=1468}}</ref>\n\nOther supported methods, such as those outlined by the Buffalo Human Rights Center, include relying on three Ps: protection, prosecution, and prevention.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> Protection starts with enforcing strict measures on the matters of both trafficking and begging. For many nations the first step is the criminalization of begging and trafficking.<ref name=\"Craig, Gary 2010\"/> Prosecution should be instituted in the form of greater legal ramifications for traffickers, with punishment focused on the exploiter rather than the exploited.<ref name=\"TVPA 2000\"/> This becomes difficult with respect to victims of familial trafficking, considering this would require changes in care placement and strict monitoring of each displaced child's welfare.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Many organizations affirm that prevention begins with discouraging donations and improving services so that children, and families as a whole, have greater capabilities.<ref name=\"Wells 2010\"/> Though well-intentioned, by giving child beggars money, individuals only make this practice more profitable, and soon these funds find their way into the hands of the child's abuser.<ref name=\"Wells 2010\"/>\n\n===== Government response =====\nIn Senegal, where the abuses against [[talibes]] are extensive, there have been several initiatives with the help of the World Bank to put an end this exploitation. First, there is intervention on a community level with education on the validity of some of these Quranic institutions provided to rural villages that typically send their children there. This is supplemented by improved regulation of schools within the nation to ensure that they remain places of education, followed by a greater enforcement of preexisting laws banning trafficking and exploitative begging. Finally, rehabilitation services have been provided with the help of [[Civil Society Organization|CSOs]] to recovered children to provide them with the capabilities they have been denied.<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nIn Zimbabwe policy has adapted to ensure the safety of all persons under the age of sixteen with the Children's Protection and Adoption Act, however, the government admits that a lack of resources and capital play a critical role in inadequate enforcement.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/>\n\nIn Bangladesh, where there are an estimated 700,000 beggars, a law passed in 2009 banning the practice, though officials report some trouble with enforcement.<ref name=\"Burke, Jason 2011\"/>\n\nIn China, the Ministry of Public Security has established a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of forced begging, which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a blood relationship with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality and dangers of begging if they are those responsible for the child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\"/>\n\n===== NGO initiatives =====\nMany NGOs have initiated movements focusing on informing the public on the dangers of donations. As recently reported by UNICEF, \"certain behaviors, such as giving money to child beggars can also indirectly motivate traffickers and controller to demand children.\"<ref name=\"UNICEF 2006\"/> The Mirror Foundation's Stop Child Begging Project of Thailand is one such organization that emphasizes eliminating the demand. Their initiatives are focused on educating passersby on the forced begging of trafficked Cambodians within their country to decrease the likelihood of donations.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Mirror Art Group / Mirror Foundation |url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/243 |website=HumanTrafficking.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713061104/http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/243 |archive-date=July 13, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kred |first=Pak |title=Children trafficked to sell flowers and beg |url=http://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/report/95566/thailand-children-trafficked-sell-flowers-and-beg |website=The New Humanitarian |accessdate=June 2, 2019 |language=en |date=June 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===== Other methods =====\nIn China, where the kidnapping and forced begging of children has been routinely documented, a multi-media movement has begun.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\"/> Here, blogs are utilized to publicize over 3,000 photos of children whose families believe have been abducted for the purpose of begging, with hundreds of thousands of followers who remain on the look out for these children in major urban centers. This campaign has enabled at least six children to be recovered and reunited with their families.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\"/>\n\nIn instances where begging is religiously sanctioned it has been suggested by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) that religious leaders should outwardly condemn this practice. For talibes religious leaders have been asked to take a stance against begging using passages cited from the Quran, such as, \"Except paradise, you should not beg anything for the sake of Allah\" (8:23), which would help strip the practice of its religious foundation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Study on the Practice of Trafficking in Persons in Senegal |publisher=USAID |year=2004}}</ref> In addition, former US President Clinton took the responsibility of providing protection against child abuse through Internet Service Providers (ISP) that can help law enforcement track any suspicious activities including child pornography.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McCabe |first=K.A. |year=2008 |title=The role of internet providers in cases of child pornography and child protection |journal=Social Science Computer Review |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=247\u2013251|doi=10.1177/0894439307301438 }}</ref>\n\n=== Child exchange ===\nIn China, in response to adult starvation, some children were exchanged, killed, and eaten. According to Robyn Meredith, in the People's Republic of China (''ca.'' 1958),{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=18}} \"Peasants{{Efn|[[Peasants]], traditionally farmers who might be slaves, serfs, or free}} turned into skeletons.

Consumer demand is generated by people who actively or passively buy the products or services of trafficked labor.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> An example of this would be a tourist purchasing a T-shirt that has been made by a trafficked child. Derived demand, on the other hand, is generated by people who directly profit from the practice of trafficking, such as pimps or corrupt factory owners.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Scholar Kevin Bales has extensively studied the application of this economic framework to instances of human trafficking; he contends that it is central to an accurate understanding of how trafficking is initiated and sustained.<ref name=\"Bales\">{{cite book |last=Bales |first=Kevin |title=Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy |url=https://archive.org/details/disposablepeople00bale_0 |url-access=registration |year=1999 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, CA}}</ref> Bales, along with scholars Elizabeth M.

These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, child trafficking is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children\u2019s rights to a safe and healthy development.<ref>{{cite report |ref=harv |author=KMOP |collaboration=Defence for Children International, Italy; CESIS; Cardet |title=IMPACT: Improving Monitoring and Protection systems Against Child Trafficking and exploitation |year=2014 |page=16 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/impact_transnational_report-_final_1.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Dottridge |first=Mike |date=December 2008 |title=Young People's Voices on Child Trafficking: Experiences from South Eastern Europe |journal=Innocenti Working Paper |issue=IWP-2008-05 |url=https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/iwp_2008_05.pdf |location=Florence |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre |year=2008 |title=Child Trafficking in Europe, A Broad Vision to Put Children First |journal=Innocenti Insight |location=Florence |pages=12\u201316}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |publisher=Save the Children |year=2007 |title=Children Speak Out, Trafficking risk and resilience in Southeast Europe |journal=Regional Report |pages=20\u201329}}</ref>\n\n== Identification ==\nThe complex definition of child trafficking and the differences in national laws and interpretations makes the identification of child victims of trafficking challenging. For example, the European debate on child trafficking lacks consensus on how child trafficking is to be distinguished from other contexts of exploitation, from [[social dumping]] of migrants, the sale of children and the smuggling of migrants.{{sfn|KMOP|2014|p=18}}{{sfn|UNICEF-IRC|2012|pp=34\u201341}} People smugglers are also known to exploit children to transport migrants across international borders.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|last2=Missbach|first2=Antje|date=2017|title=Trafficking within migrant smuggling operations: Are underage transporters 'victims' or 'perpetrators'?|journal=Asian and Pacific Migration Journal|language=|volume=26|issue=3|pages=287\u2013307|doi=10.1177/0117196817726627|issn=0117-1968}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|last2=Missbach|first2=Antje|date=2019|title=Bringing the ferrymen into the dock: underage Indonesians as 'people smugglers' in transporting asylum seekers and refugees to Australia|url=https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/bringing-the-ferrymen-into-the-dock-underage-indonesians-as-peopl|journal=Critical Insights on Irregular Migration Facilitation: Global Perspectives|language=English|pages=30\u201332}}</ref>\n\nOnce a potential victim has come into contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child\u2019s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe |title=Trafficking in Human Beings: Identification of Potential and Presumed Victims, A Community Policing Approach |year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |location=Norway |publisher=Coordination Unit for Victims of Trafficking |title=Guide to Identification of Possible Victims of Trafficking |year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |location=Sweden |title=Handbook for the identification of child victims of trafficking |publisher=National Board of Health and Welfare with UNICEF Sweden}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |location=Denmark |title=Guidelines for identification of victims of trafficking |publisher=Danish Centre against Trafficking in Human Beings}}</ref>\n\nIdentified victims of child trafficking are entitled to special safeguards that all child victims of crimes are entitled to under international law.

An important safeguard for trafficked children who have been exploited in illegal or criminal activities is the \u2018non-punishment clause\u2019. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are to be protected from sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=UNICEF |title=Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, UNICEF Technical Notes |year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council |title=Resolution 2005/20: Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime |date=July 22, 2005 |url=https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/docs/2005/resolution%202005-20.pdf}}</ref>\n\nArticles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the exploitation of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse can be considered a victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that they have a right to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.{{sfn|KMOP|2014|pp=15\u201319}}{{sfn|UNICEF-IRC|2012|pp=34-44}}\n\n== Prevalence ==\nIt is difficult to obtain reliable estimates concerning the number of children trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/><ref name=\"Gozdziak 2008\"/> It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> This process of gathering data is only complicated by the fact that very few countries publish national estimates of child trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n=== Worldwide ===\nTrafficking of children has been documented in every region of the world.<ref name=\"United Nations 2000\"/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Inter-Agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons (ICAT) |title=An Analytical Review 10 Years on from the Adoption of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol |year=2010 |url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/ICAT_Backgound_Paper.pdf |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref> A widely used figure regarding the prevalence of this practice is provided by the ILO, which estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year; this estimate includes cross-border and internal trafficking.<ref name=\"ILO 2002\">{{cite web |publisher=ILO |title=Every Child Counts: New Global Estimates on Child Labour |year=2002 |url=http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/viewProduct.do?productId=742 |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Regional ===\nRegionally, the ILO has provided the following estimates for trafficking of children by region per year:<ref name=\"ILO 2002\"/>\n* Asia/Pacific: 250,000 children\n* Latin America & the Caribbean: 550,000 children\n* Africa: 200,000 children\n* Transition economies: 200,000 children\n* Developed/industrialized economies: unknown\n\nAs the numbers above indicate, child trafficking occurs the most frequently in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The reason is increased vulnerability and financial instability which arises after natural disasters hit.\n\n=== Lack of Education ===\nA lack of education and literacy furthermore makes families more vulnerable to traffickers. Parents are often unaware of the negative consequences of child trafficking and voluntarily send their children away. Additionally, children are often not aware of their rights and lack understanding regarding which of their rights are violated. There is a need to educate children of their rights, because it will reduce the likelihood of manipulation and forced industry work.

Moreover, trafficked children are often denied access to healthcare, effectively increasing their chances of serious injury and death.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Trafficked children are also often subject to domestic violence; they may be beaten or starved in order to ensure obedience.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In addition, these children frequently encounter substance abuse; they may be given drugs as \"payment\" or to ensure that they become addicted and thus dependent on their trafficker(s).<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> As opposed to many other forms of crime, the trauma experienced by children who are trafficked is often prolonged and repeated, leading to severe psychological impacts.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> UN.GIFT reports that trafficked children often suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/>\n\nEffects on families are also severe. Some families believe that sending or allowing their children to relocate in order to find work will bring in additional income, while in reality many families will never see their trafficked children again.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In addition, UN.GIFT has found that certain forms of trafficking, particularly sexual exploitation in girls, bring \"shame\" to families.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> Thus, in certain cases, children who are able to escape trafficking may return to their families only to find that they are rejected and ostracized.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/>\n\n=== Communities ===\nChild trafficking has also been shown to have a major effect on communities. If multiple children in a community are trafficked, it can result in the entire community being corrupted, and thus devastated, by trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Social development efforts are hindered, as trafficked children's educations are cut short.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> As a result of this lack of education, children who escape trafficking may be less able to secure employment later in life.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In addition, trafficked girls face special obstacles, in that their prospects for marriage might be diminished if the community becomes aware that they have been trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n=== Nations ===\nOn a national level, economic development is severely hindered by the lack of education of trafficked children; this results in a major loss of potentially productive future workers.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/><ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> Children who are able to successfully return to their families often pose a significant financial burden, due to their lack of education, and the illnesses and injuries they may have incurred during trafficking work.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> There are major costs associated with the rehabilitation of these trafficked children, so that they are able to successfully participate in their communities.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Furthermore, the persistence of child trafficking indicates the presence of sustained criminal activity and criminal networks, which, in most cases, are also associated with drugs and violence.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> As a result, UN.GIFT has cited child trafficking as a significant indicator of national and global security threats.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/>\n\n== Proposed solutions ==\nSolutions to child trafficking, or \"anti-trafficking actions\", can be roughly classified into four categories:<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\">{{cite book |author1=ILO |author2=UNICEF |author3=UN.GIFT |title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation \u2013 Textbook 2: Action Against Child Trafficking at Policy and Outreach Levels |year=2009 |url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/CP_Trg_Manual_Textbook_2.pdf |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref>\n* Broad protection: \"To prevent children and former victims from being (re)trafficked\"\n* Prevention: \"Of the crime of child trafficking and the exploitation that is its end result\"\n* Law enforcement: \"In particular within a labour context and relating to labour laws and regulations\"\n* Protection: \"All steps towards the redress of their grievance, rehabilitation and helping to establish her/him.\"<ref name=\"Bianca Daw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/2065674 |title=Child Trafficking: Problems and Solutions |last=Daw |first=Bianca}}</ref>\n\nBroad protection actions are geared towards children who could potentially be trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and [[conditional cash transfer]] programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the ILO, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/><ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Pinheiro |first=Paulo Sergio |title=World Report on Violence against Children |year=2006 |url=https://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/reports/SG_violencestudy_en.pdf |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> Other forms of protection and resources are conveniently located clinics, clean water, sustainable environments, and financial literacy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/409133 |title=From Human Trafficking to Human Rights: Reframing Contemporary Slavery |last=Brysk |first=Alison |year=2012 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=9780812205732 |editor-last=Brysk |editor-first=Alison |language=en-US |chapter=The Anti-slavery Movement: Making Rights Reality |editor-last2=Choi-Fitzpatrick |editor-first2=Austin |chapter-url-access=subscription |via=Project Muse}}</ref>\n\nAnother way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities from all over the world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.\n\nPreventative actions are more focused on addressing the actual practice of child trafficking, specifically by implementing legal frameworks that are aimed to both deter and prosecute traffickers.<ref name=\"United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002\"/><ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> This involves the adoption and implementation of the ILO's [[international labour standards]], as well as the development of safe and legal migration practices.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/>\n\nLaw enforcement refers to the actual prosecution of traffickers; UNICEF maintains that successful prosecution of child traffickers is the surest way to send a message that child trafficking will not be tolerated.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Traffickers can be \"caught\" at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as [[child labour]] laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by UNICEF which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> However, some anti-trafficking groups, such as the Young Women's Empowerment Project, are against working with law enforcement due to cases where law enforcement officials played roles in the exploitation of the victim.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book |last=Baker |first=C. |year=2018 |title=Fighting the US Youth Sex Trade: Gender, Race, and Politics |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781108225045|isbn=9781108225045 }}</ref> In June 2016, 14 Oakland Police officers were alleged to have been involved in a sex scandal involving a teenaged prostitute, including some while she was allegedly a minor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/badge-of-dishonor-top-oakland-police-department-officials-looked-away-as-east-bay-cops-sexually-exploited-and-trafficked-a-teenagerdepartmen/Content?oid=4832543 |title=Badge of Dishonor: Top Oakland Police Department Officials Looked Away as East Bay Cops Sexually Exploited and Trafficked a Teenager |work=East Bay Express |date=June 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nProtection begins first with victim identification; child trafficking laws must specifically and appropriately define what constitutes a \"trafficking victim\".<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Legal processes must then be in place for removing children from trafficking situations, and returning them either to their families or other appropriate settings.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Victims should also be provided with individualized and supportive physical and [[Psychological trauma|psychological]] rehabilitation in order to establish him or her self.

exists in every region of the world and which often has human rights implications. Yet, it is only within the past decade that the prevalence and ramifications of this practice have risen to international prominence, due to a dramatic increase in research and public action. Limited research has not yet identified all causes of child trafficking, however, it appears that poverty, humanitarian crisis, and lack of education contribute to high rates. A variety of potential solutions have accordingly been suggested and implemented, which can be categorized as four types of action: broad protection, prevention, law enforcement, and victim assistance.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/><ref name=\"Bianca Daw\"/>\n\nThe main international documents dealing with the trafficking of children are the 1989 UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the 1999 ILO [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]], and the 2000 UN [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children]].\n\n== Definition ==\nThe first major international instrument dealing with the trafficking of children is part of the 2000 UN [[Palermo protocols]], titled the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Article 3(a) of this document defines child trafficking as the \"recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and/or receipt\" of a child for the purpose of exploitation.<ref name=\"United Nations 2000\"/> The definition for child trafficking given here applies only to cases of trafficking that are transnational and/or involve organized criminal groups; in spite of this, child trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\">{{cite book |author1=ILO |author2=UNICEF |author3=UN.GIFT |author-link1=International Labour Organization |author-link2=UNICEF |author-link3=United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking |title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation \u2013 Textbook 1: Understanding Child Trafficking |year=2009 |url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/Textbook_1.pdf |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref> The ILO expands upon this definition by asserting that movement and exploitation are key aspects of child trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> The definition of \"child\" used here is that listed in the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which states, \"a child means every human being below the age of 18 years, unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.\"<ref name=\"United Nations 1989\">{{cite web |publisher=United Nations |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |year=1989 |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archive-date=June 11, 2010}}</ref> The distinction outlined in this definition is important, because some countries have chosen to set the \"age of majority\" lower than 18, thus influencing what exactly legally constitutes child trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n=== Related legal instruments ===\nMany international, regional, and national instruments deal with the trafficking of children. These instruments are used to define what legally constitutes trafficking of children, such that appropriate legal action can be taken against those who engage in and promote this practice.

Anti-trafficking legislation has been lauded as critical by the [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]], because it ensures that traffickers and trafficking victims are treated accordingly: for example, \"if migration laws are used to pursue traffickers, it is often the case that the victims too are prosecuted as illegal migrants, whereas if there is a specific category of 'trafficker' and 'trafficked person,' then it is more likely that the victim will be treated as such.\"<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> The existence of national laws regarding child trafficking also enables trafficking victims and/or their families to take appropriate civil action.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n== Types of child trafficking ==\nThe intended or actual after-sale use of the child is not always known.\n\n=== Forced labour ===\n{{see also|Child labour}}\nThe objective of child trafficking is often forced child labour.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Child labour refers specifically to children under a stipulated minimum age, usually 14 at the lowest, being required to work.<ref name=\"min age conv 1973\"/> [[UNICEF]] estimates that, in 2011, 150 million children aged 5\u201314 in developing countries were involved in child labour.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=UNICEF |title=State of the World's Children 2011: Adolescence, an Age of Opportunity |year=2011 |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc2011/pdfs/SOWC-2011-Main-Report_EN_02092011.pdf |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> Additionally, UNICEF states that current rates indicate that at least 100 million children will still be forced to work by 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_child_labour.html|title=Child labour|website=UNICEF|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> Within this number, the ILO reports that 60% of child workers work in agriculture.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\">{{cite web |publisher=ILO |title=Fast Facts on Child Labour |year=2010 |url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@dgreports/@dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_126685.pdf |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> A comparative study between domestic child labor rates in urban and rural regions in sub-Saharan Africa reveals that 84.3% of child labourers are working in the rural sector. 99.8% of children age five to fourteen are engaged in child labor for some form of economic activity in these regions.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Adonteng-Kissi|first=Obed|date=October 2018|title=Parental perceptions of child labour and human rights: A comparative study of rural and urban Ghana|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|volume=84|pages=34\u201344|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.07.017|pmid=30041057|issn=0145-2134}}</ref> The ILO also estimates that 115 million children are engaged in hazardous work, such as the sex or drug trade.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\"/> Overall, child labor can take many forms, including domestic servitude, work in agriculture, service, and manufacturing industries. Also, according to several researchers, most children are forced into cheap and controllable labor, and work in homes, farms, factories, restaurants, and much more.{{sfnm |1a1=Beyrer |1y=2004 |1p=16 |2a1=Gozdziak |2a2=MacDonnell |2y=2007 |2p=171 |3a1=Vinkovic |3y=2010 |3p=88}} Children are cheap labor and additionally are able to complete jobs that adults cannot due to their size. One example for this is within the fishing industry in Ghana. Children can release fish easier from nets due to their small hands. Thereby their services are highly demanded and child labor remains a present consequence of child trafficking. Trafficked children may be sexually exploited, used in the armed forces and drug trades, and in child begging.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In terms of global trends, the ILO estimates that in 2004\u20132008, there was a 3% reduction in the incidence of child labor; this stands in contrast to a previous ILO report which found that in 2000\u20132004, there was a 10% reduction in child labor.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\"/> The ILO contends that, globally, child labour is slowly declining, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of child workers has remained relatively constant: 1 in 4 children aged 5\u201317 work in this region.<ref name=\"ILO 2010\"/> In 2018 UNICEF reported that 31% of total [[Child labour in Africa|child labor]] is located in West Africa. In this region, one in six children between the ages of six and fourteen is working.

Children were working in run-down and dangerous factories, were victims of abuse and got paid far below minimum wage. In the years that followed similar scandals were revealed in other parts of Asia and Africa.\n\nResponding to these cases members of the Secretary-General of the United Nations attempted to reduce the number of violations within corporate systems in 2011 by implementing the United Nations \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework, a report stating the guiding principles on transnational corporations and other business enterprises and human rights. Endorsed in Resolution 17/4 by the Human Rights Council on June 16, 2011, the report outlines three main principles. 1) The state\u2019s existing obligation to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms, 2) the role of business enterprises as specialized organs of society performing specialized functions, required to comply with all applicable laws and to respect human rights, and 3) the need for rights and obligations to be matched to appropriate and effective remedies when breached. The resolution attempted to establish a universal understanding of appropriate employment conditions and stated punishments for those firms who violate the guiding principles. In addition, research regarding the lasting consequences for labor whose rights were violated were revealed. Yet in 2018 it was found that still, 218million children are working full time, many of which are employed by factory owners to lower production costs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruggie|first=John|date=March 21, 2011|title=Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises|url=https://www.ohchr.org/documents/issues/business/A.HRC.17.31.pdf|journal=Human Rights Council|volume=17|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual exploitation ===\n{{Main|Commercial sexual exploitation of children}}\n{{Sex and the law}}\nThe [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] is a protocol of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, formally adopted by the UN in 2000.<ref name=\"www2.ohchr.org\">{{cite web |publisher=United Nations |title=Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography |year=2000 |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310131154/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-sale.htm |archive-date=March 10, 2012}}</ref> Essentially, this protocol formally requires states to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography.<ref name=\"www2.ohchr.org\"/> According to the ILO, sexual exploitation of children includes all of the following practices and activities:<ref>{{cite web |publisher=ILO |title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children |url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>\n* \"The use of girls and boys in sexual activities remunerated in cash or in kind (commonly known as child prostitution) in the streets or indoors, in such places as brothels, discotheques, massage parlours, bars, hotels, restaurants, etc.\"\n* \"The trafficking of girls and boys and adolescents for the sex trade\"\n* \"Child sex tourism\"\n* \"The production, promotion and distribution of pornography involving children\"\n* \"The use of children in sex shows (public or private)\"\nThough measuring the extent of this practice is difficult due to its criminal and covert nature, the ILO estimates that there are as many as 1.8 million children sexually trafficked worldwide, while UNICEF's 2006 State of the World's Children Report reports this number to be 2 million.<ref name=\"ILO\">{{cite web|publisher=ILO |title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents: The ILO's Response |url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/CSEC/lang--en/index.htm |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=UNICEF |title=The State of the World's Children: Excluded and Invisible |year=2006 |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc06/index.php |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> The ILO has found that girls involved in other forms of child labour \u2014 such as domestic service or street vending \u2014 are at the highest risk of being pulled into commercial child sex trafficking.<ref name=\"ILO\"/> Likewise, Kendall and Funk justifies how \"young girls age 12 and under are malleable and more easily trained into their prospective roles as prostitutes, and because virginity is highly prized by certain consumers willing to pay a premium\".{{sfn|Kendall|Funk|2012|p=31}} A variety of sources, including the ILO and scholars Erin Kunze and D.M.

|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nMost research, such as studies done by UNICEF, suggests that boys are much more likely than girls to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.<ref name=\"UNICEF 2006\">{{cite news |title=Action to Prevent Child Trafficking Report |publisher=UNICEF |year=2006}}</ref> In Albania, where forced begging is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/>\n\nWhile concrete figures are difficult to determine, the ILO recently reported that there are at least 600,000 children involved in forced begging.{{sfn|Craig|2010|p=29}} The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\">{{cite journal |last=Pumin |first=Yin |title=Saving Child Panhandlers |journal=Beijing

[[Human Rights Watch]] projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging.{{sfn|Wells|2010|p=10}} Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though there is no way of knowing whether it was through forced means.<ref name=\"unicef.org\">{{cite web |publisher=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/ZIM_01-805.pdf |title=Study On Street Children In Zimbabwe |year=2011}}</ref>\n\nGang networks involving forced begging have been found to occur in populations of 500 or greater.<ref name=\"Burke, Jason 2011\">{{cite newspaper |last1=Burke |first1=Jason |last2=Hammadi |first2=Saad |title=Bangladesh Arrest Uncovers Evidence of Children Forced to Beg |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=January 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Motivations ====\n\n===== Economic factors =====\nForced begging is a profitable practice in which exploiters are motivated by economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked for the purpose of begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30\u201340,000 USD for the profiteer.{{sfn|Delap|2009|p=6}} Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing [[Capability approach|capabilities]]. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families.{{sfn|Delap|2009|p=12}} UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/>\n\n===== Political factors =====\nAccording to the World Bank forced begging is most commonly found in the Middle East and countries of West Africa, where laws prohibiting begging are scarce and heavy regulation of trafficking absent.<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\"/> In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/> Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back onto the streets, which does little to combat the issue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |title=A Generation's Future Goes Begging |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |date=September 7, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===== Cultural factors =====\nThere are several cultural factors that support begging. In Europe begging is found in a number of minority cultures, especially popular within Roma and nomadic communities.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> In Turkey familial networks of beggars have been documented across three generations, making it deeply ingrained within their survival schemas.<ref name=\"Craig, Gary 2010\">{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Craig |first=Gary |title=Child Slavery Now |location=Portland |publisher=The Policy Press |year=2010}}</ref> It is important to note that while these may be culturally rooted practices, juvenile begging by way of familial pressure still falls under the realm of forced begging.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> The transport of children, even one's own, for the purposes of exploitation through begging is a form of trafficking outlined by the United Nations.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/>\n\nAnother cultural practice is the resolution of familial debts through the kidnapping and exploitation of one of their children.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sidner |first=Sarah |url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/04/gang-profits-from-maimed-child-beggars/ |title=Gang Profits from Maimed Child Beggars |work=CNN Freedom Project |year=2011}}</ref>\n\n==== General abuses ====\nUNICEF has found that children who are forced to beg by third parties are often removed from their families, surrender the majority of their income to their exploiter, endure unsafe work and living conditions, and are at times maimed to increase profits.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/><ref name=\"UNICEF 2006\"/> The process of [[Mutilation|maiming]], popularized by the film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'', is common given that according to the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review children with apparent special needs often make upwards of three times as much as other children who beg.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> In addition to inflictions such as blindness and loss of limbs, other physical abuses for the purposes of heightening profits include pouring chili pepper on a child's tongue to give the appearance of impeded speech, the use of opium to elicit cries, and administering forced injections of drugs that will increase a child's energy and alertness.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Testimonies against trafficking ring gang leaders have discussed the detainment of individuals in small cells devoid of food, water, and light to make victims weak and feeble, and thus more likely to elicit donations.<ref name=\"Burke, Jason 2011\"/>\n\nThe conditions in which begging takes place commonly expose children to further physical and verbal abuse, including sexual victimization and police brutality.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Research completed by Human Rights Watch revealed that when begging hours are completed for the day children often do not have proper shelter, adequate food, or access to healthcare where they reside.<ref name=\"Wells 2010\">{{cite news |ref=harv |last=Wells |first=Matthew |title=Off the Backs of the Children: Forced Begging and Other Abuses Against Talibes in Senegal |location=New York |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=2010}}</ref> Furthermore, many of the gangs which run networks of forced begging have heavy drug involvement, thus the children under their control are often turned into drug addicts in order for them to become further reliant on their exploiters.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/>\n\n==== Long-term implications ====\nStudies have shown that children forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars have been shown to engage in a cyclical process of continuing this practice cross-generationally.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Interviews conducted by UNICEF show that children who beg have little hope for the future and do not believe their circumstances will improve.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/> Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/> Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/>\n\n==== Solutions ====\n\n===== International action =====\nA victim-centered human rights approach to combating trafficking has been internationally renowned as the best possible strategy when addressing this issue, with recourse focusing on punishing the exploiter and rehabilitating the child.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> Some countries who emphasize this method include the United States, with the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]] affirming \"victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\"<ref name=\"TVPA 2000\">{{cite news |publisher=United States |title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 |page=1468}}</ref>\n\nOther supported methods, such as those outlined by the Buffalo Human Rights Center, include relying on three Ps: protection, prosecution, and prevention.<ref name=\"Cherneva, Iveta 2011\"/> Protection starts with enforcing strict measures on the matters of both trafficking and begging. For many nations the first step is the criminalization of begging and trafficking.<ref name=\"Craig, Gary 2010\"/> Prosecution should be instituted in the form of greater legal ramifications for traffickers, with punishment focused on the exploiter rather than the exploited.<ref name=\"TVPA 2000\"/> This becomes difficult with respect to victims of familial trafficking, considering this would require changes in care placement and strict monitoring of each displaced child's welfare.<ref name=\"Delap, Emily 2009\"/> Many organizations affirm that prevention begins with discouraging donations and improving services so that children, and families as a whole, have greater capabilities.<ref name=\"Wells 2010\"/> Though well-intentioned, by giving child beggars money, individuals only make this practice more profitable, and soon these funds find their way into the hands of the child's abuser.<ref name=\"Wells 2010\"/>\n\n===== Government response =====\nIn Senegal, where the abuses against [[talibes]] are extensive, there have been several initiatives with the help of the World Bank to put an end this exploitation. First, there is intervention on a community level with education on the validity of some of these Quranic institutions provided to rural villages that typically send their children there. This is supplemented by improved regulation of schools within the nation to ensure that they remain places of education, followed by a greater enforcement of preexisting laws banning trafficking and exploitative begging. Finally, rehabilitation services have been provided with the help of [[Civil Society Organization|CSOs]] to recovered children to provide them with the capabilities they have been denied.<ref name=\"siteresources.worldbank.org\"/>\n\nIn Zimbabwe policy has adapted to ensure the safety of all persons under the age of sixteen with the Children's Protection and Adoption Act, however, the government admits that a lack of resources and capital play a critical role in inadequate enforcement.<ref name=\"unicef.org\"/>\n\nIn Bangladesh, where there are an estimated 700,000 beggars, a law passed in 2009 banning the practice, though officials report some trouble with enforcement.<ref name=\"Burke, Jason 2011\"/>\n\nIn China, the Ministry of Public Security has established a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of forced begging, which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a blood relationship with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality and dangers of begging if they are those responsible for the child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\"/>\n\n===== NGO initiatives =====\nMany NGOs have initiated movements focusing on informing the public on the dangers of donations. As recently reported by UNICEF, \"certain behaviors, such as giving money to child beggars can also indirectly motivate traffickers and controller to demand children.\"<ref name=\"UNICEF 2006\"/> The Mirror Foundation's Stop Child Begging Project of Thailand is one such organization that emphasizes eliminating the demand. Their initiatives are focused on educating passersby on the forced begging of trafficked Cambodians within their country to decrease the likelihood of donations.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Mirror Art Group / Mirror Foundation |url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/243 |website=HumanTrafficking.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713061104/http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/243 |archive-date=July 13, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kred |first=Pak |title=Children trafficked to sell flowers and beg |url=http://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/report/95566/thailand-children-trafficked-sell-flowers-and-beg |website=The New Humanitarian |accessdate=June 2, 2019 |language=en |date=June 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===== Other methods =====\nIn China, where the kidnapping and forced begging of children has been routinely documented, a multi-media movement has begun.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\"/> Here, blogs are utilized to publicize over 3,000 photos of children whose families believe have been abducted for the purpose of begging, with hundreds of thousands of followers who remain on the look out for these children in major urban centers. This campaign has enabled at least six children to be recovered and reunited with their families.<ref name=\"Pumin, Yin 2011\"/>\n\nIn instances where begging is religiously sanctioned it has been suggested by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) that religious leaders should outwardly condemn this practice. For talibes religious leaders have been asked to take a stance against begging using passages cited from the Quran, such as, \"Except paradise, you should not beg anything for the sake of Allah\" (8:23), which would help strip the practice of its religious foundation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Study on the Practice of Trafficking in Persons in Senegal |publisher=USAID |year=2004}}</ref> In addition, former US President Clinton took the responsibility of providing protection against child abuse through Internet Service Providers (ISP) that can help law enforcement track any suspicious activities including child pornography.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McCabe |first=K.A. |year=2008 |title=The role of internet providers in cases of child pornography and child protection |journal=Social Science Computer Review |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=247\u2013251|doi=10.1177/0894439307301438 }}</ref>\n\n=== Child exchange ===\nIn China, in response to adult starvation, some children were exchanged, killed, and eaten. According to Robyn Meredith, in the People's Republic of China (''ca.'' 1958),{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=18}} \"Peasants{{Efn|[[Peasants]], traditionally farmers who might be slaves, serfs, or free}} turned into skeletons. The nation's farmers, including the residents of Xiaogang,{{Efn|[[Xiaogang (disambiguation)|Xiaogang]], one of several places in China}} found themselves going to shocking lengths to find food. ... Some starving families resorted to a practice called ''\u6613\u5b50\u800c\u98df'' [meaning 'exchanging children to eat']: they traded a child for a neighbor's child, then killed and ate the skinny youngster, with the sickening knowledge that their neighbors were devouring their own.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Meredith|2007|pp=19, 220}}: \"A number of Chinese and Western scholars have documented starvation and cannibalism during Mao's Great Leap Forward, but these accounts of what happened in China's countryside are taken from Jasper Becker, ''Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine'' (New York: Free Press, 1996).\"</ref>{{Efn|[[Great Leap Forward]], a campaign under Mao Zedong to quickly move China from being agrarian to industrializing and collectivizing to become communist.}}\n\n=== Sales motivated by cash ===\nIn [[ancient Rome]], according to Keith Bradley, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote that \"there were indigent parents selling their children because they needed the cash.\"{{sfn|Bradley|1994|p=37}}\n\nIn contemporary Nepal, parents of poor families sell their children to [[orphanages]] (or sometimes simply hand them over without any payment).

Consumer demand is generated by people who actively or passively buy the products or services of trafficked labor.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> An example of this would be a tourist purchasing a T-shirt that has been made by a trafficked child. Derived demand, on the other hand, is generated by people who directly profit from the practice of trafficking, such as pimps or corrupt factory owners.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Scholar Kevin Bales has extensively studied the application of this economic framework to instances of human trafficking; he contends that it is central to an accurate understanding of how trafficking is initiated and sustained.<ref name=\"Bales\">{{cite book |last=Bales |first=Kevin |title=Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy |url=https://archive.org/details/disposablepeople00bale_0 |url-access=registration |year=1999 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, CA}}</ref> Bales, along with scholars Elizabeth M.

These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, child trafficking is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children\u2019s rights to a safe and healthy development.<ref>{{cite report |ref=harv |author=KMOP |collaboration=Defence for Children International, Italy; CESIS; Cardet |title=IMPACT: Improving Monitoring and Protection systems Against Child Trafficking and exploitation |year=2014 |page=16 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/impact_transnational_report-_final_1.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Dottridge |first=Mike |date=December 2008 |title=Young People's Voices on Child Trafficking: Experiences from South Eastern Europe |journal=Innocenti Working Paper |issue=IWP-2008-05 |url=https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/iwp_2008_05.pdf |location=Florence |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |publisher=UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre |year=2008 |title=Child Trafficking in Europe, A Broad Vision to Put Children First |journal=Innocenti Insight |location=Florence |pages=12\u201316}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |publisher=Save the Children |year=2007 |title=Children Speak Out, Trafficking risk and resilience in Southeast Europe |journal=Regional Report |pages=20\u201329}}</ref>\n\n== Identification ==\nThe complex definition of child trafficking and the differences in national laws and interpretations makes the identification of child victims of trafficking challenging. For example, the European debate on child trafficking lacks consensus on how child trafficking is to be distinguished from other contexts of exploitation, from [[social dumping]] of migrants, the sale of children and the smuggling of migrants.{{sfn|KMOP|2014|p=18}}{{sfn|UNICEF-IRC|2012|pp=34\u201341}} People smugglers are also known to exploit children to transport migrants across international borders.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|last2=Missbach|first2=Antje|date=2017|title=Trafficking within migrant smuggling operations: Are underage transporters 'victims' or 'perpetrators'?|journal=Asian and Pacific Migration Journal|language=|volume=26|issue=3|pages=287\u2013307|doi=10.1177/0117196817726627|issn=0117-1968}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|last2=Missbach|first2=Antje|date=2019|title=Bringing the ferrymen into the dock: underage Indonesians as 'people smugglers' in transporting asylum seekers and refugees to Australia|url=https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/bringing-the-ferrymen-into-the-dock-underage-indonesians-as-peopl|journal=Critical Insights on Irregular Migration Facilitation: Global Perspectives|language=English|pages=30\u201332}}</ref>\n\nOnce a potential victim has come into contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child\u2019s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe |title=Trafficking in Human Beings: Identification of Potential and Presumed Victims, A Community Policing Approach |year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |location=Norway |publisher=Coordination Unit for Victims of Trafficking |title=Guide to Identification of Possible Victims of Trafficking |year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |location=Sweden |title=Handbook for the identification of child victims of trafficking |publisher=National Board of Health and Welfare with UNICEF Sweden}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |location=Denmark |title=Guidelines for identification of victims of trafficking |publisher=Danish Centre against Trafficking in Human Beings}}</ref>\n\nIdentified victims of child trafficking are entitled to special safeguards that all child victims of crimes are entitled to under international law.

Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that they have a right to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.{{sfn|KMOP|2014|pp=15\u201319}}{{sfn|UNICEF-IRC|2012|pp=34-44}}\n\n== Prevalence ==\nIt is difficult to obtain reliable estimates concerning the number of children trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/><ref name=\"Gozdziak 2008\"/> It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> This process of gathering data is only complicated by the fact that very few countries publish national estimates of child trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n=== Worldwide ===\nTrafficking of children has been documented in every region of the world.<ref name=\"United Nations 2000\"/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Inter-Agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons (ICAT) |title=An Analytical Review 10 Years on from the Adoption of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol |year=2010 |url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/ICAT_Backgound_Paper.pdf |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref> A widely used figure regarding the prevalence of this practice is provided by the ILO, which estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year; this estimate includes cross-border and internal trafficking.<ref name=\"ILO 2002\">{{cite web |publisher=ILO |title=Every Child Counts: New Global Estimates on Child Labour |year=2002 |url=http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/viewProduct.do?productId=742 |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Regional ===\nRegionally, the ILO has provided the following estimates for trafficking of children by region per year:<ref name=\"ILO 2002\"/>\n* Asia/Pacific: 250,000 children\n* Latin America & the Caribbean: 550,000 children\n* Africa: 200,000 children\n* Transition economies: 200,000 children\n* Developed/industrialized economies: unknown\n\nAs the numbers above indicate, child trafficking occurs the most frequently in Latin America and the Caribbean.

There are, however, multiple reasons which contribute to high numbers such as poverty, humanitarian crisis and lack of education. It is additionally important to note that migration can also be voluntary.\n\n=== Poverty ===\nPoverty is the leading cause for child trafficking worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/messages/downloadsexceeded.html|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref> Often times parents are not able to provide for their families and consequentially exploit their children for financial reasons. These influencers lead to children being more inclined to take riskier jobs in order to sustain life for themselves and their families.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692|title=What Fuels Human Trafficking?|website=UNICEF USA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref> The decision for parents to expose their children for child trafficking, due to poverty, is not always for money incentives, but also because a lack of education causes them to believe that migration elsewhere will provide their children with more opportunities, which will help them escape chronic poverty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Addressing the Root Causes of Trafficking|last=OSCE|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Sometimes children are orphaned as a result of poverty, leaving them in the hands of child traffickers.

This was seen after the 2015 earthquake and 2010 earthquake in Haiti. The increase of sex trafficking after natural disasters results in the victimization of girls under the age of 18, specifically 33%.<ref name=\":02\" /> of girls under the age of 18 in such areas. The reason is increased vulnerability and financial instability which arises after natural disasters hit.\n\n=== Lack of Education ===\nA lack of education and literacy furthermore makes families more vulnerable to traffickers. Parents are often unaware of the negative consequences of child trafficking and voluntarily send their children away. Additionally, children are often not aware of their rights and lack understanding regarding which of their rights are violated. There is a need to educate children of their rights, because it will reduce the likelihood of manipulation and forced industry work. Informing children of their right to education will increase the net enrolment and grade completion rate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onedayswages.org/2017/08/08/rights-education/|title=How educating children on their rights can prevent human trafficking|last=Ruff|first=Jessinia|date=2017-08-08|website=One Day's Wages|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Voluntary Migration ===\nIn 2013 youth migrants, ages 15\u201324 made up 12% of total migration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/youth/fact-sheets/youth-migration.pdf|title=Youth and Migration|last=United Nations|date=2016|website=United Nations Youth|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The term \"child trafficking\" is often misused when migration is voluntary. \"Youth migration\" refers to youth choosing to leave homes to access opportunities elsewhere. Opportunities such as quality education, employment, and adventure are often scarce in rural areas, which is why migration often occurs from rural to urban areas. The ILO stated that 27 million young people leave their countries of birth to seek employment abroad as international migrants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/labour-migration/lang--en/index.htm|title=Labour migration (Labour migration)|website=www.ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref> In order to make migration safer for youth the UN adopted \"Addressing migration opportunities and challenges is central to achieving sustainable economic and social development\" to their new development goals, which are to be released in 2030.\n\n== Impacts ==\n\n=== Children and families ===\nAccording to UN.GIFT, child trafficking has the most significant impact on trafficked children and their families.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/><ref name=\"UN.GIFT\">{{cite web |author=UN.GIFT |title=An Introduction to Human Trafficking: Vulnerability, Impact, and Action |publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |year=2008 |url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/An_Introduction_to_Human_Trafficking_-_Background_Paper.pdf |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref> First, trafficking can result in the death or permanent injury of the trafficked child.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> This can stem from a dangerous \"movement\" stage of trafficking or from specific aspects of the \"exploitation\" stage, such as hazardous working conditions. Moreover, trafficked children are often denied access to healthcare, effectively increasing their chances of serious injury and death.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Trafficked children are also often subject to domestic violence; they may be beaten or starved in order to ensure obedience.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In addition, these children frequently encounter substance abuse; they may be given drugs as \"payment\" or to ensure that they become addicted and thus dependent on their trafficker(s).<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> As opposed to many other forms of crime, the trauma experienced by children who are trafficked is often prolonged and repeated, leading to severe psychological impacts.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> UN.GIFT reports that trafficked children often suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/>\n\nEffects on families are also severe. Some families believe that sending or allowing their children to relocate in order to find work will bring in additional income, while in reality many families will never see their trafficked children again.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In addition, UN.GIFT has found that certain forms of trafficking, particularly sexual exploitation in girls, bring \"shame\" to families.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> Thus, in certain cases, children who are able to escape trafficking may return to their families only to find that they are rejected and ostracized.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/>\n\n=== Communities ===\nChild trafficking has also been shown to have a major effect on communities. If multiple children in a community are trafficked, it can result in the entire community being corrupted, and thus devastated, by trafficking.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Social development efforts are hindered, as trafficked children's educations are cut short.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> As a result of this lack of education, children who escape trafficking may be less able to secure employment later in life.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> In addition, trafficked girls face special obstacles, in that their prospects for marriage might be diminished if the community becomes aware that they have been trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/>\n\n=== Nations ===\nOn a national level, economic development is severely hindered by the lack of education of trafficked children; this results in a major loss of potentially productive future workers.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/><ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> Children who are able to successfully return to their families often pose a significant financial burden, due to their lack of education, and the illnesses and injuries they may have incurred during trafficking work.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> There are major costs associated with the rehabilitation of these trafficked children, so that they are able to successfully participate in their communities.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1\"/> Furthermore, the persistence of child trafficking indicates the presence of sustained criminal activity and criminal networks, which, in most cases, are also associated with drugs and violence.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/> As a result, UN.GIFT has cited child trafficking as a significant indicator of national and global security threats.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/>\n\n== Proposed solutions ==\nSolutions to child trafficking, or \"anti-trafficking actions\", can be roughly classified into four categories:<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\">{{cite book |author1=ILO |author2=UNICEF |author3=UN.GIFT |title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation \u2013 Textbook 2: Action Against Child Trafficking at Policy and Outreach Levels |year=2009 |url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/CP_Trg_Manual_Textbook_2.pdf |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref>\n* Broad protection: \"To prevent children and former victims from being (re)trafficked\"\n* Prevention: \"Of the crime of child trafficking and the exploitation that is its end result\"\n* Law enforcement: \"In particular within a labour context and relating to labour laws and regulations\"\n* Protection: \"All steps towards the redress of their grievance, rehabilitation and helping to establish her/him.\"<ref name=\"Bianca Daw\">{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/2065674 |title=Child Trafficking: Problems and Solutions |last=Daw |first=Bianca}}</ref>\n\nBroad protection actions are geared towards children who could potentially be trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and [[conditional cash transfer]] programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the ILO, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education.<ref name=\"UN.GIFT\"/><ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Pinheiro |first=Paulo Sergio |title=World Report on Violence against Children |year=2006 |url=https://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/reports/SG_violencestudy_en.pdf |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> Other forms of protection and resources are conveniently located clinics, clean water, sustainable environments, and financial literacy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/409133 |title=From Human Trafficking to Human Rights: Reframing Contemporary Slavery |last=Brysk |first=Alison |year=2012 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=9780812205732 |editor-last=Brysk |editor-first=Alison |language=en-US |chapter=The Anti-slavery Movement: Making Rights Reality |editor-last2=Choi-Fitzpatrick |editor-first2=Austin |chapter-url-access=subscription |via=Project Muse}}</ref>\n\nAnother way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities from all over the world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.\n\nPreventative actions are more focused on addressing the actual practice of child trafficking, specifically by implementing legal frameworks that are aimed to both deter and prosecute traffickers.<ref name=\"United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2002\"/><ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> This involves the adoption and implementation of the ILO's [[international labour standards]], as well as the development of safe and legal migration practices.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/>\n\nLaw enforcement refers to the actual prosecution of traffickers; UNICEF maintains that successful prosecution of child traffickers is the surest way to send a message that child trafficking will not be tolerated.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Traffickers can be \"caught\" at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as [[child labour]] laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by UNICEF which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> However, some anti-trafficking groups, such as the Young Women's Empowerment Project, are against working with law enforcement due to cases where law enforcement officials played roles in the exploitation of the victim.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book |last=Baker |first=C. |year=2018 |title=Fighting the US Youth Sex Trade: Gender, Race, and Politics |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781108225045|isbn=9781108225045 }}</ref> In June 2016, 14 Oakland Police officers were alleged to have been involved in a sex scandal involving a teenaged prostitute, including some while she was allegedly a minor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/badge-of-dishonor-top-oakland-police-department-officials-looked-away-as-east-bay-cops-sexually-exploited-and-trafficked-a-teenagerdepartmen/Content?oid=4832543 |title=Badge of Dishonor: Top Oakland Police Department Officials Looked Away as East Bay Cops Sexually Exploited and Trafficked a Teenager |work=East Bay Express |date=June 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nProtection begins first with victim identification; child trafficking laws must specifically and appropriately define what constitutes a \"trafficking victim\".<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Legal processes must then be in place for removing children from trafficking situations, and returning them either to their families or other appropriate settings.<ref name=\"TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk2\"/> Victims should also be provided with individualized and supportive physical and [[Psychological trauma|psychological]] rehabilitation in order to establish him or her self.
