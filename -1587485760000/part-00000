This mode of operation is part of the OpenPGP standard and has been part of PGP from its first version.\n\nThe GnuPG&nbsp;1.x series uses an integrated cryptographic library, while the GnuPG&nbsp;2.x series replaces this with [[Libgcrypt]].\n\nGnuPG encrypts messages using [[public-key cryptography|asymmetric key pairs]] individually generated by GnuPG users. The resulting public keys may be exchanged with other users in a variety of ways, such as Internet [[key server (cryptographic)|key servers]]. They must always be exchanged carefully to prevent identity spoofing by corrupting public key \u2194 \"owner\" identity correspondences. It is also possible to add a cryptographic [[digital signature]] to a message, so the message integrity and sender can be verified, if a particular correspondence relied upon has not been corrupted.\n\nGnuPG also supports [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric encryption]] algorithms. By default, GnuPG uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] symmetrical algorithm since version 2.1,<ref name=\"2.1.0-beta864-announcement\">{{cite web |url=https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2014q4/000357.html |title=<nowiki>[Announce] The maybe final Beta for GnuPG 2.1</nowiki> |access-date=2019-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502211129/https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2014q4/000357.html |archive-date=2019-05-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[CAST-128|CAST5]] was used in earlier versions.

This mode of operation is part of the OpenPGP standard and has been part of PGP from its first version.\n\nThe GnuPG&nbsp;1.x series uses an integrated cryptographic library, while the GnuPG&nbsp;2.x series replaces this with [[Libgcrypt]].\n\nGnuPG encrypts messages using [[public-key cryptography|asymmetric key pairs]] individually generated by GnuPG users. The resulting public keys may be exchanged with other users in a variety of ways, such as Internet [[key server (cryptographic)|key servers]]. They must always be exchanged carefully to prevent identity spoofing by corrupting public key \u2194 \"owner\" identity correspondences. It is also possible to add a cryptographic [[digital signature]] to a message, so the message integrity and sender can be verified, if a particular correspondence relied upon has not been corrupted.\n\nGnuPG also supports [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric encryption]] algorithms. By default, GnuPG uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] symmetrical algorithm since version 2.1,<ref name=\"2.1.0-beta864-announcement\">{{cite web |url=https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2014q4/000357.html |title=<nowiki>[Announce] The maybe final Beta for GnuPG 2.1</nowiki> |access-date=2019-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502211129/https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2014q4/000357.html |archive-date=2019-05-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[CAST-128|CAST5]] was used in earlier versions.  GnuPG does not use patented or otherwise restricted software or algorithms.

It was in fact possible to use IDEA in GnuPG by downloading a plugin for it, however this might require a license for some uses in countries in which IDEA was patented. Starting with versions 1.4.13 and 2.0.20, GnuPG supports IDEA because the last patent of IDEA expired in 2012.

For example, GnuPG encryption support has been integrated into [[Kontact#E-Mail|KMail]] and [[Evolution (software)|Evolution]], the graphical [[email client]]s found in [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]], the most popular [[Linux]] desktops. There are also graphical GnuPG front-ends, for example [[Seahorse (software)|Seahorse]] for GNOME and [[KGPG]] for KDE.\n\nThe GPG Suite project provides a number of [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] front-ends for OS integration of encryption and [[key management]] as well as GnuPG installations via [[Installer (macOS)|Installer]] [[Package manager|packages]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Mac GPG Suite|url=https://gpgtools.org/''|publisher=GPG Suite|accessdate=2017-12-24}}</ref> for [[macOS]]. Furthermore, the GPG Suite Installer<ref>{{cite web|title=Mac GPG Suite installer|url=https://gpgtools.org/gpgsuite.html''|publisher=GPG Suite|accessdate=2017-12-24}}</ref> installs all related OpenPGP applications (GPG Keychain Access), plugins ([[GPGMail]]) and dependencies (MacGPG) to use GnuPG based encryption.\n\n[[Instant messaging]] applications such as [[Psi (instant messaging client)|Psi]] and [[Fire (instant messaging client)|Fire]] can automatically secure messages when GnuPG is installed and configured. Web-based software such as [[Horde (software)|Horde]] also makes use of it. The cross-platform [[Add-on (Mozilla)|extension]] [[Enigmail]] provides GnuPG support for [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[SeaMonkey]]. Similarly, [[Enigform]] provides GnuPG support for [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]].  FireGPG was discontinued June 7, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2010/06/07/firegpg-discontinued/|title=FireGPG\u2019s developers blog|accessdate=July 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727112311/http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2010/06/07/firegpg-discontinued/|archive-date=July 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, g10 Code GmbH and Intevation GmbH released [[Gpg4win]], a software suite that includes GnuPG for Windows, GNU Privacy Assistant, and GnuPG plug-ins for [[File Explorer|Windows Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]]. These tools are wrapped in a standard Windows installer, making it easier for GnuPG to be installed and used on Windows systems.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n== {{Anchor|GPGME}}Limitations ==\nAs a command-line-based system, GnuPG&nbsp;1.x is not written as an [[Application programming interface|API]] that may be incorporated into other software.  To overcome this, ''GPGME'' (abbreviated from ''GnuPG Made Easy'') was created as an API wrapper around GnuPG that [[parsing|parses]] the output of GnuPG and provides a stable and maintainable API between the components.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.gnupg.org/%28it%29/related_software/gpgme/index.html\n | title = GPGME (GnuPG Made Easy)\n | date = February 11, 2015\n | accessdate = March 3, 2015\n | website = gnupg.org\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150217100145/https://www.gnupg.org/%28it%29/related_software/gpgme/index.html\n | archive-date = February 17, 2015\n | url-status = live\n }}</ref>  This currently requires an out-of-process call to the GnuPG executable for many GPGME API calls; as a result, possible security problems in an application do not propagate to the actual crypto code {{citation needed|date=June 2017}} due to the process barrier.  Various graphical front-ends based on GPGME have been created.\n\nSince GnuPG&nbsp;2.0, many of GnuPG's functions are available directly as C APIs in [[Libgcrypt]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Libraries|url=https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/libraries.en.html#lib-libgcrypt|website=GNUPG|accessdate=2 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208072115/https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/libraries.en.html#lib-libgcrypt|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Vulnerabilities ==\nThe OpenPGP standard specifies several methods of [[digital signature|digitally signing]] messages. In 2003, due to an error in a change to GnuPG intended to make one of those methods more efficient, a security vulnerability was introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.di.ens.fr/~pnguyen/pub_Ng04.htm|title=Can We Trust Cryptographic Software?
