He first gained attention as the lead singer of [[Judas Priest]], and then [[Iced Earth]]. He took the nickname \"Ripper\" from the Judas Priest song \"[[The Ripper (song)|The Ripper]]\" during his time in the tribute band \"British Steel\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|title=Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tim-quot-ripper-quot-owens-mn0000499459|work=Allmusic|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> Much like [[Rob Halford|his predecessor]], Owens possesses a powerful wide ranging singing voice.\n\n==Early life==\nOwens was born on September 13, 1967, in [[Akron, Ohio]]. He graduated from [[Kenmore High School]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kerry |last=Clawson |title=Vocal Music Teacher Leaves Akron Schools on High Note |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/local/vocal-music-teacher-leaves-akron-schools-on-high-note-1.491902 |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-05-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Brainicide and Winter's Bane/British Steel===\nOwens began his musical career as the singer for Brainicide, a thrash metal band based in his home town of [[Akron, Ohio]] that had also been known as Dammage, Inc.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Brainicide/53735#band_tab_discography|title=Brainicide - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> He recorded 3 demo tapes with them before the band split in 1989.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\"/> Prior to joining [[Judas Priest]] in 1996, Owens fronted a band called [[Winter's Bane]], with whom he recorded an album called ''[[Heart of a Killer]]'' in 1993. He was most prominent in his role as the frontman of [[Judas Priest]] [[tribute band]] British Steel, named after the [[British Steel (album)|Judas Priest album]], although the bands Winter's Bane and British Steel were actually one and the same. The band would often open their shows as Winter's Bane in order to introduce the audience to their original material. After finishing their original set, they would then take a break, which included a wardrobe change to emulate the subject of their tribute, Judas Priest. Winter's Bane sound engineer Ken Reffner would come out from behind the soundboard, adding a fifth member to the stage. Reffner can be seen playing the part of [[K. K. Downing]] with British Steel in the Judas Priest episode of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''.\n\n===Judas Priest===\nOwens made headlines in 1996 when he went from being a fan of the [[heavy metal music|metal]] act [[Judas Priest]] to being their lead singer, replacing [[Rob Halford]]. Despite numerous rumors that Halford would reunite with Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, as well as two live albums and a 2002 DVD release. Owens also helped write one Judas Priest song, \"What's My Name?\", which was a bonus track on ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]''. With Judas Priest, he was nominated once for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] in 1999, with the song \"Bullet Train\" from the album ''[[Jugulator]]'', but lost to [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Better than You (Metallica song)|Better than You]]\".\n\n====''Rock Star''====\nThe movie ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'' (2001), about a tribute band singer who is asked to join the band he has tried to imitate, was loosely based on Owens' career. Judas Priest disavowed the movie after they were denied creative control in the screenplay and script.<ref name=\"movie flap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444846/judas-priest-movie-flap.jhtml|title=Judas Priest Turn Their Backs on \"Rock Star\" Movie|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref> For example, in ''Rock Star'' the band throws out their original singer while on tour and replaces him a few days later; while in real life, Rob Halford was not thrown out, but left Judas Priest, four years before he was replaced. Owens said of the movie, \"They fabricated things and decided to pull away from my story and make their own because I guess mine was too normal. There's no telling what they put in there. If I could sue, I would.\"<ref name=\"movie flap\" />\n\n===Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force===\nJudas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. Owens seized opportunity when, that same year, vocalist [[Matt Barlow]] quit [[Iced Earth]]. Iced Earth's first album with Owens, ''[[The Glorious Burden]]'', came out in early 2004. While singing with Judas Priest, Owens had toured with Iced Earth (and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]) in 2001, but the tour was cut short. In 2006, Owens also reunited with his former Winter's Bane colleague [[Dennis Hayes (bassist)|Dennis Hayes]] in a band called [[Beyond Fear]]. The self-titled debut album from his new band was released in May of that year. Hayes would join Iced Earth as well in 2007 after bassist James \"Bo\" Wallace left due to family health issues.\n\nOwens' stay in Iced Earth was short, however, as on December 11, 2007, guitarist [[Jon Schaffer]] announced that Owens would be leaving the band; Matt Barlow had been invited to return to the line-up after heavy feedback from fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574|title=Vocalist Matt Barlow Rejoins Iced Earth|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606234913/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574|archivedate=2011-06-06}}</ref>\n\nOn February 26, 2008, it was announced that Owens would be the new lead singer for [[Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force]], replacing [[Doogie White]]. Owens quit Malmsteen's band in 2012, saying there were conflicts in show dates between his solo band and Yngwie's touring, but that he would be open to the possibility of working with him again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tim-ripper-owens-why-i-quit-yngwie-malmsteens-band/|title=TIM 'RIPPER' OWENS: Why I Quit YNGWIE MALMSTEEN's Band|last=Blabbermouth|date=20 October 2015|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Tim_%22Ripper%22_Owens/3198|title=Tim \"Ripper\" Owens - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2009, Owens released his first solo album, ''Play My Game''.

The origin of the band's name was explained on May 20, 2009. It derives from a series of radio prank calls Christy made to a Christian radio station. In response to the pranks they received, the host described how he prays for them, thus \"saving their soul to be saved by God's grace...not in the devil's hell where you'd be putting your nails in the charred walls of the damned\". The band features Christy on drums, and Owens on vocals along with [[Steve DiGiorgio]] (bass guitar) and [[Jason Suecof]] (lead guitar). The band's debut self-titled album was released on February 2, 2010 on [[Metal Blade Records]]. Owens is also a member of a cover band called [[HAIL!]]. HAIL!'s rotating cast of members include Owens, [[Andreas Kisser]], [[Paul Bostaph]], [[David Ellefson]], [[Mike Portnoy]], [[Jimmy DeGrasso]] and [[Roy Mayorga]]. Owens, DeGrasso, Ellefson and Kisser formed the band in late 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hailthemasses.com/theband/theband.aspx |title=hailthemasses.com |publisher=hailthemasses.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>  The band toured Europe in 2009, June 2010, and also came together to perform at a benefit for [[Deftones]] bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] in 2010. That line-up consisted of Owens, Portnoy, Mark Anthony of [[the Letter Black]], [[Phil Demmel]] of [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] and Ellefson. HAIL! is on their second European tour with the following line-up: [[Andreas Kisser]], Owens, [[Paul Bostaph]] and [[James LoMenzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hailthemasses.com/tourinfo/tour.aspx |title=hailthemasses.com |publisher=hailthemasses.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=56225|title=Hail! to Continue Tour Despite Paul Gray's Passing; James Lomenzo to Step In|publisher=Metal Underground}}</ref> Due to the death of previously announced bassist [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]], LoMenzo agreed on one day's notice to fly to Portugal for the Rock In Rio Festival where HAIL! was scheduled to perform on May 30, 2010.

He first gained attention as the lead singer of [[Judas Priest]], and then [[Iced Earth]]. He took the nickname \"Ripper\" from the Judas Priest song \"[[The Ripper (song)|The Ripper]]\" during his time in the tribute band \"British Steel\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|title=Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tim-quot-ripper-quot-owens-mn0000499459|work=Allmusic|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> Much like [[his predecessor|Rob Halford]], Owens possesses a powerful wide ranging singing voice.\n\n==Early life==\nOwens was born on September 13, 1967, in [[Akron, Ohio]]. He graduated from [[Kenmore High School]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kerry |last=Clawson |title=Vocal Music Teacher Leaves Akron Schools on High Note |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/local/vocal-music-teacher-leaves-akron-schools-on-high-note-1.491902 |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-05-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Brainicide and Winter's Bane/British Steel===\nOwens began his musical career as the singer for Brainicide, a thrash metal band based in his home town of [[Akron, Ohio]] that had also been known as Dammage, Inc.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Brainicide/53735#band_tab_discography|title=Brainicide - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> He recorded 3 demo tapes with them before the band split in 1989.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\"/> Prior to joining [[Judas Priest]] in 1996, Owens fronted a band called [[Winter's Bane]], with whom he recorded an album called ''[[Heart of a Killer]]'' in 1993. He was most prominent in his role as the frontman of [[Judas Priest]] [[tribute band]] British Steel, named after the [[British Steel (album)|Judas Priest album]], although the bands Winter's Bane and British Steel were actually one and the same. The band would often open their shows as Winter's Bane in order to introduce the audience to their original material. After finishing their original set, they would then take a break, which included a wardrobe change to emulate the subject of their tribute, Judas Priest. Winter's Bane sound engineer Ken Reffner would come out from behind the soundboard, adding a fifth member to the stage. Reffner can be seen playing the part of [[K. K. Downing]] with British Steel in the Judas Priest episode of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''.\n\n===Judas Priest===\nOwens made headlines in 1996 when he went from being a fan of the [[heavy metal music|metal]] act [[Judas Priest]] to being their lead singer, replacing [[Rob Halford]]. Despite numerous rumors that Halford would reunite with Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, as well as two live albums and a 2002 DVD release. Owens also helped write one Judas Priest song, \"What's My Name?\", which was a bonus track on ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]''. With Judas Priest, he was nominated once for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] in 1999, with the song \"Bullet Train\" from the album ''[[Jugulator]]'', but lost to [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Better than You (Metallica song)|Better than You]]\".\n\n====''Rock Star''====\nThe movie ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'' (2001), about a tribute band singer who is asked to join the band he has tried to imitate, was loosely based on Owens' career. Judas Priest disavowed the movie after they were denied creative control in the screenplay and script.<ref name=\"movie flap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444846/judas-priest-movie-flap.jhtml|title=Judas Priest Turn Their Backs on \"Rock Star\" Movie|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref> For example, in ''Rock Star'' the band throws out their original singer while on tour and replaces him a few days later; while in real life, Rob Halford was not thrown out, but left Judas Priest, four years before he was replaced. Owens said of the movie, \"They fabricated things and decided to pull away from my story and make their own because I guess mine was too normal. There's no telling what they put in there. If I could sue, I would.\"<ref name=\"movie flap\" />\n\n===Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force===\nJudas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. Owens seized opportunity when, that same year, vocalist [[Matt Barlow]] quit [[Iced Earth]]. Iced Earth's first album with Owens, ''[[The Glorious Burden]]'', came out in early 2004. While singing with Judas Priest, Owens had toured with Iced Earth (and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]) in 2001, but the tour was cut short. In 2006, Owens also reunited with his former Winter's Bane colleague [[Dennis Hayes (bassist)|Dennis Hayes]] in a band called [[Beyond Fear]]. The self-titled debut album from his new band was released in May of that year. Hayes would join Iced Earth as well in 2007 after bassist James \"Bo\" Wallace left due to family health issues.\n\nOwens' stay in Iced Earth was short, however, as on December 11, 2007, guitarist [[Jon Schaffer]] announced that Owens would be leaving the band; Matt Barlow had been invited to return to the line-up after heavy feedback from fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574|title=Vocalist Matt Barlow Rejoins Iced Earth|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606234913/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574|archivedate=2011-06-06}}</ref>\n\nOn February 26, 2008, it was announced that Owens would be the new lead singer for [[Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force]], replacing [[Doogie White]]. Owens quit Malmsteen's band in 2012, saying there were conflicts in show dates between his solo band and Yngwie's touring, but that he would be open to the possibility of working with him again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tim-ripper-owens-why-i-quit-yngwie-malmsteens-band/|title=TIM 'RIPPER' OWENS: Why I Quit YNGWIE MALMSTEEN's Band|last=Blabbermouth|date=20 October 2015|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Tim_%22Ripper%22_Owens/3198|title=Tim \"Ripper\" Owens - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2009, Owens released his first solo album, ''Play My Game''.

The origin of the band's name was explained on May 20, 2009. It derives from a series of radio prank calls Christy made to a Christian radio station. In response to the pranks they received, the host described how he prays for them, thus \"saving their soul to be saved by God's grace...not in the devil's hell where you'd be putting your nails in the charred walls of the damned\". The band features Christy on drums, and Owens on vocals along with [[Steve DiGiorgio]] (bass guitar) and [[Jason Suecof]] (lead guitar). The band's debut self-titled album was released on February 2, 2010 on [[Metal Blade Records]]. Owens is also a member of a cover band called [[HAIL!]]. HAIL!'s rotating cast of members include Owens, [[Andreas Kisser]], [[Paul Bostaph]], [[David Ellefson]], [[Mike Portnoy]], [[Jimmy DeGrasso]] and [[Roy Mayorga]]. Owens, DeGrasso, Ellefson and Kisser formed the band in late 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hailthemasses.com/theband/theband.aspx |title=hailthemasses.com |publisher=hailthemasses.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>  The band toured Europe in 2009, June 2010, and also came together to perform at a benefit for [[Deftones]] bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] in 2010. That line-up consisted of Owens, Portnoy, Mark Anthony of [[the Letter Black]], [[Phil Demmel]] of [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] and Ellefson. HAIL! is on their second European tour with the following line-up: [[Andreas Kisser]], Owens, [[Paul Bostaph]] and [[James LoMenzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hailthemasses.com/tourinfo/tour.aspx |title=hailthemasses.com |publisher=hailthemasses.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=56225|title=Hail! to Continue Tour Despite Paul Gray's Passing; James Lomenzo to Step In|publisher=Metal Underground}}</ref> Due to the death of previously announced bassist [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]], LoMenzo agreed on one day's notice to fly to Portugal for the Rock In Rio Festival where HAIL! was scheduled to perform on May 30, 2010.

The film was Parajanov's first major work and earned him international acclaim for its rich use of costume and color. The film also features a detailed portrayal of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Hutsul]] culture, showing not only the harsh [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] environment and brutal family rivalries, but also the various aspects of Hutsul traditions, music, costumes, and dialect.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a small [[Hutsul]] village in the [[Carpathian mountains]] of [[Ukraine]], a young man, Ivan, falls in love with the daughter of the man who killed his father. Though their families share a bitter enmity, Ivan and Marichka have known each other since childhood. In preparation for their marriage, Ivan leaves the village to work and earn money for a household. While he is gone, Marichka accidentally slips into a river and drowns while trying to rescue a lost lamb.\n\nIvan returns and falls into despair after seeing Marichka's body. He continues to work, enduring a period of joyless toil, until he meets another woman, Palahna, while shoeing a horse. Ivan and Palahna get married in a traditional [[Hutsul]] wedding in which they are blindfolded and yoked together. The marriage quickly turns sour, however, as Ivan remains obsessed with the memory of Marichka. Estranged from her emotionally distant husband, Palahna becomes involved with a local sorcerer, while Ivan begins to experience hallucinations.\n\nAt a tavern, Ivan witnesses the sorcerer embrace Palahna and strike one of his friends. Roused into an uncharacteristic fury, Ivan snatches up his axe, only to be struck down by the sorcerer. Ivan stumbles into the nearby woods and perceives Marichka's spirit to be with him, reflected in the water and gliding amongst the trees. As reality merges into dream, the colorless shade of Marichka reaches out across a great space and touches Ivan's outstretched hand. Ivan screams and dies. The community gives him a traditional Hutsul burial while children watch through cross braced windows.\n\n==Themes==\nThe film is highly symbolic, making frequent use of religious and folkloric images that include crosses, lambs, graves, and spirits. The film also uses color to represent mood. During Ivan's period of mourning, black and white film stock is used. In other scenes, colors are often muted, but provide a contrast to vivid use of red and yellow. On its release, the film's presentation contrasted with the common [[socialist realism]] style that had government approval. After refusing to change the film, Parajanov was soon blacklisted from Soviet cinema.<ref>[http://www.parajanov.com/maestro.html Sergei Paradzhanov<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ivan Mykolaichuk]] - Ivan\n* [[Larisa Kadochnikova]] - Marichka\n* {{Interlanguage link|Tatyana Bestayeva|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} - Palagna\n* [[Spartak Bagashvili]] - Yurko\n* [[Nikolai Grinko]] - Batag\n* [[Leonid Yengibarov]] - Miko\n* [[Nina Alisova]] - Paliychuk\n\n==Release==\nThe film began an international film festival tour in Spring 1965.<ref name=\"Steffen\">{{cite book |last= Steffen |first=James |date=2013 |title= The Cinema of Sergei Parajanov |url= https://books.google.com/?id=RbDxAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |isbn=9780299296537 |page=73 }}</ref>\nPolitical protest followed the premiere of ''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors'' in [[Kiev]] on 4 September 1965.<ref name=\"SteffenXVI\" />\n\nThe film was seen by 8.5 million viewers in the USSR.<ref>[http://ezhe.ru/cgi-bin/vgik-bd.cgi?g=g775]</ref>\n\n==Filming==\n[[File:Carpathians-satellite.jpg|thumb|The film is set in the Ukrainian part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].]]\nParts of the film were shot in the [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]].\n\n==Awards==\nGrand Prix at Mar del Plata International Film Festival (1965).

Jack is a massive bender \n\nThe programme is currently presented by [[John Craven]], [[Adam Henson]], [[Matt Baker (television presenter)|Matt Baker]], [[Tom Heap]], [[Ellie Harrison (journalist)|Ellie Harrison]], [[Paul Martin (TV presenter)|Paul Martin]], [[Anita Rani]], [[Helen Skelton]], [[Steve Brown (wheelchair rugby)|Steve Brown]], [[Charlotte Smith (broadcaster)|Charlotte Smith]], and [[Sean Fletcher]].\n\n==History==\nThe show was first broadcast on 24 July 1988 as ''Country File''. While farming remained a core ingredient, the programme held a much broader brief\u2014to investigate rural issues and celebrate the beauty and diversity of the [[British countryside]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01d4z5h|title=Country File 24 July 1988, History of the BBC|website=BBC|access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref>\n\nAnne Brown and Chris Baines fronted the programme for its first year under its original producer Mike Fitzgerald. The programme was modelled on a regional BBC magazine series called \"Your Country Needs You\", presented by Chris Baines, Directed by Ann Brown and produced by Mike Fitzgerald.\n\nBroadcaster [[John Craven]] started fronting the Sunday morning programme in 1989. The programme was originally 30 minutes in length.\n\nIn April 2009, ''Countryfile'' moved to an early Sunday evening slot, with [[Matt Baker (television presenter)|Matt Baker]] and [[Julia Bradbury]] joining [[John Craven]] as co-presenters. [[Tom Heap]] and [[Ellie Harrison (journalist)|Ellie Harrison]] also joined in 2009. In 2014, [[Helen Skelton]] became a presenter and in 2015, [[Anita Rani]] joined the programme.\n\nThe programme currently airs 52 weeks of the year and includes a five-day weather forecast live from the BBC's weather studio in London.\n\n''Countryfile'' was originally produced by [[BBC Birmingham]], moving to its new home of [[BBC Natural History Unit|BBC Bristol]] in 2012.\n\n==Overview==\nEpisodes are typically centred on two lead presenters visiting a place or region, and uncovering the stories, characters and traditions which make that area distinctive. Typical subject matter includes wildlife, conservation, farming and food production, the arts, countryside crafts, social history and leisure activities. Presenters and guests are often wearing [[British country clothing]], episodes may include several segments with other presenters, uncovering other stories in the region. Compilation programmes occasionally air with a thematic focus, with a reduced number of original segments typically featuring one lead presenter only, and several other segments repeated from previous shows.\n\nJournalism remains an integral part of the programme's agenda. BBC News's Rural Affairs Correspondent [[Tom Heap]] or John Craven presents a weekly investigation into the big issues affecting the British countryside. Recent examples include the impact of animal diseases, the move towards renewable energy, environmental disasters, threats to rural services as well as changes to farming policy and practices.\n\nFarmer Adam Henson joined the programme in 2001 following a search to find a new presenter amongst programme viewers. In 2009 he started fronting the weekly \"Adam's Farm\" strand which gives viewers an insight into the challenges of running a mixed farm in the [[Cotswolds]]. His father, Joe Henson, was one of the original founders of the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]].\n\nIn 2013 the programme marked its 25th anniversary with a special edition guest-edited by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]]. ''Countryfile: A Royal Appointment'' saw the team joining the Prince on [[Duchy Home Farm|his Gloucestershire farm]] where he shared his passion for the British countryside, rare breed animals, organic farming and hedge-laying. ''Countryfile'' also accompanied him on a trip to [[County Durham]] to find out what's being done to help struggling hill farmers before heading to a London comprehensive where pupils are growing and cooking their own food with remarkable results. The Silver Jubilee celebrations continued well into July when 250 viewers were invited to a traditional summer fayre held on Adam Henson's farm. The anniversary was marked by a new title sequence and re-versioned music composed by David Lowe.\n\nOctober 2013 also saw the programme uniting with another BBC institution. Ireland went on to win ''[[One Man and His Dog|Countryfile's One Man and His Dog]]'', which was broadcast on 27 October.\n\n===Magazine===\nThe BBC's ''Countryfile'' magazine was launched in 2007 and is now published by Immediate Media Co.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.immediate.co.uk/brands/countryfile/|title=BBC Countryfile Magazine - Immediate Media Co \u2013 The Special Interest Content and Platform Company|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buysubscriptions.com/science-nature-magazines/country-file-magazine-subscription|title=BBC Countryfile Magazine Subscription|publisher=}}</ref> The current editor is Fergus Collins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryfile.com|title=Countryfile.com - News, walks & photos from BBC Countryfile Magazine|website=www.countryfile.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Photographic competition===\nThe ''Countryfile Photographic Competition'' remains a highlight of the programme's year.

While farming remained a core ingredient, the programme held a much broader brief\u2014to investigate rural issues and celebrate the beauty and diversity of the [[British countryside]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01d4z5h|title=Country File 24 July 1988, History of the BBC|website=BBC|access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref>\n\nAnne Brown and Chris Baines fronted the programme for its first year under its original producer Mike Fitzgerald. The programme was modelled on a regional BBC magazine series called \"Your Country Needs You\", presented by Chris Baines, Directed by Ann Brown and produced by Mike Fitzgerald.\n\nBroadcaster [[John Craven]] started fronting the Sunday morning programme in 1989. The programme was originally 30 minutes in length.\n\nIn April 2009, ''Countryfile'' moved to an early Sunday evening slot, with [[Matt Baker (television presenter)|Matt Baker]] and [[Julia Bradbury]] joining [[John Craven]] as co-presenters. [[Tom Heap]] and [[Ellie Harrison (journalist)|Ellie Harrison]] also joined in 2009. In 2014, [[Helen Skelton]] became a presenter and in 2015, [[Anita Rani]] joined the programme.\n\nThe programme currently airs 52 weeks of the year and includes a five-day weather forecast live from the BBC's weather studio in London.\n\n''Countryfile'' was originally produced by [[BBC Birmingham]], moving to its new home of [[BBC Natural History Unit|BBC Bristol]] in 2012.\n\n==Overview==\nEpisodes are typically centred on two lead presenters visiting a place or region, and uncovering the stories, characters and traditions which make that area distinctive. Typical subject matter includes wildlife, conservation, farming and food production, the arts, countryside crafts, social history and leisure activities. Presenters and guests are often wearing [[British country clothing]], episodes may include several segments with other presenters, uncovering other stories in the region. Compilation programmes occasionally air with a thematic focus, with a reduced number of original segments typically featuring one lead presenter only, and several other segments repeated from previous shows.\n\nJournalism remains an integral part of the programme's agenda. BBC News's Rural Affairs Correspondent [[Tom Heap]] or John Craven presents a weekly investigation into the big issues affecting the British countryside. Recent examples include the impact of animal diseases, the move towards renewable energy, environmental disasters, threats to rural services as well as changes to farming policy and practices.\n\nFarmer Adam Henson joined the programme in 2001 following a search to find a new presenter amongst programme viewers. In 2009 he started fronting the weekly \"Adam's Farm\" strand which gives viewers an insight into the challenges of running a mixed farm in the [[Cotswolds]]. His father, Joe Henson, was one of the original founders of the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]].\n\nIn 2013 the programme marked its 25th anniversary with a special edition guest-edited by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]]. ''Countryfile: A Royal Appointment'' saw the team joining the Prince on [[Duchy Home Farm|his Gloucestershire farm]] where he shared his passion for the British countryside, rare breed animals, organic farming and hedge-laying. ''Countryfile'' also accompanied him on a trip to [[County Durham]] to find out what's being done to help struggling hill farmers before heading to a London comprehensive where pupils are growing and cooking their own food with remarkable results. The Silver Jubilee celebrations continued well into July when 250 viewers were invited to a traditional summer fayre held on Adam Henson's farm. The anniversary was marked by a new title sequence and re-versioned music composed by David Lowe.\n\nOctober 2013 also saw the programme uniting with another BBC institution. Ireland went on to win ''[[One Man and His Dog|Countryfile's One Man and His Dog]]'', which was broadcast on 27 October.\n\n===Magazine===\nThe BBC's ''Countryfile'' magazine was launched in 2007 and is now published by Immediate Media Co.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.immediate.co.uk/brands/countryfile/|title=BBC Countryfile Magazine - Immediate Media Co \u2013 The Special Interest Content and Platform Company|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buysubscriptions.com/science-nature-magazines/country-file-magazine-subscription|title=BBC Countryfile Magazine Subscription|publisher=}}</ref> The current editor is Fergus Collins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryfile.com|title=Countryfile.com - News, walks & photos from BBC Countryfile Magazine|website=www.countryfile.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Photographic competition===\nThe ''Countryfile Photographic Competition'' remains a highlight of the programme's year.

The series centers on the surreal life of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] Australian-immigrant [[wallaby]]<!--Do not change. Rocko is referred to as a wallaby, despite constantly being called \"Kangaroo Boy\".--> named [[Rocko]] and his friends: the eccentric steer<!--Do not change, despite the running gag of everyone mistaking Heff for a cow, he always corrects them as \"steer\".--> [[Heffer Wolfe]], the neurotic turtle [[Filburt Shellbach|Filburt]], and Rocko's faithful dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]]. It is set in the fictional town of O-Town. Throughout its run, this show was [[controversial]] for its [[adult humor]], including [[double entendre]], [[innuendo]], and [[satirical]] social commentary, similar to ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.\n\nMurray created the title character for an unpublished comic book series in the late 1980s, and later reluctantly pitched the series to Nickelodeon, who were looking for edgier cartoonists for their then-new [[Nicktoons]]. The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom, with the writers targeting both children and adults. The show premiered on September 18, 1993, and ended on November 24, 1996, totaling four seasons and 52 episodes. A [[Television special|special]], entitled ''[[Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling]]'', was [[Streaming media|digitally released]] on [[Netflix]] on August 9, 2019.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NickRewind/status/1151114646767771649|title=Rocko is still living a MODERN life in the Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling movie coming to @netflix 8/9pic.twitter.com/G3Ms8eJgAT|last=NickRewind|date=2019-07-16|website=@NickRewind|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe show launched the careers of voice actors [[Carlos Alazraqui]] and [[Tom Kenny]].

Living next door to Rocko is a middle-aged couple, [[Ed Bighead]] ([[Charlie Adler]]), a cynical and cantankerous toad<!--They are always referred to as toads on the show, not frogs.

Murray said that he matched personalities of his characters to the various animals in the series to form a social [[caricature]].<ref name=\"CNMurrayInterview\"/>\n\n===Setting===\n''Rocko's Modern Life'' is set in a generic fictional American town called O-Town, located near the [[Great Lakes]]. Places in the town include: Chokey Chicken (later renamed \"Chewy Chicken\" due to the former name referring to [[masturbation]]), a parody of [[KFC]] and a favorite restaurant/hang-out place for Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt; Conglom-O Corporation, a [[megacorporation]] with the slogan \"We own you\" that owns everything in town; [[Hell|Heck]], a place of eternal torment run by [[Satan|Peaches]] where \"bad people\" go when they die; Holl-o-Wood, a town that resembles [[Hollywood]]; and Kind of a Lot O' Comics, a [[comic book]] store owned by a cruel toad named Mr. Smitty, where Rocko works.\n\nMany of the locations in ''Rocko's Modern Life'' have the letter \"O\" in them; for example, O-Town and Conglom-O Corporation. When asked about the use of \"O\" in his show, Murray said:\n{{quote|I always got a big kick out of the businesses that were 'House-O-Paint', or 'Ton-O-Noodles', because their names seemed to homogenize what they sold, and strip the products of true individuality and stress volume ... and we all know, the American dream is volume! So what better company to create volume than 'Conglom-O', and since a majority of the town worked at Conglom-O, it should be called 'O' Town. I also wanted the town to be 'anytown' USA, and I used to love sports players with a big ZERO on their back. It was funny to me.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/>}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Joe Murray publicity shot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Rocko's Modern Life'' creator Joe Murray.]]\nOriginally, the character appeared in an unpublished comic book titled ''Travis''. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks.

Marvel purchased the license for Rocko from Nickelodeon.

John \"Lewie\" Lewandowski wrote all of the stories except for one; [[Joey Cavalieri]] wrote \"Beaten by a Club\", the second story of Issue #4.\n\nTroy Little, a resident of [[Monroe, Oregon]], wrote to Marvel requesting that the title for the comic's [[comic book letter column|letters column]] should be \"That's Life\".

The series centers on the surreal life of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] Australian-immigrant [[wallaby]]<!--Do not change. Rocko is referred to as a wallaby, despite constantly being called \"Kangaroo Boy\".--> named [[Rocko]] and his friends: the eccentric steer<!--Do not change, despite the running gag of everyone mistaking Heff for a cow, he always corrects them as \"steer\".--> [[Heffer Wolfe]], the neurotic turtle [[Filburt Shellbach|Filburt]], and Rocko's faithful dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]]. It is set in the fictional town of O-Town. Throughout its run, this show was [[controversial]] for its [[adult humor]], including [[double entendre]], [[innuendo]], and [[satirical]] social commentary, similar to ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.\n\nMurray created the title character for an unpublished comic book series in the late 1980s, and later reluctantly pitched the series to Nickelodeon, who were looking for edgier cartoonists for their then-new [[Nicktoons]]. The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom, with the writers targeting both children and adults. The show premiered on September 18, 1993, and ended on November 24, 1996, totaling four seasons and 52 episodes. A [[Television special|special]], entitled ''[[Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling]]'', was [[Streaming media|digitally released]] on [[Netflix]] on August 9, 2019.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NickRewind/status/1151114646767771649|title=Rocko is still living a MODERN life in the Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling movie coming to @netflix 8/9pic.twitter.com/G3Ms8eJgAT|last=NickRewind|date=2019-07-16|website=@NickRewind|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe show launched the careers of voice actors [[Carlos Alazraqui]] and [[Tom Kenny]]. After the show's cancellation, much of the staff regrouped to work on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', created by ''Rocko''{{'}}s creative director [[Stephen Hillenburg]].\n\n==Premise==\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Rocko's Modern Life characters}}\n''Rocko's Modern Life'' follows the life of an easily frightened Australian immigrant [[wallaby]]<!--Do not change. Rocko is referred to as a wallaby, despite constantly being called \"Kangaroo Boy\".--> named [[Rocko]] (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]), who encounters various dilemmas and situations regarding otherwise mundane aspects of life. His best friends are: [[Heffer Wolfe]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), a fat and enthusiastic steer<!--Do not change, despite the running gag of everyone mistaking Heff for a cow, he always corrects them as \"steer\".-->; [[Filburt]] ([[Mr. Lawrence]]), a neurotic turtle who often feels awkward or disturbed; and his faithful dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]] (Alazraqui). Living next door to Rocko is a middle-aged couple, [[Ed Bighead]] ([[Charlie Adler]]), a cynical and cantankerous toad<!--They are always referred to as toads on the show, not frogs. Do not change.--> who despises Rocko; and his compassionate and more friendly wife Bev (Adler).\n\nAll of the characters in ''Rocko's Modern Life'' are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals of varying species, the vast majority of whom are mentally unstable. Murray said that he matched personalities of his characters to the various animals in the series to form a social [[caricature]].<ref name=\"CNMurrayInterview\"/>\n\n===Setting===\n''Rocko's Modern Life'' is set in a generic fictional American town called O-Town, located near the [[Great Lakes]]. Places in the town include: Chokey Chicken (later renamed \"Chewy Chicken\" due to the former name referring to [[masturbation]]), a parody of [[KFC]] and a favorite restaurant/hang-out place for Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt; Conglom-O Corporation, a [[megacorporation]] with the slogan \"We own you\" that owns everything in town; [[Hell|Heck]], a place of eternal torment run by [[Satan|Peaches]] where \"bad people\" go when they die; Holl-o-Wood, a town that resembles [[Hollywood]]; and Kind of a Lot O' Comics, a [[comic book]] store owned by a cruel toad named Mr. Smitty, where Rocko works.\n\nMany of the locations in ''Rocko's Modern Life'' have the letter \"O\" in them; for example, O-Town and Conglom-O Corporation. When asked about the use of \"O\" in his show, Murray said:\n{{quote|I always got a big kick out of the businesses that were 'House-O-Paint', or 'Ton-O-Noodles', because their names seemed to homogenize what they sold, and strip the products of true individuality and stress volume ... and we all know, the American dream is volume! So what better company to create volume than 'Conglom-O', and since a majority of the town worked at Conglom-O, it should be called 'O' Town. I also wanted the town to be 'anytown' USA, and I used to love sports players with a big ZERO on their back. It was funny to me.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/>}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Joe Murray publicity shot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Rocko's Modern Life'' creator Joe Murray.]]\nOriginally, the character appeared in an unpublished comic book titled ''Travis''. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks. He described the early 1990s animation atmosphere as \"ripe for this kind of project. We took some chances that would be hard to do in these current times (the 1990s)\".<ref name=\"MurrayRockoHome\">\n\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110206001351/http://www.joemurraystudio.com/tv/rocko.shtml Rocko's Modern Life]\", ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''\n</ref> Murray wanted funding for his independent film ''My Dog Zero'', so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. He presented a pencil test to [[Nickelodeon]], which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show. Murray had never worked in television before.<ref name=\"harrington\"/> The industry was coming out of a \"[[Animation in the United States in the television era#Commercialization and counterculture|rough period]]\" and Murray wanted to \"shake things up a bit\".<ref name=\"awn\"/>\n\n[[Linda Simensky]], then in charge of animation development in Nickelodeon, described the [[Nicktoons]] lineup and concept to Murray. He originally felt skepticism towards the concept of creating a Nicktoon as he disliked television cartoons. Simensky told him that Nicktoons differed from other cartoons. He then told her that he believed that ''My Dog Zero'' would not work as a cartoon. He then researched Nickelodeon at the library and found that Nickelodeon's \"attitude was different than regular TV\".<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/> The cable network providers were \"making their own rules\": for example, Murray stated that he \"didn't write for children\", which the executives were fine with.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> Murray was unsure at first, but was inspired by independent animation around him, such as Animation Celebration and [[MTV]]'s ''[[Liquid Television]]'', and gave the network a shot.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> At the time, Nickelodeon was selling itself as a network-based as much around the edge as around kids' entertainment. It aimed to appeal to college students and parents as much as children.<ref name=\"theavclub\"/>\n\nMurray developed the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] and coming across a wallaby that seemed to be oblivious to the chaos around him.<ref name=\"awn\"/> Murray combed through his sketchbooks, developed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. Murray felt they would not like the pilot, and he would just collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> According to Murray, around three or four months later he had \"forgotten about\" the concept and was working on ''My Dog Zero'' when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for ''My Dog Zero''.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\">\"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/murray.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life]\", ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref> On his website he describes ''My Dog Zero'' as \"that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to ''Rocko''.\"<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100309032237/http://www.joemurraystudio.com/indie/indie.shtml Independent Filmwork]\", ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''</ref> \"Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic\" was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that [[Heffer Wolfe]], one of the characters, would be \"a little too weird for test audiences\". Murray, instead of removing Heffer from \"Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic\", decided to write \"Trash-O-Madness\" as the pilot episode.<ref name=\"TrainorMurray\"/>\n\nIn the original series pilot, Rocko was colored yellow. His color was changed when a toy merchandising company informed Nick they were interested in marketing toys but did not want to market Rocko because \"they already had a yellow character\". Murray changed Rocko's color to beige, but after the pilot aired, the company opted out of producing toys for the series, so the color change was pointless.

Instead of a finished script, the animators usually received a three-page outline, requiring them to come up with a majority of the gags and dialogue. The animation team appreciated this approach, with storyboard artist Jeff Myers, formerly of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', quoted as saying \"The script [at ''The Simpsons''] was carved in stone. Here it's ... more of a challenge and a lot more fun when we're given a rough outline.\"<ref name=\"lewiston\">{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/04/rockos_modern_life_coming_to_d.html|title=Cartoon creators relax the rules|accessdate=July 19, 2011|author=Christopher Gessel|publisher=[[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston Morning Tribune]]|date=September 11, 1993}}</ref> Murray's animation lacked parallel lines and featured crooked architecture similar to various [[Chuck Jones]] cartoons.

The first and original version can be heard playing throughout every episode in Season 1 except for episode 8. The second version of the theme song was a slightly remixed version of the first and was used for episode 8. Version 2 had high-pitched, distorted voices in the chorus. The third version of the theme song was performed by [[Kate Pierson]] and [[Fred Schneider]] from [[The B-52's]]. They performed the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' theme song for the rest of the series.\n\nAt first, Murray wanted Paul Sumares to perform the theme song since Sumares created most of the music found in ''My Dog Zero''. Murray wanted the same style in ''My Dog Zero'' exhibited in ''Rocko's Modern Life''. Nickelodeon wanted a person with more experience.<ref name=\"Sumares\"/> According to Sumares, believing for the request to be a long shot, Murray asked for [[Danny Elfman]] and felt stunned when Nickelodeon decided to honor his request by asking Elfman to perform.<ref name=\"Sumares\"/> According to Murray, Elfman, his first choice, was booked. Therefore, he chose the B-52's, his second choice.<ref name=\"Sumares\"/> According to Sumares Murray decided to use the B-52's instead of Elfman. Murray states that the difference between the stories \"could just be a recollection conflict because Paul is a brilliant amazing guy.\"<ref name=\"Sumares\"/> Murray also sought [[Alan Silvestri]]. According to Sumares, Viacom did not want to use Silvestri as the organization wanted a band \"slightly older kids could identify with.\"<ref name=\"Sumares\"/>\n\n[[Pat Irwin]], a veteran of many bands, including the New York-based instrumental group the Raybeats, and a side gig, the B-52s, spent five years as a music director on the series.

Animation]], after ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''. It initially ran a total of 99 episodes and one film being ''[[Wakko's Wish]]''.\n\n''Animaniacs'' is a [[variety show]], with short [[sketch comedy|skit]]s featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments. Hallmarks of the series included its music, character catchphrases, and humor directed at an adult audience.\n\nA reboot of the series was announced by [[Hulu]] in January 2018, with two seasons to be produced in conjunction with Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, expected to air starting on September 14th 2020.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Premise===\nThe Warner siblings live in the water tower on the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"creation\"/> However, characters from the series had episodes in various places and periods of time. The ''Animaniacs'' characters interacted with famous people and creators of the past and present as well as mythological characters and characters from contemporary pop culture and television. [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]], the casting and recording director of ''Animaniacs'', said that the Warner siblings functioned to \"tie the show together,\" by appearing in and introducing other characters' segments.<ref name=\"dvdint1\">{{cite video\n| people = Maurice LaMarche\n| title = Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 1.

The Warner kids, [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]], are three 1930s cartoon stars of an unknown species (one [[Tom Ruegger]] named \"Cartoonus characterus\") that were locked away in the [[Warner Bros.

Executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] said that the irreverence in ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons inspired the ''Animaniacs'' cast.<ref name=\"Spielberg1\"/> Tom Ruegger created ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', a series [[Sherri Stoner]] had also written for, after being inspired by the personalities of two of his ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton. Ruegger thought of the premise for ''Pinky and the Brain'' when wondering what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world.<ref name=\"pinkyorigin\">{{Cite news\n| last = Will\n| first = Ed\n| title = Brain Power: Pinky, genius pal to resume plotting in 1997\n| newspaper = The Denver Post\n| date = June 11, 1996}}</ref> Deanna Oliver contributed ''The Goodfeathers'' scripts and the character ''Chicken Boo'',<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> while Nicholas Hollander based ''Katie Kaboom'' on his teenage daughter.<ref name = \"dvdint2\"/>\n\nRuegger modeled the Warners' personalities heavily after his three sons.<ref name=\"origin1\">{{Cite news\n| title = TV Production: What a Character! Part II of a series: The Evolution of Animaniacs\n| magazine = Animation Magazine\n| page = 12\n| date = July 1995}}</ref> Because the Warners were portrayed as cartoon stars from the early [[The Golden Age of American animation|1930s]], Ruegger and other artists for ''Animaniacs'' made the images of the Warners similar to cartoon characters of the early 1930s.<ref name=\"origin1\"/> Simple black and white drawings were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s, such as<!--\n\nPlease restrain your intense urge to list more early cartoon characters here. Five major characters are listed already, and eight more are not going to clarify anything.\n\n--> [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], and the early versions of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]].\n\nSherri Stoner created ''Slappy the Squirrel'' when another writer and friend of Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner's career in TV movies playing troubled teenagers. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old, the latter developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and \"have the dirt on [them]\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Producers===\nSteven Spielberg served as executive producer, under his [[Amblin Television]] label. [[Showrunner]] and senior producer Tom Ruegger lead the overall production and writer's room. Producers Peter Hastings, [[Sherri Stoner]], [[Rusty Mills]], and Rich Arons contributed scripts for many of the episodes and had an active role during group discussions in the writer's room as well.\n\nThe writers and animators of ''Animaniacs'' used the experience gained from the previous series to create new characters cast in the mold of [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Tex Avery]]'s creations.<ref name=\"Spielberg1\">{{cite web\n| last = Carugati\n| first = Anna\n| title = Interviews: Steven Spielberg\n| work = World Screen\n| publisher = WSN Inc.\n|date=October 2006\n| url = http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011232156/http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm\n| accessdate = May 8, 2007\n| archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> Additional writers for the series included [[Liz Holzman]], [[Paul Rugg]], [[Deanna Oliver]], [[John P. McCann|John McCann]], Nicholas Hollander, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Jeff Kwitny, Earl Kress, [[Tom Minton]], and Randy Rogel. Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in writing sketch comedy<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> while others, including Kress, Minton, and Rogel, came from cartoon backgrounds.<ref name = \"airdate1\"/><ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\nMade-up stories did not exclusively comprise ''Animaniacs'' writing, as Hastings remarked: \"We weren't really there to tell compelling stories&nbsp;... [As a writer] you could do a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial&nbsp;... you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up.\"<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Writers for the series wrote into ''Animaniacs'' stories that happened to them; the episodes \"Ups and Downs,\" \"Survey Ladies,\" and \"I Got Yer Can\" were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg,<ref name=\"dvdint3a\"/> Deanna Oliver, and Stoner,<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> respectively. Another episode, \"Bumbie's Mom,\" both parodied the film ''Bambi'' and was based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\nIn an interview, the writers explained how ''Animaniacs'' allowed for non-restrictive and open writing.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because ''Animaniacs'' segments could widely vary in both time and subject,<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> while Stoner described how the ''Animaniacs'' writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story, as was the case in the episode \"The Three Muska-Warners\".<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Rugg, Hastings and Stoner also mentioned how the ''Animaniacs'' writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about parody subjects that would not be touched on other series.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\n===Cast===\n''Animaniacs'' featured [[Rob Paulsen]] as Yakko, Pinky, and Dr. Otto von Scratchansniff, [[Tress MacNeille]] as Dot, [[Jess Harnell]] as Wakko, [[Sherri Stoner]] as Slappy the Squirrel, [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the Brain, Squit and the belching segments \"The Great Wakkorotti\" (Harnell said that he himself is commonly mistaken for the role),<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> and veteran voice actor [[Frank Welker]] as Ralph the Security Guard, Thaddeus Plotz and Runt.<ref name = \"airdate1\"/> [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko: \"We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko.\" Romano said that the casters had \"no trouble\" choosing the role of Dot, referring to MacNeille as \"just hilarious&nbsp;... And yet [she had] that edge.\"<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Before Animaniacs, Harnell had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] which he \"fell into\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Harnell revealed that at the audition for the show, he did a [[John Lennon]] [[impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] and the audition \"went great\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Stoner commented that when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg, he said she should play Slappy.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> According to Romano, she personally chose [[Bernadette Peters]] to play Rita.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Other voices were provided by [[Jim Cummings]], [[Paul Rugg]], [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]], [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Gail Matthius]]. Tom Ruegger's three sons also played roles in the series. Nathan Ruegger voiced Skippy Squirrel, nephew to Slappy, throughout the duration of the series; Luke Ruegger voiced ''The Flame'' in historical segments on ''Animaniacs''; and Cody Ruegger voiced Birdie from ''Wild Blue Yonder''.\n\n===Animation===\nAnimation work on ''Animaniacs'' was farmed out to several different studios, both American and international, over the course of the show's production.

In an interview, Spielberg defended the \"irreverence\" of ''Animaniacs'', saying that the ''Animaniacs'' crew has \"a point of view\" and does not \"sit back passively and play both sides equally\".<ref name=\"Spielberg2\">\n{{Cite news\n| last = Closs\n| first = Larry\n| title = Spielberg Toons In: Moviemaker extraordinaire Steven Spielberg reveals he's also an animaniac at heart\n| periodical = TV Guide\n| pages = 33\u201336\n| date = October 28, 1995\n| url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/berg951.html\n| access-date = September 8, 2007\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213002515/http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/berg951.html\n| archive-date = December 13, 2007\n| url-status = live\n}}\n</ref> Spielberg also said that ''Animaniacs''' humor of social commentary and irreverence were inspired by the [[Marx Brothers]]<ref name=\"Spielberg2\"/> and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons.<ref name=\"Spielberg1\"/> ''Animaniacs'', among other Spielberg-produced shows, had a large amount of cartoon violence. Spielberg defended the violence in ''Animaniacs'' by saying that the series had a balance of both violent humor and educational segments, so the series would never become either too violent or \"benign\".<ref name=\"Spielberg2\"/> ''Animaniacs'' also made use of catchphrases, recurring jokes and segments, and \"adult\" humor.\n\n[[File:TTA meets YWD.jpg|right|thumb|[[List of Animaniacs characters#Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Yakko, Wakko and Dot]] shake hands with their ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' predecessors Buster and Babs Bunny and Plucky Duck, who make a cameo appearance in an episode of ''Animaniacs'']]\n\n===Recurring jokes and catchphrases===\nCharacters on ''Animaniacs'' had catchphrases, with some characters having more than one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko's \"Goodnight, everybody!\" often said following adult humor, Wakko's \"Faboo!\" and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all three Warners was \"Hello-o-o, nurse!\"<ref name=\"creation\"/> Tom Ruegger said that the \"Hello-o-o, Nurse!\" line was intended to be a catchphrase much like [[Bugs Bunny]]'s line, \"What's up, doc?\"<ref name=\"dvdint3a\"/> Before the theme song for each \"Pinky and the Brain\" segment, Pinky asks, \"Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?\" Brain replies, \"The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!\" During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, \"Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?\" and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur that changes every episode.<ref name=\"pinkyandthebrain\"/> Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode \"Win Big\", and then producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\n[[Running gags]] and recurring segments were very common in the show. The closing credits for each episode always included one joke credit and ended with a water tower gag similar to ''The Simpsons'' couch gag. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled \"The Wheel of Morality\" (which, in Yakko's words, \"adds boring educational value to what would otherwise be an almost entirely entertaining program\", and ends with a \"moral\" that makes no sense) eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once (and, in the case of the Wheel segments, enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room for anything else in the episode).<ref name=\"dvdint3a\"/>\n\n===Humor and content intended for adults===\nA great deal of ''Animaniacs' '' humor and content was aimed at an adult audience. <!--In an interview with TV Guide, Tom Ruegger stated, \"We don't just write for kids[...] We fill the stories with cultural references that people our age \u2014 for the most part, we're baby boomers \u2014 will understand, as well as [references for] younger people.\"<ref name=\"adultjokes2\">{{Cite news\n| magazine = TV Guide\n| volume = 45\n| date = 1997}}</ref>--> ''Animaniacs'' parodied the film ''A Hard Day's Night'' and the [[Three Tenors]], references that ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote were \"appealing to older audiences\".<ref name=\"adultjokes\">\n{{Cite news\n| last = Strauss\n| first = Neil\n| author-link = Neil Strauss\n| title = The Pop Life\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/arts/the-pop-life-648949.html?scp=2&sq=yakko'sworld&st=nyt&pagewanted=2\n| page = 2\n| newspaper = The New York Times\n| date = October 27, 1994\n| access-date = February 14, 2017\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121308/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/arts/the-pop-life-648949.html?scp=2&sq=yakko'sworld&st=nyt&pagewanted=2\n| archive-date = March 5, 2016\n| url-status = live\n}}\n</ref> The [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[H.M.S.

Initially, these featured all the characters except for Pinky and the Brain, who were published in their own comic book series (which ran for a ''Christmas Special'' issue and then 27 regular issues from July 1996 to November 1998 before its cancellation), though cameos were possible. The ''Animaniacs'' comic book series was later renamed ''Animaniacs! featuring Pinky and the Brain''<ref name=\"animaniacscomic\">{{cite web|url=http://toonzone.net/comics/anim00.php |title=Toon Zone&nbsp;\u2013 Comics&nbsp;\u2013 Animaniacs |accessdate=April 11, 2010 |work=Toon Zone Comics |publisher=Toon Zone |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815071721/http://www.toonzone.net/comics/anim00.php |archivedate=August 15, 2009 }}</ref> with issue #43 and ran for another 16 issues before ''its'' cancellation.

Animation]], after ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''. It initially ran a total of 99 episodes and one film being ''[[Wakko's Wish]]''.\n\n''Animaniacs'' is a [[variety show]], with short [[sketch comedy|skit]]s featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments. Hallmarks of the series included its music, character catchphrases, and humor directed at an adult audience.\n\nA reboot of the series was announced by [[Hulu]] in January 2018, with two seasons to be produced in conjunction with Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, expected to air starting on September 14th 2020.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Premise===\nThe Warner siblings live in the water tower on the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"creation\"/> However, characters from the series had episodes in various places and periods of time. The ''Animaniacs'' characters interacted with famous people and creators of the past and present as well as mythological characters and characters from contemporary pop culture and television. [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]], the casting and recording director of ''Animaniacs'', said that the Warner siblings functioned to \"tie the show together,\" by appearing in and introducing other characters' segments.<ref name=\"dvdint1\">{{cite video\n| people = Maurice LaMarche\n| title = Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 1.

Shown here are the majority of the characters from the series.]]\n{{See also|List of Animaniacs characters}}\n''Animaniacs'' had a large cast of characters, separated into individual segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warner kids, [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]], are three 1930s cartoon stars of an unknown species (one [[Tom Ruegger]] named \"Cartoonus characterus\") that were locked away in the [[Warner Bros.

Executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] said that the irreverence in ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons inspired the ''Animaniacs'' cast.<ref name=\"Spielberg1\"/> Tom Ruegger created ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', a series [[Sherri Stoner]] had also written for, after being inspired by the personalities of two of his ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton. Ruegger thought of the premise for ''Pinky and the Brain'' when wondering what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world.<ref name=\"pinkyorigin\">{{Cite news\n| last = Will\n| first = Ed\n| title = Brain Power: Pinky, genius pal to resume plotting in 1997\n| newspaper = The Denver Post\n| date = June 11, 1996}}</ref> Deanna Oliver contributed ''The Goodfeathers'' scripts and the character ''Chicken Boo'',<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> while Nicholas Hollander based ''Katie Kaboom'' on his teenage daughter.<ref name = \"dvdint2\"/>\n\nRuegger modeled the Warners' personalities heavily after his three sons.<ref name=\"origin1\">{{Cite news\n| title = TV Production: What a Character!

Five major characters are listed already, and eight more are not going to clarify anything.\n\n--> [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], and the early versions of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]].\n\nSherri Stoner created ''Slappy the Squirrel'' when another writer and friend of Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner's career in TV movies playing troubled teenagers. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old, the latter developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and \"have the dirt on [them]\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Producers===\nSteven Spielberg served as executive producer, under his [[Amblin Television]] label. [[Showrunner]] and senior producer Tom Ruegger lead the overall production and writer's room. Producers Peter Hastings, [[Sherri Stoner]], [[Rusty Mills]], and Rich Arons contributed scripts for many of the episodes and had an active role during group discussions in the writer's room as well.\n\nThe writers and animators of ''Animaniacs'' used the experience gained from the previous series to create new characters cast in the mold of [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Tex Avery]]'s creations.<ref name=\"Spielberg1\">{{cite web\n| last = Carugati\n| first = Anna\n| title = Interviews: Steven Spielberg\n| work = World Screen\n| publisher = WSN Inc.\n|date=October 2006\n| url = http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011232156/http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm\n| accessdate = May 8, 2007\n| archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> Additional writers for the series included [[Liz Holzman]], [[Paul Rugg]], [[Deanna Oliver]], [[John P. McCann|John McCann]], Nicholas Hollander, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Jeff Kwitny, Earl Kress, [[Tom Minton]], and Randy Rogel. Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in writing sketch comedy<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> while others, including Kress, Minton, and Rogel, came from cartoon backgrounds.<ref name = \"airdate1\"/><ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\nMade-up stories did not exclusively comprise ''Animaniacs'' writing, as Hastings remarked: \"We weren't really there to tell compelling stories&nbsp;... [As a writer] you could do a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial&nbsp;... you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up.\"<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Writers for the series wrote into ''Animaniacs'' stories that happened to them; the episodes \"Ups and Downs,\" \"Survey Ladies,\" and \"I Got Yer Can\" were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg,<ref name=\"dvdint3a\"/> Deanna Oliver, and Stoner,<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> respectively. Another episode, \"Bumbie's Mom,\" both parodied the film ''Bambi'' and was based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/>\n\nIn an interview, the writers explained how ''Animaniacs'' allowed for non-restrictive and open writing.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because ''Animaniacs'' segments could widely vary in both time and subject,<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> while Stoner described how the ''Animaniacs'' writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story, as was the case in the episode \"The Three Muska-Warners\".<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Rugg, Hastings and Stoner also mentioned how the ''Animaniacs'' writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about parody subjects that would not be touched on other series.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\n===Cast===\n''Animaniacs'' featured [[Rob Paulsen]] as Yakko, Pinky, and Dr. Otto von Scratchansniff, [[Tress MacNeille]] as Dot, [[Jess Harnell]] as Wakko, [[Sherri Stoner]] as Slappy the Squirrel, [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the Brain, Squit and the belching segments \"The Great Wakkorotti\" (Harnell said that he himself is commonly mistaken for the role),<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> and veteran voice actor [[Frank Welker]] as Ralph the Security Guard, Thaddeus Plotz and Runt.<ref name = \"airdate1\"/> [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko: \"We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko.\" Romano said that the casters had \"no trouble\" choosing the role of Dot, referring to MacNeille as \"just hilarious&nbsp;... And yet [she had] that edge.\"<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Before Animaniacs, Harnell had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] which he \"fell into\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Harnell revealed that at the audition for the show, he did a [[John Lennon]] [[impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] and the audition \"went great\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Stoner commented that when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg, he said she should play Slappy.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> According to Romano, she personally chose [[Bernadette Peters]] to play Rita.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Other voices were provided by [[Jim Cummings]], [[Paul Rugg]], [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]], [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Gail Matthius]]. Tom Ruegger's three sons also played roles in the series. Nathan Ruegger voiced Skippy Squirrel, nephew to Slappy, throughout the duration of the series; Luke Ruegger voiced ''The Flame'' in historical segments on ''Animaniacs''; and Cody Ruegger voiced Birdie from ''Wild Blue Yonder''.\n\n===Animation===\nAnimation work on ''Animaniacs'' was farmed out to several different studios, both American and international, over the course of the show's production. The animation companies included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]), [[StarToons]],<ref name=startoons>\n{{Cite news\n| last = Owens\n| first = John\n| title = Drawing On Experience\n| url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon\n| accessdate = October 1, 2011\n| newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]]\n| date = July 5, 1992\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121105141556/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon\n| archive-date = November 5, 2012\n| url-status = live\n}}\n</ref> [[Wang Film Productions]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], and [[AKOM]], and most ''Animaniacs'' episodes frequently had animation from different companies in each episode's respective segments.<ref>Credits from various ''Animaniacs'' episodes.</ref>\n\n''Animaniacs'' was made with a higher production value than standard television animation; the show had a higher [[cel]] count than most TV cartoons.<ref name=\"dvdint3a\">{{Cite video\n| people = Tom Ruegger\n| title = Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 3.

The series made parodies of television shows and films. In an interview, Spielberg defended the \"irreverence\" of ''Animaniacs'', saying that the ''Animaniacs'' crew has \"a point of view\" and does not \"sit back passively and play both sides equally\".<ref name=\"Spielberg2\">\n{{Cite news\n| last = Closs\n| first = Larry\n| title = Spielberg Toons In: Moviemaker extraordinaire Steven Spielberg reveals he's also an animaniac at heart\n| periodical = TV Guide\n| pages = 33\u201336\n| date = October 28, 1995\n| url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/berg951.html\n| access-date = September 8, 2007\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213002515/http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/berg951.html\n| archive-date = December 13, 2007\n| url-status = live\n}}\n</ref> Spielberg also said that ''Animaniacs''' humor of social commentary and irreverence were inspired by the [[Marx Brothers]]<ref name=\"Spielberg2\"/> and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons.<ref name=\"Spielberg1\"/> ''Animaniacs'', among other Spielberg-produced shows, had a large amount of cartoon violence. Spielberg defended the violence in ''Animaniacs'' by saying that the series had a balance of both violent humor and educational segments, so the series would never become either too violent or \"benign\".<ref name=\"Spielberg2\"/> ''Animaniacs'' also made use of catchphrases, recurring jokes and segments, and \"adult\" humor.\n\n[[File:TTA meets YWD.jpg|right|thumb|[[List of Animaniacs characters#Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Yakko, Wakko and Dot]] shake hands with their ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' predecessors Buster and Babs Bunny and Plucky Duck, who make a cameo appearance in an episode of ''Animaniacs'']]\n\n===Recurring jokes and catchphrases===\nCharacters on ''Animaniacs'' had catchphrases, with some characters having more than one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko's \"Goodnight, everybody!\" often said following adult humor, Wakko's \"Faboo!\" and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all three Warners was \"Hello-o-o, nurse!\"<ref name=\"creation\"/> Tom Ruegger said that the \"Hello-o-o, Nurse!\" line was intended to be a catchphrase much like [[Bugs Bunny]]'s line, \"What's up, doc?\"<ref name=\"dvdint3a\"/> Before the theme song for each \"Pinky and the Brain\" segment, Pinky asks, \"Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?\" Brain replies, \"The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!\" During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, \"Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?\" and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur that changes every episode.<ref name=\"pinkyandthebrain\"/> Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode \"Win Big\", and then producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\n[[Running gags]] and recurring segments were very common in the show. The closing credits for each episode always included one joke credit and ended with a water tower gag similar to ''The Simpsons'' couch gag. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled \"The Wheel of Morality\" (which, in Yakko's words, \"adds boring educational value to what would otherwise be an almost entirely entertaining program\", and ends with a \"moral\" that makes no sense) eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once (and, in the case of the Wheel segments, enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room for anything else in the episode).<ref name=\"dvdint3a\"/>\n\n===Humor and content intended for adults===\nA great deal of ''Animaniacs' '' humor and content was aimed at an adult audience. <!--In an interview with TV Guide, Tom Ruegger stated, \"We don't just write for kids[...] We fill the stories with cultural references that people our age \u2014 for the most part, we're baby boomers \u2014 will understand, as well as [references for] younger people.\"<ref name=\"adultjokes2\">{{Cite news\n| magazine = TV Guide\n| volume = 45\n| date = 1997}}</ref>--> ''Animaniacs'' parodied the film ''A Hard Day's Night'' and the [[Three Tenors]], references that ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote were \"appealing to older audiences\".<ref name=\"adultjokes\">\n{{Cite news\n| last = Strauss\n| first = Neil\n| author-link = Neil Strauss\n| title = The Pop Life\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/arts/the-pop-life-648949.html?scp=2&sq=yakko'sworld&st=nyt&pagewanted=2\n| page = 2\n| newspaper = The New York Times\n| date = October 27, 1994\n| access-date = February 14, 2017\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121308/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/arts/the-pop-life-648949.html?scp=2&sq=yakko'sworld&st=nyt&pagewanted=2\n| archive-date = March 5, 2016\n| url-status = live\n}}\n</ref> The [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[H.M.S.

After the show's run, two additional discount albums compiling tracks from previous releases were released under Rhino's Flashback label, ''The Animaniacs Go Hollywood'' and ''The Animaniacs Wacky Universe''.<ref name = mainalbum>{{cite web\n| title = Animaniacs Discography: Main Albums\n| work = Allmusic\n| publisher = Rovi Corporation\n| url = {{Allmusic|class=artist | id=p44804|pure_url=yes}}\n| accessdate = April 9, 2010}}</ref> and the compilation album, ''The Animaniacs Faboo!

Animation were in the early stages of developing a reboot of ''Animaniacs''. The interest in the reboot was driven by a surge of popularity for the show when it was made available on [[Netflix]] in 2016, plus numerous successful projects that have revived interest in older shows, such as ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/animaniacs-reboot-steven-spielberg-amblin-1201817336/ | title = 'Animaniacs' Reboot Being Developed By Steven Spielberg, Amblin TV and Warner Bros. \u2014 Exclusive | first = Michael | last = Schneider | date = May 30, 2017 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[IndieWire]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170530175259/http://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/animaniacs-reboot-steven-spielberg-amblin-1201817336/ | archive-date = May 30, 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe revival was officially announced by the streaming service [[Hulu]] in January 2018 in partnership with Spielberg and Warner Bros.
