Most rivers are not deep enough to be navigable, although small boats are sailed in the lower courses of the River [[Minho River|Minho]] and several others, as well as at many of the [[dams]].\n\nThe rivers flowing into the [[Bay of Biscay]] (Cantabrian Sea) tend to be very short, and those flowing into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are only a little longer, except for the Minho (340&nbsp;km) and the [[River Sil|Sil]] (225&nbsp;km), whose lengths are several hundred kilometres.  There are numerous [[rapid]]s, due to the steep gradients of many river courses.\n\nIn addition to [[river fishing]], rivers have been used to power mills, and dams have been constructed both to provide [[hydroelectric]] power and for storage of water.\n\n==Alphabetical list of Galician rivers==\n\n{{Compact ToC}}\n\n===A===\n[[File:Ribadavia 060115 25.jpg|right|thumb|The Avia at Ribadavia]]\n{| style = align=\"left\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"bonita\" style=\"margin: 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding: 0.5em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!width=\"125\"|Name\n!width=\"150\"|Source\n!width=\"150\"|Outlet\n!width=\"250\"|Flows through\n!width=\"75\"|Province\n|-\n|[[Abad\u00edn (river)|Abad\u00edn]]\n|[[Frai\u00e1s, Abad\u00edn]]\n|[[Anllo]]\n|[[Triab\u00e1, Castro de Rei]]\n|[[Lugo (province)|Lugo]]\n|-\n|[[Abaixo]]\n|\n|[[Anll\u00f3ns]]\n|\n|[[La Coru\u00f1a (province)|A Coru\u00f1a]]\n|-\n|[[\u00c1bedes]]\n|[[Oso\u00f1o, Vilardev\u00f3s]]\n|[[T\u00e1mega]]\n|[[Vilardev\u00f3s]].

Planning for ships to replace the [[Adelaide-class frigate|''Adelaide''-class frigates]] and restore the capability last exhibited by the [[Perth-class destroyer|''Perth''-class destroyers]] began by 2000, initially under acquisition project '''SEA 1400''', which was re-designated '''SEA 4000'''. Although the designation \"Air Warfare Destroyer\" is used to describe ships dedicated to the defence of a naval force (plus assets ashore) from aircraft and missile attack, the planned Australian destroyers are expected to also operate in [[anti-surface warfare|anti-surface]], [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]], and [[naval gunfire support]] roles.\n\nPlanning for the '''Australian Air Warfare Destroyer''' (as the class was known until 2006) continued through the mid-2000s, with the selection of the [[Aegis combat system]] as the intended combat system and [[ASC Pty Ltd|ASC]] as the primary shipbuilder in 2005. In late 2005, the '''AWD Alliance''' was formed as a [[consortium]] of the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] (DMO), [[ASC Pty Ltd|ASC]], and [[Raytheon]]. Between 2005 and 2007, [[Gibbs & Cox]]'s Evolved [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer]] concept and [[Navantia]]'s [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n-class frigate|''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n''-class frigate]] competed for selection as the AWD design. Although the ''Arleigh Burke'' design was larger and more capable, the ''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n'' design was selected in June 2007 as it was an existing design, and would be cheaper, quicker, and less risky to build.\n\nThree ships were ordered in October 2007, and will be assembled at ASC's facility in [[Osborne, South Australia]], from 31 pre-fabricated modules (or 'blocks'). An option to build a fourth destroyer was included in the original contract, but has not been exercised. ASC, [[NQEA Australia]], and the [[Forgacs Group]] were selected in May 2009 to build the blocks, but within two months, NQEA was replaced by [[BAE Systems Australia]]. Construction errors and growing delays led the AWD Alliance to redistribute the construction workload in 2011, with some modules to be built by Navantia. Increasing slippage has pushed the original planned 2014-2016 commissioning dates out by at least three years, with lead ship {{HMAS|Hobart|DDGH 39|2}} to be completed by June 2017, {{HMAS|Brisbane|DDGH 41|2}} in September 2018, and {{HMAS|Sydney|DDGH 42|2}} by March 2020. The AWD Alliance, Navantia, and the involved shipyards have been criticised for underestimating risks, costs, and timeframes; faulty [[technical drawings|drawings]] and bad building practices leading to repeated manufacturing errors; and blame-passing. The alliance concept has been panned for having no clear management structure or entity in charge, and having the DMO simultaneously acting as supplier, build partner, and customer for the ships.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Planning==\nThe 1992 Force Structure Review contained plans to replace the three [[Perth-class destroyer|''Perth''-class]] guided-missile destroyers and four of the six [[Adelaide-class frigate|''Adelaide''-class]] guided-missile frigates with air defence vessels.<ref name=Gulber4>Gulber, ''Growth in Strength'', p. 4</ref> The initial proposal \u2013 to build an additional six [[Anzac-class frigate|''Anzac''-class]] frigates configured for wide-area [[anti-aircraft warfare]] \u2013  did not go ahead as the ''Anzac'' design was too small to effectively host all the required equipment and weapons.<ref name=Gulber4/> Instead, the RAN began to [[Adelaide-class frigate#FFG Upgrade|upgrade the ''Adelaide''s]] in 1999 to fill the anti-aircraft capability that would be lost when the ''Perth''s left service between 1999 and 2001.<ref name=Gulber5>Gulber, ''Growth in Strength'', p. 5</ref><ref name=Pengelley>Pengelley, ''Aussie rules''</ref> The frigate upgrade was only intended as a stop-gap (only four ships were upgraded, and all four were due to decommission during the mid-2010s), and by 2000, the [[Australian Defence Force]] had begun a project to replace the three ''Perth''-class destroyers.<ref name=Gulber5/><ref name=Pengelley/> The acquisition of the dedicated air warfare destroyers was initially identified as Project SEA 1400, then redesignated Project SEA 4000.<ref name=Gulber5/>\n\nThe main role of the air warfare destroyer is air defence of a naval task group, in addition to assets ashore and operating in the littoral.<ref name=Pengelley/> Although specifically designed for air warfare, the AWDs also had to be capable of facing other threats, and were to be fitted with ship-to-ship missiles, a gun for [[naval gunfire support]] of soldiers ashore, and anti-submarine capability through sonar systems and abovewater-launched torpedoes.<ref name=Pengelley/> The ships had to be able to operate a helicopter for both surveillance and combat duties.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\nIn 2004, the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] identified that the future air warfare destroyer class would be built around the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Aegis Combat System]].<ref name=Brown/> The use of Aegis was formally approved in April 2005, and [[Raytheon Australia]] was brought into the AWD project with the responsibility of integrating the Aegis system into the selected design, along with modifications to accommodate RAN-preferred electronic warfare equipment, underwater sensors, and weapons.<ref name=Pengelley/><ref name=Brown/> In May 2005, the [[Australian Submarine Corporation|ASC]] shipyard at [[Osborne, South Australia]], was identified as the primary shipbuilder for the project.<ref name=Pengelley/> In late 2005, the AWD Alliance was formed to organise and implement the project.<ref name=Pengelley/> The Alliance is a consortium including the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] (DMO), ASC's project-dedicated subsidiary, and Raytheon.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\n[[File:Bow view of USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) escorting Alvaro de Bazan (F101) in the Persian Gulf 051203-N-7241L-002.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The two competing designs for the Australian AWD project: ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer {{USS|Donald Cook|DDG-75|6}} leading ''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n''-class frigate [[Spanish frigate \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n (F101)|''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n'']] in 2005]]\n\nAfter receiving tenders from [[Blohm + Voss]], [[Navantia]], and [[Gibbs & Cox]], among others, the Australian government identified Gibbs & Cox's Evolved Flight II [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer]] as the preferred design in August 2005.<ref name=Brown>Brown, ''Spanish designs are Australia's choice for warship programmes''</ref><ref name=prefdes>Department of Defence, ''Preferred designer chosen for AWD contract''</ref> The [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n-class frigate|''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n''-class frigate]], designed by [[Navantia]], was identified as the official alternative, and both designs began further testing and modification as part of a two-year selection process.<ref name=Brown/><ref name=prefdes/> The two ship designs were equivalent in many areas, including length, speed and weapons outfit, although the ''Arleigh Burke'' class was larger with a displacement 2,200 tons greater than the Spanish frigate, and had superior capabilities in regards to range ({{convert|700|nmi|lk=in}} greater), helicopter operations (two embarked helicopters instead of one), primary armament (a 64-cell [[Mark 41 Vertical Launch System]] compared to a 48-cell launcher), and close-defence (with a second [[close-in weapons system]]).<ref>Shackleton, ''Choices and consequences''</ref> The [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Navy]], Vice Admiral [[Russ Shalders]], believed the American design would provide the RAN with a greater long-term capability, as there was greater scope for upgrades and modifications later in the ships' careers.<ref>Walters, ''Navy wants upgrade capacity for destroyers''</ref> Despite the American destroyer being the preferred option, the conclusion of the selection process in late June 2007 saw Navantia's ''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n'' design selected: the Spanish ships were considered a less-risky design as, unlike the Evolved ''Arleigh Burke''s (which at this point only existed as an on-paper design), vessels of the Spanish design had been built and were operational.<ref name=Brown/> The ''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n'' derivatives were predicted to be in service four years earlier than the American-designed ships, and would cost A$1 billion less to build, with further financial and technical benefits in ordering the AWDs and the [[Canberra-class landing helicopter dock|''Canberra''-class landing helicopter dock ships]] from the same supplier.<ref name=Brown/>\n\nThe contract for the ships was signed on 4 October 2007.<ref name=Pengelley/> The A$8 billion, three-ship deal included the option to order a fourth ship at a later date.<ref name=Kerr>Kerr, ''Australia seeks to extend AWD options''</ref> This option was due to expire in October 2008.<ref name=Kerr/> The Australian government sought to extend the offer into early 2009, so as to review the recommendations of the ''[[Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030]]'' white paper due for completion at the end of 2008, and to enquire about acquiring a fourth Aegis system from the USN, before ordering or cancelling the fourth destroyer.<ref name=Kerr/>{{Clarify|date=December 2011|reason=What happened to the fourth destroyer?}} The [[Navy League of Australia]] has consistently supported the acquisition of a fourth AWD.<ref name=Thornhill10.1>Thornhill, ''Force 2030'', pp. 10\u20131</ref> According to the Navy League, building a fourth destroyer would be relatively cheap (money for design and other 'start-up' costs would have already been spent) and improve RAN capabilities (by offering increased flexibility and redundancy, particularly in the event of a [[Falklands War]]-like armed conflict).<ref name=Thornhill10.1/><ref name=ThornbillCase/> Along with the Navy League, the Australian defence industry has supported a fourth destroyer, to keep workers employed for longer while reducing the gap to the next major defence construction projects (the [[Collins-class submarine replacement project|''Collins''-class replacement]] and the [[Hunter-class frigate|''Anzac''-class replacement]]).<ref name=Thornhill10.1/><ref name=ThornbillCase/><ref name=Kerin>Kerin, ''Fourth destroyer still an option: Smith''</ref>\n\nThe Australian Minister for Defence announced on 20 January 2006 that the Air Warfare Destroyers will be named [[HMAS Hobart (DDG 39)]], [[HMAS Brisbane (DDG 41)]], and [[HMAS Sydney (DDG 42)]].<ref>Department of Defence, ''Next generation of naval ships to reflect a rich history of service''</ref><ref>Andrew, ''AWD, Hobart, MFU or DDGH \u2013 What's in a name?''</ref> The Navy League of Australia suggested

designed to allow for upgrades and installation of new equipment, with a theoretical maximum displacement of {{convert|7,000|tonne|LT ST}}.<ref name=Gulber8/>\n\nThe ''Hobart''s use a more powerful propulsion system than their Spanish predecessors.<ref name=Brown/> The [[combined diesel or gas turbine]] (CODOG) propulsion arrangement consists of two General Electric Marine model 7LM2500-SA-MLG38 gas turbines, each generating {{convert|17,500|kW}}, and two Caterpillar Bravo 16 V Bravo diesel engines, each providing {{convert|5,650|kW}}.<ref name=Pengelley/> These drive two propeller shafts,

{{convert|18|kn}}; although not fast enough to keep pace with an American [[carrier battle group]], the RAN is happy with the speed/range tradeoff, as endurance is more important for Australian operating conditions.<ref name=Pengelley/> For in-harbour manoeuvring, each destroyer is fitted with a bow thruster.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\nThe standard [[ship's company]] is 186-strong, plus 16 additional personnel to operate and maintain the ship's helicopter.<ref name=Pengelley/> Additional accommodation increases the maximum potential complement to 31 officers and 203 sailors.<ref name=Pengelley/> Onboard electricity requirements (the [[hotel load]]) are supplied by four MTU prime mover diesel motors connected to Alconza alternators.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\n===Armament===\nEach ship's main weapon is a 48-cell [[Mark 41 Vertical Launch System]].<ref name=Pengelley/> The cells are capable of firing the [[RIM-66 Standard|RIM-66 Standard 2]] anti-aircraft missile or the quad-packed [[RIM-162 ESSM|RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow]] point-defence missile.<ref name=Pengelley/> The ''Force 2030'' white paper indicates that the ''Hobart''{{'}}s Mark 41 launchers are likely to

system]], specifically the Aegis Baseline 7.1 Refresh 2 version.<ref name=Pengelley/> The system has been 'Australianised' to be more capable in regards to non-aviation threats.<ref name=Pengelley/> The system feeds into the Australian Tactical Interface; six multi-function consoles that are capable of handling the destroyer's sonar, electronic warfare, and close-defence functions in addition to Aegis.<ref name=Pengelley/> The main radar system is the Lockheed Martin [[AN/SPY-1]]D(V) S-band radar.<ref name=Pengelley/> The combination of the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar, Aegis system, and Standard 2 missile will allow each destroyer to fire on enemy aircraft or missiles over {{convert|150|km}} away.<ref>Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance, ''Project Overview''</ref>\n\nIn addition to the main radar, the ''Hobart''s will be fitted with a Northrop Grumman AN/SPQ-9B X-band pulse Doppler horizon search radar, a Raytheon Mark 99 fire-control system with two [[continuous-wave radar|continuous wave illuminating radars]] for missile direction, and two L-3 Communications SAM Electronics X-band navigation radars.<ref name=Pengelley/> The ships are fitted with an Ultra Electronics Sonar Systems' Integrated Sonar System, which includes a hull-mounted sonar and a towed variable depth sonar built up from a quad directional active-passive receive array, a passive torpedo detection array and a high-powered towed sonar source. Other sensors include an Ultra Electronics Series 2500 electro-optical director, a Sagem VAMPIR IR search and track system, and Rafael Toplite stabilised [[target acquisition]] sights for each ship's Typhoons.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\nElectronic warfare sensors consist of the [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] EDO Reconnaissance and Surveillance Systems ES-3701 [[electronic support measures]] (ESM) radar, a SwRI MBS-567A communications ESM system, an Ultra Electronics Avalon Systems multipurpose digital receiver, and a Jenkins Engineering Defence Systems low-band receiver.<ref name=Pengelley/> Countermeasures include four launchers for [[Nulka]] decoy missiles, plus four six-tube launchers for radio frequency, infrared, and underwater acoustic decoys.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\nCommunications equipment includes HF, VHF, and UHF radios, [[Link 11]] and [[Link 16]] tactical data exchange uplinks, ASTIS MCE (Advanced SATCOM Terrestrial Infrastructure System Maritime Communications Elements) terminals, and [[Inmarsat]] equipment.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\n===Control System===\nThe control system for this class is provided by [[Navantia]] and is a version of the [[Integrated Platform

(which is also responsible for superstructure work on the [[Canberra-class landing helicopter dock|''Canberra''-class]] amphibious ships) by redistributing up to 13 of the 24 hull blocks the company was slated to build for the first two ships to the other two shipyards.<ref name=StewartOver>Stewart, ''Overdue and over budget''</ref><ref name=RANchanges>Royal Australian Navy, ''Changes to Air Warfare Destroyer Construction Program''</ref> In addition, the three blocks containing each destroyer's hull-mounted sonar are being assembled by Navantia in Spain and the United Kingdom, with the possibility another two hull blocks could be assigned to the Spanish shipyard.<ref name=StewartOver/><ref name=RANchanges/> An additional nine-month delay was announced in September 2012; this was intended to create a better transition of labour from the destroyers to following shipbuilding projects ([[Collins-class submarine replacement project|replacements for the ''Collins''-class submarines]] and the ''Anzac''-class frigates), and achieve some savings in the federal budget.<ref name=Thornhill11>Thornhill, ''Force 2030'', p. 11</ref><ref name=Cullen20120906>Cullen, ''Work on $8bn destroyer fleet delayed''</ref>\n\nA March 2014 report by the ANAO heavily criticised the DMO and the AWD Alliance for underestimating the risks in redesigning the ships for Australian operations, and building them in shipyards with no recent warship construction experience.<ref name=\"McPhedranBlowout\"/> The ANAO report also criticised designer Navantia and the shipyards involved in block construction over poor drawings, repeated errors, and bad building practices.<ref name=McPhedranBlowout/> As a result of further delays and growing costs, the ''Hobart''-class destroyer project was added to the government's \"Projects of Concern\" list in June 2014.<ref>Department of Defence Ministers, ''Air Warfare Destroyer added to Projects of Concern list''</ref> Follow-up government reports identified unrealistic time and cost estimates as additional factors.<ref name=Sheridan9bn/> The overarching alliance concept has been repeatedly denounced, with no effective management structure or entity in charge, (allowing for repeated blame-passing between the individual alliance partners, Navantia, and the subcontracted shipyards), and the DMO locked in a contradictory role (simultaneously acting as supplier, build partner, and customer).<ref name=McPhedranBlowout/><ref name=Greene/><ref name=Sheridan9bn/>\n[[File:NUSHIP Brisbane in October

Planning for ships to replace the [[Adelaide-class frigate|''Adelaide''-class frigates]] and restore the capability last exhibited by the [[Perth-class destroyer|''Perth''-class destroyers]] began by 2000, initially under acquisition project '''SEA 1400''', which was re-designated '''SEA 4000'''. Although the designation \"Air Warfare Destroyer\" is used to describe ships dedicated to the defence of a naval force (plus assets ashore) from aircraft and missile attack, the planned Australian destroyers are expected to also operate in [[anti-surface warfare|anti-surface]], [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]], and [[naval gunfire support]] roles.\n\nPlanning for the '''Australian Air Warfare Destroyer''' (as the class was known until 2006) continued through the mid-2000s, with the selection of the [[Aegis combat system]] as the intended combat system and [[ASC Pty Ltd|ASC]] as the primary shipbuilder in 2005. In late 2005, the '''AWD Alliance''' was formed as a [[consortium]] of the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] (DMO), [[ASC Pty Ltd|ASC]], and [[Raytheon]]. Between 2005 and 2007, [[Gibbs & Cox]]'s Evolved [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer]] concept and [[Navantia]]'s [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n-class frigate|''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n''-class frigate]] competed for selection as the AWD design. Although the ''Arleigh Burke'' design was larger and more capable, the ''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n'' design was selected in June 2007 as it was an existing design, and would be cheaper, quicker, and less risky to build.\n\nThree ships were ordered in October 2007, and will be assembled at ASC's facility in [[Osborne, South Australia]], from 31 pre-fabricated modules (or 'blocks'). An option to build a fourth destroyer was included in the original contract, but has not been exercised. ASC, [[NQEA Australia]], and the [[Forgacs Group]] were selected in May 2009 to build the blocks, but within two months, NQEA was replaced by [[BAE Systems Australia]]. Construction errors and growing delays led the AWD Alliance to redistribute the construction workload in 2011, with some modules to be built by Navantia. Increasing slippage has pushed the original planned 2014-2016 commissioning dates out by at least three years, with lead ship {{HMAS|Hobart|DDGH 39|2}} to be completed by June 2017, {{HMAS|Brisbane|DDGH 41|2}} in September 2018, and {{HMAS|Sydney|DDGH 42|2}} by March 2020. The AWD Alliance, Navantia, and the involved shipyards have been criticised for underestimating risks, costs, and timeframes; faulty [[technical drawings|drawings]] and bad building practices leading to repeated manufacturing errors; and blame-passing. The alliance concept has been panned for having no clear management structure or entity in charge, and having the DMO simultaneously acting as supplier, build partner, and customer for the ships.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Planning==\nThe 1992 Force Structure Review contained plans to replace the three [[Perth-class destroyer|''Perth''-class]] guided-missile destroyers and four of the six [[Adelaide-class frigate|''Adelaide''-class]] guided-missile frigates with air defence vessels.<ref name=Gulber4>Gulber, ''Growth in Strength'', p. 4</ref> The initial proposal \u2013 to build an additional six [[Anzac-class frigate|''Anzac''-class]] frigates configured for wide-area [[anti-aircraft warfare]] \u2013  did not go ahead as the ''Anzac'' design was too small to effectively host all the required equipment and weapons.<ref name=Gulber4/> Instead, the RAN began to [[Adelaide-class frigate#FFG Upgrade|upgrade the ''Adelaide''s]] in 1999 to fill the anti-aircraft capability that would be lost when the ''Perth''s left service between 1999 and 2001.<ref name=Gulber5>Gulber, ''Growth in Strength'', p. 5</ref><ref name=Pengelley>Pengelley, ''Aussie rules''</ref> The frigate upgrade was only intended as a stop-gap (only four ships were upgraded, and all four were due to decommission during the mid-2010s), and by 2000, the [[Australian Defence Force]] had begun a project to replace the three ''Perth''-class destroyers.<ref name=Gulber5/><ref name=Pengelley/> The acquisition of the dedicated air warfare destroyers was initially identified as Project SEA 1400, then redesignated Project SEA 4000.<ref name=Gulber5/>\n\nThe main role of the air warfare destroyer is air defence of a naval task group, in addition to assets ashore and operating in the littoral.<ref name=Pengelley/> Although specifically designed for air warfare, the AWDs also had to be capable of facing other threats, and were to be fitted with ship-to-ship missiles, a gun for [[naval gunfire support]] of soldiers ashore, and anti-submarine capability through sonar systems and abovewater-launched torpedoes.<ref name=Pengelley/> The ships had to be able to operate a helicopter for both surveillance and combat duties.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\nIn 2004, the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] identified that the future air warfare destroyer class would be built around the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Aegis Combat System]].<ref name=Brown/> The use of Aegis was formally approved in April 2005, and [[Raytheon Australia]] was brought into the AWD project with the responsibility of integrating the Aegis system into the selected design, along with modifications to accommodate RAN-preferred electronic warfare equipment, underwater sensors, and weapons.<ref name=Pengelley/><ref name=Brown/> In May 2005, the [[Australian Submarine Corporation|ASC]] shipyard at [[Osborne, South Australia]], was identified as the primary shipbuilder for the project.<ref name=Pengelley/> In late 2005, the AWD Alliance was formed to organise and implement the project.<ref name=Pengelley/> The Alliance is a consortium including the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] (DMO), ASC's project-dedicated subsidiary, and Raytheon.<ref name=Pengelley/>\n\n[[File:Bow view of USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) escorting Alvaro de Bazan (F101) in the Persian Gulf

2005.<ref name=Brown>Brown, ''Spanish designs are Australia's choice for warship programmes''</ref><ref name=prefdes>Department of Defence, ''Preferred designer chosen for AWD contract''</ref> The [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n-class frigate|''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n''-class frigate]], designed by [[Navantia]], was identified as the official alternative, and both designs began further testing and modification as part of a two-year selection process.<ref name=Brown/><ref name=prefdes/> The two ship designs were equivalent in many areas, including length, speed and weapons outfit, although the ''Arleigh Burke'' class was larger with a displacement 2,200 tons greater than the Spanish frigate, and had superior capabilities in regards to range ({{convert|700|nmi|lk=in}} greater), helicopter operations (two embarked helicopters instead of one), primary armament (a 64-cell [[Mark 41 Vertical Launch System]] compared to a 48-cell launcher), and close-defence (with a second [[close-in weapons system]]).<ref>Shackleton, ''Choices and consequences''</ref> The [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Navy]], Vice Admiral [[Russ Shalders]], believed the American design would provide the RAN with a greater long-term capability, as there was greater scope for upgrades and modifications later in the ships' careers.<ref>Walters, ''Navy wants upgrade capacity for destroyers''</ref> Despite the American destroyer being the preferred option, the conclusion of the selection process in late June 2007 saw Navantia's ''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n'' design selected: the Spanish ships were considered a less-risky design as, unlike the Evolved ''Arleigh Burke''s (which at this point only existed as an on-paper design), vessels of the Spanish design had been built and were operational.<ref name=Brown/> The ''\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n'' derivatives were predicted to be in service four years earlier than the American-designed ships, and would cost A$1 billion less to build, with further financial and technical benefits in ordering the AWDs and the [[Canberra-class landing helicopter dock|''Canberra''-class landing helicopter dock ships]] from the same supplier.<ref name=Brown/>\n\nThe contract for the ships was signed on 4 October 2007.<ref name=Pengelley/> The A$8 billion, three-ship deal included the option to order a fourth ship at a later date.<ref name=Kerr>Kerr, ''Australia seeks to extend AWD options''</ref> This option was due to expire in October 2008.<ref name=Kerr/> The Australian government sought to extend the offer into early 2009, so as to review the recommendations of the ''[[Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030]]'' white paper due for completion at the end of 2008, and to enquire about acquiring a fourth Aegis system from the USN, before ordering or cancelling the fourth destroyer.<ref name=Kerr/>{{Clarify|date=December 2011|reason=What happened to the fourth destroyer?}} The [[Navy League of Australia]] has consistently supported the acquisition of a fourth AWD.<ref name=Thornhill10.1>Thornhill, ''Force 2030'', pp. 10\u20131</ref> According to the Navy League, building a fourth destroyer would be relatively cheap (money for design and other 'start-up' costs would have already been spent) and improve RAN capabilities (by offering increased flexibility and redundancy, particularly in the event of a [[Falklands War]]-like armed conflict).<ref name=Thornhill10.1/><ref name=ThornbillCase/> Along with the Navy League, the Australian defence industry has supported a fourth destroyer,
