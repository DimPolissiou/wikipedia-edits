However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

It was primarily an effort to convince pagan readers that Christianity should be allowed into the religious \u2018market-place\u2019 that John North says second century Rome had become.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\"/>  On the other hand, G.Stroumsa says Tertullian also knew co-existence meant competition, so he attempted to delegitimize that competition through images of idolatry and Christian identity at the same time he advocated for tolerance.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\"/> It is not known exactly when Tertullian wrote his [[Apologeticus|''Apologeticus pro Christianis'']], but it was during the same era when [[Irenaeus]] (130-202 CE) wrote [[Adversus Haereses|''Adversus Haereses'']], and [[Justin Martyr]] (100-165) wrote the [[First Apology of Justin Martyr|''First Apology'']] which were both polemics against heretics.  Eric Osborne asserts that Justin Martyr, who is generally attributed with inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought, writes only to answer objections his friends are facing and to defend these friends from ill treatment and even death. He quotes Justin in a letter to the emperor as saying he is writing: \"On behalf of those from every race of men who are unjustly hated and ill-treated, being one of them myself.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Eric Francis|title=Justin Martyr|publisher=J.

The [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades.

Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n== Christian Roman doctrine in 4th and 5th century A.D.==\n{{Main|Persecution of Pagans by the Christian Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter he had adopted Christianity following the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]], [[Constantine I]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (together with his co-emperor [[Licinius]]). Since 306 there had already had been several edicts that granted Christians [[religious toleration]] in parts of the Empire, but the Edict of Milan removed all obstacles to the Christian faith and made the Empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship. Constantine supported the church with his patronage; he had an extraordinary number of large [[basilicas]] built for the Christian church, and endowed it with land and other wealth.<ref name=MacMullan49>MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> In doing this, however, he required the Pagans \"to foot the bill\".<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> According to Christian chroniclers it appeared necessary to Constantine \"to teach his subjects to give up their rites (...) and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,\"<ref>quoted after MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> which led to the closure of pagan temples due to a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure;<ref name=MacMullan50>MacMullan 1984:50.</ref> Constantine I did not need to use force to implement this;<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> his subjects are said to simply have obeyed him out of fear.

However, he changed his mind after he had witnessed how the [[Donatist]]s (a schismatic Christian sect) were \"brought over to the Catholic unity by fear of imperial edicts.\" When Augustine had characterized himself in ''De utilitate credenti'' (392), he said he was ''cupidus veri'', eager for truth.<ref name=\"Flasch168\">Kurt Flasch: ''Augustin - Einf\u00fchrung in sein Denken'' {{in lang|de}}, 3. ed., Reclam, 2003, p.168</ref> But  in his 93. letter he described himself as ''quietis avidus'', needing rest, and gave as reason the agitating Donatist.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> From a position that had trusted the power of philosophical argumentation, Augustine had moved to a position that emphasised the authority of the church.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> Augustine had become convinced of the effectiveness of mild forms of persecution and developed a defence of their use. His authority on this question was undisputed for over a millennium in [[Western Christianity]].<ref name=\"Coffey22\" /> Within this Augustinian consensus there was only disagreement about the extent to which Christians should persecute heretics. Augustine advocated fines, imprisonment, banishment and moderate floggings, but, according to [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], \"would have been horrified by the burning of heretics.\"<ref>quoted after Coffey 2000: 23.</ref> In [[late Antiquity]] those burnings appear very rare indeed, the only certain case being the execution of [[Priscillian]] and six of his followers in 385. This sentence was roundly condemned by bishops like [[Ambrose]], Augustine's mentor.<ref name=Coffey23>Coffey 2000:23.</ref>\n\n===The treatment of heretics===\n{{Further|Christian heresy}}\nWith the adoption of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Christianity by Constantine I]] (after [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]], 312), heresy had become a political issue in the late Roman empire. Adherents of unconventional Christian beliefs not covered by the [[Nicene Creed]] like [[Novatianism]] and [[Gnosticism]] were banned from holding meetings,<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />  but the Roman emperor intervened especially in the conflict between orthodox and [[Arianism|Arian]] Christianity, which resulted in the burning of Arian books.<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />\n\nIn contrast to the late antiquity, the execution of heretics was much more easily approved in the late [[Middle Ages]], after the Christianization of Europe was largely completed. The first known case is the burning of fourteen people  at [[Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1022.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In the following centuries groups like the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Waldensians]], [[Catharism|Cathars]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were persecuted throughout Europe. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) codified the theory and practise of persecution.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In its third canon, the council declared: ''\"Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, .. to take an oath that they will strive .. to exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the Church.\"''<ref>Medieval Sourcebook:  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV 1215]</ref>\n\nIn the process of eliminating these heretical movements, Church officials, especially members of the [[Inquisition]], made widespread use of torture to provoke confessions. Heretics who refused to recant their beliefs were hanged or burnt alive.<ref>Sean Martin, The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages, Pocket Essentials, 2005, p.g. 105-120</ref> At the [[Massacre at B\u00e9ziers|Siege of B\u00e9ziers]] during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (launched to eliminate the Cathars in [[Languedoc]], crusaders under the direction of a papal legate, [[Arnaud Amalric]] killed both Cathars and orthodox Catholics.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg]] | title=Massacre at Monts\u00e9gur.

An example of this would be [[John Jewel]]. In defending the demand for religious uniformity by [[Elizabeth I of England]], he declared: ''\"Queen Elizabeth doth as did [[Moses]], [[Joshua|Josua]], [[David]], [[Solomon|Salomon]], [[Josias]], [[Jehoshaphat|Jesophat]], ...\"'' <ref>John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.31</ref>\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

The [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n== Christian Roman doctrine in 4th and 5th century A.D.==\n{{Main|Persecution of Pagans by the Christian Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter he had adopted Christianity following the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]], [[Constantine I]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (together with his co-emperor [[Licinius]]). Since 306 there had already had been several edicts that granted Christians [[religious toleration]] in parts of the Empire, but the Edict of Milan removed all obstacles to the Christian faith and made the Empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship. Constantine supported the church with his patronage; he had an extraordinary number of large [[basilicas]] built for the Christian church, and endowed it with land and other wealth.<ref name=MacMullan49>MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> In doing this, however, he required the Pagans \"to foot the bill\".<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> According to Christian chroniclers it appeared necessary to Constantine \"to teach his subjects to give up their rites (...) and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,\"<ref>quoted after MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> which led to the closure of pagan temples due to a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure;<ref name=MacMullan50>MacMullan 1984:50.</ref> Constantine I did not need to use force to implement this;<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> his subjects are said to simply have obeyed him out of fear.

However, he changed his mind after he had witnessed how the [[Donatist]]s (a schismatic Christian sect) were \"brought over to the Catholic unity by fear of imperial edicts.\" When Augustine had characterized himself in ''De utilitate credenti'' (392), he said he was ''cupidus veri'', eager for truth.<ref name=\"Flasch168\">Kurt Flasch: ''Augustin - Einf\u00fchrung in sein Denken'' {{in lang|de}}, 3. ed., Reclam, 2003, p.168</ref> But  in his 93. letter he described himself as ''quietis avidus'', needing rest, and gave as reason the agitating Donatist.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> From a position that had trusted the power of philosophical argumentation, Augustine had moved to a position that emphasised the authority of the church.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> Augustine had become convinced of the effectiveness of mild forms of persecution and developed a defence of their use. His authority on this question was undisputed for over a millennium in [[Western Christianity]].<ref name=\"Coffey22\" /> Within this Augustinian consensus there was only disagreement about the extent to which Christians should persecute heretics. Augustine advocated fines, imprisonment, banishment and moderate floggings, but, according to [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], \"would have been horrified by the burning of heretics.\"<ref>quoted after Coffey 2000: 23.</ref> In [[late Antiquity]] those burnings appear very rare indeed, the only certain case being the execution of [[Priscillian]] and six of his followers in 385. This sentence was roundly condemned by bishops like [[Ambrose]], Augustine's mentor.<ref name=Coffey23>Coffey 2000:23.</ref>\n\n===The treatment of heretics===\n{{Further|Christian heresy}}\nWith the adoption of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Christianity by Constantine I]] (after [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]], 312), heresy had become a political issue in the late Roman empire. Adherents of unconventional Christian beliefs not covered by the [[Nicene Creed]] like [[Novatianism]] and [[Gnosticism]] were banned from holding meetings,<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />  but the Roman emperor intervened especially in the conflict between orthodox and [[Arianism|Arian]] Christianity, which resulted in the burning of Arian books.<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />\n\nIn contrast to the late antiquity, the execution of heretics was much more easily approved in the late [[Middle Ages]], after the Christianization of Europe was largely completed. The first known case is the burning of fourteen people  at [[Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1022.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In the following centuries groups like the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Waldensians]], [[Catharism|Cathars]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were persecuted throughout Europe. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) codified the theory and practise of persecution.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In its third canon, the council declared: ''\"Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, .. to take an oath that they will strive .. to exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the Church.\"''<ref>Medieval Sourcebook:  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV 1215]</ref>\n\nIn the process of eliminating these heretical movements, Church officials, especially members of the [[Inquisition]], made widespread use of torture to provoke confessions. Heretics who refused to recant their beliefs were hanged or burnt alive.<ref>Sean Martin, The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages, Pocket Essentials, 2005, p.g. 105-120</ref> At the [[Massacre at B\u00e9ziers|Siege of B\u00e9ziers]] during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (launched to eliminate the Cathars in [[Languedoc]], crusaders under the direction of a papal legate, [[Arnaud Amalric]] killed both Cathars and orthodox Catholics.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg]] | title=Massacre at Monts\u00e9gur.

An example of this would be [[John Jewel]]. In defending the demand for religious uniformity by [[Elizabeth I of England]], he declared: ''\"Queen Elizabeth doth as did [[Moses]], [[Joshua|Josua]], [[David]], [[Solomon|Salomon]], [[Josias]], [[Jehoshaphat|Jesophat]], ...\"'' <ref>John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.31</ref>\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

Located at the crest of Olive Hill, Barnsdall Art Park overlooks the city of Los Angeles, and the [[Hollywood Hills]], including [[Griffith Park]]. The park is centered on Barnsdall's [[Hollyhock House]] designed by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]], [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]], and on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Los Angeles, California|National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles]].\n\n==History==\nAline Barnsdall, a native of [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]] and heiress to an oil fortune, was led by her interest in the future of the American stage to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where she co-directed an [[experimental theatre]] company. While in Chicago, she met the equally unconventional Frank Lloyd Wright, whose recently completed [[Midway Gardens]] she admired.\n\nA trip to [[California]] turned Barnsdall's attention to Los Angeles. In 1915 she commissioned Wright to help her develop an innovative theatrical community on the nation's western cultural frontier. Selecting a thirty-six acre site in East Hollywood known as Olive Hill, Barnsdall and Wright worked together to develop a plan that included a home for Barnsdall and her young daughter, two secondary residences, a theater, a director's house, a dormitory for actors, studios for artists, shops, and a motion picture theater. The site plan was based on the gridded spacing of the existing [[Olive|olive grove]]\u2019s 1225 trees.\n\nIn subsequent decades, the park has become popular among\u00a0residents from the nearby districts.\u00a0The park has a wide variety of park visitors, as it sits at the intersection of a number of Los Angeles demographic groups.\n\n===Hollyhock House===\n{{Main|Hollyhock House}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:House image02b.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Hollyhock House]] at Barnsdall Art Park.]] -->\n\nThe Aline Barnsdall Residence, known as [[Hollyhock House]], was the first Los Angeles project of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Built between 1919 and 1921, it represents his earliest efforts to develop a regionally appropriate style of architecture for [[Southern California]].<ref>[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.ca1386 Library of Congress: HABS-Historic American Buildings Survey of Barnsdall Park]</ref>\n\nTaking advantage of the area's mild climate, Hollyhock House is a combination of house and gardens. It is a remarkable example of Wright's love of nature and the way he incorporated it into his designs. The house takes its name from the [[Alcea rosea|hollyhock]] blossom, the favorite flower of Aline Barnsdall. Wright's abstracted hollyhock patterns were incorporated into the decoration motif on and in the residence.\n\nWright was often absent during the actual construction of Hollyhock House, due to the demands of a major commission, the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in Tokyo, Japan. Therefore, he gave supervision of the Barnsdall project to two young [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin studio]] associates: his son [[Lloyd Wright]], and [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]]. They both became independently renowned architects.\n\n===Art Park===\n[[File:Barnsdall Art Park shopping carts 2015-02-13.jpg|thumb|left|Shopping carts at Art Park]]\n\nBecause of financial and artistic differences, only the two secondary residences and the Barnsdall home, Hollyhock House, were finally built. In 1926, Aline Barnsdall gave Hollyhock House and eleven surrounding acres to the City of Los Angeles for use as a public park in memory of her father, Theodore Barnsdall.<ref>[http://tclf.org/landscapes/barnsdall-art-park The Cultural Landscape Foundation: History of Barnsdall Art Park]</ref> The City agreed to take the Hollywood estate, but initially did not do anything with it, likely because of Barnsdall's restrictions on how the land could be used, as well as her controversial ideals. Part of the ensuing negotiations between the City and Barnsdall included a provision that the [[California Art Club]] would be granted a fifteen-year lease (1927\u20131942) on Hollyhock House to use as their clubhouse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Merrell|first=Eric|title=California Art Club in Search of a Home: The Hollyhock Years, 1927-1942|url=http://www.californiaartclub.org/california-art-club-in-search-of-a-home-the-hollyhock-years-1927-1942/|publisher=California Art Club|accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s additional art center buildings, including a modern theatre, an art gallery, and studios, were built on Olive Hill in the park. In the 1990s the Olive Hill restoration master plan and work was completed, including restoring the original olive groves.\n\n== Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery==\n{{main|Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery}}\nThe Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery is a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} venue that offers dramatic exhibition space for large, thematic group exhibitions and major retrospective exhibitions of individual work.<ref>[http://www.lamag.org lamag.org: Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery]</ref>\n\nThe Junior Arts Center Gallery is a {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} venue in the building that offers a more intimate gallery space. At times the two galleries are used together for single large-scale exhibitions.\n\n=== Exhibitions program ===\nThe Municipal Art Gallery's exhibitions program produces approximately nine exhibitions of [[contemporary art]] per year. The mission of the program is to promote, interpret, and present to the general public the contemporary art of artists from culturally diverse Southern California. The curatorial focus includes painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, design, video, electronic, performance, and installation works. Exhibits at Barnsdall Park receive over 45,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Barnsdall Gallery Theatre==\nThe Barnsdall Gallery Theatre (BGT) is owned and operated by Performing Arts in the City of Los Angeles's Department of Cultural Affairs. It is a 299-seat proscenium space rented at  nominal fees to individuals and organizations for live theatre, dance, music, [[spoken word]], lectures, films, and other events. The venue is equipped with dual sound, lights, an [[HD ready]] [[Video projector|digital projector]], and built-in [[16 mm film|16mm film]], slide, and video projectors, as well as dressing rooms and spacious upper and lower lobbies with [[box office]] and refreshment counters.\n\nBGT also presents a variety of community events in the space, including many popular free programs, such as the Independent Shakespeare Company, Music Summer Camps by the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, and many annual festivals, including the Thai Festival and Artwallah.\n\n;Independent Shakespeare Company\nThe Independent Shakespeare Company (ISC) is an ongoing, free live summer series held on an outdoor stage in the park.\n\nIn 2004, in association with the City's Department of Cultural Affairs, the ISC established a residency in Barnsdall Art Park. The first production was \"[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]\". In October 2004, the ISC toured ''Richard III'' in France as part of the 100th anniversary of the [[Entente Cordiale]]. This production returned to Los Angeles as part of Free Shakespeare in Barnsdall Art Park 2005, performed in rotation with ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'' and ''Hamlet''.  In 2005, the ISC returned to Barnsdall Art Park with a new production of ''Hamlet'', running in repertory with ''Richard III'' and encore performances of ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona''. In 2006, the ISC produced ''As You Like It'' and ''Hamlet''.\n\n;Silverlake Conservatory of Music\nThe Silverlake Conservatory of Music presents Music Summer Camps, bringing music to young people at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre. A team of professional master musicians present a music program combining academic information with live performance. The musicians perform their music and then explain how their instruments fit into the rhythm, chord structure, mood, or melody of a piece. Young people who are interested in a musical career are able to learn from professionals. For those with little knowledge of music, the program builds awareness and interest.\n\n== Barnsdall Art Center ==\n[[File:Barnsdall Art Center patio 2015-02-13.jpg|thumb|Outdoor work area and patio]]\n\nThe Barnsdall Art Center provides college-level art instruction at low cost in a unique Frank Lloyd Wright building. The center is temporarily housed in the Junior Arts Center due to the closure of the Frank Lloyd Wright building for safety reasons. The Barnsdall Art Center Student Advisory Committee provides support and student influence for the center's growth. The [[non-profit organization]] provides volunteer services with registration and financial assistance by covering programs and classes that the City is unable to fund.\n\n=== The Junior Arts Center===\nThe Junior Arts Center offers art programs to children and youth aged 3\u201318. Art instruction held at the center throughout the year includes drawing, painting, [[Filmmaking|film making]], printmaking, acting, photography, and sculpture. Parent/child classes are also available. The arts center's children's gallery features the work of young artists.\n\nThe Junior Arts Center Gallery provides family-oriented exhibitions by both children's and adults' work, as well as interactive family exhibits.

Located at the crest of Olive Hill, Barnsdall Art Park overlooks the city of Los Angeles, and the [[Hollywood Hills]], including [[Griffith Park]]. The park is centered on Barnsdall's [[Hollyhock House]] designed by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]], [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]], and on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Los Angeles, California|National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles]].\n\n==History==\nAline Barnsdall, a native of [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]] and heiress to an oil fortune, was led by her interest in the future of the American stage to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where she co-directed an [[experimental theatre]] company. While in Chicago, she met the equally unconventional Frank Lloyd Wright, whose recently completed [[Midway Gardens]] she admired.\n\nA trip to [[California]] turned Barnsdall's attention to Los Angeles. In 1915 she commissioned Wright to help her develop an innovative theatrical community on the nation's western cultural frontier. Selecting a thirty-six acre site in East Hollywood known as Olive Hill, Barnsdall and Wright worked together to develop a plan that included a home for Barnsdall and her young daughter, two secondary residences, a theater, a director's house, a dormitory for actors, studios for artists, shops, and a motion picture theater. The site plan was based on the gridded spacing of the existing [[Olive|olive grove]]\u2019s 1225 trees.\n\nIn subsequent decades, the park has become popular among\u00a0residents from the nearby districts.\u00a0The park has a wide variety of park visitors, as it sits at the intersection of a number of Los Angeles demographic groups.\n\n===Hollyhock House===\n{{Main|Hollyhock House}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:House image02b.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Hollyhock House]] at Barnsdall Art Park.]] -->\n\nThe Aline Barnsdall Residence, known as [[Hollyhock House]], was the first Los Angeles project of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Built between 1919 and 1921, it represents his earliest efforts to develop a regionally appropriate style of architecture for [[Southern California]].<ref>[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.ca1386 Library of Congress: HABS-Historic American Buildings Survey of Barnsdall Park]</ref>\n\nTaking advantage of the area's mild climate, Hollyhock House is a combination of house and gardens. It is a remarkable example of Wright's love of nature and the way he incorporated it into his designs. The house takes its name from the [[Alcea rosea|hollyhock]] blossom, the favorite flower of Aline Barnsdall. Wright's abstracted hollyhock patterns were incorporated into the decoration motif on and in the residence.\n\nWright was often absent during the actual construction of Hollyhock House, due to the demands of a major commission, the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in Tokyo, Japan. Therefore, he gave supervision of the Barnsdall project to two young [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin studio]] associates: his son [[Lloyd Wright]], and [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]]. They both became independently renowned architects.\n\n===Art Park===\n[[File:Barnsdall Art Park shopping carts 2015-02-13.jpg|thumb|left|Shopping carts at Art Park]]\n\nBecause of financial and artistic differences, only the two secondary residences and the Barnsdall home, Hollyhock House, were finally built. In 1926, Aline Barnsdall gave Hollyhock House and eleven surrounding acres to the City of Los Angeles for use as a public park in memory of her father, Theodore Barnsdall.<ref>[http://tclf.org/landscapes/barnsdall-art-park The Cultural Landscape Foundation: History of Barnsdall Art Park]</ref> The City agreed to take the Hollywood estate, but initially did not do anything with it, likely because of Barnsdall's restrictions on how the land could be used, as well as her controversial ideals. Part of the ensuing negotiations between the City and Barnsdall included a provision that the [[California Art Club]] would be granted a fifteen-year lease (1927\u20131942) on Hollyhock House to use as their clubhouse.<ref>{{cite web|last=Merrell|first=Eric|title=California Art Club in Search of a Home: The Hollyhock Years, 1927-1942|url=http://www.californiaartclub.org/california-art-club-in-search-of-a-home-the-hollyhock-years-1927-1942/|publisher=California Art Club|accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s additional art center buildings, including a modern theatre, an art gallery, and studios, were built on Olive Hill in the park. In the 1990s the Olive Hill restoration master plan and work was completed, including restoring the original olive groves.\n\n== Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery==\n{{main|Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery}}\nThe Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery is a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} venue that offers dramatic exhibition space for large, thematic group exhibitions and major retrospective exhibitions of individual work.<ref>[http://www.lamag.org lamag.org: Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery]</ref>\n\nThe Junior Arts Center Gallery is a {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} venue in the building that offers a more intimate gallery space. At times the two galleries are used together for single large-scale exhibitions.\n\n=== Exhibitions program ===\nThe Municipal Art Gallery's exhibitions program produces approximately nine exhibitions of [[contemporary art]] per year. The mission of the program is to promote, interpret, and present to the general public the contemporary art of artists from culturally diverse Southern California. The curatorial focus includes painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, design, video, electronic, performance, and installation works. Exhibits at Barnsdall Park receive over 45,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Barnsdall Gallery Theatre==\nThe Barnsdall Gallery Theatre (BGT) is owned and operated by Performing Arts in the City of Los Angeles's Department of Cultural Affairs. It is a 299-seat proscenium space rented at  nominal fees to individuals and organizations for live theatre, dance, music, [[spoken word]], lectures, films, and other events. The venue is equipped with dual sound, lights, an [[HD ready]] [[Video projector|digital projector]], and built-in [[16 mm film|16mm film]], slide, and video projectors, as well as dressing rooms and spacious upper and lower lobbies with [[box office]] and refreshment counters.\n\nBGT also presents a variety of community events in the space, including many popular free programs, such as the Independent Shakespeare Company, Music Summer Camps by the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, and many annual festivals, including the Thai Festival and Artwallah.\n\n;Independent Shakespeare Company\nThe Independent Shakespeare Company (ISC) is an ongoing, free live summer series held on an outdoor stage in the park.\n\nIn 2004, in association with the City's Department of Cultural Affairs, the ISC established a residency in Barnsdall Art Park. The first production was \"[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]\". In October 2004, the ISC toured ''Richard III'' in France as part of the 100th anniversary of the [[Entente Cordiale]]. This production returned to Los Angeles as part of Free Shakespeare in Barnsdall Art Park 2005, performed in rotation with ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'' and ''Hamlet''.  In 2005, the ISC returned to Barnsdall Art Park with a new production of ''Hamlet'', running in repertory with ''Richard III'' and encore performances of ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona''. In 2006, the ISC produced ''As You Like It'' and ''Hamlet''.\n\n;Silverlake Conservatory of Music\nThe Silverlake Conservatory of Music presents Music Summer Camps, bringing music to young people at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre. A team of professional master musicians present a music program combining academic information with live performance. The musicians perform their music and then explain how their instruments fit into the rhythm, chord structure, mood, or melody of a piece. Young people who are interested in a musical career are able to learn from professionals. For those with little knowledge of music, the program builds awareness and interest.\n\n== Barnsdall Art Center ==\n[[File:Barnsdall Art Center patio 2015-02-13.jpg|thumb|Outdoor work area and patio]]\n\nThe Barnsdall Art Center provides college-level art instruction at low cost in a unique Frank Lloyd Wright building. The center is temporarily housed in the Junior Arts Center due to the closure of the Frank Lloyd Wright building for safety reasons. The Barnsdall Art Center Student Advisory Committee provides support and student influence for the center's growth. The [[non-profit organization]] provides volunteer services with registration and financial assistance by covering programs and classes that the City is unable to fund.\n\n=== The Junior Arts Center===\nThe Junior Arts Center offers art programs to children and youth aged 3\u201318. Art instruction held at the center throughout the year includes drawing, painting, [[Filmmaking|film making]], printmaking, acting, photography, and sculpture. Parent/child classes are also available. The arts center's children's gallery features the work of young artists.\n\nThe Junior Arts Center Gallery provides family-oriented exhibitions by both children's and adults' work, as well as interactive family exhibits. Annual special events include [[Day of the Dead|D\u00eda de los Muertos]], Aline Barnsdall Day, the culmination of children's classes, and the Barnsdall Art Center's students exhibit.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in Hollywood]]\n* [[List of parks in Los Angeles]]\n* [[Little Armenia, Los Angeles]] \u2014 ''community on west''.\n* [[Lloyd G.
