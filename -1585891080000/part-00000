If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred.<ref>Cook, Jia-Rui C.

This generates so-called [[Rossby wave]]s that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree<!-- and assuming a linear dependency -->, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3{{E|18}} J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times

If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred.<ref>Cook, Jia-Rui C.

This could be explained if Europa's surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, an effect that is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling Europa's surface from its rocky mantle and the effects of Jupiter's gravity tugging on Europa's outer ice crust.<ref name=\"Hurford2006\">{{cite journal |last1=Hurford |first1=T.A. |last2=Sarid |first2=A.R. |last3=Greenberg |first3=R. |title=Cycloidal cracks on Europa: Improved modeling and non-synchronous rotation implications |journal=Icarus |date=January 2007 |volume=186 |issue=1 |pages=218\u2013233 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.08.026 |bibcode=2007Icar..186..218H }}</ref> Comparisons of ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' and ''Galileo'' spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage.

The Crystallographic regular polytopes}}\n\nThe [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vertices of an origin-centered regular 5-cell having edge length&nbsp;2 are:\n\n:<math>\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}},\\  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}},\\  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}},\\  \\pm1\\right)</math>\n:<math>\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}},\\  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}},\\  \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{3}},\\ 0   \\right)</math>\n:<math>\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}},\\  -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}},\\ 0,\\                   0   \\right)</math>\n:<math>\\left( -2\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}},\\ 0,\\                   0,\\                   0   \\right)</math>\n\nAnother set of origin-centered coordinates in 4-space can be seen as a hyperpyramid with a regular tetrahedral base in 3-space, with edge length 2{{radic|2}}:\n\n:<math>\\left( 1,1,1, \\frac{-1}\\sqrt{5}  \\right)</math>\n:<math>\\left( 1,-1,-1,\\frac{-1}\\sqrt{5}  \\right)</math>\n:<math>\\left( -1,1,-1,\\frac{-1}\\sqrt{5}  \\right)</math>\n:<math>\\left( -1,-1,1,\\frac{-1}\\sqrt{5}  \\right)</math>\n:<math>\\left( 0,0,0,\\sqrt{5}-\\frac 1\\sqrt{5}  \\right)</math>\n\nThe vertices of a 4-simplex (with edge {{radic|2}}) can be more simply constructed on a [[hyperplane]] in 5-space, as (distinct) permutations of (0,0,0,0,1) ''or'' (0,1,1,1,1); in these positions it is a [[facet (geometry)|facet]] of, respectively, the [[5-orthoplex]] or the [[rectified penteract]].\n\n=== Boerdijk\u2013Coxeter helix===\nA ''5-cell'' can be constructed as a [[Boerdijk\u2013Coxeter helix]] of five chained tetrahedra, folded into a 4-dimensional ring. The 10 triangle faces can be seen in a 2D net within a [[triangular tiling]], with 6 triangles around every vertex, although folding into 4-dimensions causes edges to coincide. The purple edges represent the Petrie polygon of the 5-cell.\n:[[File:5-cell 5-ring net.png|480px]]\n\n===Projections===\nThe A<sub>4</sub> Coxeter plane projects the 5-cell into a regular [[pentagon]] and [[pentagram]].\n{{4-simplex Coxeter plane graphs|t0|150}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=640\n!colspan=2|Projections to 3 dimensions\n|- valign=top align=center\n|[[Image:Stereographic polytope 5cell.png|240px]]<BR>[[Stereographic projection]] wireframe (edge projected onto a [[3-sphere]])\n|[[Image:5-cell.gif]]<BR>A 3D projection of a 5-cell performing a [[SO(4)#Geometry of 4D rotations|simple rotation]]\n|- valign=top align=center\n|[[Image:Pentatope-vertex-first-small.png]]<BR>The vertex-first projection of the 5-cell into 3 dimensions has a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] projection envelope.

He expounded a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] known as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Wotanism]], which he claimed was the revival of the religion of the ancient German race, and which included an inner set of [[Ariosophy|Ariosophical]] teachings that he termed Armanism.\n\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class family in [[Vienna]], List claimed that he abandoned his family's [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] faith in childhood, instead devoting himself to the pre-Christian god [[Odin|Wotan]]. Spending much time in the Austrian countryside, he engaged in rowing, hiking, and sketching the landscape. From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were survivals of pre-Christian, [[paganism|pagan]] religion. He published three novels, ''Carnuntum'' (1888), ''Jung Diethers Heimkehr'' (1894), and ''Pipara'' (1895), each set among the German tribes of the [[Iron Age]], as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing ''v\u00f6lkisch'' articles, now largely for the nationalist ''Ostdeutsche Rundschau'' newspaper, with his works taking on an [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] dimension halfway through that decade. In 1893, he co-founded the [[Literarische Donaugesellschaft]] literary society, and involved himself in [[German nationalism in Austria|Austria's Pan-German nationalist]] movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the [[German Empire]].\n\nDuring an 11-month period of blindness in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming under the influence of the [[Theosophical Society]], resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate [[Runology]] and the [[Armanen Futharkh]]. The popularity of his work among the ''v\u00f6lkisch'' and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.\nThrough these ventures he promoted the [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] view that modern society was degenerate, but that it would be cleansed through an apocalyptic event resulting in the establishment of a new Pan-German Empire that would embrace Wotanism. Having erroneously prophesied that this empire would be established by victory for the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], List died on a visit to [[Berlin]] in 1919.\n\nDuring his lifetime, List became a well-known figure among the nationalist and ''v\u00f6lkisch'' subcultures of Austria and Germany, influencing the work of many others operating in this milieu. His work, propagated through the List Society, influenced later ''v\u00f6lkisch'' groups such as the [[Reichshammerbund]] and [[Germanenorden]], and through those exerted an influence on both the burgeoning [[Nazi Party]] and the [[SS]]. After [[World War II]] his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathen]] practitioners in Europe, Australia, and North America.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life: 1848&ndash;77===\n\nGuido Karl Anton List was born on 5 October 1848 in [[Vienna]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=33}} Born to a prosperous middle-class family, he was the eldest son of Karl Anton List, a leather goods dealer who was the son of Karl List, a publican and vintner.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1pp=33&ndash;34|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=108}} Guido's mother, Marian List, was the daughter of builder's merchant Franz Anton Killian.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=33}} List was raised in the city's second ''[[bezirk]]'', on the eastern side of the [[Danube]] canal.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Like most Austrians at the time, his family were members of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] denomination of [[Christianity]], with List being [[Infant baptism|christened]] into this faith at [[Peterskirche, Vienna|St Peter's Church]] in Vienna.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Reflecting the family's wealth and [[bourgeoisie]] status, in 1851 a [[watercolour]] portrait of List was painted by the artist [[Anton von Anreiter]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}}\n\n[[Image:Carnuntum Heidentor.jpg|thumb|left|Heidentor, the Pagan Gate at Carnuntum where List buried wine bottles in 1875]]\n\nAccounts suggest that List had a happy childhood.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Developing a preference for rural areas rather than urban ones,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=35}} he enjoyed family visits to the countryside of [[Lower Austria]] and [[Moravia]], and &ndash; encouraged by his father &ndash; he began to sketch and paint the castles, prehistoric monuments, and natural scenery of these areas.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} According to his later account, he developed an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Austria, coming to believe that the catacombs beneath [[Stephansdom|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna had once been a shrine devoted to a [[paganism|pagan]] deity.

the ''[[Volk (German word)|volk]]'' or folk &ndash; and the natural world.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=50}} List believed that human beings had an immortal soul, and that it would be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] according to the laws of [[karma]] until eventually uniting with divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=24|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=52}}\n\n[[Image:Armanenrunor i cirkel med siffror vector.svg|thumb|left|180px|\"Runic Circle of the [[Armanen runes|Armanen Futharkh]].]]\n\nIn the 1890s, List initially devised the idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the ''Armanenschaft'', an idea which had developed into a key part of his thinking by 1908.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=56}} List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of [[Freemasonry]].

he believed that these teachings became the [[Kabbalah]], which he therefore reasoned was an ancient German and not Jewish innovation, thus legitimising its usage in his own teachings.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=63|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2pp=113&ndash;114}} Rudgley stated that this \"tortuous argument\" was used to support List's anti-semitic agenda.{{sfn|Rudgley|2006|p=113}}\n\n===Millenarian views===\n\nList generally saw the world in which he was living as one of degeneration,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} comparing it with the societies of the Late Roman and Byzantine Empires.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=83}} He bemoaned the decline of the rural peasantry through urbanisation, having witnessed how Vienna's population tripled between 1870 and 1890, resulting in overcrowding, a growth in diseases like [[tuberculosis]], and a severe strain on the city's resources.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=82&ndash;83}} A staunch monarchist, he opposed all forms of [[democracy]], [[feminism]], and modern trends in the arts, such as those of the [[Vienna Secession]]ists.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} Influenced by the Pan-Germanist politician [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]] and his [[Away from Rome!]] movement, List decried the growing influence of linguistically Slavic communities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=81}} He was opposed to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] and large-scale enterprise, instead favouring an economic system based on small-scale artisans and craftsmen, being particularly unhappy with the decline in tradesmen's [[guilds]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=81&ndash;82}} He was similarly opposed to the modern banking sector and financial institutions, deeming it to be dominated by Jews; in criticising these institutions, he expressed anti-semitic sentiments.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} Such views of the country's economic situation were not uncommon in Austria at the time, having become particularly widespread following the [[Panic of 1873]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} The later Heathen and runologist [[Stephen Flowers|Edred Thorsson]] noted that List's \"theories were to some degree based on the anti-semitic dogmas of the day\",{{sfn|Thorsson|1984|p=15}} while Hammer stated that the Ariosophic tradition promulgated by List and others was \"unambiguously racist and anti-semitic\".{{sfn|Hammer|2015|p=352}}\n\nList believed that the degradation of modern Western society was as a result of a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party,{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=83}} an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=25}} Adopting a [[millenarianism|millenarianist]] perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=85}} In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a [[golden age]] for the new Ario-German Empire.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=86}} Toward the war's end, he believed that the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=88&ndash;89}} For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=78&ndash;79}} Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the [[House of Habsburg]],{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=65}} with a revived [[feudalism|feudal]] system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=64}} In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=63&ndash;64}} He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=51}}\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nWriting in 2003, the historian of religion [[Mattias Gardell]] believed that List had become the \"revered guru of Ariosophic paganism\".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=23}} Gardell considered the Austrian esotericist to have been \"a legend in his lifetime\",{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=25}} with List's ideas being embraced by many ''v\u00f6lkisch'' groups in Germany.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} German members of the List Society included [[Philipp Stauff]], [[Karl Hellwig]], [[Georg Hauerstein]], [[Bernhard Koerner]], and [[Eberhard von Brockhusen]], who were founding members of the [[Reichshammerbund]] and [[Germanenorden]]; through the Germanenorden's [[Munich]] offshoot, the [[Thule Society]], a lineage can be drawn between the List Society and the early [[Nazi Party]] as it was established after World War I.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} \nGoodrick-Clarke opined that \"this channel of influence certainly carries most weight in any assessment of List's historical importance.\"{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} The scholar of Western esotericism [[Joscelyn Godwin]] expressed the view that List was one of the \"three godfathers of Nazi Thule\" alongside Liebenfels and [[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]],{{sfn|Godwin|1996|p=48}} while Rudgley went further by claiming that List's vision of a future German Empire constituted \"a blueprint for the Nazi regime\".{{sfn|Rudgley|2006|p=115}}\n\nOther German ''v\u00f6lkisch'' figures promoted Listian ideas to the wider public during and after the First World War.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} Further individuals &ndash; notably [[Rudolf John Gorsleben]], [[Werner von B\u00fclow]], [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]], [[Herbert Reichstein]], and [[Frodi Ingolfson Werhmann]] &ndash; took List's Ariosophical ideas alongside those of Liebenfels and built upon them further, resulting in a flourishing Ariosophical movement in the late 1920s and 1930s, with some of these individuals being within the coterie of prominent Nazi [[Heinrich Himmler]] and influencing the symbolism and rituals of the [[SS]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=46}} His was also exerted an influence on the Australian Odinist and Ariosophist [[Alexander Rud Mills]].{{sfn|Asbj\u00f8rn J\u00f8n|1999|p=78}}\n\nBoth Goodrick-Clarke and later the religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein described List as \"the pioneer of ''v\u00f6lkisch'' rune occultism\",{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=50|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=42}} with the latter adding that \"the roots of modern esoteric runology are found in Guido List's visions.\"{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=114}} In 1984, Thorsson expressed the view that List's impact was such that he was \"able to shape the runic theories of German magicians (although not necessarily their ''political'' ones) from that time to the present day.\"{{sfn|Thorsson|1984|p=15}} In 1976, two longstanding activists in the ''v\u00f6lkisch'' and far-right milieu, Adolf and Sigrun Schleipfer, established the Armanen-Order in order to revive List's ideas, adopting a strong anti-modernist stance and a desire to revive pre-Christian religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2015|1p=353|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=55}} It was through the Armanen-Order that Thorsson, who joined it, learned about List's work.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=81}} Thorsson then spearheaded \"the post-war runic revival\",{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=116}} founding an initiatory organisation known as the Rune Gild in 1980.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=116}} Thorsson was responsible for translating a number of List's works into English, alongside those of other ''v\u00f6lkisch'' mystics like [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=162, 322|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=82}} These publications brought awareness of List to an English-speaking readership,{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=81}} with his 1988 translation of List's ''The Secret of the Runes'' initiating a surge of interest in Ariosophy among the Heathen community of the United States.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=117}} List's runology also made an appearance in [[Stephan Grundy]]'s 1990 book ''Teutonic Magic''.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=118}}\nList's Armanist ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the American Odinist militant [[David Lane (white nationalist)|David Lane]],{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=201}} with [[Wotansvolk]], a group that List was involved in establishing, viewing their own activism as a continuation of that begun by List.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=275|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=208}} List was also of interest to the Heathen [[Michael Jenkins Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]], who spent time visiting the places in Austria that are associated with List's life.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=300}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nA bibliography of List's published books is provided in Goodrick-Clarke's study ''The Occult Roots of Nazism''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=274}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He expounded a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] known as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Wotanism]], which he claimed was the revival of the religion of the ancient German race, and which included an inner set of [[Ariosophy|Ariosophical]] teachings that he termed Armanism.\n\nBorn to a wealthy middle-class family in [[Vienna]], List claimed that he abandoned his family's [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] faith in childhood, instead devoting himself to the pre-Christian god [[Odin|Wotan]]. Spending much time in the Austrian countryside, he engaged in rowing, hiking, and sketching the landscape. From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were survivals of pre-Christian, [[paganism|pagan]] religion. He published three novels, ''Carnuntum'' (1888), ''Jung Diethers Heimkehr'' (1894), and ''Pipara'' (1895), each set among the German tribes of the [[Iron Age]], as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing ''v\u00f6lkisch'' articles, now largely for the nationalist ''Ostdeutsche Rundschau'' newspaper, with his works taking on an [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] dimension halfway through that decade. In 1893, he co-founded the [[Literarische Donaugesellschaft]] literary society, and involved himself in [[German nationalism in Austria|Austria's Pan-German nationalist]] movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the [[German Empire]].\n\nDuring an 11-month period of blindness in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming under the influence of the [[Theosophical Society]], resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate [[Runology]] and the [[Armanen Futharkh]]. The popularity of his work among the ''v\u00f6lkisch'' and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.\nThrough these ventures he promoted the [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] view that modern society was degenerate, but that it would be cleansed through an apocalyptic event resulting in the establishment of a new Pan-German Empire that would embrace Wotanism. Having erroneously prophesied that this empire would be established by victory for the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], List died on a visit to [[Berlin]] in 1919.\n\nDuring his lifetime, List became a well-known figure among the nationalist and ''v\u00f6lkisch'' subcultures of Austria and Germany, influencing the work of many others operating in this milieu. His work, propagated through the List Society, influenced later ''v\u00f6lkisch'' groups such as the [[Reichshammerbund]] and [[Germanenorden]], and through those exerted an influence on both the burgeoning [[Nazi Party]] and the [[SS]]. After [[World War II]] his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathen]] practitioners in Europe, Australia, and North America.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life: 1848&ndash;77===\n\nGuido Karl Anton List was born on 5 October 1848 in [[Vienna]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=33}} Born to a prosperous middle-class family, he was the eldest son of Karl Anton List, a leather goods dealer who was the son of Karl List, a publican and vintner.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1pp=33&ndash;34|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=108}} Guido's mother, Marian List, was the daughter of builder's merchant Franz Anton Killian.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=33}} List was raised in the city's second ''[[bezirk]]'', on the eastern side of the [[Danube]] canal.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Like most Austrians at the time, his family were members of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] denomination of [[Christianity]], with List being [[Infant baptism|christened]] into this faith at [[Peterskirche, Vienna|St Peter's Church]] in Vienna.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Reflecting the family's wealth and [[bourgeoisie]] status, in 1851 a [[watercolour]] portrait of List was painted by the artist [[Anton von Anreiter]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}}\n\n[[Image:Carnuntum Heidentor.jpg|thumb|left|Heidentor, the Pagan Gate at Carnuntum where List buried wine bottles in 1875]]\n\nAccounts suggest that List had a happy childhood.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Developing a preference for rural areas rather than urban ones,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=35}} he enjoyed family visits to the countryside of [[Lower Austria]] and [[Moravia]], and &ndash; encouraged by his father &ndash; he began to sketch and paint the castles, prehistoric monuments, and natural scenery of these areas.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} According to his later account, he developed an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Austria, coming to believe that the catacombs beneath [[Stephansdom|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna had once been a shrine devoted to a [[paganism|pagan]] deity.

the ''[[Volk (German word)|volk]]'' or folk &ndash; and the natural world.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=50}} List believed that human beings had an immortal soul, and that it would be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] according to the laws of [[karma]] until eventually uniting with divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=24|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=52}}\n\n[[Image:Armanenrunor i cirkel med siffror vector.svg|thumb|left|180px|\"Runic Circle of the [[Armanen runes|Armanen Futharkh]].]]\n\nIn the 1890s, List initially devised the idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the ''Armanenschaft'', an idea which had developed into a key part of his thinking by 1908.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=56}} List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of [[Freemasonry]].

he believed that the deity they were accused of worshiping, [[Baphomet]], was actually a [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] of the [[Maltese Cross]] representing Armanist  teachings.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=61&ndash;62}} According to List, a number of prominent [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] &ndash; including [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Johannes Trithemius]], [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]], and [[Johann Reuchlin]] &ndash; were also aware of this ancient Armanist teaching, with List claiming that he was actually the reincarnation of Reuchlin.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1pp=62&ndash;63|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=114}} In addition, List claimed that in the eighth century, Armanists had imparted their secret teachings to the Jewish [[rabbi]]s of [[Cologne]] in the hope of preserving them from Christian persecution; he believed that these teachings became the [[Kabbalah]], which he therefore reasoned was an ancient German and not Jewish innovation, thus legitimising its usage in his own teachings.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=63|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2pp=113&ndash;114}} Rudgley stated that this \"tortuous argument\" was used to support List's anti-semitic agenda.{{sfn|Rudgley|2006|p=113}}\n\n===Millenarian views===\n\nList generally saw the world in which he was living as one of degeneration,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} comparing it with the societies of the Late Roman and Byzantine Empires.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=83}} He bemoaned the decline of the rural peasantry through urbanisation, having witnessed how Vienna's population tripled between 1870 and 1890, resulting in overcrowding, a growth in diseases like [[tuberculosis]], and a severe strain on the city's resources.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=82&ndash;83}} A staunch monarchist, he opposed all forms of [[democracy]], [[feminism]], and modern trends in the arts, such as those of the [[Vienna Secession]]ists.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} Influenced by the Pan-Germanist politician [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]] and his [[Away from Rome!]] movement, List decried the growing influence of linguistically Slavic communities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=81}} He was opposed to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] and large-scale enterprise, instead favouring an economic system based on small-scale artisans and craftsmen, being particularly unhappy with the decline in tradesmen's [[guilds]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=81&ndash;82}} He was similarly opposed to the modern banking sector and financial institutions, deeming it to be dominated by Jews; in criticising these institutions, he expressed anti-semitic sentiments.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} Such views of the country's economic situation were not uncommon in Austria at the time, having become particularly widespread following the [[Panic of 1873]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} The later Heathen and runologist [[Stephen Flowers|Edred Thorsson]] noted that List's \"theories were to some degree based on the anti-semitic dogmas of the day\",{{sfn|Thorsson|1984|p=15}} while Hammer stated that the Ariosophic tradition promulgated by List and others was \"unambiguously racist and anti-semitic\".{{sfn|Hammer|2015|p=352}}\n\nList believed that the degradation of modern Western society was as a result of a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party,{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=83}} an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=25}} Adopting a [[millenarianism|millenarianist]] perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=85}} In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a [[golden age]] for the new Ario-German Empire.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=86}} Toward the war's end, he believed that the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=88&ndash;89}} For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=78&ndash;79}} Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the [[House of Habsburg]],{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=65}} with a revived [[feudalism|feudal]] system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=64}} In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=63&ndash;64}} He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=51}}\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nWriting in 2003, the historian of religion [[Mattias Gardell]] believed that List had become the \"revered guru of Ariosophic paganism\".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=23}} Gardell considered the Austrian esotericist to have been \"a legend in his lifetime\",{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=25}} with List's ideas being embraced by many ''v\u00f6lkisch'' groups in Germany.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} German members of the List Society included [[Philipp Stauff]], [[Karl Hellwig]], [[Georg Hauerstein]], [[Bernhard Koerner]], and [[Eberhard von Brockhusen]], who were founding members of the [[Reichshammerbund]] and [[Germanenorden]]; through the Germanenorden's [[Munich]] offshoot, the [[Thule Society]], a lineage can be drawn between the List Society and the early [[Nazi Party]] as it was established after World War I.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} \nGoodrick-Clarke opined that \"this channel of influence certainly carries most weight in any assessment of List's historical importance.\"{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} The scholar of Western esotericism [[Joscelyn Godwin]] expressed the view that List was one of the \"three godfathers of Nazi Thule\" alongside Liebenfels and [[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]],{{sfn|Godwin|1996|p=48}} while Rudgley went further by claiming that List's vision of a future German Empire constituted \"a blueprint for the Nazi regime\".{{sfn|Rudgley|2006|p=115}}\n\nOther German ''v\u00f6lkisch'' figures promoted Listian ideas to the wider public during and after the First World War.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} Further individuals &ndash; notably [[Rudolf John Gorsleben]], [[Werner von B\u00fclow]], [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]], [[Herbert Reichstein]], and [[Frodi Ingolfson Werhmann]] &ndash; took List's Ariosophical ideas alongside those of Liebenfels and built upon them further, resulting in a flourishing Ariosophical movement in the late 1920s and 1930s, with some of these individuals being within the coterie of prominent Nazi [[Heinrich Himmler]] and influencing the symbolism and rituals of the [[SS]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=46}} His was also exerted an influence on the Australian Odinist and Ariosophist [[Alexander Rud Mills]].{{sfn|Asbj\u00f8rn J\u00f8n|1999|p=78}}\n\nBoth Goodrick-Clarke and later the religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein described List as \"the pioneer of ''v\u00f6lkisch'' rune occultism\",{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=50|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=42}} with the latter adding that \"the roots of modern esoteric runology are found in Guido List's visions.\"{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=114}} In 1984, Thorsson expressed the view that List's impact was such that he was \"able to shape the runic theories of German magicians (although not necessarily their ''political'' ones) from that time to the present day.\"{{sfn|Thorsson|1984|p=15}} In 1976, two longstanding activists in the ''v\u00f6lkisch'' and far-right milieu, Adolf and Sigrun Schleipfer, established the Armanen-Order in order to revive List's ideas, adopting a strong anti-modernist stance and a desire to revive pre-Christian religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2015|1p=353|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=55}} It was through the Armanen-Order that Thorsson, who joined it, learned about List's work.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=81}} Thorsson then spearheaded \"the post-war runic revival\",{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=116}} founding an initiatory organisation known as the Rune Gild in 1980.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=116}} Thorsson was responsible for translating a number of List's works into English, alongside those of other ''v\u00f6lkisch'' mystics like [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=162, 322|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=82}} These publications brought awareness of List to an English-speaking readership,{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=81}} with his 1988 translation of List's ''The Secret of the Runes'' initiating a surge of interest in Ariosophy among the Heathen community of the United States.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=117}} List's runology also made an appearance in [[Stephan Grundy]]'s 1990 book ''Teutonic Magic''.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=118}}\nList's Armanist ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the American Odinist militant [[David Lane (white nationalist)|David Lane]],{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=201}} with [[Wotansvolk]], a group that List was involved in establishing, viewing their own activism as a continuation of that begun by List.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=275|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=208}} List was also of interest to the Heathen [[Michael Jenkins Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]], who spent time visiting the places in Austria that are associated with List's life.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=300}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nA bibliography of List's published books is provided in Goodrick-Clarke's study ''The Occult Roots of Nazism''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=274}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device.

The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series, as well as support for drum-based charts.\n\n=== Community-made charts ===\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.
