The show was adapted from the original Dutch version ''Now or Neverland'' and renamed ''Fear Factor'' by [[Endemol|Endemol USA]] and NBC for the American market. It was initially hosted by comedian and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] commentator [[Joe Rogan]].\n\nThe show pits [[contestant|contestants]] against each other in a variety of three stunts for a grand prize, usually of $50,000. From the first to fifth season, the contestants consisted regularly of three men and three women who were competing for themselves. In the sixth season, the show's format was modified to feature four competing teams of two people who have a pre-existing relationship with one another. \n\n''Fear Factor'' was cancelled by NBC in 2006, briefly revived in 2011 and then cancelled again in 2012. It was revived for a second time in 2017 to air on [[MTV]] with rapper and actor [[Ludacris]] assuming the host role; the series would ultimately end in the summer of 2018 after two seasons on that network.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nAs NBC's answer to the [[Columbia Broadcasting Service|CBS]] television series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', the show was initially a hit for the network in the summer of 2001 and built strong ratings and popularity in the following seasons. [[Joe Rogan]], then known for his role on the sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]'' (1995-1999) and as a commentator for [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] was hired as the host. According to a 2015 interview with [[Art Bell]], Rogan expected ''Fear Factor'' to be cancelled after a few episodes due to objections to some of the content and further stated that he took the job mainly to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy career.<ref>{{Citation|title=Midnight In The Desert with Art Bell Joined by Guest Joe Rogan: 1st Hour|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cDKRXkgTBg|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThe series had a runaway success during the first few seasons, but after the series' fourth season, the popularity and ratings for ''Fear Factor'' began to decline. By 2006, when ''Fear Factor'' was in its sixth season, the ratings for the series were in steep decline as a result of content concerns and a growing loss of viewer interest, coupled with the series facing tough competition with other TV shows in the same time slot. As a result, the series was only averaging a 2.6 in the ratings.<ref>[http://medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_2914.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218012406/http://medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_2914.asp |date=February 18, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=New, Monday, January 9th 9/8c |url=http://www.nbc.com/Fear_Factor/ |title=Fear Factor \u2013 NBC Official Site |publisher=Nbc.com |date= |access-date=2012-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081056/http://www.nbc.com/Fear_Factor/ |archive-date=2011-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later that year, ''Fear Factor'' faced tough competition with the TV ratings champion, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s talent series ''[[American Idol]]'' on Tuesday nights, and the ratings declined further, and continued to trend further downward during this period. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for Season Six, the series' ratings continued to drop and consequently, [[NBC]] put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', which was removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. After a continuous and steep drop in the series' ratings, it was officially cancelled by NBC in May 2006 after six seasons and the network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be aired throughout the summer, with its last episode airing on September 12, 2006. In 2004, ''Fear Factor'' became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, ''Fear Factor'' earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue. Currently only the first season has been released on DVD, but in early 2009, plans were made to release a box set containing the entire series on DVD. The project was put on hold for an unknown reason in March 2010. On June 5, 2010, it was announced that the project was cancelled because of the low sales of the first season DVD.\n\nWith [[Chiller Network|Chiller]] airing reruns of the show every Sunday night, the ratings on Chiller led to Comcast informing ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in a May 31, 2011 report that ''Fear Factor'' would be revived for a new season. Eight episodes were ordered, with two of them being two-hour episodes and Rogan returning to the hosting duties.<ref>[http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/02/nbc-reviving-fear-factor NBC Reviving Fear Factor], ''Entertainment Weekly'', June 2, 2011</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-fearfactor-idUSTRE75S7CL20110629 Joe Rogan returning as Fear Factor host], Reuters, June 28, 2011</ref> The revival was shot in high-definition, and owing to concerns over the then-ongoing NFL Lockout and the loss of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' episodes, [[TV Guide]] reported in early July the show could be ready as early as September as lockout replacement programming.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Joe-Rogan-Fear-Factor-1034757.aspx Exclusive: Joe Rogan to Return as Fear Factor Host] TV Guide.

The first season of MTV's ''Fear Factor'' premiered on May 30, 2017 and concluded on August 22, 2017.

The series also has a [[YouTube]] channel, where previously unaired footage is shown.\n\n==Original format (2001\u201306)==\nBefore the contestants are introduced (and at the half-way point of a two-hour special), Rogan presents a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one most commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|I'm Joe Rogan, and this is ''Fear Factor''. The stunts you're about to see were all designed and supervised by trained professionals. They are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime.}}\n\nBefore Rogan presents a verbal disclaimer, the narrator presents a statement, and this is one most commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|Imagine a world where your greatest fears become reality. Welcome to ''Fear Factor''. Each shows, six contestants from around the country battle each other in three extreme stunts. These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically and mentally. If the contestant is too afraid to complete a stunt, they're eliminated. If they fail a stunt, they're eliminated. But if they succeed, they will be one step closer to the grand prize, $50,000.}}\n\nThe normal format involves three men and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who have to complete three professional stunts to win [[United States dollar|US$]]50,000. Rogan noted that the stunts not only test any contestants/teams physically, but mentally as well. Any contestant(s)/team(s) who were too scared to attempt a stunt, failed to complete a stunt, or  underperformed a stunt were eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completed the first or the second stunt, they automatically win $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the stunt along with the winner of the stunt return for the next stunt to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second stunt, then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the stunt would return to the next stunt to compete for a reduced $25,000 (this rule did not apply for non-elimination stunts). The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the stunt, then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced.\n\nOnly once in the history of ''Fear Factor'' did the $50,000 top prize go unclaimed in an episode. This happened on a Best Friends edition on September 27, 2004, when none of the remaining teams were able to complete the final stunt. In the stunt, one member of each team had to drive a ramp car, while the other member had to drive a sports car. The one driving the sports car had to drive it onto the truck bed via the ramp car. If the sports car fell off of the truck bed at any time, the team was automatically eliminated. Had it been successfully completed, the team who did this the fastest would have won. However, the last remaining contestants walked away with two [[Mazda]] vehicles for winning a previous stunt (see [[Fear Factor#Second stunt|Second stunt]]).\n\nAfter the acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] of [[Vivendi]] by [[NBC]]'s parent company [[General Electric]] in 2004, contestants could win vacations in order to promote the theme park division of [[NBCUniversal]] at [[Universal Orlando]], or win trips to Universal Studios in [[Hollywood]].\n\nThe order of the stunts on a typical episode of ''Fear Factor'' is as follows:\n\n'''First stunt:''' The first stunt is designed to physically test each of the contestants or teams (for example, jumping from one building to the next or hanging from a helicopter and collecting flags on a ladder). Usually, the two men and the two women, or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, farthest distance, or number of flags collected in under a certain time) will move on to the second stunt. The others are eliminated. In the sixth season, a sometimes used rule was that the best-performing team won the ability to eliminate the team of their choice, meaning that teams who failed to complete the stunt or had the worst performance could still advance to the next round if the winning team did not choose to eliminate them.\n\n'''Second stunt:''' The second stunt is meant to mentally challenge the contestants or teams. The three most common types of stunts in the second round are eating stunts, animal stunts, and retrieval/transfer stunts. Eating stunts entail ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple items; animal stunts entail immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, spiders, snakes, or worms); retrieval/transfer stunts entail retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (for example, blood or lard) or live animals. Less often, the second stunt involves a pain endurance challenge or embarrassment tolerance challenge, such as outlasting competitors in a [[tear gas]] chamber, walking on broken glass with bare feet, getting a tattoo, having their head shaved, getting piercings, or ingesting [[habanero]] peppers. With the exception of retrieval/transfer stunts, contestants are usually not eliminated after this stunt unless they fail to complete it or vomit before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for having the worst performance. In later episodes, a common (but not always used) rule was that no one would be eliminated after the second stunt; instead, the contestant or team that performed the best would receive a prize, such as a vehicle or a prize package similar in value. More often than not, the contestant/team with the best performance had the privilege of choosing the order that the contestants/teams had to go in to perform the next stunt [for the following day].\n\n'''Third stunt:''' The third and final stunt is usually something from an extreme type of stunt seen in an [[action film]]. Like the first stunt, it usually involves heights, water, vehicles, or some combination of the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt is always competitive. The player or team with the best performance this round wins the grand prize, usually [[U.S. Dollars|$]]50,000, and has the privilege of being informed by Rogan that \"evidently, fear is not a factor for you\".\n\n===Special formats===\n\n====Four-Stunt Show====\nThis was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode aired in Season 3 and was notable for a stunt involving [[body piercing]]. In Seasons 4 to 6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with themed episodes, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor, and Thanksgiving Fear Factor. In Season 5, six contestants from other reality shows competed in a two-hour, four-stunt episode for $50,000.\n\n====Extended competitions====\nSome ''Fear Factor'' competitions consisted of five or more stunts and featured an increased grand prize. These competitions were always presented as multi-part episodes or single two-hour episodes. The first such competitions were the Tournaments of Champions in Seasons 2 and 3 (see below). Season 4 included a two-hour season premiere in which twelve contestants competed in six stunts for a grand prize of $1,000,000; and a two-part, six-stunt Las Vegas episode where the winner would have a chance to win up to $100,000 based on his or her performance in the final stunt (they would then have to bet half their winnings on a hand of blackjack). Season 6 featured two three-episode, six-stunt competitions (\"Psycho Fear Factor\" and \"Reality Stars Fear Factor\"). Season 7 included two five-stunt competitions in which five teams competed for a grand prize of $100,000; the first aired as a single two-hour episode, and the second aired in two parts.\n\n'''Tournament of Champions:''' The second and third seasons concluded with a Tournament of Champions featuring the winners of each show in that season and a $100,000 grand prize. In Season two, the thirteen non-celebrity winners were divided into groups of eight men and five women. For the first four stunts, men competed amongst men and women competed amongst women, in two stunts each. The men had to release a flag from a locked box while hanging suspended in the air and eat three different items from a table. The women had to collect flags while on top of an aircraft and retrieve three poles from a tank with [[alligator]]s. The stunts narrowed the contestants down from eight men and five women to two men and two women who will, in the end, compete against each other for the grand prize by using a key to activate a horn while riding on a speeding truck. In Season three, the twenty-four winners were divided into two groups of twelve, each containing seven men and five women. In the first semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six to three to two finalists. In the second semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six in the first stunt, then the men competed amongst the men and the women competed amongst the women in the second stunt, and then the final four contestants, two men and two women, were cut to two finalists. Each finalist won a 2004 [[Mazda RX-8]] and a chance at the $100,000. In the finals, the four finalists competed in three stunts. Each stunt eliminated one contestant, and the final stunt determined the winner.\n\n'''Couples Fear Factor:''' Seasons 4 and 5 both included ''Couples Fear Factor'' competitions that played out over seven episodes and featured a grand prize of $1,000,000. Nine couples competed in 17 stunts in Season 4, and eight couples competed in 14 stunts in Season 5. In Season 4, each episode contained two or three stunts, with at least one stunt being a non-elimination stunt. In Season 5, each episode featured two stunts; the first was always a non-elimination stunt, and the second usually eliminated the team with the worst performance. In contrast to the regular format, only one team was eliminated in each elimination stunt; if multiple teams failed the stunt, then the teams that succeeded would vote on which failing team to eliminate. Almost every stunt offered a prize (e.g., [[Automobile|cars]], vacations, pre-loaded [[credit card]]s, a chance to steal a desired prize from another team) or a $10,000 incentive to the team with the best performance. ''Couples Fear Factor'' episodes had certain stylistic differences from the regular format, including a different opening sequence, and onscreen interviews with the contestants (regular episodes usually presented interviews in voiceover format only).\n\n'''Psycho Fear Factor:''' A three-episode series in which six couples competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $250,000. The stunts were centered around the Bates Motel on the set of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' horror movie from [[Paramount Pictures]]. Unlike other Fear Factor episodes, contestants were required to sleep in the filthy Bates Motel between stunts and were subjected to Fear Factor pranks and mini-challenges while in the motel.\n\n'''Reality Stars Fear Factor:''' A three-episode series in which five teams of Reality TV stars competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $150,000. The series featured teams from ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', and ''[[The Real World]]''.\n\n====Other formats====\n'''Celebrity special''' (Seasons two, three, and six):\nIn Seasons 2 and 3, episodes with celebrity contestants were played in the normal format, except that contestants were playing for charity. The winning contestant's charity would receive $50,000, and other contestants' charities would receive a lesser amount ($10,000 or $25,000). In Season 6, eight celebrity contestants paired up into teams of two for the first two stunts but competed individually in the final stunt. [[Stephen Baldwin]], [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin Richardson]] and [[Alan Thicke]] are among the celebrities who have competed on ''Fear Factor''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/alan-thickes-greatest-36659/|title=Alan Thicke's Greatest Fear|work=Lauren Kane|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|date=2002}} Retrieved December 2016</ref> Season 2 included an episode featuring six WWF/E stars; it was won by [[Matt Hardy]].\n\n'''All-Gross Show''' (Seasons three to six):\nAll three stunts on this show followed the format of the second (gross) stunt as described above. The first such episode involved [[Apple bobbing|bobbing]] for objects in a vat containing 50 gallons of cow [[blood]]. In seasons four and five, the all-gross format was used for Halloween-themed episodes. In season six, a \"Farm Fear Factor\" episode featured all gross stunts.\n\n'''Mixed Team and Individual Stunts''' (Seasons two, five, and six):\nIn most episodes, contestants competed individually or in teams of two for the entire competition. However, there were three episodes in which contestants paired up into teams for the first and/or second stunt but competed individually in the final stunt. The first instance of this was a Season 2 episode in which three pairs of [[twins]] competed as teams in the first stunt, and competed individually the second and third stunts. In Season 5's \"New York vs. L.A.\" episode, the first stunt narrowed a pool of eight contestants down to four (one man and one woman from each city); contestants from the same city then teamed up in the second stunt, and all contestants competed as individuals in the final stunt. A Season 6 celebrity episode had contestants competing as teams in the first two stunts and individually in the final stunt. In the latter episode, contestants were allowed to attempt the stunts alone if their partner quit before the stunt started.\n\n'''Holiday specials''' (Seasons three to five):\nOver the course of the series, Fear Factor produced three Christmas episodes, two Halloween episodes, and a Thanksgiving episode. The Christmas episodes featured Christmas-themed stunts but were otherwise played in the normal format. The Halloween episodes followed the all-gross format, and the Thanksgiving episode followed the four-stunt format.\n\n'''Las Vegas Show''' (Seasons three to five):\nStunts took place at various [[hotel]]s and [[casino]]s in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The show's winner was required to bet at least half of their winnings on one hand of [[Blackjack]], with the chance to continue gambling if successful.\n\n'''Special Contestants''' (Seasons two to seven):\nSome episodes featured a specific type of contestant (e.g., models, all-female, twins, military members, reality TV stars, freaks and geeks, young and old, returning contestants) or teams with a specific type of relationship (e.g., couples, newlyweds, siblings, best friends, parent/child teams, exes). Many of these episodes were played in the regular format, although some used a four-stunt or extended competition format.\n\n'''Fear Factor [[Super Bowl]] Halftime Show''' (Season two):\nPlayed in the normal format with ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmates. The first stunt aired as counter programming to the Super Bowl halftime show and ended right before the third quarter of the game started. The remaining two stunts were shown immediately after the game as counter programming to the Super Bowl lead-out show.\n\n'''Miss USA''' (Seasons three to five):\nPlayed in the normal format with [[Miss USA]] contestants, with the winning contestant keeping $25,000 and giving $25,000 to a charity of their choice. There was no Miss USA edition in the sixth season of ''Fear Factor'', as [[NBC]] produced a Miss USA edition of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'' instead; the Miss USA contestants were the briefcase models for the entire episode. The next time that Miss USA delegates would be involved in a game show was in 2010 on ''[[Minute to Win It]]''. The Miss USA edition was not present in the show's final two seasons, as the current format had four teams of two people.\n\n'''Blind Date''' (Season six):\nFour single men were introduced to four single women, and either the women (in the first episode) or the men (in the second episode) got to choose their partner among the available contestants of the opposite sex. The game was then played in the regular format, with the winning team dividing the prize.\n\n'''Sleep Deprivation''' (Season four):\nFive co-ed pairs of contestants competed as teams in the normal format, with one exception: contestants had to stay awake for the 48-hour duration of the competition. If a contestant fell asleep at any time before the final stunt was completed, his or her team would be eliminated. This was the only episode in the TV series in which contestants could be eliminated in the downtime between stunts.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n'''Million Dollar Heist:''' (Season six): Played in the regular teams format, but instead of competing for the normal $50,000 prize, teams would race head-to-head to \"steal\" up to $1,000,000 worth of gold from an armored truck submerged in water for their final stunt. The team that \"stole\" the most money's worth of gold within the time limit would win the combined amount of money collected by both teams.\n\n'''Home Invasion''': This short segment was included at the end of each episode in Season six. It involved Joe Rogan going to different homes across America and challenging a family to compete in a stunt. Each stunt usually involved the contestants, under time limit (usually one minute), ingesting or bobbing in something foul or undesirable. If successful, the family would win up to $5,000 in the form of pre-loaded credit cards from [[Capital One]].\n\n==Revived series (2011\u201312)==\nThe series revival began airing on December 12, 2011, and the two premiere episodes were viewed by 8.7 million and 8.5 million viewers, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Stephan |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/12/13/fear-factor-ratings/ |title='Fear Factor' premiere ratings &#124; Inside TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> This makes the premiere the highest non-sports programming to air on NBC at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. since February 2008. Following Rogan's word for a verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement, and this is one most commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|It all began ten years ago, at the dawn of reality television. Audiences had never seen anything like it. Now, the legend begins all over again. It's bigger, better and more intense than ever before. Welcome back to ''Fear Factor.''}}\n\nThe revival featured four teams of two people with a preexisting relationship per episode, rather than the original versions' six people (three males and three females). The first five seasons had typically used the three male, three female grouping, but the sixth and final pre-revival season always utilized 4 teams of two people each. The stunts have remained basically the same, with the \"gross\" one in between the two physical ones.\n\nNBC pulled a two-hour, five team, five stunt episode entitled \"Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!\" which featured a stunt where teams spun a wheel to determine whether they would have to shave their heads and eyebrows, get tattooed, or be tear gassed. This episode was scheduled to air in two parts on January 23 and 30, 2012, but it was postponed after Part 1 was replaced by a GOP debate.\n\nAnother episode, entitled \"Hee Haw! Hee Haw!\" and featuring a stunt where contestants drink the urine and semen of a donkey, was then scheduled to air January 30, 2012. Hesitant about airing the stunt, NBC eventually pulled the episode after pictures of the stunt appeared online. Video footage of the stunt appeared online after the episode aired on Danish TV in June 2012,<ref>{{cite web|title=Fear Factor' Donkey Semen Stunt Finally Airs ... On Danish TV|url=http://www.tmz.com/category/fear-factor-donkey-semen/|publisher=TMZ|accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> and ''Fear Factor'' eventually posted short clips of all three stunts on their [[YouTube]] channel in July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fear Factor Moments \u2013 Shock Walk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7Ku1rgjidg|website=YouTube|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Factor Moments \u2013 Donkey Juice|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6KiP7iQgo|website=YouTube|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fear Factor Moments \u2013 Train & Car Crash|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O41xsGXPeks|website=YouTube|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe sixth episode, entitled \"The Bees Are So Angry\", was two hours instead of the usual one, and included five teams, five stunts, and a $100,000 prize instead of the usual four teams, three stunts, and $50,000 prize. Following this episode, ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' replaced the series' slot on Monday nights.\n\nNBC rescheduled the two hour \"Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!\" episode, which aired in two parts over the nights of July 9 and July 16. The first part ended with the \"To Be Continued\" subtitle followed by a preview for the second part. As of July 2012, ''Fear Factor'' was officially cancelled.\n\n===US Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Order\n! Episode\n! Airdate\n! Rating\n! Share\n!

As the show started, Ludacris gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|The challenges you are about to see were designed and tested by trained professionals. They are extremely ludicrous and should never be attempted by anyone, anywhere, or at anytime. This is MTV's ''Fear Factor''.}}\n\nHowever, the order of the stunts, as well as some of the rules, differ from the original format. Each episode of the MTV version has three named rounds: Beat the Beast, Face Your Fear, and The Final Fear.\n\n'''Beat the Beast:''' This stunt challenges the contestants to conquer their fear of something creepy (usually live creatures considered gross or intimidating) and generally follows the same format as animal stunts from the second stunt of the original version. The team with the best performance in this round wins a \"FearVantage\", which is an advantage in the next round (such as picking the order).\n\n'''Face Your Fear:''' This is a challenge tailored to a common fear shared by all of the contestants on a particular episode. The nature of this stunt varies widely depending on the fears of the contestants.\n\n'''The Final Fear:''' This is an extreme physical stunt that follows the same format as the first and third stunts from the original version of the show. The team with the best performance wins the $50,000 grand prize.\n\n==International versions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:92%; line-height:14px; background:#F8F8FF; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

public mainly because of the show's second stunt, which intends to [[disgust]] its viewers. The [[American Humane Association]] expressed concerns for allowing various animals to get injured, and even killing insects by eating them alive during the videotaping of the show. The association also revealed that professional [[animal training|animal trainers]] have refused to work on the show because the producers of ''Fear Factor'' have demanded stunts which violate the association's guidelines.\n\n<blockquote>American Humane believes that shows like ''Fear Factor'' are on a slippery slope of animal mistreatment and provide poor examples of animal treatment and humane ethics. As we work diligently to expand voluntary compliance with animal safety guidelines, organisations like Endemol who blatantly demonstrate complete disregard for animal welfare, or even that of their human contestants \u2014 are producing unacceptable programming.

Austin Aitken, a part-time [[paralegal]] from [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], sued [[NBC]] for $2.5 million [[United States dollar|USD]] for airing the show, claiming that he felt so disgusted from watching the stunt, his [[blood pressure]] rose until he felt dizzy and lightheaded and subsequently vomited. He claimed that his disorientation was so severe that he ran into a doorway and seriously injured himself. In March 2005, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells threw out the lawsuit on the grounds of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment protection]].<ref>Joe Milicia, [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1104759364675 Viewer Sues NBC Over 'Fear Factor' Rat-Eating Episode] Accessed March 3, 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815131635/http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1104759364675 |date=August 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n''Fear Factor'' was also criticized by major U.S. electrical utilities for an episode that required contestants to climb through a simulated electrical substation with \"electrified wires\" replete with simulated sparks and electrical sounds added in post-processing.

The show was adapted from the original Dutch version ''Now or Neverland'' and renamed ''Fear Factor'' by [[Endemol|Endemol USA]] and NBC for the American market. It was initially hosted by comedian and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] commentator [[Joe Rogan]].\n\nThe show pits [[contestant|contestants]] against each other in a variety of three stunts for a grand prize, usually of $50,000. From the first to fifth season, the contestants consisted regularly of three men and three women who were competing for themselves. In the sixth season, the show's format was modified to feature four competing teams of two people who have a pre-existing relationship with one another. \n\n''Fear Factor'' was cancelled by NBC in 2006, briefly revived in 2011 and then cancelled again in 2012. It was revived for a second time in 2017 to air on [[MTV]] with rapper and actor [[Ludacris]] assuming the host role; the series would ultimately end in the summer of 2018 after two seasons on that network.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nAs NBC's answer to the [[Columbia Broadcasting Service|CBS]] television series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', the show was initially a hit for the network in the summer of 2001 and built strong ratings and popularity in the following seasons. [[Joe Rogan]], then known for his role on the sitcom ''[[NewsRadio]]'' (1995-1999) and as a commentator for [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] was hired as the host. According to a 2015 interview with [[Art Bell]], Rogan expected ''Fear Factor'' to be cancelled after a few episodes due to objections to some of the content and further stated that he took the job mainly to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy career.<ref>{{Citation|title=Midnight In The Desert with Art Bell Joined by Guest Joe Rogan: 1st Hour|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cDKRXkgTBg|language=en|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThe series had a runaway success during the first few seasons, but after the series' fourth season, the popularity and ratings for ''Fear Factor'' began to decline. By 2006, when ''Fear Factor'' was in its sixth season, the ratings for the series were in steep decline as a result of content concerns and a growing loss of viewer interest, coupled with the series facing tough competition with other TV shows in the same time slot. As a result, the series was only averaging a 2.6 in the ratings.<ref>[http://medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_2914.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218012406/http://medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_2914.asp |date=February 18, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=New, Monday, January 9th 9/8c |url=http://www.nbc.com/Fear_Factor/ |title=Fear Factor \u2013 NBC Official Site |publisher=Nbc.com |date= |access-date=2012-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081056/http://www.nbc.com/Fear_Factor/ |archive-date=2011-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later that year, ''Fear Factor'' faced tough competition with the TV ratings champion, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s talent series ''[[American Idol]]'' on Tuesday nights, and the ratings declined further, and continued to trend further downward during this period. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for Season Six, the series' ratings continued to drop and consequently, [[NBC]] put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', which was removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. After a continuous and steep drop in the series' ratings, it was officially cancelled by NBC in May 2006 after six seasons and the network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be aired throughout the summer, with its last episode airing on September 12, 2006. In 2004, ''Fear Factor'' became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, ''Fear Factor'' earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue. Currently only the first season has been released on DVD, but in early 2009, plans were made to release a box set containing the entire series on DVD. The project was put on hold for an unknown reason in March 2010. On June 5, 2010, it was announced that the project was cancelled because of the low sales of the first season DVD.\n\nWith [[Chiller (TV channel)|Chiller]] airing reruns of the show every Sunday night, the ratings on Chiller led to Comcast informing ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in a May 31, 2011 report that ''Fear Factor'' would be revived for a new season. Eight episodes were ordered, with two of them being two-hour episodes and Rogan returning to the hosting duties.<ref>[http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/02/nbc-reviving-fear-factor NBC Reviving Fear Factor], ''Entertainment Weekly'', June 2, 2011</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-fearfactor-idUSTRE75S7CL20110629 Joe Rogan returning as Fear Factor host], Reuters, June 28, 2011</ref> The revival was shot in high-definition, and owing to concerns over the then-ongoing NFL Lockout and the loss of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' episodes, [[TV Guide]] reported in early July the show could be ready as early as September as lockout replacement programming.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Joe-Rogan-Fear-Factor-1034757.aspx Exclusive: Joe Rogan to Return as Fear Factor Host] TV Guide.

The first season of MTV's ''Fear Factor'' premiered on May 30, 2017 and concluded on August 22, 2017. Just prior to the first-season finale, it was announced that MTV had renewed the series for a second season consisting of 20 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=MTV Orders Second Season of \u2018Fear Factor\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fear-factor-mtv-second-season-ludacris-1202535284/|website=Variety|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref> The second season, subtitled ''Season From Hell'', began airing on February 25, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=SCARE UP SUNDAYS WHEN \"FEAR FACTOR\" RETURNS WITH LUDACRIS|url=http://www.mtvpress.com/press-releases/2018/01/29/scare-up-sundays-when-fear-factor-returns-with-ludacris|website=MTV Press|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> The MTV revival is hosted by [[Ludacris]] and continues to use the format of four teams competing for a $50,000 prize.

The series also has a [[YouTube]] channel, where previously unaired footage is shown.\n\n==Original format (2001\u201306)==\nBefore the contestants are introduced (and at the half-way point of a two-hour special), Rogan presents a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one most commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|I'm Joe Rogan, and this is ''Fear Factor''. The stunts you're about to see were all designed and supervised by trained professionals. They are extremely dangerous and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime.}}\n\nBefore Rogan presents a verbal disclaimer, the narrator presents a statement, and this is one most commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|Imagine a world where your greatest fears become reality. Welcome to ''Fear Factor''. Each shows, six contestants from around the country battle each other in three extreme stunts. These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically and mentally. If the contestant is too afraid to complete a stunt, they're eliminated. If they fail a stunt, they're eliminated. But if they succeed, they will be one step closer to the grand prize, $50,000.}}\n\nThe normal format involves three men and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who have to complete three professional stunts to win [[United States dollar|US$]]50,000. Rogan noted that the stunts not only test any contestants/teams physically, but mentally as well. Any contestant(s)/team(s) who were too scared to attempt a stunt, failed to complete a stunt, or  underperformed a stunt were eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completed the first or the second stunt, they automatically win $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the stunt along with the winner of the stunt return for the next stunt to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second stunt, then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the stunt would return to the next stunt to compete for a reduced $25,000 (this rule did not apply for non-elimination stunts). The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the stunt, then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced.\n\nOnly once in the history of ''Fear Factor'' did the $50,000 top prize go unclaimed in an episode. This happened on a Best Friends edition on September 27, 2004, when none of the remaining teams were able to complete the final stunt. In the stunt, one member of each team had to drive a ramp car, while the other member had to drive a sports car. The one driving the sports car had to drive it onto the truck bed via the ramp car. If the sports car fell off of the truck bed at any time, the team was automatically eliminated. Had it been successfully completed, the team who did this the fastest would have won. However, the last remaining contestants walked away with two [[Mazda]] vehicles for winning a previous stunt (see [[Fear Factor#Second stunt|Second stunt]]).\n\nAfter the acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] of [[Vivendi]] by [[NBC]]'s parent company [[General Electric]] in 2004, contestants could win vacations in order to promote the theme park division of [[NBCUniversal]] at [[Universal Orlando]], or win trips to Universal Studios in [[Hollywood]].\n\nThe order of the stunts on a typical episode of ''Fear Factor'' is as follows:\n\n'''First stunt:''' The first stunt is designed to physically test each of the contestants or teams (for example, jumping from one building to the next or hanging from a helicopter and collecting flags on a ladder). Usually, the two men and the two women, or the three teams, that gave the best performance (such as the fastest time, farthest distance, or number of flags collected in under a certain time) will move on to the second stunt. The others are eliminated. In the sixth season, a sometimes used rule was that the best-performing team won the ability to eliminate the team of their choice, meaning that teams who failed to complete the stunt or had the worst performance could still advance to the next round if the winning team did not choose to eliminate them.\n\n'''Second stunt:''' The second stunt is meant to mentally challenge the contestants or teams. The three most common types of stunts in the second round are eating stunts, animal stunts, and retrieval/transfer stunts. Eating stunts entail ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple items; animal stunts entail immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, spiders, snakes, or worms); retrieval/transfer stunts entail retrieving items or gross objects (often by mouth) hidden in disgusting substances (for example, blood or lard) or live animals. Less often, the second stunt involves a pain endurance challenge or embarrassment tolerance challenge, such as outlasting competitors in a [[tear gas]] chamber, walking on broken glass with bare feet, getting a tattoo, having their head shaved, getting piercings, or ingesting [[habanero]] peppers. With the exception of retrieval/transfer stunts, contestants are usually not eliminated after this stunt unless they fail to complete it or vomit before finishing. In the case of teams, one team may be eliminated for having the worst performance. In later episodes, a common (but not always used) rule was that no one would be eliminated after the second stunt; instead, the contestant or team that performed the best would receive a prize, such as a vehicle or a prize package similar in value. More often than not, the contestant/team with the best performance had the privilege of choosing the order that the contestants/teams had to go in to perform the next stunt [for the following day].\n\n'''Third stunt:''' The third and final stunt is usually something from an extreme type of stunt seen in an [[action film]]. Like the first stunt, it usually involves heights, water, vehicles, or some combination of the three. In order to avoid ties, this stunt is always competitive. The player or team with the best performance this round wins the grand prize, usually [[U.S. Dollars|$]]50,000, and has the privilege of being informed by Rogan that \"evidently, fear is not a factor for you\".\n\n===Special formats===\n\n====Four-Stunt Show====\nThis was typically a 90-minute episode featuring four stunts instead of three. The first such episode aired in Season 3 and was notable for a stunt involving [[body piercing]]. In Seasons 4 to 6, at least one of the four stunts was a non-elimination stunt in which contestants competed for a prize. The four-stunt format was sometimes used in conjunction with themed episodes, such as Family Fear Factor, Twins Fear Factor, and Thanksgiving Fear Factor. In Season 5, six contestants from other reality shows competed in a two-hour, four-stunt episode for $50,000.\n\n====Extended competitions====\nSome ''Fear Factor'' competitions consisted of five or more stunts and featured an increased grand prize. These competitions were always presented as multi-part episodes or single two-hour episodes. The first such competitions were the Tournaments of Champions in Seasons 2 and 3 (see below). Season 4 included a two-hour season premiere in which twelve contestants competed in six stunts for a grand prize of $1,000,000; and a two-part, six-stunt Las Vegas episode where the winner would have a chance to win up to $100,000 based on his or her performance in the final stunt (they would then have to bet half their winnings on a hand of blackjack). Season 6 featured two three-episode, six-stunt competitions (\"Psycho Fear Factor\" and \"Reality Stars Fear Factor\"). Season 7 included two five-stunt competitions in which five teams competed for a grand prize of $100,000; the first aired as a single two-hour episode, and the second aired in two parts.\n\n'''Tournament of Champions:''' The second and third seasons concluded with a Tournament of Champions featuring the winners of each show in that season and a $100,000 grand prize. In Season two, the thirteen non-celebrity winners were divided into groups of eight men and five women. For the first four stunts, men competed amongst men and women competed amongst women, in two stunts each. The men had to release a flag from a locked box while hanging suspended in the air and eat three different items from a table. The women had to collect flags while on top of an aircraft and retrieve three poles from a tank with [[alligator]]s. The stunts narrowed the contestants down from eight men and five women to two men and two women who will, in the end, compete against each other for the grand prize by using a key to activate a horn while riding on a speeding truck. In Season three, the twenty-four winners were divided into two groups of twelve, each containing seven men and five women. In the first semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six to three to two finalists. In the second semifinal episode, the group was cut from twelve to six in the first stunt, then the men competed amongst the men and the women competed amongst the women in the second stunt, and then the final four contestants, two men and two women, were cut to two finalists. Each finalist won a 2004 [[Mazda RX-8]] and a chance at the $100,000. In the finals, the four finalists competed in three stunts. Each stunt eliminated one contestant, and the final stunt determined the winner.\n\n'''Couples Fear Factor:''' Seasons 4 and 5 both included ''Couples Fear Factor'' competitions that played out over seven episodes and featured a grand prize of $1,000,000. Nine couples competed in 17 stunts in Season 4, and eight couples competed in 14 stunts in Season 5. In Season 4, each episode contained two or three stunts, with at least one stunt being a non-elimination stunt. In Season 5, each episode featured two stunts; the first was always a non-elimination stunt, and the second usually eliminated the team with the worst performance. In contrast to the regular format, only one team was eliminated in each elimination stunt; if multiple teams failed the stunt, then the teams that succeeded would vote on which failing team to eliminate. Almost every stunt offered a prize (e.g., [[Automobile|cars]], vacations, pre-loaded [[credit card]]s, a chance to steal a desired prize from another team) or a $10,000 incentive to the team with the best performance. ''Couples Fear Factor'' episodes had certain stylistic differences from the regular format, including a different opening sequence, and onscreen interviews with the contestants (regular episodes usually presented interviews in voiceover format only).\n\n'''Psycho Fear Factor:''' A three-episode series in which six couples competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $250,000. The stunts were centered around the Bates Motel on the set of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' horror movie from [[Paramount Pictures]]. Unlike other Fear Factor episodes, contestants were required to sleep in the filthy Bates Motel between stunts and were subjected to Fear Factor pranks and mini-challenges while in the motel.\n\n'''Reality Stars Fear Factor:''' A three-episode series in which five teams of Reality TV stars competed in six stunts for various cash and prizes, including a grand prize of $150,000. The series featured teams from ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', and ''[[The Real World]]''.\n\n====Other formats====\n'''Celebrity special''' (Seasons two, three, and six):\nIn Seasons 2 and 3, episodes with celebrity contestants were played in the normal format, except that contestants were playing for charity. The winning contestant's charity would receive $50,000, and other contestants' charities would receive a lesser amount ($10,000 or $25,000). In Season 6, eight celebrity contestants paired up into teams of two for the first two stunts but competed individually in the final stunt. [[Stephen Baldwin]], [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin Richardson]] and [[Alan Thicke]] are among the celebrities who have competed on ''Fear Factor''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/alan-thickes-greatest-36659/|title=Alan Thicke's Greatest Fear|work=Lauren Kane|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|date=2002}} Retrieved December 2016</ref> Season 2 included an episode featuring six WWF/E stars; it was won by [[Matt Hardy]].\n\n'''All-Gross Show''' (Seasons three to six):\nAll three stunts on this show followed the format of the second (gross) stunt as described above. The first such episode involved [[Apple bobbing|bobbing]] for objects in a vat containing 50 gallons of cow [[blood]]. In seasons four and five, the all-gross format was used for Halloween-themed episodes. In season six, a \"Farm Fear Factor\" episode featured all gross stunts.\n\n'''Mixed Team and Individual Stunts''' (Seasons two, five, and six):\nIn most episodes, contestants competed individually or in teams of two for the entire competition. However, there were three episodes in which contestants paired up into teams for the first and/or second stunt but competed individually in the final stunt. The first instance of this was a Season 2 episode in which three pairs of [[twins]] competed as teams in the first stunt, and competed individually the second and third stunts. In Season 5's \"New York vs. L.A.\" episode, the first stunt narrowed a pool of eight contestants down to four (one man and one woman from each city); contestants from the same city then teamed up in the second stunt, and all contestants competed as individuals in the final stunt. A Season 6 celebrity episode had contestants competing as teams in the first two stunts and individually in the final stunt. In the latter episode, contestants were allowed to attempt the stunts alone if their partner quit before the stunt started.\n\n'''Holiday specials''' (Seasons three to five):\nOver the course of the series, Fear Factor produced three Christmas episodes, two Halloween episodes, and a Thanksgiving episode. The Christmas episodes featured Christmas-themed stunts but were otherwise played in the normal format. The Halloween episodes followed the all-gross format, and the Thanksgiving episode followed the four-stunt format.\n\n'''Las Vegas Show''' (Seasons three to five):\nStunts took place at various [[hotel]]s and [[casino]]s in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The show's winner was required to bet at least half of their winnings on one hand of [[Blackjack]], with the chance to continue gambling if successful.\n\n'''Special Contestants''' (Seasons two to seven):\nSome episodes featured a specific type of contestant (e.g., models, all-female, twins, military members, reality TV stars, freaks and geeks, young and old, returning contestants) or teams with a specific type of relationship (e.g., couples, newlyweds, siblings, best friends, parent/child teams, exes). Many of these episodes were played in the regular format, although some used a four-stunt or extended competition format.\n\n'''Fear Factor [[Super Bowl]] Halftime Show''' (Season two):\nPlayed in the normal format with ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmates. The first stunt aired as counter programming to the Super Bowl halftime show and ended right before the third quarter of the game started. The remaining two stunts were shown immediately after the game as counter programming to the Super Bowl lead-out show.\n\n'''Miss USA''' (Seasons three to five):\nPlayed in the normal format with [[Miss USA]] contestants, with the winning contestant keeping $25,000 and giving $25,000 to a charity of their choice. There was no Miss USA edition in the sixth season of ''Fear Factor'', as [[NBC]] produced a Miss USA edition of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'' instead; the Miss USA contestants were the briefcase models for the entire episode. The next time that Miss USA delegates would be involved in a game show was in 2010 on ''[[Minute to Win It]]''. The Miss USA edition was not present in the show's final two seasons, as the current format had four teams of two people.\n\n'''Blind Date''' (Season six):\nFour single men were introduced to four single women, and either the women (in the first episode) or the men (in the second episode) got to choose their partner among the available contestants of the opposite sex. The game was then played in the regular format, with the winning team dividing the prize.\n\n'''Sleep Deprivation''' (Season four):\nFive co-ed pairs of contestants competed as teams in the normal format, with one exception: contestants had to stay awake for the 48-hour duration of the competition. If a contestant fell asleep at any time before the final stunt was completed, his or her team would be eliminated. This was the only episode in the TV series in which contestants could be eliminated in the downtime between stunts.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n'''Million Dollar Heist:''' (Season six): Played in the regular teams format, but instead of competing for the normal $50,000 prize, teams would race head-to-head to \"steal\" up to $1,000,000 worth of gold from an armored truck submerged in water for their final stunt. The team that \"stole\" the most money's worth of gold within the time limit would win the combined amount of money collected by both teams.\n\n'''Home Invasion''': This short segment was included at the end of each episode in Season six. It involved Joe Rogan going to different homes across America and challenging a family to compete in a stunt. Each stunt usually involved the contestants, under time limit (usually one minute), ingesting or bobbing in something foul or undesirable. If successful, the family would win up to $5,000 in the form of pre-loaded credit cards from [[Capital One]].\n\n==Revived series (2011\u201312)==\nThe series revival began airing on December 12, 2011, and the two premiere episodes were viewed by 8.7 million and 8.5 million viewers, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Stephan |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/12/13/fear-factor-ratings/ |title='Fear Factor' premiere ratings &#124; Inside TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> This makes the premiere the highest non-sports programming to air on NBC at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. since February 2008. Following Rogan's word for a verbal disclaimer, the narrator gives a statement, and this is one most commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|It all began ten years ago, at the dawn of reality television. Audiences had never seen anything like it. Now, the legend begins all over again. It's bigger, better and more intense than ever before. Welcome back to ''Fear Factor.''}}\n\nThe revival featured four teams of two people with a preexisting relationship per episode, rather than the original versions' six people (three males and three females). The first five seasons had typically used the three male, three female grouping, but the sixth and final pre-revival season always utilized 4 teams of two people each. The stunts have remained basically the same, with the \"gross\" one in between the two physical ones.\n\nNBC pulled a two-hour, five team, five stunt episode entitled \"Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!\" which featured a stunt where teams spun a wheel to determine whether they would have to shave their heads and eyebrows, get tattooed, or be tear gassed. This episode was scheduled to air in two parts on January 23 and 30, 2012, but it was postponed after Part 1 was replaced by a GOP debate.\n\nAnother episode, entitled \"Hee Haw! Hee Haw!\" and featuring a stunt where contestants drink the urine and semen of a donkey, was then scheduled to air January 30, 2012. Hesitant about airing the stunt, NBC eventually pulled the episode after pictures of the stunt appeared online. Video footage of the stunt appeared online after the episode aired on Danish TV in June 2012,<ref>{{cite web|title=Fear Factor' Donkey Semen Stunt Finally Airs ... On Danish TV|url=http://www.tmz.com/category/fear-factor-donkey-semen/|publisher=TMZ|accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> and ''Fear Factor'' eventually posted short clips of all three stunts on their [[YouTube]] channel in July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fear Factor Moments \u2013 Shock Walk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7Ku1rgjidg|website=YouTube|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Factor Moments \u2013 Donkey Juice|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6KiP7iQgo|website=YouTube|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fear Factor Moments \u2013 Train & Car Crash|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O41xsGXPeks|website=YouTube|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe sixth episode, entitled \"The Bees Are So Angry\", was two hours instead of the usual one, and included five teams, five stunts, and a $100,000 prize instead of the usual four teams, three stunts, and $50,000 prize. Following this episode, ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' replaced the series' slot on Monday nights.\n\nNBC rescheduled the two hour \"Leeches & Shaved Heads & Tear Gas, Oh My!\" episode, which aired in two parts over the nights of July 9 and July 16. The first part ended with the \"To Be Continued\" subtitle followed by a preview for the second part. As of July 2012, ''Fear Factor'' was officially cancelled.\n\n===US Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Order\n! Episode\n! Airdate\n! Rating\n! Share\n!

As the show started, Ludacris gives a verbal disclaimer. The wording has changed with certain versions, but this is one commonly used:\n\n{{cquote|The challenges you are about to see were designed and tested by trained professionals. They are extremely ludicrous and should never be attempted by anyone, anywhere, or at anytime. This is MTV's ''Fear Factor''.}}\n\nHowever, the order of the stunts, as well as some of the rules, differ from the original format. Each episode of the MTV version has three named rounds: Beat the Beast, Face Your Fear, and The Final Fear.\n\n'''Beat the Beast:''' This stunt challenges the contestants to conquer their fear of something creepy (usually live creatures considered gross or intimidating) and generally follows the same format as animal stunts from the second stunt of the original version. The team with the best performance in this round wins a \"FearVantage\", which is an advantage in the next round (such as picking the order).\n\n'''Face Your Fear:''' This is a challenge tailored to a common fear shared by all of the contestants on a particular episode. The nature of this stunt varies widely depending on the fears of the contestants.\n\n'''The Final Fear:''' This is an extreme physical stunt that follows the same format as the first and third stunts from the original version of the show. The team with the best performance wins the $50,000 grand prize.\n\n==International versions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:92%; line-height:14px; background:#F8F8FF; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

public mainly because of the show's second stunt, which intends to [[disgust]] its viewers. The [[American Humane Association]] expressed concerns for allowing various animals to get injured, and even killing insects by eating them alive during the videotaping of the show. The association also revealed that professional [[animal training|animal trainers]] have refused to work on the show because the producers of ''Fear Factor'' have demanded stunts which violate the association's guidelines.\n\n<blockquote>American Humane believes that shows like ''Fear Factor'' are on a slippery slope of animal mistreatment and provide poor examples of animal treatment and humane ethics. As we work diligently to expand voluntary compliance with animal safety guidelines, organisations like Endemol who blatantly demonstrate complete disregard for animal welfare, or even that of their human contestants \u2014 are producing unacceptable programming.

Austin Aitken, a part-time [[paralegal]] from [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], sued [[NBC]] for $2.5 million [[United States dollar|USD]] for airing the show, claiming that he felt so disgusted from watching the stunt, his [[blood pressure]] rose until he felt dizzy and lightheaded and subsequently vomited. He claimed that his disorientation was so severe that he ran into a doorway and seriously injured himself. In March 2005, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells threw out the lawsuit on the grounds of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment protection]].<ref>Joe Milicia, [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1104759364675 Viewer Sues NBC Over 'Fear Factor' Rat-Eating Episode] Accessed March 3, 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815131635/http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1104759364675 |date=August 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n''Fear Factor'' was also criticized by major U.S. electrical utilities for an episode that required contestants to climb through a simulated electrical substation with \"electrified wires\" replete with simulated sparks and electrical sounds added in post-processing.

The show followed thirty-one contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom-built house. Each week, one or more of the housemates were evicted by a public vote.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, ''Big Brother Greece 4'' launched under the name '''''Big Mother''''' on [[ANT1]] on October 3, 2005 and ended on December 29, 2005, lasted 88 days. It featured a new format and was known as \"Big Mother\". In '''''Big Mother''''', the nine housemates take part in the game with their mothers, with whom they must coexist during the contest. The \"mamas\" were not able to win the prize but they would stay with their children until their eviction. When a housemate is evicted, their mother must also leave the house. However, this proved to be a failure with the show's audience and the show's name switched back to '''''Big Brother''''' and use the traditional format in mid-season.\n\nDespite the switch back to the traditional format, ratings still did not meet expectations and ANT1 decided to abandon the Big Brother franchise. The last remaining housemate, Nikos Papadopoulos, was declared the winner, winning a cash prize of \u20ac200,000.\n\nThe show presented by [[Tatiana Stefanidou]]. <ref name=\"bbcgreece\">{{cite news|first=Panos|last=Polyzoidis|title=Greece's Big Brother row|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1889048.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2002-03-23|accessdate=2007-12-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131220025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1889048.stm| archivedate= 31 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Housemates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; line-height:20px; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!

The show followed thirty-one contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom-built house. Each week, one or more of the housemates were evicted by a public vote.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, ''Big Brother Greece 4'' launched under the name '''''Big Mother''''' on [[ANT1]] on October 3, 2005 and ended on December 29, 2005, lasted 88 days. It featured a new format and was known as \"Big Mother\". In '''''Big Mother''''', the nine housemates take part in the game with their mothers, with whom they must coexist during the contest. The \"mamas\" were not able to win the prize but they would stay with their children until their eviction. When a housemate is evicted, their mother must also leave the house. However, this proved to be a failure with the show's audience and the show's name switched back to '''''Big Brother''''' and use the traditional format in mid-season.\n\nDespite the switch back to the traditional format, ratings still did not meet expectations and ANT1 decided to abandon the Big Brother franchise. The last remaining housemate, Nikos Papadopoulos, was declared the winner, winning a cash prize of \u20ac200,000.\n\nThe show presented by [[Tatiana Stefanidou]]. <ref name=\"bbcgreece\">{{cite news|first=Panos|last=Polyzoidis|title=Greece's Big Brother row|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1889048.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2002-03-23|accessdate=2007-12-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131220025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1889048.stm| archivedate= 31 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Housemates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; line-height:20px; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!

The show followed eighteen contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom-built house. \n\nIn 2003, ''[[Big Brother (Greek TV series)|Big Brother Greece 3]]'' launched under the name '''''The Wall''''' on [[ANT1]] on March 10 and ended on June 30, last 113 days. This season introduced the notion of \"The Battle,\" in which the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half, with two teams of housemates constantly fighting for time in the luxurious half. Each week, one or more of the housemates were evicted by a public vote. The last remaining housemate, Thodores Jsp\u00f3gloy, was declared the winner, winning a cash prize of \u20ac300,000.\n\nThe show presented by [[Andreas Mikroutsikos]].

The show followed eighteen contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom-built house. \n\nIn 2003, ''[[Big Brother (Greek TV series)|Big Brother Greece 3]]'' launched under the name '''''The Wall''''' on [[ANT1]] on March 10 and ended on June 30, last 113 days. This season introduced the notion of \"The Battle,\" in which the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half, with two teams of housemates constantly fighting for time in the luxurious half. Each week, one or more of the housemates were evicted by a public vote. The last remaining housemate, Thodores Jsp\u00f3gloy, was declared the winner, winning a cash prize of \u20ac300,000.\n\nThe show presented by [[Andreas Mikroutsikos]].

Though identifying as \"[[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Muslim]]s\" in the context of Bosnia's ethnic set-up, religion plays no part in their life.

Luna asks Amar to return home with her but Amar insists that life in this isolated community of faithful followers has brought him peace and also keeps him from drinking. When he returns home a few weeks later, Luna realizes that Amars attitude to religion has fundamentally changed. Amar claims that his only interest is to become a better person, but Luna finds it extremely difficult to follow his line of thinking. She begins to question everything that she has believed in, even her desire to have a child. As the wounds of a tragic war-filled past continue to haunt her, Luna tears herself apart searching if love is truly enough to keep her and Amar together on the path to a lifetime of happiness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107]]\n* [[Leon Lu\u010dev]]\n* [[Mirjana Karanovi\u0107]]\n* [[Nina Violi\u0107]]\n* Jasna Beri\n* [[Jasna \u017dalica]]\n* Mirvad Kuri\u0107\n* [[Sebastian Cavazza]]\n* Marija Kohn\n* Izudin Bajrovi\u0107\n* [[Vanessa Glodjo]]\n* Ermin Bravo\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was screened in competition at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale 2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2010/02_programm_2010/02_Programm_2010.html |title=60th Berlin International Film Festival: Programme |accessdate=16 October 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> At the [[7th Yerevan Golden Apricot International Film Festival]] the film won the [[FIPRESCI Prize]].<ref name=gaiff.am>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaiff.am/en/winners//year/2010.html|title=Golden Apricot International Film Festival|work=gaiff.am|accessdate=1 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131025219/http://www.gaiff.am/en/winners//year/2010.html|archive-date=31 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|1156531}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:On The Path}}\n[[Category:2010 films]]\n[[Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina films]]\n[[Category:Bosnian-language films]]\n[[Category:2010 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107]]\n[[Category:Films set in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Films about Islam]]\n[[Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina drama films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2010 film}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = On the Path\n| image          = On the Path.jpg\n| caption        = Film poster\n| director       = [[Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107]]\n| producer       = Damir Ibrahimovi\u0107 {{Plain list}} Bruno Wagner {{Plain list}} Barbara Albert\n| writer         = [[Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107]]\n| starring       = [[Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107]]<br>[[Leon Lu\u010dev]]<br>[[Nina Violi\u0107]]<br>[[Mirjana Karanovi\u0107]]\n| music          = \n| cinematography = Christine A.

{"title_page": "Edinburgh Geological Society", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n\nThe '''Edinburgh Geological Society''' ('''EGS''') was founded in 1834 in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, with the aim of stimulating public interest in [[geology]] and the advancement of geological knowledge. It was a time of debate and controversy surrounding the emerging science of geology and Edinburgh was one of the centres of this debate, which is why the Society is among the oldest of the Scottish scientific societies.\n\nThroughout its 170-year history, the Society has seen major changes in geological thinking, from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theories of [[evolution]] to the modern ideas on [[plate tectonics]]. The Society still seeks to stimulate public interest and offers a range of facilities to members including lectures, excursions, publications and the maintenance of a geological library.\n\n==History==\nThe Society was founded in 1834 by eleven students from the department of Geology and Mineralogy of [[Queen's College, Edinburgh]]. They met in Robertson's Tavern, Milne's Close, Edinburgh and resolved to start a geological society 'for discussion and mutual instruction'. At their first scientific meeting, they argued about the [[volcanic]] origin of [[Arthur's Seat]] in the heart of Edinburgh. They were all students of [[Alexander Rose (geologist)|Alexander Rose]] and from then on they met in his house in [[Drummond Street, Edinburgh|Drummond Street]]. They elected John Castle as their first President but a few months later, Rose was elected President and remained in that post for 11 years.\n\n===Notable Presidents of the Society===\n* 1834\u201335: John Castle \u2014 student: first President\n* 1835\u201346: Alexander Rose \u2014 lecturer at Queen's College, Edinburgh: 'father of the Society'\n* 1874\u201389: [[David Milne-Home]] \u2014 Advocate, geologist and meteorologist: longest tenure as President\n* 1908\u201310: [[Charles_Clough_(geologist)|Charles Clough]] \u2014 Geological Survey field geologist\n* 1917-18: [[Thomas John Jehu]] \u2014 Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Lectures===\nFrom October to March, a varied programme of illustrated lectures is presented.

It was a time of debate and controversy surrounding the emerging science of geology and Edinburgh was one of the centres of this debate, which is why the Society is among the oldest of the Scottish scientific societies.\n\nThroughout its 170-year history, the Society has seen major changes in geological thinking, from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theories of [[evolution]] to the modern ideas on [[plate tectonics]]. The Society still seeks to stimulate public interest and offers a range of facilities to members including lectures, excursions, publications and the maintenance of a geological library.\n\n==History==\nThe Society was founded in 1834 by eleven students from the department of Geology and Mineralogy of [[Queen's College, Edinburgh]]. They met in Robertson's Tavern, Milne's Close, Edinburgh and resolved to start a geological society 'for discussion and mutual instruction'. At their first scientific meeting, they argued about the [[volcanic]] origin of [[Arthur's Seat]] in the heart of Edinburgh. They were all students of [[Alexander Rose (geologist)|Alexander Rose]] and from then on they met in his house in [[Drummond Street, Edinburgh|Drummond Street]]. They elected John Castle as their first President but a few months later, Rose was elected President and remained in that post for 11 years.\n\n===Notable Presidents of the Society===\n* 1834\u201335: John Castle \u2014 student: first President\n* 1835\u201346: Alexander Rose \u2014 lecturer at Queen's College, Edinburgh: 'father of the Society'\n* 1874\u201389: [[David Milne-Home]] \u2014 Advocate, geologist and meteorologist: longest tenure as President\n* 1908\u201310: Charles Clough \u2014 Geological Survey field geologist\n* 1917-18: [[Thomas John Jehu]] \u2014 Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Lectures===\nFrom October to March, a varied programme of illustrated lectures is presented.
