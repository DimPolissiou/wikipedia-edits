through a variety of mechanisms, however, the way in which [[inflammation]] is created does not greatly influence cancer risk.<ref name=\"Franks_2012\" /> Rather, the cancer risk is largely dependent on the fact that all autoimmune diseases increase chronic [[inflammation]] which has been linked to cancer.<ref name=\"Franks_2012\" /> Below are some autoimmune diseases most commonly linked to

When any one of these mechanisms fail, it is possible to have a reservoir of self-reactive cells that become functional within the immune system. The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created take place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.\n\nSome infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules.

The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created take place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.\n\nSome infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules. In this case, a normal immune response to ''C. jejuni'' can result in the production of antibodies that also react to a lesser degree with gangliosides of myelin sheath surrounding peripheral nerves' axons (i.e., [[Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9]]).

A lot of people use it as an attribute, but the real definition of swavey is a genre of music. The genre of music is the genre of fusing more than one together. I know it sounds strange, but if you ask an artist what they do they're going to say that they rap, they sing, they do rock, a lot of people are multi-talented. They get looked at confused, but I don't think that they're confused. I feel that they're just talented, swavey artists. Labels want to put you in one lane, but I feel like there are so many people are more than that and they're swavey artists.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicekicks.com/2012/10/14/tory-lanez-talks-air-jordans-music-industry-advice-staying-swavey/|title=Tory Lanez Talks Air Jordans, Music Industry Advice & Staying Swavey &#124; Nice Kicks|date=October 14, 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2015|author=Stonebook, Ian}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n===Drake===\nIn 2010, Lanez posted a video on YouTube, challenging fellow Canadian [[rapper]] [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], to whom he was rumored to be related. The video features him denying these rumors and announcing the $10,000 challenge. While showing Drake respect, Lanez again challenged him, but only if Drake would listen to some of his tracks from his second mixtape ''Playing for Keeps''. Lanez also claimed that if Drake did not like it, he would personally give to him $10,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torylanez.wordpress.com/about/|title=Biography The Official Tory Lanez Fansite|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://drizzy.ning.com/m/discussion?id=3514281%3ATopic%3A110007|title=Tory Lanez $10,000 Challenge To Drake (Who Do Ya'll Think?)|date=March 27, 2010|author=Kevin G|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In August 2015, while appearing on the \"Sway in the Morning\" radio show on [[Shade 45]], Lanez had taken a shot at Drake, alluding to the infamous freestyle he had performed on [[Hot 97]] six years prior where he had read lyrics from his [[BlackBerry]]. In October 2015, Lanez created additional tension with the rapper when he expressed his dislike of the use of \"the 6\", a nickname for Toronto, and one that had, of course, been popularized by Drake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapdose.com/2015/10/12/tory-lanez-disses-drake-says-its-not-cool-to-call-toronto-the-6/|title=Tory Lanez Disses Drake, Says It's Not Cool To Call Toronto \"The 6\"|website=Rapdose.com|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the lyrics of his 2016 single \"[[Summer Sixteen]]\", Drake appears to make a subliminal diss at Lanez, rapping: \"All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little.\" Many took this, and the ensuing lines, to be something off a shot taken towards Tory Lanez. Drake also took aim at [[Meek Mill]] who, in the midst of their ongoing feud, called out Drake for dissing Lanez on the song, \"[[War Pain]]\": \"Tory from the 6, you hatin\u2019 on him, Lord knows!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-goes-after-meek-mill-barack-obama-and-tory-lanez-on-summer-sixteen-news.19888.html|title=Drake Goes After Meek Mill, Barack Obama & Tory Lanez On \"Summer Sixteen\"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> In an interview with [[Revolt (TV network)|Revolt]], Tory was asked about the perceived shot. He was skeptical about whether it was aimed at him at all, he assured the press that he wouldn't be responding even if it was. \"Drake could diss me 20,000 times, and I\u2019d never diss him.

Many people thought Tory was taking shots at Drake. Tory disses Drake again in the song, \"Line Up the Flex\" with ASAP Ferg.

The tweet meant that Jacquees is in a fierce competition with every [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] artist in the game, except for [[Chris Brown]], who he says is his idol. The tweet wasn't convincing to Lanez, who responded to Jacquees with two choice emojis. Jacquees took Lanez' emoji response as an assault, and he went on to call Lanez a \"peasant\" and \"watermelon head ass\". Jacquees did, however, take the time to compliment Lanez' penmanship, though he implied that Lanez' vocal talents are not up to par with his own.

A lot of people use it as an attribute, but the real definition of swavey is a genre of music. The genre of music is the genre of fusing more than one together. I know it sounds strange, but if you ask an artist what they do they're going to say that they rap, they sing, they do rock, a lot of people are multi-talented. They get looked at confused, but I don't think that they're confused. I feel that they're just talented, swavey artists. Labels want to put you in one lane, but I feel like there are so many people are more than that and they're swavey artists.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicekicks.com/2012/10/14/tory-lanez-talks-air-jordans-music-industry-advice-staying-swavey/|title=Tory Lanez Talks Air Jordans, Music Industry Advice & Staying Swavey &#124; Nice Kicks|date=October 14, 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2015|author=Stonebook, Ian}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n===Drake===\nIn 2010, Lanez posted a video on YouTube, challenging fellow Canadian [[rapper]] [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], to whom he was rumored to be related. The video features him denying these rumors and announcing the $10,000 challenge. While showing Drake respect, Lanez again challenged him, but only if Drake would listen to some of his tracks from his second mixtape ''Playing for Keeps''. Lanez also claimed that if Drake did not like it, he would personally give to him $10,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torylanez.wordpress.com/about/|title=Biography The Official Tory Lanez Fansite|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://drizzy.ning.com/m/discussion?id=3514281%3ATopic%3A110007|title=Tory Lanez $10,000 Challenge To Drake (Who Do Ya'll Think?)|date=March 27, 2010|author=Kevin G|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In August 2015, while appearing on the \"Sway in the Morning\" radio show on [[Shade 45]], Lanez had taken a shot at Drake, alluding to the infamous freestyle he had performed on [[Hot 97]] six years prior where he had read lyrics from his [[BlackBerry]]. In October 2015, Lanez created additional tension with the rapper when he expressed his dislike of the use of \"the 6\", a nickname for Toronto, and one that had, of course, been popularized by Drake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapdose.com/2015/10/12/tory-lanez-disses-drake-says-its-not-cool-to-call-toronto-the-6/|title=Tory Lanez Disses Drake, Says It's Not Cool To Call Toronto \"The 6\"|website=Rapdose.com|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the lyrics of his 2016 single \"[[Summer Sixteen]]\", Drake appears to make a subliminal diss at Lanez, rapping: \"All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little.\" Many took this, and the ensuing lines, to be something off a shot taken towards Tory Lanez. Drake also took aim at [[Meek Mill]] who, in the midst of their ongoing feud, called out Drake for dissing Lanez on the song, \"[[War Pain]]\": \"Tory from the 6, you hatin\u2019 on him, Lord knows!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-goes-after-meek-mill-barack-obama-and-tory-lanez-on-summer-sixteen-news.19888.html|title=Drake Goes After Meek Mill, Barack Obama & Tory Lanez On \"Summer Sixteen\"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> In an interview with [[Revolt (TV network)|Revolt]], Tory was asked about the perceived shot. He was skeptical about whether it was aimed at him at all, he assured the press that he wouldn't be responding even if it was. \"Drake could diss me 20,000 times, and I\u2019d never diss him.

Many people thought Tory was taking shots at Drake. Tory disses Drake again in the song, \"Line Up the Flex\" with ASAP Ferg.

The tweet wasn't convincing to Lanez, who responded to Jacquees with two choice emojis. Jacquees took Lanez' emoji response as an assault, and he went on to call Lanez a \"peasant\" and \"watermelon head ass\". Jacquees did, however, take the time to compliment Lanez' penmanship, though he implied that Lanez' vocal talents are not up to par with his own.

The winner represents Texas in the [[Miss America]] pageant; three winners have gone on to be crowned Miss America (but none since 1975).\n\nTo become Miss Texas, a contestant must first win a local competition. A young woman may compete at the local and state level more than once, but may only compete in the national [[Miss America]] competition one time.

He was the [[chief executive]] of [[Diageo]], the world's largest [[spirits]] group, for twelve years between 2000 and 2013.\n\nWalsh was criticised in the press for what was seen as his excessive remuneration, but received admiration for his ability to build brands.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cowe|first=Roger|title=Grand Met Director May Collect \u00a33M|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 January 1996}}</ref> He spent the majority of his career at Diageo and its precursor [[Grand Metropolitan]]. His most notable decision was the acquisition of the [[Seagram]] drinks company, which added [[Captain Morgan]] [[rum]] and [[Crown Royal]] [[Canadian whisky]] to Diageo's roster of brands.\n\nWalsh's tenure in charge of Diageo closely mirrored his behaviour as head of the [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] food business: selling off non-essential assets such as [[Burger King]] and aggressively marketing a select number of \"core\" brands. He was disciplined regarding prices paid for the acquisition of assets. Towards the end of his Diageo career, he increased the company's exposure to developing markets such as India and China.\n\nIn February 2014 Walsh became the [[non-executive chairman]] of [[Compass Group]], the world's largest [[catering]] company. His role as an advisor to Diageo ended in September 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nWalsh was born in [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]], and raised in the former [[mill town]] of [[Chadderton]], [[Lancashire]], in the North West of England.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated13>{{cite news|last=Hancock|first=Ciaran|title=Stout defence of brand Guinness|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/agribusiness-and-food/stout-defence-of-brand-guinness-1.557793|accessdate=26 October 2012|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=26 October 2012}}</ref> The only child of Arthur and Anne Walsh, his father was a [[pipe fitter]] who later ran a small [[thermal engineering]] company, and his mother was a [[housewife]].<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Walsh believes that he inherited his work ethic from his father, his organisational skills from his mother, and his confidence from both parents, who he has described as \"strict\" but \"loving\".<ref name=autogenerated13 /><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|title=Boss with the most bottle|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/consumer_goods/article2326867.ece | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612070501/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/consumer_goods/article2326867.ece|archivedate=12 June 2011|url-status=dead| work=The Times |date=26 August 2007|location=London|first=Philippe|last=Naughton}}</ref> His great grandfather emigrated from Ireland, hence he bears the common Irish surname of Walsh.<ref name=autogenerated13 />\n\nWalsh was educated at his local [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], the [[Royton and Crompton School]], followed by [[Oldham College]].<ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=oldhamcol /> He initially aspired to become a fighter pilot after becoming influenced by his \"hero\", a mathematics teacher who had been in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II]].<ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite web|last=Prevett|first=Hannah|title=You live and you learn: Paul Walsh|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1023443/live-learn-Paul-Walsh/|date=1 September 2010|accessdate=4 October 2013|publisher=Management Today}}</ref> Walsh gained his pilot licence, but failed the medical examination to fly [[fighter jet]]s due to [[Color blindness|colour blindness]].<ref name=autogenerated5 />\n\nInstead, Walsh took a [[sandwich degree]] in [[accounting]] and economics at [[Manchester Metropolitan University|Manchester Polytechnic]] in 1973, with a work placement at the [[Co-operative Group]]'s soft drinks operation.<ref name=autogenerated12>{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Paul|title=Mr Diageo's thirst for power|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jul/23/theobserver.observerbusiness11|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=The Observer|date=23 July 2000}}</ref> He did not enjoy accounting, but reasoned that the skill would provide a good gateway into business.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> He moved to London to work for [[International Computers Limited]], and later the American [[Eaton Corporation]], a manufacturer of industrial equipment, which he says he learnt a \"can-do attitude\".<ref name=armluc>{{cite news|last=Armistead|first=Louise|title=Diageo's Paul Walsh hands over the keys to an impressive drinks cabinet|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10042841/Diageos-Paul-Walsh-hands-over-the-keys-to-an-impressive-drinks-cabinet.html|accessdate=3 October 2013|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=7 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Grand Metropolitan===\nWalsh joined London-based property and brewing conglomerate [[Grand Metropolitan]] (Grand Met) in 1982 as a [[financial planner]] and [[account manager]] for their brewing division [[Watney Combe & Reid|Watney, Mann & Truman]].

In 1999 Walsh returned to England, and was elected [[chief operating officer]] of Diageo in January 2000, and CEO in September 2000. He took over a company that had stagnated since its merger three years earlier, and that ''[[The Economist]]'' deemed \"mediocre\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Diageo: The morning after|newspaper=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/node/179376|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=12 December 1998}}</ref> As head of Diageo he transformed the consumer goods company into a streamlined premium drinks business. Walsh said:<blockquote>\"While Diageo had positions in drinks, that leadership was marginal \u2013 capital was not limitless. My view, supported by colleagues on the board, was that we should focus on where we can be a global leader.
