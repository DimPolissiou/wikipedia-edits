The attribution to the ''discipulo'' was revived in the catalogue of the 2001 Bosch exhibition in [[Rotterdam]], by Vermet and Vandenbroeck, who also suggested that several of the costumes suggest a much later date, around 1500, so that the awkward drawing and execution cannot be attributed to youthful imperfection. They also noted that the painting is not on oak, adding to their doubts about the attribution to Bosch.<ref>Koldeweij, J., P. Vandenbroeck, J. and Vermet, B.

Furthermore, the theme, symbolism and the composition itself is profoundly original, which would make it extremely unlikely that an unknown pupil could have painted it.<ref>C. Garrido and R.

English summary and commentary in: Stechow, Wolfgang, (1966), ''Northern Renaissance Art 1400-1600: Sources and Documents'' (paperback 1989, pp. 19-20).</ref> Immediately after this, and without starting a new paragraph, Guevara refers to the painting of the ''Seven Deadly Sins'' as characteristic of his style. This led some scholars, as early as Dollmayr (1898) and most vocally Stechow (1966), to ascribe the work to this pupil. \n\nMost experts have argued since, however, that given the highly ambiguous nature of the passage, Guevara had probably returned to a description of the works of Bosch himself. Furthermore, the accuracy and authority of Guevara is suspect: when in 1570 Guevara's heirs sold a copy of ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]'' to [[Phillip II of Spain]], it was made clear that Guevara had regarded that work as the original painted by Bosch himself, whilst nowadays it is known that his was a copy (displayed in [[El Escorial]]), of the original hanging in [[Prado]]. [[Phillip II of Spain]] himself purchased the work (prior to 1560, probably from a monastery art sale) in the belief that ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' was a Bosch original, and he always regarded it as such. It was his favourite Bosch painting and it hung in his own bedroom in [[El Escorial]]. When he donated the painting to [[El Escorial]] in 1574, it was cataloged as being a Bosch original; Silva Maroto argued that it is hard to believe that Guevara would question the authorship of Phillip's favourite Bosch in such an ambiguous passage, which as Maroto pointed out is part of a manuscript that remained unpublished until 1788.<ref name=silva/>\n\nThe alleged poor quality of the drawing had led to the incorrect belief it dates from Bosch's early period. The attribution to the ''discipulo'' was revived in the catalogue of the 2001 Bosch exhibition in [[Rotterdam]], by Vermet and Vandenbroeck, who also suggested that several of the costumes suggest a much later date, around 1500, so that the awkward drawing and execution cannot be attributed to youthful imperfection.

Together, the two highways run concurrently for nearly {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}}, through Hay Springs and into [[Rushville, Nebraska|Rushville]]. On the west side of Rushville, Highway 87 leaves to the north towards [[Pine Ridge, South Dakota]] while US&nbsp;20 continues through town.\n\n====Rushville to Valentine====\n[[File:Nebraska Sandhills NE97 Hooker County 3.JPG|thumb|The Nebraska Sandhills]]\n[[File:Niobrara National Scenic River Bluffs.jpg|thumb|Bluffs covered with Ponderosa pine line a curve on the Niobrara National Scenic River]]\nAfter departing Rushville, US&nbsp;20 bends to the northeast passing agricultural fields and grasslands. The highway passes through the small village of Clinton and continues on to the northeast before reaching the city of [[Gordon, Nebraska|Gordon]]. Gordon was home to [[outlaw]] [[Doc Middleton]] who operated a saloon in town between 1900 and 1913.<ref name=\"nebroadside2\">{{harvp|Boye|1989|pp=419&ndash;420}}</ref> Highway 20 leaves the city traveling east and just as the road turns to the northeast {{convert|12|mi|km}} east of Gordon enters the western reaches of the [[Nebraska Sandhills]]. The road winds its way to the northeast before arriving at the village of [[Merriman, Nebraska|Merriman]] in [[Cherry County, Nebraska|Cherry County]]. Cherry County is the largest county, by land area, in Nebraska with over {{convert|6000|mi2|km2}} it is larger than the states of [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], and [[Rhode Island]] combined.  Here, US&nbsp;20 intersects [[Nebraska Highway 61|N-61]] which is one of the most desolate highways in the state. Traveling south it is almost {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the next town, [[Hyannis, Nebraska|Hyannis]].<ref name=\"nebroadside3\">{{harvp|Boye|1989|p=419}}</ref> From Merriman, US&nbsp;20 continues east through the northern reaches of the sandhills. Between Merriman and [[Crookston, Nebraska|Crookston]], the highway is within {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} of the South Dakota border.\n\nContinuing through the sandhills, the highway winds its way east until it enters the small village of [[Cody, Nebraska|Cody]]. Cody was named for a railroad foreman and not [[Buffalo Bill]].<ref name=\"placenames\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dlas_EPVGFEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Nebraska Place-Names | publisher=University of Nebraska Press | author=Fitzpatrick, Lillian L. | year=1960 | pages=36}}</ref><ref name=\"nebroadside4\">{{harvp|Boye|1989|p=418}}</ref> The highway continues on to the east through the small villages of [[Nenzel, Nebraska|Nenzel]], [[Kilgore, Nebraska|Kilgore]], and [[Crookston, Nebraska|Crookston]]. Here the highway crosses over the Minnechaduza Creek marking the northern extent of the Nebraska Sandhills. The route then turns southeast, running parallel to the Minnechaduza Creek along the edge of the sandhills towards the city of [[Valentine, Nebraska|Valentine]]. US&nbsp;20 meets up with several other highways in Valentine, [[U.S. Route 83|US&nbsp;83]], [[Nebraska Highway 12|N-12]], and [[Nebraska Highway 97|N-97]] serving as a crossroads of North Central Nebraska. The [[Niobrara River]] runs along the southeast side of Valentine and the portion east of town is the start of the [[Niobrara Valley Preserve]], which preserves thousands of acres or riverine canyons and grasslands along a {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the river.<ref name=\"wne4\">{{cite web|url = https://www.westnebraska.com/sandhills-scenic-rivers/valentine/|title = Valentine|website = Journey to Western Nebraska|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref> This portion of the river is also designated as a National Scenic River. Valentine marks the eastern terminus of the Bridges to Buttes Scenic Byway.\n\n===Valentine to O'Neill===\nFrom Valentine, US&nbsp;20 takes a southeast line crossing the Niobrara River back into the sandhills. It continues towards the southeast through the small villages of [[Wood Lake, Nebraska|Wood Lake]] and [[Johnstown, Nebraska|Johnstown]] before turning to the east. After leaving Johnstown, the road enters flat plains where agricultural fields utilizing center pivot irrigation dot the landscape as the highway heads east towards [[Ainsworth, Nebraska|Ainsworth]]. In Ainsworth, the road meets up with [[Nebraska Highway 7|N-7]] and runs concurrently for {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} before [[U.S. Route 183 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;183]] also joins from the south. The three highways continue east and cross over a canyon formed by Long Pine Creek just north of [[Long Pine, Nebraska|Long Pine]].<ref name=\"nebroadside5\">{{harvp|Boye|1989|p=412}}</ref> {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the three highways diverge in [[Bassett, Nebraska|Bassett]]. Highway 7 continues north towards [[Springview, Nebraska|Springview]] while US&nbsp;183 heads south to [[Taylor, Nebraska|Taylor]]. US&nbsp;20 continues east through the small villages of [[Newport, Nebraska|Newport]] and [[Stuart, Nebraska|Stuart]] before turning southeast and entering the city of [[Atkinson, Nebraska|Atkinson]]. From here the highway continues east along the southern edge of flat plains dotted with agricultural fields into the city of [[O'Neill, Nebraska|O'Neill]]. O'Neill is located in the Elkhorn Valley and lies just north of the [[Elkhorn River|river]] of the same name.<ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n===O'Neill to Iowa===\nUS&nbsp;20 leaves O'Neill headed southeast concurrently with [[U.S. Route 275 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;275]] for {{convert|13|mi|km}} before turning due east towards the village of [[Orchard, Nebraska|Orchard]]. The highway continues east beyond Orchars and past the small villages of [[Royal, Nebraska|Royal]], [[Brunswick, Nebraska|Brunswick]], and [[Plainview, Nebraska|Plainview]]. As US&nbsp;20 continues east towards [[Osmond, Nebraska|Osmond]] there is a marked change in terrain as the road transitions from the flat plains to rolling hills of eastern Nebraska on the way to the [[Missouri River]].<ref name=\"unltopmap\"/> From Osmond, the highway continues east before crossing [[U.S. Route 81 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;81]] then turns northeast and travels along with Middle Logan Creek through the communities of [[Randolph, Nebraska|Randolph]] and [[Belden, Nebraska|Belden]]. The highway takes a jog to the north at [[Laurel, Nebraska|Laurel]] for {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} before turning back to the east. After passing by the towns of [[Waterbury, Nebraska|Waterbury]], [[Willis, Nebraska|Willis]], and [[Jackson, Nebraska|Jackson]], US&nbsp;20 emerges from the rolling hills into the [[Missouri River]] plain. As it approaches [[South Sioux City, Nebraska|South Sioux City]] the highway becomes a four-lane divided highway for the first time along its entire length. Shortly, thereafter, the highway becomes [[limited access|expressway]] and runs concurrently with [[Interstate 129]] as it intersects [[U.S. Route 75 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;75]] and [[U.S. Route 77 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;77]]. The highway continues east to the Missouri River where it crosses into [[Iowa]] functioning as a bypass around the southeastern side of [[Sioux City, Iowa]].<ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:NE Alliance 1958 with current US20 alignment.png|thumb|Former US&nbsp;20 alignment through Smiley Canyon with present-day alignment indicated in dashed red]]\nPrior to the assignment of US&nbsp;20, this route across northern Nebraska carried several different route numbers. In 1922, the highway followed the routes of [[Nebraska Highway 79|N-79]], [[Nebraska Highway 78|N-78]], [[Nebraska Highway 77|N-77]], [[Nebraska Highway 65|N-65]], and [[Nebraska Highway 49|N-49]] from west to east between the Wyoming state line and South Sioux City.<ref name=\"geelhart\">{{cite web|last1=Geelhart|first1=Chris|title=Highways 1 to 30|url=http://www.northernplainshighways.org/nebraska/ne1-30.html|website=Nebraska Highways|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}</ref> This route generally followed the former [[Cowboy Trail|Cowboy Line]], part of the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Chicago and North Western Railway]], from Wyoming to Sioux City via O'Neill.<ref name=\"chicagonorthwestern\">{{cite map|title = The North Western Line |url = https://www.cnwhs.org/images/map1909.jpg |date = 1909 |publisher = The North Western Line |access-date = January 21, 2017}}</ref> This is now a partially abandoned railway that has been converted into a biking and hiking trail. In the mid-1920s the multiple state highway designations gave way to a single route number, [[Nebraska Highway 1|N-1]] which encompassed the entire route from Wyoming to Iowa and was the immediate predecessor to US&nbsp;20 in 1926.\n\nThere have been a few realignments of US&nbsp;20 since its designation in 1926. An older alignment of US-20 ran about {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} south of the current section east of Laurel.  This alignment went due east from Laurel, along present day 869th Road, passing Dixon and Allen to an intersection with present-day [[Nebraska Highway 9|N-9]] where it turned north to meet up with the current alignment.<ref name=\"geelhart\"/> West of Fort Robinson, an old alignment of US&nbsp;20 traveled along modern day Smiley Canyon Scenic Drive. This is a winding road that runs through Smiley Canyon north of the current alignment. During the winters, this area of US&nbsp;20 would become treacherous leading to many accidents.<ref name=\"nebroadside6\">{{harvp|Boye|1989|p=434}}</ref>\n\nIn November, 2010, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman approved designating US-20 from Hay Springs to Fort Robinson in honor of Crazy Horse, capping a year-long effort by citizens of Chadron.

The route then turns southeast, running parallel to the Minnechaduza Creek along the edge of the sandhills towards the city of [[Valentine, Nebraska|Valentine]]. US&nbsp;20 meets up with several other highways in Valentine, [[U.S. Route 83|US&nbsp;83]], [[Nebraska Highway 12|N-12]], and [[Nebraska Highway 97|N-97]] serving as a crossroads of North Central Nebraska. The [[Niobrara River]] runs along the southeast side of Valentine and the portion east of town is the start of the [[Niobrara Valley Preserve]], which preserves thousands of acres or riverine canyons and grasslands along a {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the river.<ref name=\"wne4\">{{cite web|url = https://www.westnebraska.com/sandhills-scenic-rivers/valentine/|title = Valentine|website = Journey to Western Nebraska|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref> This portion of the river is also designated as a National Scenic River. Valentine marks the eastern terminus of the Bridges to Buttes Scenic Byway.\n\n===Valentine to O'Neill===\nFrom Valentine, US&nbsp;20 takes a southeast line crossing the Niobrara River back into the sandhills. It continues towards the southeast through the small villages of [[Wood Lake, Nebraska|Wood Lake]] and [[Johnstown, Nebraska|Johnstown]] before turning to the east. After leaving Johnstown, the road enters flat plains where agricultural fields utilizing center pivot irrigation dot the landscape as the highway heads east towards [[Ainsworth, Nebraska|Ainsworth]]. In Ainsworth, the road meets up with [[Nebraska Highway 7|N-7]] and runs concurrently for {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} before [[U.S. Route 183 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;183]] also joins from the south.

The highway continues east beyond Orchars and past the small villages of [[Royal, Nebraska|Royal]], [[Brunswick, Nebraska|Brunswick]], and [[Plainview, Nebraska|Plainview]]. As US&nbsp;20 continues east towards [[Osmond, Nebraska|Osmond]] there is a marked change in terrain as the road transitions from the flat plains to rolling hills of eastern Nebraska on the way to the [[Missouri River]].<ref name=\"unltopmap\"/> From Osmond, the highway continues east before crossing [[U.S. Route 81 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;81]] then turns northeast and travels along with Middle Logan Creek through the communities of [[Randolph, Nebraska|Randolph]] and [[Belden, Nebraska|Belden]]. The highway takes a jog to the north at [[Laurel, Nebraska|Laurel]] for {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} before turning back to the east. After passing by the towns of [[Waterbury, Nebraska|Waterbury]], [[Willis, Nebraska|Willis]], and [[Jackson, Nebraska|Jackson]], US&nbsp;20 emerges from the rolling hills into the [[Missouri River]] plain. As it approaches [[South Sioux City, Nebraska|South Sioux City]] the highway becomes a four-lane divided highway for the first time along its entire length. Shortly, thereafter, the highway becomes [[limited access|expressway]] and runs concurrently with [[Interstate 129]] as it intersects [[U.S. Route 75 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;75]] and [[U.S. Route 77 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;77]]. The highway continues east to the Missouri River where it crosses into [[Iowa]] functioning as a bypass around the southeastern side of [[Sioux City, Iowa]].<ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:NE Alliance 1958 with current US20 alignment.png|thumb|Former US&nbsp;20 alignment through Smiley Canyon with present-day alignment indicated in dashed red]]\nPrior to the assignment of US&nbsp;20, this route across northern Nebraska carried several different route numbers. In 1922, the highway followed the routes of [[Nebraska Highway 79|N-79]], [[Nebraska Highway 78|N-78]], [[Nebraska Highway 77|N-77]], [[Nebraska Highway 65|N-65]], and [[Nebraska Highway 49|N-49]] from west to east between the Wyoming state line and South Sioux City.<ref name=\"geelhart\">{{cite web|last1=Geelhart|first1=Chris|title=Highways 1 to 30|url=http://www.northernplainshighways.org/nebraska/ne1-30.html|website=Nebraska Highways|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}</ref> This route generally followed the former [[Cowboy Trail|Cowboy Line]], part of the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Chicago and North Western Railway]], from Wyoming to Sioux City via O'Neill.<ref name=\"chicagonorthwestern\">{{cite map|title = The North Western Line |url = https://www.cnwhs.org/images/map1909.jpg |date = 1909 |publisher = The North Western Line |access-date = January 21, 2017}}</ref> This is now a partially abandoned railway that has been converted into a biking and hiking trail. In the mid-1920s the multiple state highway designations gave way to a single route number, [[Nebraska Highway 1|N-1]] which encompassed the entire route from Wyoming to Iowa and was the immediate predecessor to US&nbsp;20 in 1926.\n\nThere have been a few realignments of US&nbsp;20 since its designation in 1926. An older alignment of US-20 ran about {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} south of the current section east of Laurel.  This alignment went due east from Laurel, along present day 869th Road, passing Dixon and Allen to an intersection with present-day [[Nebraska Highway 9|N-9]] where it turned north to meet up with the current alignment.<ref name=\"geelhart\"/> West of Fort Robinson, an old alignment of US&nbsp;20 traveled along modern day Smiley Canyon Scenic Drive. This is a winding road that runs through Smiley Canyon north of the current alignment. During the winters, this area of US&nbsp;20 would become treacherous leading to many accidents.<ref name=\"nebroadside6\">{{harvp|Boye|1989|p=434}}</ref>\n\nIn November, 2010, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman approved designating US-20 from Hay Springs to Fort Robinson in honor of Crazy Horse, capping a year-long effort by citizens of Chadron.
