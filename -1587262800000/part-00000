In the sixteenth season, Jo emerges from the psych ward, and she and Alex get legally married, after finding out they never signed a marriage license. She also becomes an attending. After \"My Shot\", Alex tells Jo he has went to his mother's. In \"[[Leave a Light On (Grey's Anatomy)|Leave a Light On]]\", after months of Alex's disappearance and Jo's concerns and suspicions he has left her, he reveals through a letter that Izzie did indeed have his kids via the frozen embryos and he has left to be a father to twins and to start a new life with her. Alex leaves her his shares at Grey Sloan and says she deserves better, but wants to give his kids the life she and him never had. In \"Life on Mars?\", Jo declares she will rise so high that she will make Alex look like a fool for having left her, and admits she cannot hate Alex because of how much he loved her.\n\n==Development==\n===Casting and creation===\nIn August 2012, it was announced that [[Camilla Luddington]], [[Gaius Charles]], and [[Tina Majorino]] had been cast as Jo Wilson, Shane Ross, and Heather Brooks, respectively; these characters would be the new interns of Seattle Grace-Mercy West.<ref name=\"greys\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greys-Anatomy-Tina-Majorino-1052050.aspx|title=Exclusive: ''True Blood'', ''Veronica Mars'' Alum Tina Majorino Lands a ''Grey's'' Gig|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|work=TV Guide|date=August 16, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2012}}</ref> [[TVGuide]] later reported that even with all of the recurring cast being added to ''Grey's Anatomy'' for the new season that ''[[True Blood]]'' star Camilla Luddington is the only actress with an option to become a series regular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/07/19/greys-anatomy-season-9-camilla-luddington/|title='Kate Middleton' Joins Grey's Anatomy Season 9|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|work=Wetpaint|date=July 19, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nLuddington had met [[Shonda Rhimes|Shonda]] a few months before the auditioning process for Jo and missed the actual audition due to a scheduling conflict. \u201c[She] had a pilot called Gilded Lilys that I tested for, so I knew [her] a few months before,\u201d the actress explained, according to ''[[TVLine]]''. \u201cWhen I went in [for Grey\u2019s], I actually missed the auditions because I was at Comic-Con for [[Tomb Raider]].

She assessed, \u201c[Camilla] had so beautifully gone through many months of very dark storytelling, and I didn\u2019t want any of us to watch Jo go into a hole again.\u201d Vernoff also said Jo's reaction made the most sense \u201cbecause [of] the experience [...] not knowing [can be] so much worse than a very painful truth. Jo had so many episodes of not knowing [where Alex was] that even though the [eventual] answer was horridly painful, there was really honest relief [in just knowing what was up]. Getting an answer finally allowed her to strangely feel better than she had when she was just in the dark. [She] had imagined every possible worst-case scenario.

Furthermore, Romero praised the camerawork in identifying the viewer in the shoes of a domestic abuse survivor, noting how it centers on her \u201cbewildered, horrified, and shocked face as Paul\u2019s voice sounds far away, like she\u2019s hearing it through a seashell\u201d. In another piece of commentary, she spoke of the [[gaslighting]] that her abusive partner uses, as Stadler's first remark is saying Brooke looks \u201cbetter\u201d and that \u201cIt looks like you finally got the help you needed.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/01/188363/greys-anatomy-jo-domestic-violence-husband|title=How Grey's Anatomy Is Dealing With Domestic Violence|last=Romero|first=Ariana|work=TVGuide|date=January 19, 2019|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nJo's development and the sensitive subject matter of sexual assault in \u201cSilent All These Years\u201d was well remarked and acclaimed.
