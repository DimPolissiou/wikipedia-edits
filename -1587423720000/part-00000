Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante.

The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story.

In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good.

Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thinking about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\">{{Cite web

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU.

Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Director [[Matt Reeves]] stated: \"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character,<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> who was previously portrayed by [[J.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good.

Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thinking about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\">{{Cite web

He advocated religious toleration and emerged as a leader of the [[Levellers]] in 1647, which led to his imprisonment in 1649. \n\nIn October 1645 Walwyn published ''England's Lamentable Slaverie'', his famous rebuke to John Lilburne, in which he criticised his fellow Leveller for a misguided reliance on the Magna Carta of 1225 as the foundation for citizens' rights. He argued that it was, \"more precious in your [Liliburne's] esteem than it deserveth\", dismissing it as a small set of concessions \"wrestled out of the pawes\" of Norman conquerors and describing it as, \"a messe of pottage\", and (in the following year), \"but a beggerly thing containing many marks of intollerable bondage\".

The second pamphlet was a direct response to ''Wiles'' as its full title \"Walwyns Just Defence against the Aspertions Cast upon him, in a Late Un-Christian Pamphlet Entitled, Walwyns Wiles\" makes clear.

After being ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] for two centuries, the independent [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Principality of Zeta]] emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the [[House of Bal\u0161i\u0107]] between 1356 and 1421, and by the [[House of Crnojevi\u0107]] between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under [[Montenegro Vilayet|Ottoman rule]], Montenegro regained ''de facto'' independence in 1697 under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], first under the theocratic rule of [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|prince-bishops]], before being transformed into a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|principality]] in 1852. Montenegro's ''[[de jure]]'' independence was recognised by the [[Great Powers]] at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, following the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]]. In 1905, the country became a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|kingdom]]. After [[World War I]], it became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] together established a federation known as the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was renamed to the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year, ending a nearly 88-year union between the two states.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/serbia-ends-union-with-montenegro-1.785687 Serbia ends union with Montenegro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince 1990, the state of Montenegro has been governed by the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] and its minor coalition partners.

The first mention of Montenegro (as Monte nigro) dates to 9 November 1053 in a papal epistle and the others date to 1061, 1097, 1121, 1125, 1144, 1154, 1179 and 1189.<ref name=\"maticacrnogorska\">{{cite web  |title=PRVI POMENI CRNE GORE - Marijan Ma\u0161o Milji\u0107 |url=http://www.maticacrnogorska.me/matica67.html |website=www.maticacrnogorska.me}}</ref>\n\nThe native name ''Crna Gora,'' also meaning \"black mountain,\" came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.<ref name=Fine532>{{harvnb|Fine|1994|p=532}}</ref> Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]], but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]] took power in [[Upper Zeta]].<ref name=Fine532 /> The aforementioned region became known as ''Stara Crna Gora'' '[[Old Montenegro]]' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of ''Brda'' '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw the annexation of [[Old Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Metohija]] and southern [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. Its borders have changed little since then, losing [[Metohija]] and gaining the [[Bay of Kotor]].\n \nAfter the second session of the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''[[Federal State of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] by the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka|ZAVNOCGB]]. After Democratic Federal Yugoslavia became the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FPRY), the Federal State of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[People's Republic of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Narodna Republika Crna Gora'') on 29 November 1945.

Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046\u201381), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081\u20131101).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 January 1997 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright|Uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1878, painted by [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]]]]\nBy the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, it was conquered by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] as a province named Zeta. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojevi\u0107]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name&nbsp;\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514\u20131528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]).

In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.\n\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nParts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[First French Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], its successors. In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\"). However, the [[Venetian Republic]] introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. The republic was succeeded by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1797, and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II]] in 1832.

Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of [[Abdul Hamid II]] in 1909.<ref name=\"ttk.gov.tr\">U\u011fur \u00d6zcan, [http://www.ttk.gov.tr/index.php?Page=Yayinlar&KitapNo=989 II.

However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party of Montenegro|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.\n\nIn 1858 one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the\n[[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161|Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans (who had 15,000 troops) at [[Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. The glory of Montenegrin victory was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Montenegrins in Vojvodina,{{citation needed|date= June 2019}} then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognizing Montenegro's independence. The Ottoman Empire recognized Montenegrin independence in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855.\n\n[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|[[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Royal family of Montenegro]]: King [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Nicholas I]] with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law]]\n\nIn 1910 Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912 and 1913 (in which the Ottomans lost most of their Balkan lands), a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkod\u00ebr]] being awarded to a newly-created [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia.\n\nMontenegro became one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318). From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas which formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\n=== World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Italian governorate of Montenegro|Socialist Republic of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Crna Gora - Oslobodjenje od strane okupacije 1711-1918.png|thumb|left|Expansion of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918]]\n\nIn April 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. The first armed uprising in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&mm=07&dd=13&nav_category=167&nav_id=445290 |title=Prema oceni istori\u010dara, Trinaestojulski ustanak bio je prvi i najmasovniji oru\u017eani otpor u porobljenoj Evropi 1941. godine |publisher=B92.net |language=Serbian |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|Captured ships of the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslavian Navy]], [[Bay of Kotor]] 1941.]]\n[[File:Borbe_za_oslobo\u0111enje_Crne_Gore.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Montenegro in World War II]]\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Yugoslav Partisan)|Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107]], [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Veljko Vlahovi\u0107]], and [[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]]. Those loyal to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the [[University of Montenegro]] was established. Greater autonomy was established until the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] ratified a new constitution in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Serbia and Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)}}\nAfter the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] along with Serbia.\n\nIn the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992]], the turnout was 66%, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia.

The opponents claimed that the poll was organized under anti-[[Democracy|democratic conditions]] with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote.

Despite an extensive road network, no roads are built to full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform regional economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.\n\nCurrent [[European route]]s that pass through Montenegro are [[European route E65|E65]] and [[European route E80|E80]].\n\nThe backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway]], which provides international connection towards [[Serbia]]. There is a domestic branch line, the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway]], which was operated as a freight-only line for decades, and is now also open for passenger traffic after the reconstruction and electrification works in 2012. The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway]], is not in use.\n\nMontenegro has two international airports, [[Podgorica Airport]] and [[Tivat Airport]]. The two airports served 1.1&nbsp;million passengers in 2008. [[Montenegro Airlines]] is the flag carrier of Montenegro.\n\nThe [[Port of Bar]] is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during [[World War II]], with reconstruction beginning in 1950. Today, it is equipped to handle over 5 million tons of cargo annually, though the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the size of the Montenegrin industrial sector has resulted in the port operating at a loss and well below capacity for several years. The reconstruction of the [[Belgrade-Bar railway]] and the proposed [[Belgrade-Bar motorway]] are expected to bring the port back up to capacity.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Widok na Perast z zachodu 01.JPG|thumb|[[Perast]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]]]]\n[[File:Sveti Stefan (06).jpg|thumb|[[Sveti Stefan]]]]\nMontenegro has both a picturesque coast and a mountainous northern region.

It is a national strategy to make tourism a major contributor to the Montenegrin economy. A number of steps were taken to attract foreign investors. Some large projects are already under way, such as [[Porto Montenegro]], while other locations, like [[Jaz Beach]], [[Buljarica]], [[Velika Pla\u017ea]] and [[Ada Bojana]], have perhaps the greatest potential to attract future investments and become premium tourist spots on the [[Adriatic]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Montenegro|Demographic history of Montenegro}}\n\n=== Ethnic structure ===\n[[File:MontenegroEthnic2011.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|Predominant ethnic group in each municipality of Montenegro, 2011.]]\nAccording to the 2003 census, Montenegro has 620,145 citizens.

Children enroll in elementary schools ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Osnovna \u0161kola'') at the age of 6; it lasts 9 years. The students may continue their secondary education ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Srednja \u0161kola''), which lasts 4 years (3 years for trade schools) and ends with graduation ([[Matura]]). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years. There is one public university ([[University of Montenegro]]) and two private ones ([[Mediterranean University]] and [[University of Donja Gorica]]).\n\n=== Elementary and secondary education ===\nElementary education in Montenegro is free and compulsory for all the children between the ages of 7 and 15 when children attend the \"eight-year school\".\n\nVarious types of elementary education are available to all who qualify, but the vocational and technical schools (gymnasiums), where the students follow four-year course which will take them up to the university entrance, are the most popular. At the secondary level there are a number of art schools, apprentice schools and teacher training schools. Those who have attended the technical schools may pursue their education further at one of two-year post-secondary schools, created in response to the needs of industry and the social services.\n\nSecondary schools are divided in three types, and children attend one depending on choice and primary school grades:\n\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Gimnazija / \u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438j\u0430) lasts for four years and offers a general, broad education.

His Nero Wolfe novel ''[[The Black Mountain (novel)|The Black Mountain]]'' was largely set in Montenegro during the 1950s.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Montenegro}}\nThe media of Montenegro refers to mass media outlets based in Montenegro. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Montenegro]] guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a [[country in transition]], Montenegro's media system is under transformation.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's long history. It is a variation of Mediterranean and Oriental. The most influence is from Italy, [[Turkey]], [[Byzantine Empire]]/[[Greece]], and Hungary. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with seafood being a common dish, while the northern represents more the Oriental.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Nikola Vucevic Dec 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107]], a professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Orlando Magic]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] ([[NBA]]).]]\n\nThe '''Sports in Montenegro''' revolves mostly around team sports, such as [[Association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[water polo]], [[volleyball]], and [[Team handball|handball]].

Montenegro participated on two Eurobaskets until now.\n[[File:MontenegrinFans2.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica City Stadium]], Montenegro fans with national features.]]\n\nAmong women sports, [[Montenegro women's national handball team|the national handball team]] is the most successful, having won the [[2012 European Women's Handball Championship|2012 European Championship]] and finishing as runners-up at the [[Handball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]].

After being ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] for two centuries, the independent [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Principality of Zeta]] emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the [[House of Bal\u0161i\u0107]] between 1356 and 1421, and by the [[House of Crnojevi\u0107]] between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under [[Montenegro Vilayet|Ottoman rule]], Montenegro regained ''de facto'' independence in 1697 under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], first under the theocratic rule of [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|prince-bishops]], before being transformed into a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|principality]] in 1852. Montenegro's ''[[de jure]]'' independence was recognised by the [[Great Powers]] at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, following the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]]. In 1905, the country became a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|kingdom]]. After [[World War I]], it became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] together established a federation known as the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was renamed to the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year, ending a nearly 88-year union between the two states.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/serbia-ends-union-with-montenegro-1.785687 Serbia ends union with Montenegro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince 1990, the state of Montenegro has been governed by the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] and its minor coalition partners. Classified by the [[World Bank]] as an upper middle-income country, Montenegro is a member of the UN, [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]]. It is a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe country's English name derives from [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and translates as \"Black Mountain\", deriving from the appearance of [[Lov\u0107en|Mount Lov\u0107en]] when covered in dense evergreen forests.<ref name=\"visit-montenegro\">{{cite web |title=Montenegro History \u2013 Part I |url=https://www.visit-montenegro.com/montenegro/history/ |website=visit-montenegro.com |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> In the monuments of [[Kotor]], Montenegro was mentioned as Montenegro in 1397, as Monte Nigro in 1443 and as Crna Gora in 1435 and 1458, but there are much older papers of Latin sources where Montenegro is mentioned as Monte nigro. The first mention of Montenegro (as Monte nigro) dates to 9 November 1053 in a papal epistle and the others date to 1061, 1097, 1121, 1125, 1144, 1154, 1179 and 1189.<ref name=\"maticacrnogorska\">{{cite web  |title=PRVI POMENI CRNE GORE - Marijan Ma\u0161o Milji\u0107 |url=http://www.maticacrnogorska.me/matica67.html |website=www.maticacrnogorska.me}}</ref>\n\nThe native name ''Crna Gora,'' also meaning \"black mountain,\" came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.<ref name=Fine532>{{harvnb|Fine|1994|p=532}}</ref> Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]], but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]] took power in [[Upper Zeta]].<ref name=Fine532 /> The aforementioned region became known as ''Stara Crna Gora'' '[[Old Montenegro]]' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of ''Brda'' '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw the annexation of [[Old Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Metohija]] and southern [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. Its borders have changed little since then, losing [[Metohija]] and gaining the [[Bay of Kotor]].\n \nAfter the second session of the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''[[Federal State of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] by the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka|ZAVNOCGB]]. After Democratic Federal Yugoslavia became the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FPRY), the Federal State of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[People's Republic of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Narodna Republika Crna Gora'') on 29 November 1945. In 1963, the FPRY was renamed to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and coincidentally, the People's Republic of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]]''  ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Crna Gora'').

This name was briefly kept after declaration of independence.

Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046\u201381), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081\u20131101).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 January 1997 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright|Uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1878, painted by [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]]]]\nBy the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, it was conquered by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] as a province named Zeta. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojevi\u0107]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name&nbsp;\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514\u20131528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]). Also, [[Old Herzegovina]] region was part of [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]].\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n{{Main|Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] was the most popular spiritual and military leader from the [[Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]]. <br />'''Right:''' [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] was a [[List of rulers of Montenegro|Prince-Bishop]] (''vladika'') of Montenegro and the national poet and philosopher, Oil painting of Njego\u0161 as vladika, c.\u2009[[1837]]| width1 = 150\n| image1 = Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 \u0417\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438 XIX. \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430.jpg \n| width2 = \n| image2 = \n| width3 = 143\n| image3 = Njegosh_vladika.jpg\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\nLarge portions fell under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.\n\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nParts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[First French Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], its successors. In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\"). However, the [[Venetian Republic]] introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. The republic was succeeded by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1797, and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II]] in 1832. His predecessor [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar I]] contributed to the unification of Montenegro with the Highlands.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro===\n{{Main|Principality of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Battle of Vu\u010dji Do, Orao, 1877.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Vu\u010dji Do]], 1876]]\nUnder [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] (ruled 1860-1918), the [[principality]] was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of [[Abdul Hamid II]] in 1909.<ref name=\"ttk.gov.tr\">U\u011fur \u00d6zcan, [http://www.ttk.gov.tr/index.php?Page=Yayinlar&KitapNo=989 II.

However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party of Montenegro|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.\n\nIn 1858 one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the\n[[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161|Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans (who had 15,000 troops) at [[Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. The glory of Montenegrin victory was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Montenegrins in Vojvodina,{{citation needed|date= June 2019}} then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognizing Montenegro's independence. The Ottoman Empire recognized Montenegrin independence in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855.\n\n[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|[[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Royal family of Montenegro]]: King [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Nicholas I]] with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law]]\n\nIn 1910 Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912 and 1913 (in which the Ottomans lost most of their Balkan lands), a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkod\u00ebr]] being awarded to a newly-created [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia.\n\nMontenegro became one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318). From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas which formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\n=== World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Italian governorate of Montenegro|Socialist Republic of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Crna Gora - Oslobodjenje od strane okupacije 1711-1918.png|thumb|left|Expansion of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918]]\n\nIn April 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. The first armed uprising in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&mm=07&dd=13&nav_category=167&nav_id=445290 |title=Prema oceni istori\u010dara, Trinaestojulski ustanak bio je prvi i najmasovniji oru\u017eani otpor u porobljenoj Evropi 1941. godine |publisher=B92.net |language=Serbian |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|Captured ships of the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslavian Navy]], [[Bay of Kotor]] 1941.]]\n[[File:Borbe_za_oslobo\u0111enje_Crne_Gore.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Montenegro in World War II]]\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Yugoslav Partisan)|Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107]], [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Veljko Vlahovi\u0107]], and [[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]]. Those loyal to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the [[University of Montenegro]] was established. Greater autonomy was established until the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] ratified a new constitution in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Serbia and Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)}}\nAfter the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] along with Serbia.\n\nIn the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992]], the turnout was 66%, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia.

The opponents claimed that the poll was organized under anti-[[Democracy|democratic conditions]] with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote.

Despite an extensive road network, no roads are built to full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform regional economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.\n\nCurrent [[European route]]s that pass through Montenegro are [[European route E65|E65]] and [[European route E80|E80]].\n\nThe backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway]], which provides international connection towards [[Serbia]].

The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway]], is not in use.\n\nMontenegro has two international airports, [[Podgorica Airport]] and [[Tivat Airport]]. The two airports served 1.1&nbsp;million passengers in 2008. [[Montenegro Airlines]] is the flag carrier of Montenegro.\n\nThe [[Port of Bar]] is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during [[World War II]], with reconstruction beginning in 1950. Today, it is equipped to handle over 5 million tons of cargo annually, though the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the size of the Montenegrin industrial sector has resulted in the port operating at a loss and well below capacity for several years. The reconstruction of the [[Belgrade-Bar railway]] and the proposed [[Belgrade-Bar motorway]] are expected to bring the port back up to capacity.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Widok na Perast z zachodu 01.JPG|thumb|[[Perast]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]]]]\n[[File:Sveti Stefan (06).jpg|thumb|[[Sveti Stefan]]]]\nMontenegro has both a picturesque coast and a mountainous northern region.

Children enroll in elementary schools ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Osnovna \u0161kola'') at the age of 6; it lasts 9 years. The students may continue their secondary education ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Srednja \u0161kola''), which lasts 4 years (3 years for trade schools) and ends with graduation ([[Matura]]). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years. There is one public university ([[University of Montenegro]]) and two private ones ([[Mediterranean University]] and [[University of Donja Gorica]]).\n\n=== Elementary and secondary education ===\nElementary education in Montenegro is free and compulsory for all the children between the ages of 7 and 15 when children attend the \"eight-year school\".\n\nVarious types of elementary education are available to all who qualify, but the vocational and technical schools (gymnasiums), where the students follow four-year course which will take them up to the university entrance, are the most popular. At the secondary level there are a number of art schools, apprentice schools and teacher training schools. Those who have attended the technical schools may pursue their education further at one of two-year post-secondary schools, created in response to the needs of industry and the social services.\n\nSecondary schools are divided in three types, and children attend one depending on choice and primary school grades:\n\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Gimnazija / \u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438j\u0430) lasts for four years and offers a general, broad education.

His Nero Wolfe novel ''[[The Black Mountain (novel)|The Black Mountain]]'' was largely set in Montenegro during the 1950s.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Montenegro}}\nThe media of Montenegro refers to mass media outlets based in Montenegro. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Montenegro]] guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a [[country in transition]], Montenegro's media system is under transformation.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's long history. It is a variation of Mediterranean and Oriental. The most influence is from Italy, [[Turkey]], [[Byzantine Empire]]/[[Greece]], and Hungary. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with seafood being a common dish, while the northern represents more the Oriental.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Nikola Vucevic Dec 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107]], a professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Orlando Magic]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] ([[NBA]]).]]\n\nThe '''Sports in Montenegro''' revolves mostly around team sports, such as [[Association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[water polo]], [[volleyball]], and [[Team handball|handball]].

[[Montenegrin national football team]], founded at 2006, played in playoffs for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], which is the biggest success in the history of national team.\n\n[[Water polo]] is often considered the national sport. Montenegro's [[Montenegro national water polo team|national team]] is one of the top ranked teams in the world, winning the gold medal at the [[2008 Men's European Water Polo Championship]] in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, and winning the gold medal at the [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]], which was held in the Montenegrin capital, [[Podgorica]].

In 2006, the [[Basketball Federation of Montenegro]] along with this team joined the [[International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA) on its own, following the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Independence of Montenegro]]. Montenegro participated on two Eurobaskets until now.\n[[File:MontenegrinFans2.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica City Stadium]], Montenegro fans with national features.]]\n\nAmong women sports, [[Montenegro women's national handball team|the national handball team]] is the most successful, having won the [[2012 European Women's Handball Championship|2012 European Championship]] and finishing as runners-up at the [[Handball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]].

He is best known for his patriotic song \"[[Rule, Britannia!]]\", which has become a second [[national anthem]] to \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", and the song \"[[A-Hunting We Will Go]]\". Arne was a leading British theatre composer of the 18th century, working at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Covent Garden]].\n\n==Early life==\nArne was born to a Church of England father and a Roman Catholic mother in [[Covent Garden]] and baptised at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]].\n\nArne's father and grandfather were both [[upholstery|upholsterers]] and both held office in the [[Worshipful Company of Upholders]] of the [[City of London]].  His grandfather fell on hard times and died in the [[Marshalsea Prison|debtors' prison of Marshalsea]].  His father earned enough money not only to rent 31 King Street, a large house in Covent Garden,<ref>{{openplaque|233}}</ref> but also to have Arne educated at [[Eton College]]. But in later life, he too lost most of his money and had to supplement his income by acting as a numberer of the boxes (ticket counter) at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]].\n\nArne was so keen on music that he smuggled a [[spinet]] into his room and, damping the sounds with his handkerchief, would secretly practise during the night while the rest of the family slept. He also dressed up as a liveryman in order to gain access to the gallery of the [[Italian Opera]]. It was at the opera that Arne first met the musician and composer [[Michael Christian Festing|Michael Festing]], who was a major influence on him. Festing not only taught him to play the violin, but also took him to various musical events, including going to compete against  [[Thomas Roseingrave]] for the post of organist at [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]], and a visit to Oxford in 1733 to hear [[George Frideric Handel]]'s oratorio ''[[Athalia (Handel)|Athalia]]''.\n\nUpon leaving school, Arne was [[Articled clerk|articled]] to a [[solicitor]] for three years. However, Arne's father discovered his son leading a group of musicians at what was probably one of Festing's musical gatherings. Following this disclosure of his son's real interest and talent, he was persuaded (again probably by Festing) to allow the young Arne to give up his legal career and to pursue music as a living.\n\n==Musical career==\n[[File:Thomas Augustine Arne.png|thumb|left|Thomas Augustine Arne, 1778]]\nBetween 1733 and 1776, Arne wrote music for about 90 stage works, including [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[masques]], [[pantomimes]], and opera.

He is best known for his patriotic song \"[[Rule, Britannia!]]\", which has become a second [[national anthem]] to \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", and the song \"[[A-Hunting We Will Go]]\". Arne was a leading British theatre composer of the 18th century, working at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Covent Garden]].\n\n==Early life==\nArne was born to a Church of England father and a Roman Catholic mother in [[Covent Garden]] and baptised at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]].\n\nArne's father and grandfather were both [[upholstery|upholsterers]] and both held office in the [[Worshipful Company of Upholders]] of the [[City of London]].  His grandfather fell on hard times and died in the [[Marshalsea Prison|debtors' prison of Marshalsea]].  His father earned enough money not only to rent 31 King Street, a large house in Covent Garden,<ref>{{openplaque|233}}</ref> but also to have Arne educated at [[Eton College]]. But in later life, he too lost most of his money and had to supplement his income by acting as a numberer of the boxes (ticket counter) at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]].\n\nArne was so keen on music that he smuggled a [[spinet]] into his room and, damping the sounds with his handkerchief, would secretly practise during the night while the rest of the family slept. He also dressed up as a liveryman in order to gain access to the gallery of the [[Italian Opera]]. It was at the opera that Arne first met the musician and composer [[Michael Christian Festing|Michael Festing]], who was a major influence on him. Festing not only taught him to play the violin, but also took him to various musical events, including going to compete against  [[Thomas Roseingrave]] for the post of organist at [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]], and a visit to Oxford in 1733 to hear [[George Frideric Handel]]'s oratorio ''[[Athalia (Handel)|Athalia]]''.\n\nUpon leaving school, Arne was [[Articled clerk|articled]] to a [[solicitor]] for three years.
