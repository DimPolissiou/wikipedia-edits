[[Francisco Fajardo]], the son of a Spanish [[captain (land)|captain]] and a [[Guaiqueri]] ''[[cacique|cacica]]'', attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after founding a series of coastal towns. Fajardo's settlement did not last long. It was destroyed by natives of the region led by [[Terepaima]] and [[Guaicaipuro]]. This was the last rebellion on the part of the natives. On [[25 July]] 1567, Captain [[Diego de Losada]] laid the foundations of the city of ''Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas''. The foundation \u2212 1567 \u2013 \"I take possession of this land in the name of God and the King\" These were the words of Don Diego de Losada in founding the city of Caracas on 25 July 1567. In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Venezuela Province]] under Governor [[Juan de Pimentel]] (1576\u20131583).\n\nDuring the 17th century, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by [[pirate]]s. With the coastal mountains as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks. However, [[Preston Somers Expedition|in 1595]], around 200 English privateers including George Sommers and Amyas Preston crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town's defenders were guarding the more often-used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation.<ref>John Lombardi, ''Venezuela,'' Oxford, England, 1982, p 72.</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas\n |title        = George Somers, Amyas Preston and the Burning of Caracas\n |work         = The Bermudian\n |access-date  = 17 May 2016\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513110245/http://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/1055-the-burning-of-caracas\n |archive-date = 13 May 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the cocoa cultivation and exports under the [[Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guipuzcoana de Caracas]] grew in importance, the city expanded. In 1777, Caracas became the capital of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\n[[File:Joseph Thomas 1839 000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Caracas, as painted by Joseph Thomas in 1839]]\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Manuel Gual]] led an attempted revolution aimed at independence, but the rebellion was put down on 13 July 1797. Caracas was ultimately the site of the signing of a [[Declaration of independence]] on 17 August 1811. In 1812, an [[1812 Caracas earthquake|earthquake destroyed Caracas]]. The war for independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Bol\u00edvar defeated [[royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist]]s in the [[Battle of Carabobo]].<ref name=\"HT\">Maurice Wiesenthal, ''The History and Geography of a Valley'', 1981.</ref>\n\nCaracas grew in economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In 1941, Caracas was the site at which ratifications for the [[Venezuela\u2013Colombia Boundary Treaty of 1941|L\u00f3pez de Mesa-Gil Borges Treaty]] were exchanged. Later, during the 1950s, Caracas began an intensive modernization program which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Universidad Central de Venezuela]], designed by modernist architect [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] and declared [[World Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], was built. New working- and middle-class residential districts sprouted in the valley, extending the urban area toward the east and southeast. Joining [[El Silencio (Caracas)|El Silencio]], also designed by Villanueva, were several workers' housing districts, 23 de Enero and Simon Rodriguez. Middle-class developments include Bello Monte, Los Palos Grandes, Chuao, and El Cafetal. The dramatic change in the economic structure of the country, which went from being primarily agricultural to dependent on oil production, stimulated the fast development of Caracas, and made it a magnet for people in rural communities who migrated to the capital city in an unplanned fashion searching for greater economic opportunity. This migration created the ''rancho'' (slum) belt of the valley of Caracas.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Plan of the City of Caracas with its Division in Neighborhoods. 1775.jpg|thumb|250px|Above center you can see the [colonial] Coat of arms of Caracas, on its left a shield representing 'Justice' and on the right 'Vigilance', then a list of important colonial buildings and below a plan of the City of Caracas with its division in neighborhoods, ca. 1775, by Joseph Carlos de Aguero.

The red field symbolises the blood spilt by Caraquenian people in favour of independence and the highest ideals of the Venezuelan Nation. Later, in the year 1994, presumably as a result of the change of municipal authorities, it was decided to increase the size of the Caracas coat of arms and move it to the centre of the field. This version of the flag is still in use today.\n\nThe coat of arms of the City of Caracas was adopted by the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador Municipality]] to identify itself. Later, the [[Metropolitan Mayor Office]] assumed the lion, the scallop and [[Cross of Saint James|Saint James' Cross]] for the same purpose.\n\nThe anthem of the city is the ''[[Marcha a Caracas]]'', written by the composer [[Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis]] with the lyrics by [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia]]. The lyrics are said to be inspired by the heroism of the Caraquenian people, and the memory of the ''City of Red Roofs''. Incidentally, the [[National Anthem]] of Venezuela, ''[[Gloria al Bravo Pueblo]]'', includes the lines \"...y si el despotismo levanta la voz, seguid el ejemplo que Caracas dio\" (\"...and if despotism raises its voice, follow the example that Caracas gave\"), reflecting the fact that, in addition to generously providing many heroic fighters to the War of Independence, the junta established in Caracas (19 April 1810) served as inspiration for other regions to do the same\u2014as did its [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] a year later.\n\n==Local government==\nUnder the [[constitution of Venezuela]], municipal governments have two branches: the executive (governed by a mayor) and the legislative (managed by a [[municipal council]]).\n\n=== Metropolitan District of Caracas ===\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was [[decree]]d in ''Gaceta Official'' N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador]], [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]], [[Baruta Municipality|Baruta]], [[Sucre Municipality, Miranda|Sucre]], and [[El Hatillo Municipality, Miranda|El Hatillo]] municipalities would be delegated to the ''Alcald\u00eda Mayor'', physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldfrank|first1=Benjamin|title=Deepening Local Democracy in Latin America: Participation, Decentralization, and the Left|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-07451-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AqJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|language=en|page=190}}</ref> The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ANC aprob\u00f3 supresi\u00f3n y liquidaci\u00f3n del \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Caracas|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/gobierno/anc-aprobo-supresion-liquidacion-del-area-metropolitana-caracas_216247|accessdate=21 April 2018|publisher=El Nacional|date=20 December 2017|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Vista PlazaVenezuela2.jpg|thumb|250px|Skyscrapers in [[Plaza Venezuela]]]]\nBusinesses that are located here include service companies, banks, and malls, among others.

Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Myriad factors contribute to the lack of tourism in Caracas. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.\n\nIn an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5&nbsp;million Venezuelan bolivars.\n\nAlthough the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8&nbsp;million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6&nbsp;million bolivars.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. Venezuela's current goal is to reach a GDP of 7.6 percent. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.<ref>MART\u00cdNEZ RODR\u00cdGUEZ, M. (2013).

The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, the altitude with respect to sea level varies from between {{convert|870|and|1,043|m|ft|sp=us}}, with {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the historic zone. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the ''Pico El \u00c1vila'', which rises to {{convert|2159|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe main body of water in Caracas is the [[Guaire River]], which flows across the city and empties into the ''[[Tuy River]]'', which is also fed by the ''El Valle'' and ''San Pedro'' rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The ''La Mariposa'' and ''Camatagua'' reservoirs provide water to the city.\nThe city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190\" heights=\"190\">\nFile:Avila desde el Parque del Este 2.JPG|Day view of [[El Avila National Park]] from [[Parque del Este]]\nFile:Pueblo de Galip\u00e1n.jpg|[[:es:Galip\u00e1n|Galip\u00e1n]], town atop [[Parque Nacional El \u00c1vila|El \u00c1vila]]\nFile:Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del r\u00edo Guaire 2013 000.jpg|View of the ''Rio Guaire'' canyon, main body of water that passes through Caracas\nFile:TelefericodeCaracas.jpg|View of the [[Teleferico de Caracas|Avila gondola lift]] starting from Caracas to Hotel Humboldt station\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Este de Caracas.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|View of the east side of Caracas]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Caracas has a mix of [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') with [[subtropical highland]] (''Cwb'') influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between {{convert|900|and|1,300|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} (annual), in the city proper, and up to {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are generally not nearly as high as other tropical locations at sea level. The annual average temperature is approximately {{convert|23.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, with the average of the coldest month (January) {{convert|22.8|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the average of the warmest month (July) {{convert|25.0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of {{convert|2.2|C-change|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching {{convert|8|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}</span>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=61408&cityname=Caracas%2C+Venezuela&set=metric|title=Weather Base \u2013 World Weather \u2013 Average Conditions \u2013 Caracas |publisher=BBC |access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref> This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the ''Pacheco''.

Hail storms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. [[Electrical storm]]s are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of [[Cerro El \u00c1vila]].

[[Francisco Fajardo]], the son of a Spanish [[captain (land)|captain]] and a [[Guaiqueri]] ''[[cacique|cacica]]'', attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after founding a series of coastal towns. Fajardo's settlement did not last long. It was destroyed by natives of the region led by [[Terepaima]] and [[Guaicaipuro]]. This was the last rebellion on the part of the natives. On [[25 July]] 1567, Captain [[Diego de Losada]] laid the foundations of the city of ''Santiago de Le\u00f3n de Caracas''. The foundation \u2212 1567 \u2013 \"I take possession of this land in the name of God and the King\" These were the words of Don Diego de Losada in founding the city of Caracas on 25 July 1567. In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Venezuela Province]] under Governor [[Juan de Pimentel]] (1576\u20131583).\n\nDuring the 17th century, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by [[pirate]]s. With the coastal mountains as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks.

In 1777, Caracas became the capital of the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]].\n\n[[File:Joseph Thomas 1839 000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Caracas, as painted by Joseph Thomas in 1839]]\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Espa\u00f1a]] and [[Manuel Gual]] led an attempted revolution aimed at independence, but the rebellion was put down on 13 July 1797. Caracas was ultimately the site of the signing of a [[Declaration of independence]] on 17 August 1811. In 1812, an [[1812 Caracas earthquake|earthquake destroyed Caracas]]. The war for independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Bol\u00edvar defeated [[royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist]]s in the [[Battle of Carabobo]].<ref name=\"HT\">Maurice Wiesenthal, ''The History and Geography of a Valley'', 1981.</ref>\n\nCaracas grew in economic importance during Venezuela's oil boom in the early 20th century. In 1941, Caracas was the site at which ratifications for the [[Venezuela\u2013Colombia Boundary Treaty of 1941|L\u00f3pez de Mesa-Gil Borges Treaty]] were exchanged. Later, during the 1950s, Caracas began an intensive modernization program which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Universidad Central de Venezuela]], designed by modernist architect [[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] and declared [[World Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]], was built. New working- and middle-class residential districts sprouted in the valley, extending the urban area toward the east and southeast. Joining [[El Silencio (Caracas)|El Silencio]], also designed by Villanueva, were several workers' housing districts, 23 de Enero and Simon Rodriguez. Middle-class developments include Bello Monte, Los Palos Grandes, Chuao, and El Cafetal. The dramatic change in the economic structure of the country, which went from being primarily agricultural to dependent on oil production, stimulated the fast development of Caracas, and made it a magnet for people in rural communities who migrated to the capital city in an unplanned fashion searching for greater economic opportunity. This migration created the ''rancho'' (slum) belt of the valley of Caracas.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Plan of the City of Caracas with its Division in Neighborhoods. 1775.jpg|thumb|250px|Above center you can see the [colonial] Coat of arms of Caracas, on its left a shield representing 'Justice' and on the right 'Vigilance', then a list of important colonial buildings and below a plan of the City of Caracas with its division in neighborhoods, ca. 1775, by Joseph Carlos de Aguero.

The red field symbolises the blood spilt by Caraquenian people in favour of independence and the highest ideals of the Venezuelan Nation. Later, in the year 1994, presumably as a result of the change of municipal authorities, it was decided to increase the size of the Caracas coat of arms and move it to the centre of the field. This version of the flag is still in use today.\n\nThe coat of arms of the City of Caracas was adopted by the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador Municipality]] to identify itself. Later, the [[Metropolitan Mayor Office]] assumed the lion, the scallop and [[Cross of Saint James|Saint James' Cross]] for the same purpose.\n\nThe anthem of the city is the ''[[Marcha a Caracas]]'', written by the composer [[Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis]] with the lyrics by [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Sarabia]]. The lyrics are said to be inspired by the heroism of the Caraquenian people, and the memory of the ''City of Red Roofs''. Incidentally, the [[National Anthem]] of Venezuela, ''[[Gloria al Bravo Pueblo]]'', includes the lines \"...y si el despotismo levanta la voz, seguid el ejemplo que Caracas dio\" (\"...and if despotism raises its voice, follow the example that Caracas gave\"), reflecting the fact that, in addition to generously providing many heroic fighters to the War of Independence, the junta established in Caracas (19 April 1810) served as inspiration for other regions to do the same\u2014as did its [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] a year later.\n\n==Local government==\nUnder the [[constitution of Venezuela]], municipal governments have two branches: the executive (governed by a mayor) and the legislative (managed by a [[municipal council]]).\n\n=== Metropolitan District of Caracas ===\nOn 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was [[decree]]d in ''Gaceta Official'' N\u00b0 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the [[Libertador Bolivarian Municipality|Libertador]], [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]], [[Baruta Municipality|Baruta]], [[Sucre Municipality, Miranda|Sucre]], and [[El Hatillo Municipality, Miranda|El Hatillo]] municipalities would be delegated to the ''Alcald\u00eda Mayor'', physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldfrank|first1=Benjamin|title=Deepening Local Democracy in Latin America: Participation, Decentralization, and the Left|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-07451-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AqJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|language=en|page=190}}</ref> The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ANC aprob\u00f3 supresi\u00f3n y liquidaci\u00f3n del \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Caracas|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/gobierno/anc-aprobo-supresion-liquidacion-del-area-metropolitana-caracas_216247|accessdate=21 April 2018|publisher=El Nacional|date=20 December 2017|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Vista PlazaVenezuela2.jpg|thumb|250px|Skyscrapers in [[Plaza Venezuela]]]]\nBusinesses that are located here include service companies, banks, and malls, among others.

Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Myriad factors contribute to the lack of tourism in Caracas. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.\n\nIn an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5&nbsp;million Venezuelan bolivars.\n\nAlthough the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8&nbsp;million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6&nbsp;million bolivars.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. Venezuela's current goal is to reach a GDP of 7.6 percent. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela's GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.<ref>MART\u00cdNEZ RODR\u00cdGUEZ, M. (2013).

This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the ''Pico El \u00c1vila'', which rises to {{convert|2159|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe main body of water in Caracas is the [[Guaire River]], which flows across the city and empties into the ''[[Tuy River]]'', which is also fed by the ''El Valle'' and ''San Pedro'' rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El \u00c1vila. The ''La Mariposa'' and ''Camatagua'' reservoirs provide water to the city.\nThe city is occasionally subject to earthquakes \u2013 notably in 1641 and 1967.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190\" heights=\"190\">\nFile:Avila desde el Parque del Este 2.JPG|Day view of [[El Avila National Park]] from [[Parque del Este]]\nFile:Pueblo de Galip\u00e1n.jpg|[[:es:Galip\u00e1n|Galip\u00e1n]], town atop [[Parque Nacional El \u00c1vila|El \u00c1vila]]\nFile:Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del r\u00edo Guaire 2013 000.jpg|View of the ''Rio Guaire'' canyon, main body of water that passes through Caracas\nFile:TelefericodeCaracas.jpg|View of the [[Teleferico de Caracas|Avila gondola lift]] starting from Caracas to Hotel Humboldt station\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Este de Caracas.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|View of the east side of Caracas]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Caracas has a mix of [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') with [[subtropical highland]] (''Cwb'') influences due to its altitude. Caracas is also intertropical, with precipitation that varies between {{convert|900|and|1,300|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} (annual), in the city proper, and up to {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in some parts of the Mountain range.

[[Yankee]] captains valued Cape Verdeans as crews, because they \u201cworked hard to save what they could while on board vessel they could be hired for much less money than American seamen.  Furthermore, they made a disciplined crew.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Haywood |first=Carl Norman |title=American Whalers in Africa |publisher=Boston University}}.

Eventually, they came to own almost all that remained of the New Bedford fleet, either by purchase or by default. In some cases, they received the ships as outright gifts and \"sailed them all over the earth with their own crews and made a modest profit by whaling in the old and tried manner.\"\n\nThis Cape Verdean immigration \"trickle\" grew to a \"flood\" in the 20th century as Cape Verde suffered drought, starvation, and economic decline.<ref name=Spiamedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiamedia.com/cape_verde.html|title=Cape Verde History and Culture|accessdate=2005-05-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050407130453/http://www.spiamedia.com/cape_verde.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2005-04-07}}</ref>  Once on whaling ships and in America, Cape Verdean men were able to send home money and news of other family and friends already in \u201cthe land of opportunity.\u201d  They also sent bidons (gasoline barrels) full of food, clothes, and other items from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]; and [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  The latter are the oldest and largest Cape Verdean communities in the United States.  These communities and new Cape Verdean communities are marked by close kinship ties and interdependence among families, a traditional Cape Verdean practice that has been passed down through the generations.\n\nOne of the major forces that brought Cape Verdeans to the Americas was the whaling industry. American whalers from New Bedford first began travelling to the islands in the 1790s, and further developed their trade as time progressed into the 19th century. During this time, many Cape Verdeans joined American whaling crews in order to escape Cape Verde, a land plagued with poor natural resources and an often abusive Portuguese colonial government. By the mid-1800s New Bedford had transformed into an economic maritime center, where Cape Verdeans were not only about to excel in the whaling industry but in other maritime industries (such as fishing) as well.<ref name=\"whalingmuseum.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/current/cape-verdean-maritime|title=Cape Verdean Maritime Exhibit - New Bedford Whaling Museum New Bedford Whaling Museum|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> New Bedford Whaling Museum explains, \u201cAs the 20th century went on and the ties between the islands and the port strengthened, entrepreneurs like Roy Teixeira, Henrique Mendes, Louis Lopes, Frank Lopes and Antonio Cardoza purchased, managed and owned packet ships like the Coriolanus, the Savoia, and the Arcturus... Importantly, not only did Cape Verdeans settle in New Bedford, but between 1860 and 1965 41% of the packets trading between New England and the Islands were owned by Cape Verdeans.\u201d<ref name=\"whalingmuseum.org\"/>\n\nMany Cape Verdeans worked in the [[cranberry]] [[bog]]s for the cranberry industry in Southeastern Massachusetts.<ref>Semedo, Querino Kenneth J., [http://www1.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/caboverde/cranberry/semedo3.html \"The Story Must Be Told : A Story of Cape Verdeans : A story about the forgotten cranberry bog workers, the Cape Verdean men and women who helped to build the cranberry industry\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120165948/http://www1.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/caboverde/cranberry/semedo3.html |date=2011-11-20 }}, ''[[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]]'', November 25, 1999.</ref><ref>[http://www.cranberries.org/cranberries/bog_tours.html \"Cranberry Harvest Trail Guide Information - Southeastern Massachusetts\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828064100/http://www.cranberries.org/cranberries/bog_tours.html |date=August 28, 2011 }}, ''Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association''</ref>\n\nCape Verdean migration to the United States in the 19th century and early 20th century was composed of the islands' poorer classes. In 1922, the U.S. government restricted the immigration of peoples of color, greatly reducing Cape Verdean immigration. The new regulations also prevented Cape Verdean Americans from visiting the islands for fear of being denied reentry to the United States. The two communities thus were relatively isolated from each other for approximately 40 years. With doors to America closed, Cape Verdeans began to immigrate in larger numbers to Europe, South America, and West Africa along routes charted by commercial shipping and the Portuguese colonial empire. During the same period some Cape Verdean Americans migrated from the long-established East Coast communities to the steel towns of [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]; and to [[California]].\n\nIn 1966, due to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the U.S. government relaxed its regulations, and a new wave of Cape Verdean immigration began. The new arrivals in Boston, Brockton, Taunton and Onset, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; Waterbury, Connecticut; Brooklyn, and Yonkers, New York; and other communities on the East Coast met a Cape Verdean-American ethnic group whose members looked like them, but differed culturally. Separated for so long, the groups knew little of each other's recent history or treasured memories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Halter, Marilyn. \u201cCape Verdeans in the U.S.\u201d</ref>\n\nFull independence was achieved by Cape Verde on July 5, 1975 after a long struggle for complete rights and unrestricted control from the struggle of the country's colonial past. Though growing nationalism, prior efforts for independence slowly gained momentum and territory led by the efforts of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). This newfound independence allowed a new path that would be essential to the migration of Cape Verdean American as Cape Verde was one of few African countries allowing overflight of European and U.S. air travel. This was accompanied by two further actions of independence that aided Cape Verdean migration: broken political unity between Guinea in 1980, and the election of Antonio Monteiro which brought economic struggles that incited emigration.<ref>Cape Verde.

Cape Verdeans retained a unique culture apart from the groups of Afro Americans who were the descendants of slaves in the United States. This was especially true for those who settled outside the Cape Verde environments concentrated in New England, and settled in the Midwest. Due to their Catholic religion, most Cape Verdeans were related to other Catholics, who were mostly white. The Cape Verdeans maintained their own ethnic identity and lived in separate communities from other Afro American groups. However, during the civil rights struggles of the 60s, the Cape Verdeans saw similarities between their own struggle and that of African Americans and emerged a sense of solidarity with them. While some islands have a heavy European-descended population, most Cape Verdeans have African ancestry mixed with European and Moorish Jews. Because later people from all over the world settled in Cape Verde, not only Europeans, the population is one of the most unusual ethnic melting pots in the world. Due to this uniqueness, most Cape Verdeans choose to cite \"Cape Verdean\" as their race, which not only reflects a strong sense of Patriotism, but a sense of community that is only found among Cape Verdeans regardless of skin-tone.<ref name=\"everyculturecapve\">[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Cape-Verdean-Americans.html Everyculture: Cape Verdean  American].

S\u00f3nia Melo discusses how Cape Verdean websites have become important for linking diaspora communities with each other, for maintaining ties with Cape Verde, and for the local politics of emigrant communities in their countries of residence.<ref>Batalha, Lu\u00eds and J\u00f8rgen Carling ed. 2008. Transnational Archipelago</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most Cape Verdeans have a lighter skin color than Africans from the continent. This partially comes from the fact that in the beginning, Portuguese encouraged [[miscegenation]] between Portuguese colonizers and the members of African colonies throughout their empire (with the government often rewarding soldiers and officials with monetary or land benefits if they married indigenous people). Also, the prime location and solidarity found in the island allowed for interracial relationships to develop without traditional suppression. As a result, when it comes to hair textures, skin and eye colores there are a wide variety ranging from blue and blond eyes on the islands of Fogo and Brava, to crisp and darker shades on the island of Santiago. Yet it is not uncommon for nuclear families to have a variety of tones and textures for members. The uniqueness of Cape Verdeans is reflected in the Massachusetts census permitting a \"Cape-Verdean\" check-box for ethnic identification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article53126&ak=1|title=Popula\u00e7\u00e3o cabo-verdiana: \"57% dos genes s\u00e3o de origem africana e 43 %, de origem europeia\" - Primeiro di\u00e1rio caboverdiano em linha - A SEMANA|accessdate=13 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501115847/http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article53126&ak=1|archivedate=1 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Languages==\n{{see also|Cape Verdean Creole}}\n\nGenerally, Cape Verdean Americans speak English, Portuguese, and Kriolu (or Crioulo).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Creole language]] is a mixture of Portuguese and the native African tongues spoken by slaves. Although much of the vocabulary stems from Portuguese, many of these words were no longer used in twentieth-century Portugal. The African tongues, mostly [[Mande languages|Mande]], influenced Kriolu chiefly. Since the Republic of Cape Verde became independent of Portugal in 1975, Kriolu has become the dominant language among the islanders.\n\nCreole has not received official status nor has it been standardized across the country. Several scholars note that this is difficult to do given that there is substantial dialectical variation between the islands. This can be seen from migrants who left Cape Verde often identifying more with their island of origin than the archipelago as a whole. Language, food and music are the most important cultural markers of CV identity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Cape Verdean Creole Institute was founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1996, to teach the Cape Verdean language. In addition, many schools in the [[Boston Public School]] district offer Cape Verdean Creole (CVC) as a language class. Currently 2.3% of the population of Boston speaks CVC.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rixely Jimenez|first=Carmen|title=New Bostonians Demographic Report|url=https://www.cityofboston.gov/newbostonians/pdfs/dem_report.pdf|publisher=The Mayor\u2019s Office of New Bostonians}}</ref>\n\nFormal CVC language research in both Cape Verde and America has been ongoing since the late 1800s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=56|chapter=2}}</ref> The elite class of the island was mostly responsible for recording the earlier studies of the language in an attempt to make CVC more acceptable as an artistic language. When the first printing press came to Cape Verde in 1842, the elites began publishing written work in CVC for the first time. Additionally, the  Seminary of S\u00e3o Nicolau was created in 1866, which allowed for the elite mixed race and the black elite to have access to education and begin a scholarly debate about CVC.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=57|chapter=2}}</ref> These developments, along with other improvements in technology, allowed the study of CVC to flourish in Cape Verde.\n\nIn general, there are two different schools of thought on CVC research. One school of thought is ''Creole [[Exceptionalism]]'', which regards creole languages as a socially inferior dialect or degenerate language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=60|chapter=2}}</ref> Another school of thought however is referred to as ''Crioulidade'', which celebrates Cape Verde's unique heritage, consequently referring to the language not in terms of its African or Portuguese heritage, but rather as its own unique hybrid of the two that has its own history and cultural significance. Proponents of this school of thought argue that the processes of miscegenation and creolization were positive, rather than negative as the ''Exceptionalism'' school of thought suggests.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=75|chapter=2}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\nDue to a history of Portuguese colonization, the vast majority of Cape Verdeans and Cape Verdean Americans are Roman Catholic. Early Cape Verdean migrants to the United States originally joined Portuguese parishes that had sprung up throughout Southeastern Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.umassd.edu/specialPrograms/caboverde/cvchurch.html|title=The Church and the People of Cape Verde*|accessdate=13 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508062957/http://www1.umassd.edu/specialprograms/caboverde/cvchurch.html|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Cape Verdeans also began to establish their own masses in Criolu at many Massachusetts Catholic Churches. One such church is the St. Patrick's Church of Roxbury which has held a mass in Criolu for years. However, many Cape Verdean Catholics encountered racial prejudice amongst Portuguese parishioners and looked for religious alternatives. In New Bedford, the Cape Verdean community established the Our Lady of Assumption, the first Cape Verdean American church, in 1905 in response to such prejudice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Halter|first=Marilyn|title=Between Race and Ethnicity: Cape Verdean American Immigrants Between 1860 - 1965|date=1993|page=148}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in spite of colonial ties to Catholicism and the Portuguese, many Cape Verdeansin turned towards Protestantism in response to discrimination and a lack of support from the Archdiocese. In response to racism from the Portuguese community in Providence, the Cape Verdean community founded the Shelmer Street Church in 1905.<ref>Some Kind of Funny Porto Rican. Dir.

The Cape Verdean Jewish Heritage movement is mainly led by the diaspora and its interest is predominantly in preserving history, not practicing doctrine. Accordingly, one of the major goals of the movement is preservation of Jewish cemeteries in Cape Verde.<ref>Werlin, Louise. \"Jews in Cape Verde.\" UMASS Dartmouth, n.d.

The traditional Seder is adapted with a bilingual Haggadah that includes Criolu prayers and elements of Cape Verdean history, such as the addition of Amilcar's Cup.\n\n==Music==\nCape Verdean music has evolved to be composed of diverse styles and genres that reflect its mixture of racial identities, such as: African, Portuguese, Caribbean and Brazilian influences. Older styles include ''[[morna (music)|morna]]'' and ''[[coladeira]]''. These styles, though distinct, carry a commonality of somber, slow, and soulful tone that often reflects themes of love, longing, and nostalgia. Re-emerging forms of Caper Verdean Music are ''[[funan\u00e1]]'' and ''[[batuque (music)|batuque]]''. These quick tempo, percussion filled styles are high energy songs that are typically accompanied by hip-moving dance. These styles were banned previously due to overly sexual allegations but are now re-emerging in the past decade. ''[[Hip hop]]'', ''[[Reggae]]'' and ''[[Zouk]]'' are styles of Cape Verdean music that are now being explored. These fusions with contemporary styles of music are often reflective in lyrics with ongoing themes of Cape Verdean life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capeverde.co.uk/Docs/Cape-Verde-Guide/General-Information/Music.aspx?ContentTabs=Info|title=Music and Festivals|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*[[Demetrius Andrade]]\n*[[George Araujo]]\n*[[Almir Barbosa]]\n*[[Anthony Barboza]]\n*[[Cynthia Barboza]]\n*[[Dana Barros]]\n*[[Michael Beach]]\n*[[Benzino]]\n*[[Blu Cantrell]] \n*[[Peter Cipriano]]\n*[[Stephen Cooper (American football)|Stephen Cooper]]\n*[[Jasiel Correia]]\n*[[Mike Costa]]\n*[[John DeBrito]]\n*[[Pedro DeBrito]]\n*[[Vinny deMacedo]]\n*[[Paulo Dos Santos (soccer)|Paulo Dos Santos]]\n*[[Wuilito Fernandes]]\n*[[Wayne Fontes]]\n*[[Gordon D.

The first [[Luso-American|Cape Verdean]] immigrants aboard New England [[whaling ships]], which would often pick up crewmen off the coast of [[Brava, Cape Verde|Cape Verde]]. [[Yankee]] captains valued Cape Verdeans as crews, because they \u201cworked hard to save what they could while on board vessel they could be hired for much less money than American seamen.  Furthermore, they made a disciplined crew.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Haywood |first=Carl Norman |title=American Whalers in Africa |publisher=Boston University}}.

Eventually, they came to own almost all that remained of the New Bedford fleet, either by purchase or by default. In some cases, they received the ships as outright gifts and \"sailed them all over the earth with their own crews and made a modest profit by whaling in the old and tried manner.\"\n\nThis Cape Verdean immigration \"trickle\" grew to a \"flood\" in the 20th century as Cape Verde suffered drought, starvation, and economic decline.<ref name=Spiamedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiamedia.com/cape_verde.html|title=Cape Verde History and Culture|accessdate=2005-05-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050407130453/http://www.spiamedia.com/cape_verde.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2005-04-07}}</ref>  Once on whaling ships and in America, Cape Verdean men were able to send home money and news of other family and friends already in \u201cthe land of opportunity.\u201d  They also sent bidons (gasoline barrels) full of food, clothes, and other items from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]; and [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  The latter are the oldest and largest Cape Verdean communities in the United States.  These communities and new Cape Verdean communities are marked by close kinship ties and interdependence among families, a traditional Cape Verdean practice that has been passed down through the generations.\n\nOne of the major forces that brought Cape Verdeans to the Americas was the whaling industry. American whalers from New Bedford first began travelling to the islands in the 1790s, and further developed their trade as time progressed into the 19th century. During this time, many Cape Verdeans joined American whaling crews in order to escape Cape Verde, a land plagued with poor natural resources and an often abusive Portuguese colonial government. By the mid-1800s New Bedford had transformed into an economic maritime center, where Cape Verdeans were not only about to excel in the whaling industry but in other maritime industries (such as fishing) as well.<ref name=\"whalingmuseum.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/current/cape-verdean-maritime|title=Cape Verdean Maritime Exhibit - New Bedford Whaling Museum New Bedford Whaling Museum|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> New Bedford Whaling Museum explains, \u201cAs the 20th century went on and the ties between the islands and the port strengthened, entrepreneurs like Roy Teixeira, Henrique Mendes, Louis Lopes, Frank Lopes and Antonio Cardoza purchased, managed and owned packet ships like the Coriolanus, the Savoia, and the Arcturus... Importantly, not only did Cape Verdeans settle in New Bedford, but between 1860 and 1965 41% of the packets trading between New England and the Islands were owned by Cape Verdeans.\u201d<ref name=\"whalingmuseum.org\"/>\n\nMany Cape Verdeans worked in the [[cranberry]] [[bog]]s for the cranberry industry in Southeastern Massachusetts.<ref>Semedo, Querino Kenneth J., [http://www1.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/caboverde/cranberry/semedo3.html \"The Story Must Be Told : A Story of Cape Verdeans : A story about the forgotten cranberry bog workers, the Cape Verdean men and women who helped to build the cranberry industry\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120165948/http://www1.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/caboverde/cranberry/semedo3.html |date=2011-11-20 }}, ''[[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]]'', November 25, 1999.</ref><ref>[http://www.cranberries.org/cranberries/bog_tours.html \"Cranberry Harvest Trail Guide Information - Southeastern Massachusetts\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828064100/http://www.cranberries.org/cranberries/bog_tours.html |date=August 28, 2011 }}, ''Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association''</ref>\n\nCape Verdean migration to the United States in the 19th century and early 20th century was composed of the islands' poorer classes. In 1922, the U.S. government restricted the immigration of peoples of color, greatly reducing Cape Verdean immigration. The new regulations also prevented Cape Verdean Americans from visiting the islands for fear of being denied reentry to the United States. The two communities thus were relatively isolated from each other for approximately 40 years. With doors to America closed, Cape Verdeans began to immigrate in larger numbers to Europe, South America, and West Africa along routes charted by commercial shipping and the Portuguese colonial empire. During the same period some Cape Verdean Americans migrated from the long-established East Coast communities to the steel towns of [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]; and to [[California]].\n\nIn 1966, due to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the U.S. government relaxed its regulations, and a new wave of Cape Verdean immigration began. The new arrivals in Boston, Brockton, Taunton and Onset, Massachusetts; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; Waterbury, Connecticut; Brooklyn, and Yonkers, New York; and other communities on the East Coast met a Cape Verdean-American ethnic group whose members looked like them, but differed culturally. Separated for so long, the groups knew little of each other's recent history or treasured memories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Halter, Marilyn. \u201cCape Verdeans in the U.S.\u201d</ref>\n\nFull independence was achieved by Cape Verde on July 5, 1975 after a long struggle for complete rights and unrestricted control from the struggle of the country\u2019s colonial past. Though growing nationalism, prior efforts for independence slowly gained momentum and territory led by the efforts of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). This newfound independence allowed a new path that would be essential to the migration of Cape Verdean American as Cape Verde was one of few African countries allowing overflight of European and U.S. air travel. This was accompanied by two further actions of independence that aided Cape Verdean migration: broken political unity between Guinea in 1980, and the election of Antonio Monteiro which brought economic struggles that incited emigration.<ref>Cape Verde.

Cape Verdeans retained a unique culture apart from the groups of Afro Americans who were the descendants of slaves in the United States. This was especially true for those who settled outside the Cape Verde environments concentrated in New England, and settled in the Midwest. Due to their Catholic religion, most Cape Verdeans were related to other Catholics, who were mostly white. The Cape Verdeans maintained their own ethnic identity and lived in separate communities from other Afro American groups. However, during the civil rights struggles of the 60s, the Cape Verdeans saw similarities between their own struggle and that of African Americans and emerged a sense of solidarity with them. While some islands have a heavy European-descended population, most Cape Verdeans have African ancestry mixed with European and Moorish Jews. Because later people from all over the world settled in Cape Verde, not only Europeans, the population is one of the most unusual ethnic melting pots in the world. Due to this uniqueness, most Cape Verdeans choose to cite \"Cape Verdean\" as their race, which not only reflects a strong sense of Patriotism, but a sense of community that is only found among Cape Verdeans regardless of skin-tone.<ref name=\"everyculturecapve\">[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Cape-Verdean-Americans.html Everyculture: Cape Verdean  American].

Retrieved September 5, 2012, to 2:08pm.</ref>\n\nFor well over a century, the U.S. has hosted the largest proportion of the worldwide Cape Verdean diaspora residing in any one nation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOne important consequence of the technological development in recent decades has been the emergence of Cape Verdean [[transnationalism]] on the Internet. S\u00f3nia Melo discusses how Cape Verdean websites have become important for linking diaspora communities with each other, for maintaining ties with Cape Verde, and for the local politics of emigrant communities in their countries of residence.<ref>Batalha, Lu\u00eds and J\u00f8rgen Carling ed. 2008. Transnational Archipelago</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most Cape Verdeans have a lighter skin color than Africans from the continent. This partially comes from the fact that in the beginning, Portuguese encouraged [[miscegenation]] between Portuguese colonizers and the members of African colonies throughout their empire (with the government often rewarding soldiers and officials with monetary or land benefits if they married indigenous people). Also, the prime location and solidarity found in the island allowed for interracial relationships to develop without traditional suppression. As a result, when it comes to hair textures, skin and eye colores there are a wide variety ranging from blue and blond eyes on the islands of Fogo and Brava, to crisp and darker shades on the island of Santiago. Yet it is not uncommon for nuclear families to have a variety of tones and textures for members. The uniqueness of Cape Verdeans is reflected in the Massachusetts census permitting a \"Cape-Verdean\" check-box for ethnic identification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article53126&ak=1|title=Popula\u00e7\u00e3o cabo-verdiana: \"57% dos genes s\u00e3o de origem africana e 43 %, de origem europeia\" - Primeiro di\u00e1rio caboverdiano em linha - A SEMANA|accessdate=13 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501115847/http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article53126&ak=1|archivedate=1 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Languages==\n{{see also|Cape Verdean Creole}}\n\nGenerally, Cape Verdean Americans speak English, Portuguese, and Kriolu (or Crioulo).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Creole language]] is a mixture of Portuguese and the native African tongues spoken by slaves. Although much of the vocabulary stems from Portuguese, many of these words were no longer used in twentieth-century Portugal. The African tongues, mostly [[Mande languages|Mande]], influenced Kriolu chiefly. Since the Republic of Cape Verde became independent of Portugal in 1975, Kriolu has become the dominant language among the islanders.\n\nCreole has not received official status nor has it been standardized across the country. Several scholars note that this is difficult to do given that there is substantial dialectical variation between the islands. This can be seen from migrants who left Cape Verde often identifying more with their island of origin than the archipelago as a whole. Language, food and music are the most important cultural markers of CV identity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Cape Verdean Creole Institute was founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1996, to teach the Cape Verdean language. In addition, many schools in the [[Boston Public School]] district offer Cape Verdean Creole (CVC) as a language class. Currently 2.3% of the population of Boston speaks CVC.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rixely Jimenez|first=Carmen|title=New Bostonians Demographic Report|url=https://www.cityofboston.gov/newbostonians/pdfs/dem_report.pdf|publisher=The Mayor\u2019s Office of New Bostonians}}</ref>\n\nFormal CVC language research in both Cape Verde and America has been ongoing since the late 1800s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=56|chapter=2}}</ref> The elite class of the island was mostly responsible for recording the earlier studies of the language in an attempt to make CVC more acceptable as an artistic language. When the first printing press came to Cape Verde in 1842, the elites began publishing written work in CVC for the first time. Additionally, the  Seminary of S\u00e3o Nicolau was created in 1866, which allowed for the elite mixed race and the black elite to have access to education and begin a scholarly debate about CVC.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=57|chapter=2}}</ref> These developments, along with other improvements in technology, allowed the study of CVC to flourish in Cape Verde.\n\nIn general, there are two different schools of thought on CVC research. One school of thought is ''Creole [[Exceptionalism]]'', which regards creole languages as a socially inferior dialect or degenerate language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=60|chapter=2}}</ref> Another school of thought however is referred to as ''Crioulidade'', which celebrates Cape Verde's unique heritage, consequently referring to the language not in terms of its African or Portuguese heritage, but rather as its own unique hybrid of the two that has its own history and cultural significance. Proponents of this school of thought argue that the processes of miscegenation and creolization were positive, rather than negative as the ''Exceptionalism'' school of thought suggests.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Carla|title=Sounding Creole: The Politics of Cape Verdean Language, Music, and Diaspora|date=2012|page=75|chapter=2}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\nDue to a history of Portuguese colonization, the vast majority of Cape Verdeans and Cape Verdean Americans are Roman Catholic. Early Cape Verdean migrants to the United States originally joined Portuguese parishes that had sprung up throughout Southeastern Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.umassd.edu/specialPrograms/caboverde/cvchurch.html|title=The Church and the People of Cape Verde*|accessdate=13 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508062957/http://www1.umassd.edu/specialprograms/caboverde/cvchurch.html|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Cape Verdeans also began to establish their own masses in Criolu at many Massachusetts Catholic Churches. One such church is the St. Patrick\u2019s Church of Roxbury which has held a mass in Criolu for years. However, many Cape Verdean Catholics encountered racial prejudice amongst Portuguese parishioners and looked for religious alternatives. In New Bedford, the Cape Verdean community established the Our Lady of Assumption, the first Cape Verdean American church, in 1905 in response to such prejudice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Halter|first=Marilyn|title=Between Race and Ethnicity: Cape Verdean American Immigrants Between 1860 - 1965|date=1993|page=148}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in spite of colonial ties to Catholicism and the Portuguese, many Cape Verdeansin turned towards Protestantism in response to discrimination and a lack of support from the Archdiocese. In response to racism from the Portuguese community in Providence, the Cape Verdean community founded the Shelmer Street Church in 1905.<ref>Some Kind of Funny Porto Rican. Dir.

Today, a greater proportion of newly arrived Cape Verdean immigrants to the United States identify as Protestant due to an increased presence of evangelical missionaries in Cape Verde following its independence.<ref>Halter, Marilyn. \"Cape Verdeans in the U.S.\" Transnational Archipelago: Perspectives on Cape Verdean Migration and Diaspora.

The Cape Verdean Jewish Heritage movement is mainly led by the diaspora and its interest is predominantly in preserving history, not practicing doctrine. Accordingly, one of the major goals of the movement is preservation of Jewish cemeteries in Cape Verde.<ref>Werlin, Louise. \"Jews in Cape Verde.\" UMASS Dartmouth, n.d. Web. 1 Mar. 2015.</ref> A manifestation of this interest is the annual Cape Verdean - Jewish Passover Seder held in Roxbury, Massachusetts since 2005 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/04/21/two-communities-cape-verdean-and-jewish-unite-celebrate-shared-heritage/cwSZzN7w7xMgazc8H1NllJ/story.html|title=Two communities, Cape Verdean and Jewish, unite to celebrate a shared heritage - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> The Seder brings together Cape Verdean and Jewish Americans in a celebration of both cultures. The traditional Seder is adapted with a bilingual Haggadah that includes Criolu prayers and elements of Cape Verdean history, such as the addition of Amilcar's Cup.\n\n==Music==\nCape Verdean music has evolved to be composed of diverse styles and genres that reflect its mixture of racial identities, such as: African, Portuguese, Caribbean and Brazilian influences. Older styles include ''[[morna (music)|morna]]'' and ''[[coladeira]]''. These styles, though distinct, carry a commonality of somber, slow, and soulful tone that often reflects themes of love, longing, and nostalgia. Re-emerging forms of Caper Verdean Music are ''[[funan\u00e1]]'' and ''[[batuque (music)|batuque]]''. These quick tempo, percussion filled styles are high energy songs that are typically accompanied by hip-moving dance. These styles were banned previously due to overly sexual allegations but are now re-emerging in the past decade. ''[[Hip hop]]'', ''[[Reggae]]'' and ''[[Zouk]]'' are styles of Cape Verdean music that are now being explored. These fusions with contemporary styles of music are often reflective in lyrics with ongoing themes of Cape Verdean life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capeverde.co.uk/Docs/Cape-Verde-Guide/General-Information/Music.aspx?ContentTabs=Info|title=Music and Festivals|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*[[Demetrius Andrade]]\n*[[George Araujo]]\n*[[Almir Barbosa]]\n*[[Anthony Barboza]]\n*[[Cynthia Barboza]]\n*[[Dana Barros]]\n*[[Michael Beach]]\n*[[Benzino]]\n*[[Blu Cantrell]] \n*[[Peter Cipriano]]\n*[[Stephen Cooper (American football)|Stephen Cooper]]\n*[[Jasiel Correia]]\n*[[Mike Costa]]\n*[[John DeBrito]]\n*[[Pedro DeBrito]]\n*[[Vinny deMacedo]]\n*[[Paulo Dos Santos (soccer)|Paulo Dos Santos]]\n*[[Wuilito Fernandes]]\n*[[Wayne Fontes]]\n*[[Gordon D.

His initial work was on the largest car, designated XC9001, with the smallest car, XC9003, having the lowest priority despite it being Issigonis' greatest personal interest. With Lord's dictum to produce a bubble car competitor and his revised design requirements being laid down in October 1956, work on XC9001 stopped and XC9003 became the priority. The team that designed the Mini was remarkably small; in addition to Issigonis,  Jack Daniels (who had worked with him on the Morris Minor), Chris Kingham (who had been with him at Alvis), two engineering students, and four draughtsmen worked on the project. Together, by July 1957, they had designed and built the original XC9003 prototype, which was affectionately named the  \"Orange Box\" because of its colour.<ref name=\"reed1\"/> Leonard Lord approved the car for production on 19 July and XC9003 became project [[Amalgamated Drawing Office|ADO15]].\n\nThe ADO15 used a conventional [[BMC A-Series engine|BMC A-Series]] [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder]], [[water-cooled]] engine,<ref name=\"ado15\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |title=Engines of the ADO15 and family |publisher=Mgcars.org.uk |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190240/http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |archivedate=7 February 2009 }}</ref> but departed from tradition by mounting it [[Transverse engine|transversely]], with the engine oil-lubricated, four-speed transmission in the [[sump]], and by employing [[front-wheel drive]]. Almost all small front-wheel drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration, except with the transmission usually separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil. The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct entry of rainwater through the grille. Early prototypes used the existing 948-cc A-Series unit, but this provided the ADO15 with performance far greater than its price and purpose required \u2013 a top speed  over 90&nbsp;mph. The engine was reduced to a new 848-cc capacity with a shorter [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]]. This reduced power from 37 to 33&nbsp;bhp and caused a significant drop in [[torque]], so provided more realistic performance, especially when the ADO15 body was widened by 2 inches (5.08&nbsp;cm) over the XC9003 prototype, which blunted the car's top speed while improving its stability and roadholding. Even so, the ADO15 had a top speed of 75&nbsp;mph, which was better than many other [[economy car]]s of the time.\n\nThe [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, designed by Issigonis's friend Dr. [[Alex Moulton]] at [[Moulton Developments Limited]], used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs. This space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers. Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels' positioning at the corners of the car, gave the Mini [[go kart]]-like handling.\n\n[[File:Mini-ature_Parking_Space_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1169507.jpg|thumb|right|The Mini became an icon of 1960s [[British popular culture]], and featured in the 1969 caper film ''[[The Italian Job]]''.]]\nInitially, an interconnected fluid system was planned, similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis. They had assessed the mechanically interconnected [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s),{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<!--Again this apocryphal \"interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s\"! Which issue? Who was the interviewer? Some credibility, please! -->  which inspired the design of the hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini's launch. The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the [[hydrolastic]] system was first used on the [[Morris 1100]], launched in 1962; the Mini gained the system later in 1964. As launched, the Mini had simpler suspension made from [[cone|conical]] springs of solid rubber. These were compact, saving on intrusion into the cabin space, and required no maintenance. The fully independent suspension the rubber cones provided was almost unheard of in low-cost cars of the time. The conical shape gave the springs a progressive action, becoming stiffer at greater degrees of compression. This gave the ADO15 a smooth ride over small bumps, but minimised roll and pitch on more uneven surfaces. It also allowed the springs to cope with the huge variance in load between an unladen car (about 600&nbsp;kg or 1300&nbsp;lb) and a fully laden one (just over 1000&nbsp;kg or 2240&nbsp;lb, or a 70% increase).\n\nTen-inch (254&nbsp;mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be developed, the initial contract going to [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller, {{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels (even though he had already settled on 10-inch). An agreement was made on the 10-inch size, after Dunlop rejected the eight-inch proposition.\n\nMany features were designed into the ADO15's interior to maximise its passenger and luggage space on top of the major savings allowed by the transverse engine and 10-inch wheels. Sliding windows allowed single-skin doors to be fitted, improving elbow room and reducing costs. A bracing bar was fitted across the door frame to brace the single skin and this was later adapted into a large storage bin on each door. Issigonis later said that he had sized the bins to carry the ingredients of his favourite drink, a [[Martini (cocktail)|dry martini]] in the correct proportions (one bottle of [[vermouth]] and 27 of [[Gordon's Gin]]<ref name=\"issigbio\"/>). Similar bins were provided outboard of the rear seats, also serving a dual function of bracing the single-skin body panel. Small items could also be stowed under the rear seats, and early Minis were sold with optional [[wicker]] baskets specially shaped to slot under the seats. The fixed rear parcel shelf contributed to the rigidity of the body shell, although it did preclude fitting the ADO15 with a [[hatchback]]. The [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] lid was hinged at the bottom so that the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars, the [[vehicle registration plate|number plate]] was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was open. This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.\n\nThe Mini was designed as a [[monocoque]] shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the car running down the [[A-pillar|A and C pillars]], and between the body and the floor pan. Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as 'everted' (lit., 'turned outward') to provide more room for the front seat occupants{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. To further simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally. This also saved a small amount of cabin space. It also made the ADO15 very easy to assemble from complete [[knock-down kit]]s in overseas markets with only basic industry. Cars could be assembled with minimal use of [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] as the external seams made the panels largely 'self-aligning'. They also allowed panels to be stacked flat on top of one other for easy shipping. As originally built, all the structural body panels were welded to the top of the single floor pressing, but this caused major problems with water entering the cabin and was quickly changed in the first months of production.\n\nEarly prototypes were fully unitary in construction, but the cars broke apart under the high loads from the large lever ratios used with the rubber cone suspension. The design was changed to use steel subframes to carry the drivetrain and suspension for the front and rear. This also simplified production, as both subframes could be built up independently and then mated to the already-completed bodyshell. It also opened up the possibility of easily producing variants on the ADO15 as a body of any shape or design could be used provided it could accommodate the subframes.\n\nIn 1959, BMC and Alec Issigonis won the [[Dewar Trophy]], for the design and production of the Mini.\n\nThe Mini shape had become so well known that by the 1990s, [[Rover Group]]&nbsp;\u2013 the heirs to BMC&nbsp;\u2013 were able to register its design as a trademark in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |title=Trade Mark & Copyright Attorneys in Ashby-de-la-Zouch |publisher=Verymark.info |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805192734/http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |archivedate=5 August 2010 }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark I Mini: 1959\u20131967==\n{{See also|Mini (Mark I)}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mini \"Mark I\"\n| image      = File:1959 Morris Mini-Minor Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg\n| caption    = 1959 Morris Mini Minor\n| aka        = Austin 850 <br/>Austin Mini <br> Austin Partner<ref>[http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/articles/modelrange.htm#austin Mini Model Range 1959-2001- Austin, www.minipassionmini.50megs.com] Retrieved 11 August 2016</ref> <br />Austin Seven <br> Innocenti Mini<ref name=minimania>[http://www.minimania.com/Mini_Identification_1807 ''Italian Minis''], Minimania.com, Retrieved 12 August 2015</ref> <br /> Morris 850 <br/> Morris Mini <br/> Riley Elf <br /> Wolseley Hornet\n| production = 1959\u20131967\n| assembly   = England <br /> Australia\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] <br /> 2-door [[Station wagon|estate]] <br /> 2-door [[Panel van|van]] <br /> 2-door [[Pickup truck|pickup]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|1071|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br />  {{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| related    = \n| designer   = [[Alec Issigonis|Sir Alec Issigonis]]\n}}\nThe production version of the Mini was demonstrated to the press in April 1959, and by August, several thousand cars had been produced ready for the first sales.<ref name=\"autocar59\">{{cite journal |title=Happy Events (Editorial) |journal=The Autocar |year=1959 |issue=3315 |page=45}}</ref> The Mini was officially announced to the public on 26 August 1959.

This seems to have been a play on words: the Morris Minor was a larger, well known, and successful car that continued in production, and ''minor'' is [[Latin]] for \"lesser\", so an abbreviation of the Latin word for \"least\"&nbsp;\u2013 ''minimus''&nbsp;\u2013 was used for the new even smaller car. One name proposed for the almost identical Austin version was Austin Newmarket, but it was sold as the Austin Seven (sometimes written as ''SE7EN'' in early publicity material&nbsp;\u2013 with the '7' using the letter V rotated anticlockwise so it approximated the number 7), which recalled the popular small [[Austin 7]] of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nUntil 1962, the cars appeared in North America and France as the Austin 850 and Morris 850, and in Denmark as the Austin Partner (until 1964) and Morris Mascot (until 1981). It was introduced in Australia as Morris 850 only (not \"Austin\"), and then later as Morris Cooper and Morris Cooper S versions, as well.  The Morris name Mini (Mini-Minor) was first used for Austin's version by BMC in 1961 when the Austin Seven was rebranded as the Austin Mini,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk/mini_brochures.htm |title=mini_brochures |publisher=Mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref> somewhat to the surprise of the [[Sharp's Commercials]] car company (later known as Bond Cars), who had been using the name [[Bond Minicar|Minicar]] for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949.

The new suspension gave a softer ride, but it also increased weight and production cost. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.\n\nFrom October 1965, the option of the unique [[Automotive Products]] designed four-speed [[AP automatic transmission|automatic transmission]] became available. Cars fitted with this became the Mini-Matic.\n\nSlow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and production totalled 1,190,000.<ref name=\"sales\"/> [[Ford]] purchased a Mini and dismantled it to see if they could offer an alternative.

The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows, although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from hydrolastic to rubber cones<ref name=Autocar1976/> as a cost-saving measure.<ref name=\"mrtb5\">{{cite book | title=Mini Gold Portfolio 1981\u20131997 | isbn=1-85520-385-5 }}</ref>  (The 1275 GT and Clubman retained the hydrolastic system until June 1971, when they, too, switched to the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis.<ref name=Autocar1976/>)\n\nIn 1969, the simple name Mini completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.histomobile.com/1/Mini/1969/-_.htm?lan=1 |title=Mini\u2013mk III (1969\u20132000) history, pictures |publisher=Histomobile.com |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153350/http://www.histomobile.com/1/Mini/1969/-_.htm?lan=1 |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1974, a heater became standard equipment on the entry-level Mini 850, as well, having by then already been included in the standard specification of the other models for some time.<ref name=Autocar1976/>\n\nIn the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced the [[Innocenti Mini|Innocenti 90 and 120]], [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]-designed hatchbacks based on the Mini platform. Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the [[Innocenti De Tomaso]], that sported a 1275-cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine, but with an 11-stud head, a special inlet manifold, and used the \"A\" clutch instead of the \"Verto\" type. It also used [[Constant-velocity joint|homokinetic shafts]] instead of rubber couplings.\n\nThe Mini was still popular in Britain, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark IV and onwards: 1976\u20132000==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mk IV\n| image      = 1978 Leyland Mini 1000 (8329370970).jpg\n| caption    = 1978 Leyland Mini 1000\n| aka        = \n| production = 1976\u20131983\n| assembly   = {{unbulleted list | [[Longbridge plant]], Birmingham, England | [[Zetland, New South Wales]], Australia | [[Seneffe]], Belgium | [[Petone]], New Zealand | [[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal | [[Cape Town]], South Africa | [[Pamplona]], Spain }}\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]<br />2-door van<br />2-door [[Pickup truck|truck]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|1098|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4\n| related    = \n| designer   = \n}}\n\nThe Mark IV was introduced in 1976, though by this stage British Leyland was working on a new small car which was widely expected to replace the Mini before much longer. It had a front rubber-mounted subframe with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushings introduced. Twin column stalks for indicators and wipers were introduced, as were larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear light clusters included reversing lights. The 1100 Special<ref>http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/pdf/Mini%20Special%201100%20UK%201979.pdf</ref> and 850 City models were phased out by 1980,<ref>https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1979/1705775/mini_850_city.html</ref> and during the same year the engine was upgraded to the improved A-Plus unit from the new Metro. This was then followed by a number of incremental developments.\n\nIn 1978, the Mini was one of the key cars made available to disabled motorists under the new [[Motability]] scheme.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/25/newsid_2500000/2500373.stm | work=BBC News | title=1978: Motability gets moving in the UK | date=25 July 1978}}</ref>\n\nReports of the Mini's imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] (badging with the word \"mini\" in all lowercase). Faced with competition from a new wave of modern superminis like the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Renault 5]], and [[Volkswagen Polo]], the Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time. Buyers of small cars now wanted modern and practical designs, usually with a hatchback.\n\nAlthough the Mini continued to be produced after the Metro's launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and its successor Rover Group concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini. The original Mini's last year in the top ten of Britain's top selling cars was 1981, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth. The arrival of the Metro also had production of the larger Allegro pruned back before it was finally discontinued in 1982. In 1982, BL made 56,297 Minis and over 175,000 Metros. During the early 1980s, the Mini received many mechanical upgrades which were shared with the Metro, such as the [[BMC A-Series engine#A-Plus versions|A-Plus engine]], 12-inch wheels with front disc brakes, improved soundproofing and quieter, stronger transmissions. This not only modernised the Mini but, because many of its major subassemblies were now shared with the Metro, made it very cost-effective to produce despite falling sales volumes. The Mini's 25th anniversary fell in 1984 and British Leyland produced a 'Mini 25' [[List of Mini limited editions#Anniversary editions|limited-edition]] model, both to mark the occasion and to publicise the recent upgrades to the model. This marked the start of a turnaround in the Mini's fortunes. Basic models such as the City and the City E (using the economy-tuned drivetrain from the Metro HLE) filled in the bottom of the Austin-Rover range and still found buyers who wanted a compact [[city car]] that was easy to park and cheap to run. Low purchase and running costs also made the Mini continually popular as a first car for younger drivers, and Austin-Rover introduced a steady stream of [[List of Mini limited editions#Colours|limited editions]] with bright paint colours, body graphics, and trim to appeal to this market. The Mini was also becoming prized as a characterful and nostalgic car in its own right, and the [[List of Mini limited editions#London Collection|London Collection]] of limited-edition models was more upmarket and luxurious and named after affluent or fashionable parts of London. These marketing strategies proved very successful; Mini production actually had modest increases through the mid-1980s, from 34,974 in 1985 to 35,280 in 1985 and 39,800 in 1986. By 1990, with the reintroduction of the very popular Cooper model, Mini production  passed 40,000. In 1988, Austin Rover decided to keep the Mini in production for as long as it was viable to do so, putting an end to reports that it would be discontinued by 1991, by which time the original Metro would also be replaced.\n\n[[File:1992 Mini Cord FA 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|1992 Mini Cord built with a fibreglass body in Venezuela]]\nThe fibreglass [[#Chile|Mini built in Chile]] from 1970 until 1974 was not the only fibreglass version; in the summer of 1991, a fibreglass bodied Mini again entered production, this time in Venezuela.

The end of production in October 2000 not only signalled the end of original Mini production after 41 years, but also brought about the demise of the 1275-cc engine which had powered the Mini and numerous other BL/BMC/ARG cars for more than 35 years.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Variants==\nThe popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.\n\n===Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf (1961\u201369)===\n[[File:Wolseley Hornet Biggleswade.JPG|thumb|Wolseley Hornet]]\n[[File:Riley Elf.jpg|thumb|right|Riley Elf]]\nReleased in 1961 as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] Hornet and the [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more conventional [[Three-box styling|three-box design]].\nThe wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at {{convert|2.036|m|ft|abbr=on}}, whereas the overall length was increased to {{convert|3.27|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This resulted in a dry weight of {{convert|638|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|642.3|kg|abbr=on}} (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and {{convert|618|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|636.4|kg|abbr=on}} for the Hornet.<ref name=\"AKD4062C\">Hornet and Elf Workshop Manual, Part No. AKD 4062C, BMC Service Limited, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>\nFront-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit \"Wolseley\" badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars.<ref>[http://www.motorbase.com/vehicle/by-id/710/ \"Riley Elf\", ''Motorbase'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008.</ref>  The name \"Wolseley Hornet\" was first used on [[Wolseley Hornet six|1930s saloon, coup\u00e9, sports and racing cars]], while the name \"Elf\" recalled the [[Riley Nine|Riley Sprite]] and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name \"Imp\" could not be used as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.\nBoth the Riley Elf's and Wolseley Hornet's bodies were built at Fisher & Ludlow under their \"Fisholow\" brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.\nVery early Mark I versions of both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no overriders on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below scuttle panel) that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf's and Hornet's special bumper overriders first appeared in 1962.\nEarly production Mark I's also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats.<ref name=\"AKD3489\">Body Service Parts List, Riley Elf, Wolseley Hornet, British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, BMC Service division, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>  Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.\n\nBoth the Elf and the Hornet went through three engine versions. Initially, they used the {{convert|848|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} {{convert|34|bhp|abbr=on}} engine (engine type 8WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> with a single HS2 carburettor, changing to a single HS2 carburettor {{convert|38|bhp|abbr=on}} version of the Cooper's {{convert|998|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} power unit (engine type 9WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from {{convert|71|to|77|mph|abbr=on}}. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power in the form of front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a. \"magic wand\" type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/> Production of both models ceased in late 1969.\n\nVehicle Identification&nbsp;\u2013 Serial Number Prefix Letter Code:\n* First prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 name: R-Riley, W-Wolseley\n* Second prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 engine type: A\n* Third prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 body type: 2S&nbsp;\u2013 2-door Saloon\n* Fourth prefix&nbsp;\u2013 series of model: 1&nbsp;\u2013 1st series, 2&nbsp;\u2013 2nd series, 3&nbsp;\u2013 3rd series\n* Fifth prefix (used to denote cars different from standard right hand drive): L&nbsp;\u2013 left hand drive\nCode example: R-A2S1-154321 (Riley, A type engine, 2 door saloon, 1st series, serial number \"154321\")<ref name=\"AKD3489\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|Traveller|Countryman}}\n\n===Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1960\u201369)===\n[[File:1i i8.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk1 with internal fuel tank]]\n[[File:2 t75.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk2]]\nThese models were two-door estate cars with double \"barn\"-style rear doors. Both were built on a slightly longer chassis of {{convert|84|in|m}} compared to {{convert|80.25|in|m}} for the saloon.\n\nThe early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman cars had an internal fuel tank located on the left hand side of the rear load area.  This is identifiable by the fuel filler cap being on the left hand side of the car just below the rear window.\nIn October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the filler cap was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car \u2013 the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.\n\nFrom the start of production both models had a decorative, non-structural, ash wood trim on the rear body, in the style of a pre-war [[shooting-brake]]. This gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor Traveller and gave rise to these cars simply being called a [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]].  It is a popular misconception that the difference between the Traveller and the Countryman is the wood trim.\nAn all steel version of both the Traveller and the Countryman without the wood trim was launched for export markets in April 1961 and for the home market in October 1962, but the [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] version remained more popular.\n\nIn October 1967 the Mk2 version was launched with the same changes as the saloon.\n\nApproximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymans and 99,000 Morris Mini Travellers were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/>  Variations of this model were also built in South Africa, by Innocenti in Italy and by Industria de Montagem de Automoveis in Portugal.\n\nThe Mini Traveller and Countryman Register was created in 2009 to help locate and preserve the remaining Mini Traveller and Countryman cars.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mini Van (1960\u201383){{anchor|Mini_Van}}===\n[[File:Austin Mini Van3222dg.JPG|thumb|right|1963 Austin Mini Van]]\nThe Mini Van was a commercial panel van (in US English, a [[sedan delivery]]) rated at \u00bc-ton load capacity.

A set of simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille.

To meet emission standards, Coopers from 1992 on were fitted with a [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the 1,275&nbsp;cc engine, and in 1997 a multi-point fuel injected engine was introduced, along with a front-mounted radiator and various safety improvements.<ref name=\"parnell2\">{{cite book |last=Parnell| first=John |title=Original Mini-Cooper: The Restorers Guide To All MKL, II, And III Models |isbn=1-870979-32-X | year=1993 |publisher=Bay View}}</ref> \"I love my Mini Cooper,\" remarked [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2003. \"I was too scared to drive a big car in London.\"<ref>Rees, Paul: 'Listen very carefully, I will say this only once', ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', May 2003, pp 84\u201392</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n{{Anchor|Mini Clubman|Mini 1275GT}}\n\n=={{anchor|Clubman}}Mini Clubman and 1275 GT: 1969\u20131980==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mini Clubman <br /> Mini 1275 GT\n| image      = Mini Clubman 1980.JPG\n| caption    = 1980 Mini Clubman\n| aka        = \n| production = 1969\u20131980\n| assembly   = [[Longbridge]], Birmingham, England<br />[[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal, [[Petone]], New Zealand\n| body_style = 2-door saloon <br /> 2-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| engine     = {{convert|1098|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]<br />{{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]] <br /> {{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| related    = \n| designer   = \n}}\n\nIn 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist [[Roy Haynes (designer)|Roy Haynes]], who had previously worked for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the [[Austin Maxi]]. The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions. A new model, dubbed the 1275 GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper (the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275 GT for two years until 1971). The Clubman Estate replaced the Countryman and Traveller. The original \"round-front\" design remained in production alongside the Clubman and 1275 GT.\n\n[[File:Mini Clubman Estate (12769772824).jpg|thumb|left|Mini Clubman Estate|230x230px]]\nProduction of the Clubman and 1275 GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated \"lots of production changes\" including the relocation of tooling from the manufacturer's [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] plant to the [[Longbridge plant]]: very few cars were handed over to customers before the early months of 1970.<ref name=\"Autocar197102\">{{cite journal| first=Geoffrey |last=Howard| title = 10,000 mile (0 km) long-term report: Mini Clubman Estate| journal=Autocar | volume = 134 | issue = 3907| pages = 22\u201323 |date = 11 February 1971}}</ref>\n\nEarly domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that by 1970 [[Radial tire|radials]] had become the norm for the car's mainstream competitors.<ref name=Autocar197102/>  By 1973 new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of \u00a38.<ref name=\"Autocar197304\">{{cite journal| title = Auto Test Mini 850| journal=Autocar | volume = 138 | issue = 4012 | pages = 8\u201312 |date = 19 April 1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mini 1275 GT, front.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 1275 GT|229x229px]]\nThe 1275 GT is often incorrectly described as the \"Mini Clubman 1275 GT\". The official name was always just the \"Mini 1275 GT\", and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).\n\nIn 1971, the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275 GT as the only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK built 1275 GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a [[tachometer]]. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox, and initially had 10 inch (25.4&nbsp;cm) Rostyle wheels covering the 7.5inch (19.05&nbsp;cm) Cooper S type disc brakes, and a boot board, both were dropped in 1974. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0\u2013{{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 12.9&nbsp;seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a {{convert|30|\u2013|50|mph|abbr=on}} time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 \"round-front\" design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275 GT models. The long-nose Clubman and 1275 GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275 GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original \"round-front\" Mini design continued for another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275 GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275 GTs had been made.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Leyland Mini LS.jpg|thumb|right|The Leyland Mini LS was produced by [[Leyland Australia]] from 1977 to 1978]]\nFor the Australian market, all Minis including the Van gained the Clubman front in 1971 although the car was still basically a Mk I behind the A-Pillar.<ref name=miniexperience19>[http://miniexperience.com.au/issue-19/history-of-the-clubman-gt.html History of the Clubman GT] Retrieved from miniexperience.com.au on 11 February 2010</ref> The Australian van thus became the only Clubman Van produced anywhere in the world.<ref name=miniexperience19 /> From mid-1971 to the end of 1972, a Clubman GT version of the saloon was produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230190829/http://www.clubmangt.com.au/|title=The GT Spot|date=30 December 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>  This was essentially a Cooper S in Clubman body, equipped with the same {{convert|7.5|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and twin-carburettor Cooper S 1,275&nbsp;cc engine. Australian Clubman saloons were marketed under the '''Morris Mini Clubman''' name when introduced in August 1971,<ref>Green Book Price & Model Guide, July\u2013August 1983, page 71</ref> and as the '''Leyland Mini''', without the Clubman name, from February 1973.<ref name=Green_P60/>\n\nTo end Mini production in Australia, a limited edition runout model was produced \u2212 the 1275LS. Fitted with a pollution control 1,275&nbsp;cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} carburettor and {{convert|8.4|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes. Production of this model commenced in July 1978 and concluded in October 1978 with an approximate total of 810 vehicles produced.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==End of production==\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous \"special editions\" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for [[BMW]], which later bought the remnants of BMC as the [[MG Rover Group|Rover Group]]. It was even more popular in Japan, which took the lion's share of the circa 40,000 Minis produced annually in the early 1990s.<ref name=Facorca/> It was seen there as a retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. The [[E.R.A. Mini Turbo|ERA Mini Turbo]] was particularly popular with Japanese buyers.\n\nIn 1994, under [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]], a [[first cousin once removed]] of Issigonis, BMW took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting an [[airbag]] to comply with European legislation.\n\n[[File:2000 Mini Cooper (X411 JOP) 1.3.jpg|thumb|left|The last Mini produced, a Rover Cooper Mini Sport, rolled off the Longbridge line on 4 October 2000]]\nBy March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year. [[MG (car)|MG]] and Rover went to [[Phoenix Venture Holdings|Phoenix]], a new British consortium; and [[Land Rover]] was sold to [[Ford Motor Company]]. BMW retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and\u2014for overseas European markets\u2014the Mini Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on 4 October 2000 and presented to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year.<ref name=\"reed1\"/>  A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured, nearly 1.6 million of which were sold in Britain, although the majority of these were sold at least 20 years before the Mini's demise, meaning that the majority of those sold had been scrapped before the end of the original Mini's production life.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n\nAfter the last of the Mini production had been sold, the 'Mini' name passed to BMW ownership. [[Mini Hatch]], the new model made by BMW, is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and \"bulldog\" stance of the original.\n\nThe last Mini to leave the Longbridge plant did so in 2012, when a 1970s 1275GT which was used by staff to travel around the car plant was recovered from the disused tunnels under the plant. The car was damaged by a storage container falling on it and had been left without an engine or gearbox for around 30 years before being recovered during work to infill the tunnels. This car was sold at auction in July 2013 for \u00a31400.<ref name=\"Mini-2013\">{{cite news | title = Final Longbridge factory Mini sold at auction | date = 28 July 2013 | publisher = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23482725 | work = BBC News Online | accessdate = 28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brighton seafront carshow.jpg|thumb|Minis lined up on [[Brighton]] seafront after a [[London to Brighton events|London-to-Brighton rally]] ]]\n\n==Timeline==\n* August 1959: Introduction of the Austin Seven, Morris Mini-Minor and Morris Mini-Minor DL 2-door saloons, all with transversely mounted 848&nbsp;cc engine and 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox.\n* 1960: Introduction of the Austin Seven Countryman and Morris Mini-Minor Traveller 3-door estates, both with 848&nbsp;cc engine from the saloon models. 116,667 cars built in the first full year of production.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Seven Super and Morris Mini-Minor Super 2-door saloons.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper 2-door saloon, both with larger 997&nbsp;cc {{convert|55|bhp|abbr=on}} engine.\n* October 1961: Introduction of Riley Elf and Wolseley Hornet variants<ref name=elf-hornet-register>[http://www.elf-hornet-register.co.uk/Timeline.html Timeline of the Mini (ADO15) Elf/Hornet variant], Elf-hornet-register.co.uk Retrieved 15 February 2016</ref>\n* January 1962: All former Austin Seven models now officially called Austin Mini.\n* March 1962: pvc seat covers replaced cloth upholstery on entry level model (\"basic Mini\").<ref name=\"Autocar1971\">{{cite journal| journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 134 | issue = 3908 |title =Used Car Test: 1968 Morris Mini Mk I de luxe | pages = 51\u201353| date = 18 February 1971}}</ref>\n* 1962: \"De Luxe\" and \"Super\" designations discontinued.  \"Super de Luxe\" designation introduced.

These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini 1100 Special, Mini 1000 Special HL (only available in silver colour with black vinyl roof, black cloth upholstery seats with head restraints and walnut interior trim, for Portugal market only), Mini Rio, Mini Mayfair, Mini Park Lane, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini Flame, Mini Red Hot, Mini Jet Black, Mini Racing, Mini Thirty (30) which 3000 examples were produced, 2000 in Red and 1000 in Black and the Mini Monza. There was also a version inspired by ''[[The Italian Job]]'', a 1969 film famous for having a trio of Minis in its epic closing car chase.\n\n==Concepts and unproduced prototypes==\n{{see also|Mini concept cars}}\n[[File:1969 Mini 9X prototype Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 9X at the [[Heritage Motor Centre]]]]\n\nFrom 1967 to 1979, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X.<ref name=\"issigbio\"/> It was longer and more powerful than the Mini, but due to politicking inside [[British Leyland]] (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC's parent company [[British Motor Holdings]] and the [[Leyland Motor Corporation]]), the car did not reach production.\n\nA number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production are held and sometimes displayed at the British [[Heritage Motor Centre]] museum at [[Gaydon]], Warwickshire. These included the Twini, a re-engineered [[four-wheel-drive]] Moke with two engines\u2014one at the front and another at the back; the [[Austin Ant]], a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using a [[transfer case]]; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini, cancelled due to it being perceived as competition for the [[MG Midget]].\n\nIn 1992, a project considering possible improvements to the Mini was started. Codenamed ''Minki'' (\"Mini\" plus [[Rover K engine|K-Series]] engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a two-piece [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|rear door or tailgate]] instead of a boot, fold down rear seats, [[Hydragas]] suspension and a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox.<ref name=\"am-minki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |title=Austin Memories: Minki |work=www.austinmemories.com |accessdate=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209025952/http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 }}</ref> However, the project was cancelled by management within Rover, who decided that the cost of engineering the changes, and achieving compliance with modern crash testing standards, was too great for the production volumes that could be expected of an updated Mini.\n\nIn 1995 the idea to update the Mini again surfaced but this time with BMW management. As part of the process of deciding how to replace the Mini, a vehicle representing what the current Mini could have become, if it had been developed further over its production history, was commissioned.<ref name=\"am-minki\"/> This resulted in the ''Minki-II'', designed to house the 1.4L MPI K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki's tailgate. The car had to be widened by 50mm and lengthened by 50mm to accommodate the new engine and gearbox, with Hydragas suspension and dashboard from a [[Rover Metro|Rover 100]]. The Minki-II was used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59 project, later to become the [[Mini Hatch]].\n\n==Kit cars and customisation==\n{{Main|List of Mini-based cars}}\n[[File:Outspan Orange.jpg|thumb|right|One of three {{ill|Outspan (brand)|lt=Outspan Orange|fr|Outspan}} Minis, on Madeira Drive in Brighton]]\nThe cheapness and availability of used Minis make it a candidate for body replacement.

This department played a key role in ensuring the Mini's huge success in motorsport throughout the 1960s, in particular, winning the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]] in 1965, 1966 and 1967, and dominating all of the first 9 positions in the [[1966 Gallaher 500]] at Bathurst.\n\nThe car also won the [[1961 British Saloon Car Championship season|1961]], [[1962 British Saloon Car Championship season|1962]], [[1969 British Saloon Car Championship season|1969]], [[1978 British Saloon Car Championship season|1978]] and [[1979 British Saloon Car Championship season]], as well as the [[British Rally Championship]] in 1962, 1963 and 1970, the [[European Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966, and won the [[Finnish Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rallism.fi/content/en/1/171318/Winners+of+FRC.html|title=Winners of FRC|author=|date=|website=Ralli SM}}</ref> Minis also won the [[1965 Lowood 4 Hour]] endurance race, and the final [[Finnish Grand Prix]] in 1963. The Cooper S also had some success in the [[European Touring Car Championship]], winning in 1964 and 1968, the [[Guia Race of Macau]] (a 1-2-3 finish in 1965, a 1\u20132 finish in 1970 and a win in 1972), and the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], winning its class in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967 and 1968. A further title was the 1971 [[Sun-7 Chesterfield Series]]. The Mini also achieved class wins at the [[1963 Armstrong 500]], repeating this feat every year until [[1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1969]], and having class wins at the 1964, 1965 and [[1971 Sandown 250]], and [[Six Hour Le Mans]] in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972, as well as the [[1971 Phillip Island 500K]]. The car also won the [[Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship]] in 1998. Mini Leyland came 4th place in the under-2-litre category in the [[1966 Trans-Am season|1966]], [[1967 Trans-Am season|1967]] and [[1969 Trans-Am season]]s, improving to 3rd in [[1970 Trans-Am season|1970]].\n\nThe Mini Cooper S won the [[Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967.<ref name=\"montecarlo\"/> Minis initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the judges.

By this time, the Mini's design had been overtaken by numerous more modern and practical vehicles.\n\nAlthough the Metro did not replace the Mini, production figures for the Mini dipped during the 1980s, and interest in the design was not revived until the reintroduction of the Mini Cooper in 1990.

Mini sales fell in the 1967 calendar year and the US importer was expecting the forthcoming Austin America to find a larger market. The America was also withdrawn in 1972 due to slow sales and the introduction of bumper-height standards. Mini sales continued in Canada until 1980. MkIII variants, as with their UK counterparts remained badged as a \"Mini\" (no distinction between Austin or Morris), and in 1976 with the takeover of British Leyland, became British Leyland Minis (MkIV). Leyland Minis also were subject to stricter government regulation with high bumpers, large turn indicators, warning buzzers and lights for seat belts and also a fitting of air pollution pumps which required a specially designed radiator.\n\nToday the U.S. Government exempts cars older than 25 years [[Grey import vehicle#United States|from all import laws]], so older Minis can be freely imported.

With Lord's dictum to produce a bubble car competitor and his revised design requirements being laid down in October 1956, work on XC9001 stopped and XC9003 became the priority. The team that designed the Mini was remarkably small; in addition to Issigonis,  Jack Daniels (who had worked with him on the Morris Minor), Chris Kingham (who had been with him at Alvis), two engineering students, and four draughtsmen worked on the project. Together, by July 1957, they had designed and built the original XC9003 prototype, which was affectionately named the  \"Orange Box\" because of its colour.<ref name=\"reed1\"/> Leonard Lord approved the car for production on 19 July and XC9003 became project [[Amalgamated Drawing Office|ADO15]].\n\nThe ADO15 used a conventional [[BMC A-Series engine|BMC A-Series]] [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder]], [[water-cooled]] engine,<ref name=\"ado15\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |title=Engines of the ADO15 and family |publisher=Mgcars.org.uk |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190240/http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |archivedate=7 February 2009 }}</ref> but departed from tradition by mounting it [[Transverse engine|transversely]], with the engine oil-lubricated, four-speed transmission in the [[sump]], and by employing [[front-wheel drive]]. Almost all small front-wheel drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration, except with the transmission usually separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil. The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct entry of rainwater through the grille. Early prototypes used the existing 948-cc A-Series unit, but this provided the ADO15 with performance far greater than its price and purpose required \u2013 a top speed  over 90&nbsp;mph. The engine was reduced to a new 848-cc capacity with a shorter [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]]. This reduced power from 37 to 33&nbsp;bhp and caused a significant drop in [[torque]], so provided more realistic performance, especially when the ADO15 body was widened by 2 inches (5.08&nbsp;cm) over the XC9003 prototype, which blunted the car's top speed while improving its stability and roadholding. Even so, the ADO15 had a top speed of 75&nbsp;mph, which was better than many other [[economy car]]s of the time.\n\nThe [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, designed by Issigonis's friend Dr. [[Alex Moulton]] at [[Moulton Developments Limited]], used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs. This space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers. Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels' positioning at the corners of the car, gave the Mini [[go kart]]-like handling.\n\n[[File:Mini-ature_Parking_Space_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1169507.jpg|thumb|right|The Mini became an icon of 1960s [[British popular culture]], and featured in the 1969 caper film ''[[The Italian Job]]''.]]\nInitially, an interconnected fluid system was planned, similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis. They had assessed the mechanically interconnected [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s),{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<!--Again this apocryphal \"interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s\"! Which issue? Who was the interviewer? Some credibility, please! -->  which inspired the design of the hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini's launch. The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the [[hydrolastic]] system was first used on the [[Morris 1100]], launched in 1962; the Mini gained the system later in 1964. As launched, the Mini had simpler suspension made from [[cone|conical]] springs of solid rubber. These were compact, saving on intrusion into the cabin space, and required no maintenance. The fully independent suspension the rubber cones provided was almost unheard of in low-cost cars of the time. The conical shape gave the springs a progressive action, becoming stiffer at greater degrees of compression. This gave the ADO15 a smooth ride over small bumps, but minimised roll and pitch on more uneven surfaces. It also allowed the springs to cope with the huge variance in load between an unladen car (about 600&nbsp;kg or 1300&nbsp;lb) and a fully laden one (just over 1000&nbsp;kg or 2240&nbsp;lb, or a 70% increase).\n\nTen-inch (254&nbsp;mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be developed, the initial contract going to [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller, {{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels (even though he had already settled on 10-inch). An agreement was made on the 10-inch size, after Dunlop rejected the eight-inch proposition.\n\nMany features were designed into the ADO15's interior to maximise its passenger and luggage space on top of the major savings allowed by the transverse engine and 10-inch wheels. Sliding windows allowed single-skin doors to be fitted, improving elbow room and reducing costs. A bracing bar was fitted across the door frame to brace the single skin and this was later adapted into a large storage bin on each door. Issigonis later said that he had sized the bins to carry the ingredients of his favourite drink, a [[Martini (cocktail)|dry martini]] in the correct proportions (one bottle of [[vermouth]] and 27 of [[Gordon's Gin]]<ref name=\"issigbio\"/>). Similar bins were provided outboard of the rear seats, also serving a dual function of bracing the single-skin body panel. Small items could also be stowed under the rear seats, and early Minis were sold with optional [[wicker]] baskets specially shaped to slot under the seats. The fixed rear parcel shelf contributed to the rigidity of the body shell, although it did preclude fitting the ADO15 with a [[hatchback]]. The [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] lid was hinged at the bottom so that the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars, the [[vehicle registration plate|number plate]] was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was open. This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.\n\nThe Mini was designed as a [[monocoque]] shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the car running down the [[A-pillar|A and C pillars]], and between the body and the floor pan. Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as 'everted' (lit., 'turned outward') to provide more room for the front seat occupants{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. To further simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally. This also saved a small amount of cabin space. It also made the ADO15 very easy to assemble from complete [[knock-down kit]]s in overseas markets with only basic industry. Cars could be assembled with minimal use of [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] as the external seams made the panels largely 'self-aligning'. They also allowed panels to be stacked flat on top of one other for easy shipping. As originally built, all the structural body panels were welded to the top of the single floor pressing, but this caused major problems with water entering the cabin and was quickly changed in the first months of production.\n\nEarly prototypes were fully unitary in construction, but the cars broke apart under the high loads from the large lever ratios used with the rubber cone suspension. The design was changed to use steel subframes to carry the drivetrain and suspension for the front and rear. This also simplified production, as both subframes could be built up independently and then mated to the already-completed bodyshell. It also opened up the possibility of easily producing variants on the ADO15 as a body of any shape or design could be used provided it could accommodate the subframes.\n\nIn 1959, BMC and Alec Issigonis won the [[Dewar Trophy]], for the design and production of the Mini.\n\nThe Mini shape had become so well known that by the 1990s, [[Rover Group]]&nbsp;\u2013 the heirs to BMC&nbsp;\u2013 were able to register its design as a trademark in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |title=Trade Mark & Copyright Attorneys in Ashby-de-la-Zouch |publisher=Verymark.info |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805192734/http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |archivedate=5 August 2010 }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark I Mini: 1959\u20131967==\n{{See also|Mini (Mark I)}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mini \"Mark I\"\n| image      = File:1959 Morris Mini-Minor Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg\n| caption    = 1959 Morris Mini Minor\n| aka        = Austin 850 <br/>Austin Mini <br> Austin Partner<ref>[http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/articles/modelrange.htm#austin Mini Model Range 1959-2001- Austin, www.minipassionmini.50megs.com] Retrieved 11 August 2016</ref> <br />Austin Seven <br> Innocenti Mini<ref name=minimania>[http://www.minimania.com/Mini_Identification_1807 ''Italian Minis''], Minimania.com, Retrieved 12 August 2015</ref> <br /> Morris 850 <br/> Morris Mini <br/> Riley Elf <br /> Wolseley Hornet\n| production = 1959\u20131967\n| assembly   = England <br /> Australia\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]] <br /> 2-door [[Station wagon|estate]] <br /> 2-door [[Panel van|van]] <br /> 2-door [[Pickup truck|pickup]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br /> {{convert|1071|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]  <br />  {{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| related    = \n| designer   = [[Alec Issigonis|Sir Alec Issigonis]]\n}}\nThe production version of the Mini was demonstrated to the press in April 1959, and by August, several thousand cars had been produced ready for the first sales.<ref name=\"autocar59\">{{cite journal |title=Happy Events (Editorial) |journal=The Autocar |year=1959 |issue=3315 |page=45}}</ref> The Mini was officially announced to the public on 26 August 1959.

This seems to have been a play on words: the Morris Minor was a larger, well known, and successful car that continued in production, and ''minor'' is [[Latin]] for \"lesser\", so an abbreviation of the Latin word for \"least\"&nbsp;\u2013 ''minimus''&nbsp;\u2013 was used for the new even smaller car. One name proposed for the almost identical Austin version was Austin Newmarket, but it was sold as the Austin Seven (sometimes written as ''SE7EN'' in early publicity material&nbsp;\u2013 with the '7' using the letter V rotated anticlockwise so it approximated the number 7), which recalled the popular small [[Austin 7]] of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nUntil 1962, the cars appeared in North America and France as the Austin 850 and Morris 850, and in Denmark as the Austin Partner (until 1964) and Morris Mascot (until 1981). It was introduced in Australia as Morris 850 only (not \"Austin\"), and then later as Morris Cooper and Morris Cooper S versions, as well.  The Morris name Mini (Mini-Minor) was first used for Austin's version by BMC in 1961 when the Austin Seven was rebranded as the Austin Mini,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk/mini_brochures.htm |title=mini_brochures |publisher=Mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref> somewhat to the surprise of the [[Sharp's Commercials]] car company (later known as Bond Cars), who had been using the name [[Bond Minicar|Minicar]] for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949.

The new suspension gave a softer ride, but it also increased weight and production cost. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.\n\nFrom October 1965, the option of the unique [[Automotive Products]] designed four-speed [[AP automatic transmission|automatic transmission]] became available. Cars fitted with this became the Mini-Matic.\n\nSlow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and production totalled 1,190,000.<ref name=\"sales\"/> [[Ford]] purchased a Mini and dismantled it to see if they could offer an alternative.

The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows, although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows).

It also used [[Constant-velocity joint|homokinetic shafts]] instead of rubber couplings.\n\nThe Mini was still popular in Britain, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mark IV and onwards: 1976\u20132000==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mk IV\n| image      = 1978 Leyland Mini 1000 (8329370970).jpg\n| caption    = 1978 Leyland Mini 1000\n| aka        = \n| production = 1976\u20131983\n| assembly   = {{unbulleted list | [[Longbridge plant]], Birmingham, England | [[Zetland, New South Wales]], Australia | [[Seneffe]], Belgium | [[Petone]], New Zealand | [[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal | [[Cape Town]], South Africa | [[Pamplona]], Spain }}\n| body_style = 2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]<br />2-door van<br />2-door [[Pickup truck|truck]]\n| engine     = {{convert|848|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />{{convert|1098|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4<br>{{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} I4\n| related    = \n| designer   = \n}}\n\nThe Mark IV was introduced in 1976, though by this stage British Leyland was working on a new small car which was widely expected to replace the Mini before much longer. It had a front rubber-mounted subframe with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushings introduced. Twin column stalks for indicators and wipers were introduced, as were larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear light clusters included reversing lights. The 1100 Special and 850 City models were phased out by 1980,<ref>http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/pdf/Mini%20Special%201100%20UK%201979.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1979/1705775/mini_850_city.html</ref> and during the same year the engine was upgraded to the improved A-Plus unit from the new Metro. This was then followed by a number of incremental developments.\n\nIn 1978, the Mini was one of the key cars made available to disabled motorists under the new [[Motability]] scheme.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/25/newsid_2500000/2500373.stm | work=BBC News | title=1978: Motability gets moving in the UK | date=25 July 1978}}</ref>\n\nReports of the Mini's imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] (badging with the word \"mini\" in all lowercase). Faced with competition from a new wave of modern superminis like the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Renault 5]], and [[Volkswagen Polo]], the Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time. Buyers of small cars now wanted modern and practical designs, usually with a hatchback.\n\nAlthough the Mini continued to be produced after the Metro's launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and its successor Rover Group concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini. The original Mini's last year in the top ten of Britain's top selling cars was 1981, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth. The arrival of the Metro also had production of the larger Allegro pruned back before it was finally discontinued in 1982. In 1982, BL made 56,297 Minis and over 175,000 Metros. During the early 1980s, the Mini received many mechanical upgrades which were shared with the Metro, such as the [[BMC A-Series engine#A-Plus versions|A-Plus engine]], 12-inch wheels with front disc brakes, improved soundproofing and quieter, stronger transmissions. This not only modernised the Mini but, because many of its major subassemblies were now shared with the Metro, made it very cost-effective to produce despite falling sales volumes. The Mini's 25th anniversary fell in 1984 and British Leyland produced a 'Mini 25' [[List of Mini limited editions#Anniversary editions|limited-edition]] model, both to mark the occasion and to publicise the recent upgrades to the model. This marked the start of a turnaround in the Mini's fortunes. Basic models such as the City and the City E (using the economy-tuned drivetrain from the Metro HLE) filled in the bottom of the Austin-Rover range and still found buyers who wanted a compact [[city car]] that was easy to park and cheap to run. Low purchase and running costs also made the Mini continually popular as a first car for younger drivers, and Austin-Rover introduced a steady stream of [[List of Mini limited editions#Colours|limited editions]] with bright paint colours, body graphics, and trim to appeal to this market. The Mini was also becoming prized as a characterful and nostalgic car in its own right, and the [[List of Mini limited editions#London Collection|London Collection]] of limited-edition models was more upmarket and luxurious and named after affluent or fashionable parts of London. These marketing strategies proved very successful; Mini production actually had modest increases through the mid-1980s, from 34,974 in 1985 to 35,280 in 1985 and 39,800 in 1986. By 1990, with the reintroduction of the very popular Cooper model, Mini production  passed 40,000. In 1988, Austin Rover decided to keep the Mini in production for as long as it was viable to do so, putting an end to reports that it would be discontinued by 1991, by which time the original Metro would also be replaced.\n\n[[File:1992 Mini Cord FA 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|1992 Mini Cord built with a fibreglass body in Venezuela]]\nThe fibreglass [[#Chile|Mini built in Chile]] from 1970 until 1974 was not the only fibreglass version; in the summer of 1991, a fibreglass bodied Mini again entered production, this time in Venezuela.

The Mini Cooper was relaunched in 1989, 20 years after the demise of the original model. Once again, it featured the long-running 1275-cc engine which had featured on the original Mini Cooper, as well as on numerous other BMC/BL/ARG models.\n\n===Mark VI: 1990\u20131996===\nThe engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1275-cc power units, and includes the later Horizontal Integral Float version of the [[SU carburettor|SU carb]], plus the single-point fuel-injected car, which came out in 1991.

The basic Mini was the 1.3i, the other model in the range being the Mini Cooper. The end of production in October 2000 not only signalled the end of original Mini production after 41 years, but also brought about the demise of the 1275-cc engine which had powered the Mini and numerous other BL/BMC/ARG cars for more than 35 years.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Variants==\nThe popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.\n\n===Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf (1961\u201369)===\n[[File:Wolseley Hornet Biggleswade.JPG|thumb|Wolseley Hornet]]\n[[File:Riley Elf.jpg|thumb|right|Riley Elf]]\nReleased in 1961 as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] Hornet and the [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more conventional [[Three-box styling|three-box design]].\nThe wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at {{convert|2.036|m|ft|abbr=on}}, whereas the overall length was increased to {{convert|3.27|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This resulted in a dry weight of {{convert|638|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|642.3|kg|abbr=on}} (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and {{convert|618|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|636.4|kg|abbr=on}} for the Hornet.<ref name=\"AKD4062C\">Hornet and Elf Workshop Manual, Part No. AKD 4062C, BMC Service Limited, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>\nFront-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit \"Wolseley\" badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars.<ref>[http://www.motorbase.com/vehicle/by-id/710/ \"Riley Elf\", ''Motorbase'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008.</ref>  The name \"Wolseley Hornet\" was first used on [[Wolseley Hornet six|1930s saloon, coup\u00e9, sports and racing cars]], while the name \"Elf\" recalled the [[Riley Nine|Riley Sprite]] and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name \"Imp\" could not be used as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.\nBoth the Riley Elf's and Wolseley Hornet's bodies were built at Fisher & Ludlow under their \"Fisholow\" brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.\nVery early Mark I versions of both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no overriders on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below scuttle panel) that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf's and Hornet's special bumper overriders first appeared in 1962.\nEarly production Mark I's also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats.<ref name=\"AKD3489\">Body Service Parts List, Riley Elf, Wolseley Hornet, British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, BMC Service division, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>  Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.\n\nBoth the Elf and the Hornet went through three engine versions. Initially, they used the {{convert|848|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} {{convert|34|bhp|abbr=on}} engine (engine type 8WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> with a single HS2 carburettor, changing to a single HS2 carburettor {{convert|38|bhp|abbr=on}} version of the Cooper's {{convert|998|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} power unit (engine type 9WR)<ref name=\"AKD4062C\"/> in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from {{convert|71|to|77|mph|abbr=on}}. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power in the form of front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a. \"magic wand\" type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/> Production of both models ceased in late 1969.\n\nVehicle Identification&nbsp;\u2013 Serial Number Prefix Letter Code:\n* First prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 name: R-Riley, W-Wolseley\n* Second prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 engine type: A\n* Third prefix letter&nbsp;\u2013 body type: 2S&nbsp;\u2013 2-door Saloon\n* Fourth prefix&nbsp;\u2013 series of model: 1&nbsp;\u2013 1st series, 2&nbsp;\u2013 2nd series, 3&nbsp;\u2013 3rd series\n* Fifth prefix (used to denote cars different from standard right hand drive): L&nbsp;\u2013 left hand drive\nCode example: R-A2S1-154321 (Riley, A type engine, 2 door saloon, 1st series, serial number \"154321\")<ref name=\"AKD3489\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|Traveller|Countryman}}\n\n===Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1960\u201369)===\n[[File:1i i8.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk1 with internal fuel tank]]\n[[File:2 t75.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk2]]\nThese models were two-door estate cars with double \"barn\"-style rear doors. Both were built on a slightly longer chassis of {{convert|84|in|m}} compared to {{convert|80.25|in|m}} for the saloon.\n\nThe early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman cars had an internal fuel tank located on the left hand side of the rear load area.  This is identifiable by the fuel filler cap being on the left hand side of the car just below the rear window.\nIn October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the filler cap was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car \u2013 the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.\n\nFrom the start of production both models had a decorative, non-structural, ash wood trim on the rear body, in the style of a pre-war [[shooting-brake]]. This gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor Traveller and gave rise to these cars simply being called a [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]].  It is a popular misconception that the difference between the Traveller and the Countryman is the wood trim.\nAn all steel version of both the Traveller and the Countryman without the wood trim was launched for export markets in April 1961 and for the home market in October 1962, but the [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]] version remained more popular.\n\nIn October 1967 the Mk2 version was launched with the same changes as the saloon.\n\nApproximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymans and 99,000 Morris Mini Travellers were built.<ref name=\"sales\"/>  Variations of this model were also built in South Africa, by Innocenti in Italy and by Industria de Montagem de Automoveis in Portugal.\n\nThe Mini Traveller and Countryman Register was created in 2009 to help locate and preserve the remaining Mini Traveller and Countryman cars.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mini Van (1960\u201383){{anchor|Mini_Van}}===\n[[File:Austin Mini Van3222dg.JPG|thumb|right|1963 Austin Mini Van]]\nThe Mini Van was a commercial panel van (in US English, a [[sedan delivery]]) rated at \u00bc-ton load capacity. Built on the longer Traveller chassis but without side windows, it proved popular in 1960s Britain as a cheaper alternative to the car: it was classed as a commercial vehicle and as such carried no sales tax. A set of simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille.

There were no Mark III Coopers and just 1,570 Mark III Cooper S.\n\nIn 1971, the Mini Cooper design was licensed in Italy by [[Innocenti]] and in 1973 to Spain by Authi (Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses), which began to produce the Innocenti Mini Cooper 1300 and the Authi Mini Cooper 1300, respectively. The Cooper name was discontinued from the UK Mini range at this time.\n\nA new Mini Cooper named the RSP (Rover Special Products) was briefly relaunched in 1990\u201391, with slightly lower performance than the 1960s Cooper. It proved popular and a new Cooper-marked Mini went into full production in late 1991. To meet emission standards, Coopers from 1992 on were fitted with a [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the 1,275&nbsp;cc engine, and in 1997 a multi-point fuel injected engine was introduced, along with a front-mounted radiator and various safety improvements.<ref name=\"parnell2\">{{cite book |last=Parnell| first=John |title=Original Mini-Cooper: The Restorers Guide To All MKL, II, And III Models |isbn=1-870979-32-X | year=1993 |publisher=Bay View}}</ref> \"I love my Mini Cooper,\" remarked [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2003. \"I was too scared to drive a big car in London.\"<ref>Rees, Paul: 'Listen very carefully, I will say this only once', ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', May 2003, pp 84\u201392</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n{{Anchor|Mini Clubman|Mini 1275GT}}\n\n=={{anchor|Clubman}}Mini Clubman and 1275 GT: 1969\u20131980==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name       = Mini Clubman <br /> Mini 1275 GT\n| image      = Mini Clubman 1980.JPG\n| caption    = 1980 Mini Clubman\n| aka        = \n| production = 1969\u20131980\n| assembly   = [[Longbridge]], Birmingham, England<br />[[Set\u00fabal]], Portugal, [[Petone]], New Zealand\n| body_style = 2-door saloon <br /> 2-door [[estate car|estate]]\n| engine     = {{convert|1098|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]<br />{{convert|998|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]] <br /> {{convert|1275|cc|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Straight-4|I4]]\n| related    = \n| designer   = \n}}\n\nIn 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist [[Roy Haynes (designer)|Roy Haynes]], who had previously worked for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the [[Austin Maxi]]. The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions. A new model, dubbed the 1275 GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper (the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275 GT for two years until 1971). The Clubman Estate replaced the Countryman and Traveller. The original \"round-front\" design remained in production alongside the Clubman and 1275 GT.\n\n[[File:Mini Clubman Estate (12769772824).jpg|thumb|left|Mini Clubman Estate|230x230px]]\nProduction of the Clubman and 1275 GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated \"lots of production changes\" including the relocation of tooling from the manufacturer's [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] plant to the [[Longbridge plant]]: very few cars were handed over to customers before the early months of 1970.<ref name=\"Autocar197102\">{{cite journal| first=Geoffrey |last=Howard| title = 10,000 mile (0 km) long-term report: Mini Clubman Estate| journal=Autocar | volume = 134 | issue = 3907| pages = 22\u201323 |date = 11 February 1971}}</ref>\n\nEarly domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that by 1970 [[Radial tire|radials]] had become the norm for the car's mainstream competitors.<ref name=Autocar197102/>  By 1973 new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of \u00a38.<ref name=\"Autocar197304\">{{cite journal| title = Auto Test Mini 850| journal=Autocar | volume = 138 | issue = 4012 | pages = 8\u201312 |date = 19 April 1973}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mini 1275 GT, front.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 1275 GT|229x229px]]\nThe 1275 GT is often incorrectly described as the \"Mini Clubman 1275 GT\". The official name was always just the \"Mini 1275 GT\", and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).\n\nIn 1971, the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275 GT as the only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK built 1275 GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a [[tachometer]]. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox, and initially had 10 inch (25.4&nbsp;cm) Rostyle wheels covering the 7.5inch (19.05&nbsp;cm) Cooper S type disc brakes, and a boot board, both were dropped in 1974. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0\u2013{{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 12.9&nbsp;seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a {{convert|30|\u2013|50|mph|abbr=on}} time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 \"round-front\" design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275 GT models. The long-nose Clubman and 1275 GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275 GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original \"round-front\" Mini design continued for another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275 GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275 GTs had been made.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Leyland Mini LS.jpg|thumb|right|The Leyland Mini LS was produced by [[Leyland Australia]] from 1977 to 1978]]\nFor the Australian market, all Minis including the Van gained the Clubman front in 1971 although the car was still basically a Mk I behind the A-Pillar.<ref name=miniexperience19>[http://miniexperience.com.au/issue-19/history-of-the-clubman-gt.html History of the Clubman GT] Retrieved from miniexperience.com.au on 11 February 2010</ref> The Australian van thus became the only Clubman Van produced anywhere in the world.<ref name=miniexperience19 /> From mid-1971 to the end of 1972, a Clubman GT version of the saloon was produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230190829/http://www.clubmangt.com.au/|title=The GT Spot|date=30 December 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>  This was essentially a Cooper S in Clubman body, equipped with the same {{convert|7.5|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes, twin fuel tanks, and twin-carburettor Cooper S 1,275&nbsp;cc engine. Australian Clubman saloons were marketed under the '''Morris Mini Clubman''' name when introduced in August 1971,<ref>Green Book Price & Model Guide, July\u2013August 1983, page 71</ref> and as the '''Leyland Mini''', without the Clubman name, from February 1973.<ref name=Green_P60/>\n\nTo end Mini production in Australia, a limited edition runout model was produced \u2212 the 1275LS. Fitted with a pollution control 1,275&nbsp;cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} carburettor and {{convert|8.4|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes. Production of this model commenced in July 1978 and concluded in October 1978 with an approximate total of 810 vehicles produced.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==End of production==\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous \"special editions\" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for [[BMW]], which later bought the remnants of BMC as the [[MG Rover Group|Rover Group]]. It was even more popular in Japan, which took the lion's share of the circa 40,000 Minis produced annually in the early 1990s.<ref name=Facorca/> It was seen there as a retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. The [[E.R.A. Mini Turbo|ERA Mini Turbo]] was particularly popular with Japanese buyers.\n\nIn 1994, under [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]], a [[first cousin once removed]] of Issigonis, BMW took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting an [[airbag]] to comply with European legislation.\n\n[[File:2000 Mini Cooper (X411 JOP) 1.3.jpg|thumb|left|The last Mini produced, a Rover Cooper Mini Sport, rolled off the Longbridge line on 4 October 2000]]\nBy March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year. [[MG (car)|MG]] and Rover went to [[Phoenix Venture Holdings|Phoenix]], a new British consortium; and [[Land Rover]] was sold to [[Ford Motor Company]]. BMW retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and\u2014for overseas European markets\u2014the Mini Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on 4 October 2000 and presented to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year.<ref name=\"reed1\"/>  A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured, nearly 1.6 million of which were sold in Britain, although the majority of these were sold at least 20 years before the Mini's demise, meaning that the majority of those sold had been scrapped before the end of the original Mini's production life.<ref name=\"sales\"/>\n\nAfter the last of the Mini production had been sold, the 'Mini' name passed to BMW ownership. [[Mini Hatch]], the new model made by BMW, is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and \"bulldog\" stance of the original.\n\nThe last Mini to leave the Longbridge plant did so in 2012, when a 1970s 1275GT which was used by staff to travel around the car plant was recovered from the disused tunnels under the plant. The car was damaged by a storage container falling on it and had been left without an engine or gearbox for around 30 years before being recovered during work to infill the tunnels. This car was sold at auction in July 2013 for \u00a31400.<ref name=\"Mini-2013\">{{cite news | title = Final Longbridge factory Mini sold at auction | date = 28 July 2013 | publisher = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23482725 | work = BBC News Online | accessdate = 28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brighton seafront carshow.jpg|thumb|Minis lined up on [[Brighton]] seafront after a [[London to Brighton events|London-to-Brighton rally]] ]]\n\n==Timeline==\n* August 1959: Introduction of the Austin Seven, Morris Mini-Minor and Morris Mini-Minor DL 2-door saloons, all with transversely mounted 848&nbsp;cc engine and 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox.\n* 1960: Introduction of the Austin Seven Countryman and Morris Mini-Minor Traveller 3-door estates, both with 848&nbsp;cc engine from the saloon models. 116,667 cars built in the first full year of production.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Seven Super and Morris Mini-Minor Super 2-door saloons.\n* 1961: Introduction of the Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper 2-door saloon, both with larger 997&nbsp;cc {{convert|55|bhp|abbr=on}} engine.\n* October 1961: Introduction of Riley Elf and Wolseley Hornet variants<ref name=elf-hornet-register>[http://www.elf-hornet-register.co.uk/Timeline.html Timeline of the Mini (ADO15) Elf/Hornet variant], Elf-hornet-register.co.uk Retrieved 15 February 2016</ref>\n* January 1962: All former Austin Seven models now officially called Austin Mini.\n* March 1962: pvc seat covers replaced cloth upholstery on entry level model (\"basic Mini\").<ref name=\"Autocar1971\">{{cite journal| journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 134 | issue = 3908 |title =Used Car Test: 1968 Morris Mini Mk I de luxe | pages = 51\u201353| date = 18 February 1971}}</ref>\n* 1962: \"De Luxe\" and \"Super\" designations discontinued.  \"Super de Luxe\" designation introduced.

These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini 1100 Special, Mini 1000 Special HL (only available in silver colour with black vinyl roof, black cloth upholstery seats with head restraints and walnut interior trim, for Portugal market only), Mini Rio, Mini Mayfair, Mini Park Lane, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini Flame, Mini Red Hot, Mini Jet Black, Mini Racing, Mini Thirty (30) which 3000 examples were produced, 2000 in Red and 1000 in Black and the Mini Monza. There was also a version inspired by ''[[The Italian Job]]'', a 1969 film famous for having a trio of Minis in its epic closing car chase.\n\n==Concepts and unproduced prototypes==\n{{see also|Mini concept cars}}\n[[File:1969 Mini 9X prototype Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 9X at the [[Heritage Motor Centre]]]]\n\nFrom 1967 to 1979, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X.<ref name=\"issigbio\"/> It was longer and more powerful than the Mini, but due to politicking inside [[British Leyland]] (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC's parent company [[British Motor Holdings]] and the [[Leyland Motor Corporation]]), the car did not reach production.\n\nA number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production are held and sometimes displayed at the British [[Heritage Motor Centre]] museum at [[Gaydon]], Warwickshire. These included the Twini, a re-engineered [[four-wheel-drive]] Moke with two engines\u2014one at the front and another at the back; the [[Austin Ant]], a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using a [[transfer case]]; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini, cancelled due to it being perceived as competition for the [[MG Midget]].\n\nIn 1992, a project considering possible improvements to the Mini was started. Codenamed ''Minki'' (\"Mini\" plus [[Rover K engine|K-Series]] engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a two-piece [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|rear door or tailgate]] instead of a boot, fold down rear seats, [[Hydragas]] suspension and a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox.<ref name=\"am-minki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |title=Austin Memories: Minki |work=www.austinmemories.com |accessdate=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209025952/http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 }}</ref> However, the project was cancelled by management within Rover, who decided that the cost of engineering the changes, and achieving compliance with modern crash testing standards, was too great for the production volumes that could be expected of an updated Mini.\n\nIn 1995 the idea to update the Mini again surfaced but this time with BMW management. As part of the process of deciding how to replace the Mini, a vehicle representing what the current Mini could have become, if it had been developed further over its production history, was commissioned.<ref name=\"am-minki\"/> This resulted in the ''Minki-II'', designed to house the 1.4L MPI K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki's tailgate. The car had to be widened by 50mm and lengthened by 50mm to accommodate the new engine and gearbox, with Hydragas suspension and dashboard from a [[Rover Metro|Rover 100]]. The Minki-II was used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59 project, later to become the [[Mini Hatch]].\n\n==Kit cars and customisation==\n{{Main|List of Mini-based cars}}\n[[File:Outspan Orange.jpg|thumb|right|One of three {{ill|Outspan (brand)|lt=Outspan Orange|fr|Outspan}} Minis, on Madeira Drive in Brighton]]\nThe cheapness and availability of used Minis make it a candidate for body replacement. [[List of Mini based cars|There are over 120]] Mini-based [[kit car]]s from various small companies and individual enthusiasts.\n\n==Motorsport==\nBMC operated a Competition Department at [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], Oxfordshire, under the control of Stuart Turner, which built specially prepared Minis (mostly based on Cooper and Cooper S versions) to compete in international rallies and other motorsport. This department played a key role in ensuring the Mini's huge success in motorsport throughout the 1960s, in particular, winning the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]] in 1965, 1966 and 1967, and dominating all of the first 9 positions in the [[1966 Gallaher 500]] at Bathurst.\n\nThe car also won the [[1961 British Saloon Car Championship season|1961]], [[1962 British Saloon Car Championship season|1962]], [[1969 British Saloon Car Championship season|1969]], [[1978 British Saloon Car Championship season|1978]] and [[1979 British Saloon Car Championship season]], as well as the [[British Rally Championship]] in 1962, 1963 and 1970, the [[European Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966, and won the [[Finnish Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rallism.fi/content/en/1/171318/Winners+of+FRC.html|title=Winners of FRC|author=|date=|website=Ralli SM}}</ref> Minis also won the [[1965 Lowood 4 Hour]] endurance race, and the final [[Finnish Grand Prix]] in 1963. The Cooper S also had some success in the [[European Touring Car Championship]], winning in 1964 and 1968, the [[Guia Race of Macau]] (a 1-2-3 finish in 1965, a 1\u20132 finish in 1970 and a win in 1972), and the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], winning its class in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967 and 1968. A further title was the 1971 [[Sun-7 Chesterfield Series]]. The Mini also achieved class wins at the [[1963 Armstrong 500]], repeating this feat every year until [[1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1969]], and having class wins at the 1964, 1965 and [[1971 Sandown 250]], and [[Six Hour Le Mans]] in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972, as well as the [[1971 Phillip Island 500K]]. The car also won the [[Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship]] in 1998. Mini Leyland came 4th place in the under-2-litre category in the [[1966 Trans-Am season|1966]], [[1967 Trans-Am season|1967]] and [[1969 Trans-Am season]]s, improving to 3rd in [[1970 Trans-Am season|1970]].\n\nThe Mini Cooper S won the [[Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967.<ref name=\"montecarlo\"/> Minis initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the judges.

Mini sales fell in the 1967 calendar year and the US importer was expecting the forthcoming Austin America to find a larger market. The America was also withdrawn in 1972 due to slow sales and the introduction of bumper-height standards. Mini sales continued in Canada until 1980. MkIII variants, as with their UK counterparts remained badged as a \"Mini\" (no distinction between Austin or Morris), and in 1976 with the takeover of British Leyland, became British Leyland Minis (MkIV). Leyland Minis also were subject to stricter government regulation with high bumpers, large turn indicators, warning buzzers and lights for seat belts and also a fitting of air pollution pumps which required a specially designed radiator.\n\nToday the U.S. Government exempts cars older than 25 years [[Grey import vehicle#United States|from all import laws]], so older Minis can be freely imported.

{"title_page": "History of the Cape Colony from 1899 to 1910", "text_new": "{{CapeColony}}\nThe [[Second Boer War|Second Anglo-Boer War]] had no sooner commenced with the ultimatum of the Transvaal Republic on 9 October 1899, than Mr Schreiner found himself called upon to deal with the conduct of Cape rebels. The rebels joined the invading forces of [[President Steyn]], whose false assurances Mr Schreiner had offered to an indignant House of Assembly only a few weeks before. The war on the part of the Republics was evidently not to be merely one of self-defence. It was one of aggression and aggrandisement. Mr Schreiner ultimately addressed, as prime minister, a sharp remonstrance to President Steyn for allowing his burghers to invade the colony. He also co-operated with Sir [[Alfred Milner]], and used his influence to restrain the Bond.\n\n==After the war==\n\nThe acknowledgment of defeat by the Boers in the field, and the surrender of some 10,000 rebels, did not weaken the endeavours of the Dutch to obtain political supremacy in the colony. Moreover, in the autumn of 1902 Sir Gordon Sprigg, the prime minister, nominally the leader of the Progressives, sought to maintain his position by securing the support of the Bond party in parliament. In the early part of 1903 Mr Chamberlain included Cape Town in his visit to South Africa, and had conferences with the political leaders of all parties. Reconciliation between the Bond and British elements in the colony was, however, still impossible, and the two parties concentrated their efforts on a struggle for victory at the coming election. Mr Hofmeyr, who had chosen to spend the greater part of the war period in Europe, returned to the Cape to reorganize the Bond. On the other side Dr Jameson came forward as the leader of the Progressives. Parliament was dissolved in September 1903. It had passed, since the war, two measures of importance - one (1902) restricting alien immigration, the other (1903) ratifying the first customs convention between all the South African colonies. This convention was notable for its grant of preferential treatment (in general, a rebate of 25% on the customs already levied) to imports from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe election turned on the issue of British or Bond supremacy. It was fought on a register purged of the rebel voters, many of whom, besides being disfranchised, were in prison. The issue was doubtful, and each side sought to secure the support of the native voters, who in several constituencies held the balance of power. The Bondsmen were more lavish than their opponents in their promises to the natives and even invited an African journalist (who declined) to stand for a seat in the Assembly. In view of the agitation then proceeding for the introduction of Chinese coolies to work the mines on the Rand, the Progressives declared their intention, if returned, to exclude them from the colony, and this declaration gained them some native votes. The polling (in January and February 1904) resulted in a Progressive majority of five in a house of 95 members. The rejected candidates included prominent Bond supporters like Mr Merriman and Mr Sauer, and also Sir Gordon Sprigg and Mr A. Douglass, another member of the cabinet. Mr W. P. Schreiner, the ex-premier, who stood as an Independent, was also rejected.\n\n==The Jameson Ministry==\n\nOn 18 February Sir Gordon Sprigg resigned and was succeeded by Dr L. S. Jameson, who formed a ministry wholly British in character. The first task of the new government was to introduce (on 4 March) an Additional Representation Bill, to rectify - in part - the disparity in electoral power of the rural and urban districts. Twelve new seats in the House of Assembly were divided among the larger towns, and three members were added to the legislative council. The town voter being mainly British, the bill met with the bitter opposition of the Bond members, who declared that its object was the extinction of their parliamentary power. In fact, the bill was called for by the glaring anomalies in the distribution of seats by which a minority of voters in the country districts returned a majority of members, and it left the towns still inadequately represented. The bill was supported by two or three Dutch members, who were the object of violent attack by the Bondsmen. It became law, and the elections for the additional seats were held in July, after the close of the session. They resulted in strengthening the Progressive majority both in the House of Assembly and in the legislative council - where the Progressives previously had a majority of one only.\n\nAt the outset of its career the Jameson ministry had to face a serious financial situation. During the war the supplying of the army in the field had caused an artificial inflation of trade, and the Sprigg ministry had pursued a policy of extravagant expenditure not warranted by the finances of the colony. The slow recovery of the gold-mining and other industries in the Transvaal after the war was reflected in a great decline in trade in Cape Colony during the latter half of 1903, the distress being aggravated by severe drought. When Dr Jameson assumed office he found an empty treasury, and considerable temporary loans had to be raised. Throughout 1904, moreover, revenue continued to shrink - compared with 1903 receipts dropped from \u00a311,701,000 to \u00a39,913,000. The government, besides cutting down official salaries and exercising strict economy, contracted (July 1904) a loan for \u00a33,000,000. It also passed a bill imposing a graduated tax (6d. to 1s. in the pound) on all incomes over \u00a31000. A substantial [[excise]] duty was placed on spirits and beer, measures of relief for the brandy-farmers being taken at the same time. The result was that while there was a deficit on the budget of 1904 &mdash; 1905 of \u00a3731,000, the budget of 1905 &mdash; 1906 showed a surplus of \u00a35161. This small surplus was obtained notwithstanding a further shrinkage in revenue.\n\nDr Jameson's programme was largely one of material development. In the words of the speech opening the 1905 session of parliament, \"without a considerable development of our agricultural and pastoral resources our position as a self-sustaining colony cannot be assured\". This reliance on its own resources was the more necessary for the Cape because of the keen rivalry of Natal and Delagoa Bay for the carrying trade of the Transvaal. The opening up of backward districts by railways was vigorously pursued, and in other ways great efforts were made to assist agriculture. These efforts to help the country districts met with cordial recognition from the Dutch farmers, and the release, in May 1904, of all rebel prisoners was another step towards reconciliation. On the exclusion of Chinese from the colony the Bond party were also in agreement with the ministry. An education act passed in 1905 established school boards on a popular franchise and provided for the gradual introduction of compulsory education. The cultivation  of friendly relations with the neighbouring colonies was also one of the leading objects of Dr Jameson's policy. The Bond, on its side, sought to draw closer to ''Het Volk'', the Boer organization in the Transvaal, and similar bodies, and at its 1906 congress, held in March that year at [[Ceres, South Africa|Ceres]], a resolution with that aim was passed, the design being to unify, in accordance with the original conception of the Bond, Dutch sentiment and action throughout South Africa.\n\nNative affairs proved a source of considerable anxiety. In January 1905 an inter-colonial native affairs commission reported on the native question as it affected South Africa as a whole, proposals being made for an alteration of the laws in Cape Colony respecting the franchise exercised by natives. In the opinion of the commission the possession of the franchise by the Cape natives under existing conditions was sure to create in time an intolerable situation, and was an unwise and dangerous thing. (The registration of 1905 showed that there were over 23,000 \"coloured\" voters in the colony.) The commission proposed separate voting by natives only for a fixed number of members of the legislature - the plan adopted in [[New Zealand]] with the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] voters. The privileged position of the Cape native was seen to be an obstacle to the federation of South Africa. The discussion which followed, based partly on the reports that the ministry contemplated disfranchising the natives, led, however, to no immediate results.\n\nAnother disturbing factor in connexion with native affairs was the revolt of the Hottentots and [[Herero people|Herero]]s in German [[South West Africa]]. In 1904 and the following years large numbers of refugees, including some of the most important chiefs, fled into British territory, and charges were made in [[Germany]] that sufficient control over these refugees was not exercised by the Cape government. This trouble, however, came to an end in September 1907. In that month [[Jacob Morenga]], a chief who bad been interned by the colonial authorities, but had escaped and recommenced hostilities against the Germans, was once more on the British side of the frontier and, refusing to surrender, was pursued by the Cape Mounted Police and killed after a smart action. The revolt in the German protectorate had been, nearly a year before the death of Morenga, the indirect occasion of a \"Boer raid\" into Cape Colony. In November 1906 a small party of Transvaal Boers, who had been employed by the Germans against the Hottentots, entered the colony under the leadership of a man named Ferreira, and began raiding farms and forcibly enrolling recruits. Within a week the filibusters were all captured. Ferreira and four companions were tried for murder and convicted, (February 1907), the death sentences being commuted to terms of [[penal servitude]].\n\nAs the result of an inter-colonial conference held in [[Pietermaritzburg]] in the early months of 1906, a new customs convention of a strongly protective character came into force on 1 June 1906. At the same time the rebate on goods from Britain and reciprocating colonies was increased. The session of parliament which sanctioned this change was notable for the attention devoted to irrigation and railway schemes. But one important measure of a political character was passed in 1906, namely an amnesty act. Under its provisions over 7000 ex-rebels, who would otherwise have had no vote at the ensuing general election, were readmitted to the franchise in 1907.\n\nWhile the efforts made to develop the agricultural and mineral resources of the country proved successful, the towns continued to suffer from the [[inflation]] - over-buying, over-building and over-speculation - which marked the war period. As a consequence, imports further declined during 1906&mdash;1907, and receipts being largely dependent on customs the result was a considerably diminished revenue. The accounts for the year ending 30 June 1907 showed a deficit of \u00a3640,455. The decline in revenue, \u00a34,000,000 in four years, while not a true reflection of the economic condition of the country - yearly becoming more self-supporting by the increase in home produce - caused general disquiet and injuriously affected the position of the ministry. In the session of 1907 the opposition in the legislative council brought on a crisis by refusing to grant supplies voted by the lower chamber. Dr Jameson contested the constitutional right of the council so to act, and on his advice the governor dissolved parliament in September 1907. Before its dissolution parliament passed an act imposing a profit tax of 10% on diamond- and copper-mining companies earning over \u00a350,000 ''per annum'', and another act establishing an agricultural credit bank.\n\n==Merriman Premier==\n\nThe elections for the legislative council were held in January 1908 and resulted in a Bond victory. Its supporters, who called themselves the South African party  (the Progressives being renamed \"Unionists\"), obtained 17 seats out of a total of 26. Dr Jameson thereupon resigned (31 January 1908), and a ministry was formed with Mr [[John X. Merriman]] as premier and treasurer, and Mr [[J. W. Sauer]] as minister of public works. Neither of these politicians was a member of the Bond, and both had held office under Cecil Rhodes and W. P. Schreiner. They had, however, been the leading parliamentary exponents of Bond policy for a considerable time. The elections for the legislative assembly followed in April and, partly in consequence of the re-infranchisement of the ex-rebels, resulted in a decisive majority for the Merriman ministry. There were returned 69 members of the South African party, 33 Unionists and 5 Independents, among them the ex-premiers Sir Gordon Sprigg and Mr Schreiner. The change of ministry was not accompanied by any relief in the financial situation. While the country districts remained fairly prosperous (agricultural and pastoral products increasing), the transit trade and the urban industries continued to decline. The depression was accentuated by the financial crisis in [[United States|America]], which affected adversely the wool trade, and in a more marked degree the diamond trade, leading to the partial stoppage of the Kimberley mines. (The \"slump\" in the diamond trade is shown by a comparison of the value of diamonds exported from the Cape in the years 1907 and 1908; in 1907 they were valued at \u00a38,973,148, in 1908 at \u00a34,796,655.) This seriously diminished the revenue returns, and the public accounts for the year 1907 &mdash; 1908 showed a deficit of \u00a3996,000, and a prospective deficit for the ensuing year of an almost equal amount. To balance the budget, Mr Merriman proposed drastic remedies, including the suspension of the sinking fund, the reduction of salaries of all civil servants, and taxes on incomes of \u00a350 per annum. Partly in consequence of the serious economic situation, the renewed movement for the closer union of the various South African colonies, formally initiated by Dr Jameson in 1907, received the support of the Cape parliament. During 1907&mdash;1908 a national convention decided upon unification, and in 1910 the Union of South Africa was established and Cape Colony became \"Cape Province\" therein.\n\n==References==\n* ''The Migrant Farmer in the History of the Cape Colony''.P.J.

In the words of the speech opening the 1905 session of parliament, \"without a considerable development of our agricultural and pastoral resources our position as a self-sustaining colony cannot be assured\". This reliance on its own resources was the more necessary for the Cape because of the keen rivalry of Natal and Delagoa Bay for the carrying trade of the Transvaal. The opening up of backward districts by railways was vigorously pursued, and in other ways great efforts were made to assist agriculture. These efforts to help the country districts met with cordial recognition from the Dutch farmers, and the release, in May 1904, of all rebel prisoners was another step towards reconciliation. On the exclusion of Chinese from the colony the Bond party were also in agreement with the ministry. An education act passed in 1905 established school boards on a popular franchise and provided for the gradual introduction of compulsory education. The cultivation  of friendly relations with the neighbouring colonies was also one of the leading objects of Dr Jameson\u2019s policy. The Bond, on its side, sought to draw closer to ''Het Volk'', the Boer organization in the Transvaal, and similar bodies, and at its 1906 congress, held in March that year at [[Ceres, South Africa|Ceres]], a resolution with that aim was passed, the design being to unify, in accordance with the original conception of the Bond, Dutch sentiment and action throughout South Africa.\n\nNative affairs proved a source of considerable anxiety. In January 1905 an inter-colonial native affairs commission reported on the native question as it affected South Africa as a whole, proposals being made for an alteration of the laws in Cape Colony respecting the franchise exercised by natives. In the opinion of the commission the possession of the franchise by the Cape natives under existing conditions was sure to create in time an intolerable situation, and was an unwise and dangerous thing. (The registration of 1905 showed that there were over 23,000 \"coloured\" voters in the colony.) The commission proposed separate voting by natives only for a fixed number of members of the legislature - the plan adopted in [[New Zealand]] with the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] voters. The privileged position of the Cape native was seen to be an obstacle to the federation of South Africa. The discussion which followed, based partly on the reports that the ministry contemplated disfranchising the natives, led, however, to no immediate results.\n\nAnother disturbing factor in connexion with native affairs was the revolt of the Hottentots and [[Herero people|Herero]]s in German [[South West Africa]]. In 1904 and the following years large numbers of refugees, including some of the most important chiefs, fled into British territory, and charges were made in [[Germany]] that sufficient control over these refugees was not exercised by the Cape government. This trouble, however, came to an end in September 1907. In that month [[Jacob Morenga]], a chief who bad been interned by the colonial authorities, but had escaped and recommenced hostilities against the Germans, was once more on the British side of the frontier and, refusing to surrender, was pursued by the Cape Mounted Police and killed after a smart action. The revolt in the German protectorate had been, nearly a year before the death of Morenga, the indirect occasion of a \"Boer raid\" into Cape Colony. In November 1906 a small party of Transvaal Boers, who had been employed by the Germans against the Hottentots, entered the colony under the leadership of a man named Ferreira, and began raiding farms and forcibly enrolling recruits. Within a week the filibusters were all captured. Ferreira and four companions were tried for murder and convicted, (February 1907), the death sentences being commuted to terms of [[penal servitude]].\n\nAs the result of an inter-colonial conference held in [[Pietermaritzburg]] in the early months of 1906, a new customs convention of a strongly protective character came into force on 1 June 1906. At the same time the rebate on goods from Britain and reciprocating colonies was increased. The session of parliament which sanctioned this change was notable for the attention devoted to irrigation and railway schemes. But one important measure of a political character was passed in 1906, namely an amnesty act. Under its provisions over 7000 ex-rebels, who would otherwise have had no vote at the ensuing general election, were readmitted to the franchise in 1907.\n\nWhile the efforts made to develop the agricultural and mineral resources of the country proved successful, the towns continued to suffer from the [[inflation]] - over-buying, over-building and over-speculation - which marked the war period. As a consequence, imports further declined during 1906&mdash;1907, and receipts being largely dependent on customs the result was a considerably diminished revenue. The accounts for the year ending 30 June 1907 showed a deficit of \u00a3640,455. The decline in revenue, \u00a34,000,000 in four years, while not a true reflection of the economic condition of the country - yearly becoming more self-supporting by the increase in home produce - caused general disquiet and injuriously affected the position of the ministry. In the session of 1907 the opposition in the legislative council brought on a crisis by refusing to grant supplies voted by the lower chamber. Dr Jameson contested the constitutional right of the council so to act, and on his advice the governor dissolved parliament in September 1907. Before its dissolution parliament passed an act imposing a profit tax of 10% on diamond- and copper-mining companies earning over \u00a350,000 ''per annum'', and another act establishing an agricultural credit bank.\n\n==Merriman Premier==\n\nThe elections for the legislative council were held in January 1908 and resulted in a Bond victory. Its supporters, who called themselves the South African party  (the Progressives being renamed \"Unionists\"), obtained 17 seats out of a total of 26. Dr Jameson thereupon resigned (31 January 1908), and a ministry was formed with Mr [[John X. Merriman]] as premier and treasurer, and Mr [[J. W. Sauer]] as minister of public works. Neither of these politicians was a member of the Bond, and both had held office under Cecil Rhodes and W. P. Schreiner. They had, however, been the leading parliamentary exponents of Bond policy for a considerable time. The elections for the legislative assembly followed in April and, partly in consequence of the re-infranchisement of the ex-rebels, resulted in a decisive majority for the Merriman ministry. There were returned 69 members of the South African party, 33 Unionists and 5 Independents, among them the ex-premiers Sir Gordon Sprigg and Mr Schreiner. The change of ministry was not accompanied by any relief in the financial situation. While the country districts remained fairly prosperous (agricultural and pastoral products increasing), the transit trade and the urban industries continued to decline. The depression was accentuated by the financial crisis in [[United States|America]], which affected adversely the wool trade, and in a more marked degree the diamond trade, leading to the partial stoppage of the Kimberley mines. (The \"slump\" in the diamond trade is shown by a comparison of the value of diamonds exported from the Cape in the years 1907 and 1908; in 1907 they were valued at \u00a38,973,148, in 1908 at \u00a34,796,655.) This seriously diminished the revenue returns, and the public accounts for the year 1907 &mdash; 1908 showed a deficit of \u00a3996,000, and a prospective deficit for the ensuing year of an almost equal amount. To balance the budget, Mr Merriman proposed drastic remedies, including the suspension of the sinking fund, the reduction of salaries of all civil servants, and taxes on incomes of \u00a350 per annum. Partly in consequence of the serious economic situation, the renewed movement for the closer union of the various South African colonies, formally initiated by Dr Jameson in 1907, received the support of the Cape parliament. During 1907&mdash;1908 a national convention decided upon unification, and in 1910 the Union of South Africa was established and Cape Colony became \"Cape Province\" therein.\n\n==References==\n* ''The Migrant Farmer in the History of the Cape Colony''.P.J.
