In order to compete with these ships the White Star Line needed to produce a new [[flagship]] which could rival them.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=81\u201386|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref> ''Oceanic'''s maiden voyage came only a few weeks before the death of [[Thomas Henry Ismay]], founder of the White Star Line (officially named the ''Oceanic Steam Navigation Company''). As with White Star's first liner (placed in service in 1871 and bearing the same [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|name]]), this second ''Oceanic'' marked a turning point: the company thenceforth emphasized ships of \"great size and exceptional steadiness,\" aiming to compete on travel comfort rather than high speed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bonsor |first1=N.R.P. |title=North Atlantic Seaway |date=1978|pages=739\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:RMS Oceanic Harland and Wolff.jpg|thumb|left|''Oceanic'' under construction at Harland & Wolff shipyard.]]\n[[File:The Oceanic Ship, Dome (13712273173).jpg|thumb|left|''Oceanic's'' elaborately decorated dome.]]\nTheir new flagship ''Oceanic'' was built at [[Harland and Wolff]]\u2019s Queen's Island yard at [[Belfast]], as was the tradition with White Star Line ships, and her keel was laid down in 1897. She was named after their first successful liner [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|RMS ''Oceanic'']] of 1870, and was to be the first ship to exceed [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']] in length, although not in [[Gross register tonnage|tonnage]]. At 17,272&nbsp;gross&nbsp;tons, the future \"Queen of the Ocean\" cost one million [[pounds sterling]] ({{Inflation|UK|1000000|1899|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and required 1,500 shipwrights to complete. ''Oceanic'' was not however designed to be the fastest ship afloat or compete for the [[Blue Riband]], as it was the White Star Line's policy to focus on size and comfort rather than speed. ''Oceanic'' was designed for a service speed of {{convert|21|kn|}}. She was powered by two four-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[triple expansion engine]]s, which were when constructed the largest of their type in the world, and could produce 28,000 [[ihp]]<ref name=\"Haws\">{{cite book |last1=Haws |first1=Duncan |title=White Star Line (Oceanic Steam Navigation Company) |date=1990 |isbn=0 946378 16 9 |pages=52\u201353}}</ref><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\nIn order to build the ship a new 500 ton overhead [[gantry crane]] had to be constructed at the yard in order to lift the material necessary for the ship's construction. Another innovation was the use of [[hydraulic]] [[riveting machines]], which were used for the first time at Harland and Wolff during her construction.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\n''Oceanic'''s [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was integrated with her superstructure giving her a clean fluid look, this design feature would later be omitted from the next big four White Star ships, ''[[RMS Cedric|Cedric]]'', ''[[RMS Celtic (1901)|Celtic]]'', ''[[RMS Baltic (1903)|Baltic]]'' and ''[[RMS Adriatic (1907)|Adriatic]]'' with their odd but distinguishable 'island' bridges. \"Nothing but the very finest\", was Ismay\u2019s policy toward this new venture.<ref name=hagberg>{{cite web| url=http://darrel-betty-hagberg.com/Genealogy/Hagberg/oceanic.html| title=RMS Oceanic| publisher=Darrel R.

However following the death of the company chairman [[Thomas Ismay]] in November 1899 the order was postponed and then cancelled. Instead the company decided to deploy the resources to produce a set of larger liners which would become the \"[[Big Four (White Star Line)|Big Four]]\" class. The name ''Olympic'' was later bestowed upon the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] of 1910.<ref name=\"Haws\"/><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Colorful Oceanic.jpg|thumb|Old colour postcard of ''Oceanic'']]\n''Oceanic'' was launched on 14 January 1899; an event which was watched by over 50,000 people. She would be the largest and last British liner to be launched in the 19th Century. Following her fitting out and sea trials, she left Belfast for [[Liverpool]] on the 26 August that year, and when she arrived she was opened to the public and press where she was received with great fanfare. She departed Liverpool on her [[maiden voyage]] to [[New York City|New York]] on 6 September, under the command of Captain John G. Cameron. Thomas Ismay had planned to be on board but was by this stage too unwell. She completed the voyage in 6 days 2 hours and 37 minutes at an average speed of 19.57 knots and arrived at New York to a rapturous welcome. One disappointing feature which soon became apparent in service, was the tendency for the ship to experience excessive vibration at full speed, this was due in part to her long and narrow design. To avoid this problem it was soon found necessary to operate her at a service speed of {{convert|19.5|kn|}}, lower than her planned service speed of {{convert|21|kn|}}.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\nThe early years of ''Oceanic's'' career were fairly eventful: In 1900 she was struck by [[lightning]] while at dock at Liverpool and lost the top of her mainmast. On 4 August that year while berthed at New York harbour, she was threatened by a serious fire in a cargo hold of the [[SS Bovic|SS ''Bovic'']] which was docked adjacent to her. Fortunately the fire was brought under control before it could spread to ''Oceanic''.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/> \n\nOn 7 August 1901 in a heavy fog, near [[Tuskar Rock, Ireland]], ''Oceanic'' was involved in a collision with the small [[Waterford Steamship Company]] SS ''Kincora'', sinking the smaller vessel and killing seven.<ref name=hagberg/><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\nOn 18 November 1904, four days out from New York, ''Oceanic'' encountered strong gales, stormy seas and snow, the battering the ship took from the sea stove in two portholes, which allowed a considerable amount of water to enter the ship.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/> \n\nIn 1905, 45 of the ship's firemen [[mutiny|mutinied]] in protest at the unpleasant working conditions in the ship's boiler rooms, which resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of 33 stokers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.titanic-whitestarships.com/Oceanic_2_1899.htm| title=Mutiny Aboard A White Star Line Ship| publisher=Titanic and Other White Star Line Ships| accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/> \n\nIn April 1912, during the departure of {{RMS|Titanic}} from [[Southampton]], ''Oceanic'' became involved in the near collision of ''Titanic'' with {{SS|New York|1888|6}}, when ''Oceanic'' was nearby as ''New York'' broke from her mooring and nearly collided with ''Titanic'', due to the large wake caused by ''Titanic''\u2032s size and speed. A month later, in mid-May 1912, ''Oceanic'' picked up three bodies in one of the [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s left floating in the North Atlantic after ''Titanic'' sank.{{efn|Thomas Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.}} After their retrieval from [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic|Collapsible&nbsp;A]] by ''Oceanic'', the bodies were buried at sea.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n===World War I===\nShortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, ''Oceanic'' was included in a deal with the [[Admiralty]], which made an annual grant toward the maintenance of any ship on the condition that it could be called upon for naval work, during times of war. Such ships were built to particular naval specifications, in the case of ''Oceanic'' so that the [[QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I - IV|4.7 inch guns]] she was to be given could be quickly mounted. \"The greatest liner of her day\" was commissioned into [[Royal Navy|Naval]] service on 8 August 1914 as an [[armed merchant cruiser]].\n\nOn 25 August 1914, the newly designated [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] ''Oceanic'' departed [[Southampton]] on naval service that was to last just two weeks. ''Oceanic'' was to patrol the waters from the North Scottish mainland to the [[Faroe Islands|Faroes]], in particular the area around [[Shetland]]. She was empowered to stop shipping at her Captain\u2019s discretion, and to check cargoes and personnel for any potential German connections. For these duties, she carried [[Royal Marines]] and Captain William Slayter RN was appointed in command. Her former [[Merchant Master]], Captain Henry Smith, with two years' service, remained in the ship with the rank of Commander RNR. Many of the original crew also continued to serve on ''Oceanic''.\n\n====Disaster====\n[[File:WhiteStarLogo.svg|thumb|160px|right]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n''Oceanic'' headed for [[Scapa Flow]] in [[Orkney]], Britain\u2019s main naval anchorage, with easy access to the [[North Sea]] and the [[Atlantic]]. From here she proceeded north to [[Shetland]] travelling continuously on a standard zigzag course as a precaution against being targeted by [[U-boat]]s. This difficult manoeuvring required extremely accurate navigation, especially with such a large vessel. In the event it appears to have been poor navigation, rather than enemy action that was to doom ''Oceanic''.\n \nAn inaccurate fix of their position was made on the night of 7 September by navigator [[David Blair (mariner)|Lieutenant David Blair]] [[RNR]] (previously assigned to, then reassigned from, the {{RMS|Titanic||2}}). While everyone on the bridge thought they were well to the southwest of the Isle of [[Foula]], they were in fact an estimated thirteen to fourteen miles off course and on the wrong side of the island. This put them directly on course for a [[reef]], the notorious [[Shaalds of Foula]], which poses a major threat to shipping, coming within a few feet of the surface, and in calm weather giving no warning sign whatsoever.\n\nCaptain Slayter had retired after his night watch, unaware of the situation, with orders to steer to Foula. Commander Smith took over the morning watch. Having previously disagreed with his naval superior about dodging around the island, he instructed the navigator to plot a course out to sea. Slayter must have felt the course change, as he reappeared on the bridge to countermand Smith's order and made what turned out to be a hasty and ill-informed judgement.\n\nThe ship ran aground on the Shaalds on the morning of 8 September, approximately 2.5 nautical miles (5 km) east of Foula's southern tip. She was wrecked in a flat calm and clear weather. She was the first Allied passenger ship to be lost in the war.\n\n=====Rescue=====\nThe [[Aberdeen]] [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] ''Glenogil'' was the first vessel on the scene, and although she attempted to pull off the massive ship, it proved an impossible task, and with the hull already ruptured, ''Oceanic'' would not have stayed afloat long in open waters.<ref>{{cite web| title = Oceanic| publisher =  The Great Ocean Liners | url = http://www.greatoceanliners.net/oceanic2.html| accessdate = 2008-03-28}}</ref> Other ships in the area were called in to assist in the rescue operation that was to follow. All of the ship's crew transferred to the trawler via the ship's lifeboats and were then ferried to the waiting AMC [[RMS Empress of France (1914)#World War I|HMS ''Alsatian'']], and [[HMS Forward (1904)|HMS ''Forward'']].  [[Charles Lightoller]], the ship's First Officer (and also the most senior officer to survive the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]''), was the last man off, taking the navigation room's clock as a souvenir.\n\nThe 573-ton Admiralty salvage vessel ''Lyons'' was dispatched to the scene hurriedly, and in the words of the [[Laird]] of Foula, Professor [[Ian Holbourn (writer)|Ian S. Holbourn]], writing about the disaster in his book ''The Isle of Foula'':\n\n<blockquote>The launch of the Lyons, a salvage boat which hurried to the scene, was capable of a speed of ten knots, yet was unable to make any headway against the tide although she tried for fifteen minutes. Even then it was not the top of the tide, and the officer in charge reckoned the full tide would be 12&nbsp;knots, he confessed he would not have believed it had he been told.<ref name=holbourn>{{cite book| last= Holbourn| first=Ian Stoughton| authorlink=Ian Holbourn (writer)| title=The Isle of Foula| publisher=Birlinn Ltd| year=2001  | isbn=1-84158-161-5}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCommander Smith is said to have come ashore at the remote island\u2019s tiny pier, and on looking back out to sea toward his stranded ship two miles away, commented that the ship would stay on the reef as a monument and nothing would move it. One of the Foula men, wise to the full power and fury of a Shetland storm, is said to have muttered with a cynicism not unknown in those parts \"I\u2018ll give her two weeks\".<ref name=holbourn/>\n\nRemarkably, following a heavy gale that had persisted throughout the night of 29 September, just two weeks after the incident the islanders discovered the following day that the ship had been entirely swallowed up by the sea, where she remains to this day scattered as she fell apart under the pressure of the seas on the Shaalds.\n\nThe disaster was hushed up at the time, since it was felt that it would have been embarrassing to make public how a world-famous liner had run aground in friendly waters in good weather within a fortnight of beginning its service as a naval vessel. The revelation of such gross incompetence at this early stage of the war would have done nothing for national morale.\n\n=====Courts-martial=====\nLt. Blair was court-martialled at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] in November 1914, when he was found guilty of \"stranding or suffering to be stranded\" HMS ''Oceanic'', and was ordered to be reprimanded. He offered in his defence that he was exonerated by the evidence given by Captain Slayter and Commander Smith that he was under their supervision, and that the stranding was due to abnormal currents.\n\nA similar charge was made against Commander Smith at a second court-martial; the evidence for the prosecution was the same as in the previous case, but witnesses were cross-examined with a view to showing that the position of the accused on ''Oceanic'' was not clearly defined by the naval authorities, and that he was understood to be acting solely in an advisory capacity. He was acquitted the following day, as he was found not to have been in command on 8 September.\n\nCaptain Slayter was also acquitted.\n\n==Salvage==\n[[File:The standing stone that isn't - geograph.org.uk - 566188.jpg|thumb|right|One of the ''Oceanic's'' [[propeller]] blades is preserved in [[Fife]].]]\n\nIn 1924, a salvage company which had been engaged on the scuttled German warships at [[Scapa Flow]] attempted to salvage what remained of the wreck; however they were unsuccessful. In 1973 another attempt was made to salvage parts of the wreck and the propellers for scrap.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A21hcu/200611NavyNewsNov06/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fsn129w.snt129.mail.live.com%2Fdefault.aspx |title= Navy News| issue=628| publisher=United Kingdom Ministry of Defence|date=November 2006|page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last1=Chirnside |first1=Mark |title=Oceanic: White Star's \u2018Ship of the Century\u2019 |date=2018 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud, Glos |isbn=9780750985789|ref=harv }}\n*''The Other Titanic'', Simon Martin (Salvage report, 1980).\n*{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Richard|last2=Spong|first2=Harry|last3=Grover|first3=Tom|title=Armed Merchant Cruisers 1878\u20131945|year=2007|publisher=World Warship Society|location=Windsor, UK|isbn=978-0-9543310-8-5|lastauthoramp=y}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Oceanic (ship, 1899)|RMS ''Oceanic''}}\n* [http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/oceanic2.html ''Oceanic'' on thegreatoceanliners.com]\n*{{cite web| url=http://www.greatships.net/oceanic2.html| publisher=Great Ships| title=Oceanic| accessdate=2008-12-13}}\n*[http://whitestarhistory.com/oceanic2 ''Oceanic'' - at the White Star Line History Website.]\n*[http://www.gjenvick.com/HistoricalBrochures/Steamships-OceanLiners/WhiteStarLine/WhiteStarLineServices/1907/index.html White Star Line Brochure 1907] contains photographs and accommodation descriptions for ''Oceanic'' and other White Star ships.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pryZIsjhmDA YouTube video dedicated to the RMS ''Oceanic'']\n\n{{Largest passenger ships}}\n{{White Star Line ships}}\n{{September 1914 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oceanic (1899)}}\n[[Category:Ships built in Belfast]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean]]\n[[Category:Steamships]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1914]]\n[[Category:Ships of the White Star Line]]\n[[Category:Auxiliary cruisers of the Royal Navy]]\n[[Category:RMS Titanic]]\n[[Category:1899 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Harland and Wolff]]\n", "text_old": "{{Coord|60|07|N|1|58|W|display=title}}\n{{For|other ships of the same name|Oceanic (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2018}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=OCEANIC - Sj\u00f6historiska museet - Fo57172.tif\n|Ship caption= RMS ''Oceanic''\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United Kingdom\n|Ship flag={{shipboxflag|United Kingdom|government}}\n|Ship name=*'''HMS ''Oceanic''''' (1914)\n*RMS ''Oceanic'' (1899-1914)\n|Ship owner=[[White Star Line]]\n|Ship operator=*White Star Line (1899-1914)\n*[[Royal Navy]] (1914)\n|Ship route=[[Liverpool]]/[[Southampton]] to New York\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[Harland and Wolff]], [[Belfast]]\n|Ship yard number=317\n|Ship way number=\n|Ship laid down=1897\n|Ship launched=14 January 1899\n|Ship completed=26 August 1899\n|Ship christened=\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship maiden voyage=6 September 1899\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship registry=\n|Ship fate=Ran aground off, [[Foula]], [[Shetland]], 8 September 1914\n|Ship status=*Superstructure above water salvaged 1923-1924;\n*remaining hull salvaged 1979.\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship tonnage=17,272&nbsp;gross&nbsp;tonnes\n|Ship displacement=\n|Ship length={{convert|704|ft|m|abbr=on}} \n|Ship beam={{convert|68.4|ft|m|abbr=on}} \n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship decks=\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship power=Triple expansion reciprocating engines; 28,000&nbsp;horsepower.\n|Ship propulsion=Twin propeller\n|Ship speed=19&nbsp;knots max 21 kn\n|Ship capacity=*410 First class\n*300 Second class\n*1,000 Third Class.\n|Ship crew=349\n|Ship notes=Funnels: 2   Masts: 3\n}}\n|}\n\n'''RMS ''Oceanic''''' was a [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] [[ocean liner]] built for the [[White Star Line]].

In order to compete with these ships the White Star Line needed to produce a new [[flagship]] which could rival them.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbrech|first1=Richard De|title=Ships of the White Star Line|date=2009|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|pages=81\u201386|ISBN=978 0 7110 3366 5}}</ref> ''Oceanic'''s maiden voyage came only a few weeks before the death of [[Thomas Henry Ismay]], founder of the White Star Line (officially named the ''Oceanic Steam Navigation Company''). As with White Star's first liner (placed in service in 1871 and bearing the same [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|name]]), this second ''Oceanic'' marked a turning point: the company thenceforth emphasized ships of \"great size and exceptional steadiness,\" aiming to compete on travel comfort rather than high speed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bonsor |first1=N.R.P. |title=North Atlantic Seaway |date=1978|pages=739\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:RMS Oceanic Harland and Wolff.jpg|thumb|left|''Oceanic'' under construction at Harland & Wolff shipyard.]]\n[[File:The Oceanic Ship, Dome (13712273173).jpg|thumb|left|''Oceanic's'' elaborately decorated dome.]]\nTheir new flagship ''Oceanic'' was built at [[Harland and Wolff]]\u2019s Queen's Island yard at [[Belfast]], as was the tradition with White Star Line ships, and her keel was laid down in 1897. She was named after their first successful liner [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|RMS ''Oceanic'']] of 1870, and was to be the first ship to exceed [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']] in length, although not in [[Gross register tonnage|tonnage]]. At 17,272&nbsp;gross&nbsp;tons, the future \"Queen of the Ocean\" cost one million [[pounds sterling]] ({{Inflation|UK|1000000|1899|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and required 1,500 shipwrights to complete. ''Oceanic'' was not however designed to be the fastest ship afloat or compete for the [[Blue Riband]], as it was the White Star Line's policy to focus on size and comfort rather than speed. ''Oceanic'' was designed for a service speed of {{convert|21|kn|}}. She was powered by two four-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[triple expansion engine]]s, which were when constructed the largest of their type in the world, and could produce 28,000 [[ihp]]<ref name=\"Haws\">{{cite book |last1=Haws |first1=Duncan |title=White Star Line (Oceanic Steam Navigation Company) |date=1990 |isbn=0 946378 16 9 |pages=52\u201353}}</ref><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\nIn order to build the ship a new 500 ton overhead [[gantry crane]] had to be constructed at the yard in order to lift the material necessary for the ship's construction. Another innovation was the use of [[hydraulic]] [[riveting machines]], which were used for the first time at Harland and Wolff during her construction.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\n''Oceanic'''s [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was integrated with her superstructure giving her a clean fluid look, this design feature would later be omitted from the next big four White Star ships, ''[[RMS Cedric|Cedric]]'', ''[[RMS Celtic (1901)|Celtic]]'', ''[[RMS Baltic (1903)|Baltic]]'' and ''[[RMS Adriatic (1907)|Adriatic]]'' with their odd but distinguishable 'island' bridges. \"Nothing but the very finest\", was Ismay\u2019s policy toward this new venture.<ref name=hagberg>{{cite web| url=http://darrel-betty-hagberg.com/Genealogy/Hagberg/oceanic.html| title=RMS Oceanic| publisher=Darrel R.

However following the death of the company chairman [[Thomas Ismay]] in November 1899 the order was postponed and then cancelled. Instead the company decided to deploy the resources to produce a set of larger liners which would become the \"[[Big Four (White Star Line)|Big Four]]\" class. The name ''Olympic'' was later bestowed upon the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] of 1910.<ref name=\"Haws\"/><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Colorful Oceanic.jpg|thumb|Old colour postcard of ''Oceanic'']]\n''Oceanic'' was launched on 14 January 1899; an event which was watched by over 50,000 people. She would be the largest and last British liner to be launched in the 19th Century. Following her fitting out and sea trials, she left Belfast for [[Liverpool]] on the 26 August that year, and when she arrived she was opened to the public and press where she was received with great fanfare. She departed Liverpool on her [[maiden voyage]] to [[New York City|New York]] on 6 September, under the command of Captain John G. Cameron. Thomas Ismay had planned to be on board but was by this stage too unwell. She completed the voyage in 6 days 2 hours and 37 minutes at an average speed of 19.57 knots and arrived at New York to a rapturous welcome. One disappointing feature which soon became apparent in service, was the tendency for the ship to experience excessive vibration at full speed, this was due in part to her long and narrow design. To avoid this problem it was soon found necessary to operate her at a service speed of {{convert|19.5|kn|}}, lower than her planned service speed of {{convert|21|kn|}}.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\nThe early years of ''Oceanic's'' career were fairly eventful: In 1900 she was struck by [[lightning]] while at dock at Liverpool and lost the top of her mainmast. On 4 August that year while berthed at New York harbour, she was threatened by a serious fire in a cargo hold of the [[SS Bovic|SS ''Bovic'']] which was docked adjacent to her. Fortunately the fire was brought under control before it could spread to ''Oceanic''.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/> \n\nOn 7 August 1901 in a heavy fog, near [[Tuskar Rock, Ireland]], ''Oceanic'' was involved in a collision with the small [[Waterford Steamship Company]] SS ''Kincora'', sinking the smaller vessel and killing seven.<ref name=hagberg/><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/>\n\nOn 18 November 1904, four days out from New York, ''Oceanic'' encountered strong gales, stormy seas and snow, the battering the ship took from the sea stove in two portholes, which allowed a considerable amount of water to enter the ship.<ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/> \n\nIn 1905, 45 of the ship's firemen [[mutiny|mutinied]] in protest at the unpleasant working conditions in the ship's boiler rooms, which resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of 33 stokers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.titanic-whitestarships.com/Oceanic_2_1899.htm| title=Mutiny Aboard A White Star Line Ship| publisher=Titanic and Other White Star Line Ships| accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref><ref name=\"Kerbrech\"/> \n\nIn April 1912, during the departure of {{RMS|Titanic}} from [[Southampton]], ''Oceanic'' became involved in the near collision of ''Titanic'' with {{SS|New York|1888|6}}, when ''Oceanic'' was nearby as ''New York'' broke from her mooring and nearly collided with ''Titanic'', due to the large wake caused by ''Titanic''\u2032s size and speed. A month later, in mid-May 1912, ''Oceanic'' picked up three bodies in one of the [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s left floating in the North Atlantic after ''Titanic'' sank.{{efn|Thomas Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.}} After their retrieval from [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic|Collapsible&nbsp;A]] by ''Oceanic'', the bodies were buried at sea.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n===World War I===\nShortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, ''Oceanic'' was included in a deal with the [[Admiralty]], which made an annual grant toward the maintenance of any ship on the condition that it could be called upon for naval work, during times of war. Such ships were built to particular naval specifications, in the case of ''Oceanic'' so that the [[QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I - IV|4.7 inch guns]] she was to be given could be quickly mounted. \"The greatest liner of her day\" was commissioned into [[Royal Navy|Naval]] service on 8 August 1914 as an [[armed merchant cruiser]].\n\nOn 25 August 1914, the newly designated [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] ''Oceanic'' departed [[Southampton]] on naval service that was to last just two weeks. ''Oceanic'' was to patrol the waters from the North Scottish mainland to the [[Faroe Islands|Faroes]], in particular the area around [[Shetland]]. She was empowered to stop shipping at her Captain\u2019s discretion, and to check cargoes and personnel for any potential German connections. For these duties, she carried [[Royal Marines]] and Captain William Slayter RN was appointed in command. Her former [[Merchant Master]], Captain Henry Smith, with two years' service, remained in the ship with the rank of Commander RNR. Many of the original crew also continued to serve on ''Oceanic''.\n\n====Disaster====\n[[File:WhiteStarLogo.svg|thumb|160px|right]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n''Oceanic'' headed for [[Scapa Flow]] in [[Orkney]], Britain\u2019s main naval anchorage, with easy access to the [[North Sea]] and the [[Atlantic]]. From here she proceeded north to [[Shetland]] travelling continuously on a standard zigzag course as a precaution against being targeted by [[U-boat]]s. This difficult manoeuvring required extremely accurate navigation, especially with such a large vessel. In the event it appears to have been poor navigation, rather than enemy action that was to doom ''Oceanic''.\n \nAn inaccurate fix of their position was made on the night of 7 September by navigator [[David Blair (mariner)|Lieutenant David Blair]] [[RNR]] (previously assigned to, then reassigned from, the {{RMS|Titanic||2}}). While everyone on the bridge thought they were well to the southwest of the Isle of [[Foula]], they were in fact an estimated thirteen to fourteen miles off course and on the wrong side of the island. This put them directly on course for a [[reef]], the notorious [[Shaalds of Foula]], which poses a major threat to shipping, coming within a few feet of the surface, and in calm weather giving no warning sign whatsoever.\n\nCaptain Slayter had retired after his night watch, unaware of the situation, with orders to steer to Foula. Commander Smith took over the morning watch. Having previously disagreed with his naval superior about dodging around the island, he instructed the navigator to plot a course out to sea. Slayter must have felt the course change, as he reappeared on the bridge to countermand Smith's order and made what turned out to be a hasty and ill-informed judgement.\n\nThe ship ran aground on the Shaalds on the morning of 8 September, approximately 2.5 nautical miles (5 km) east of Foula's southern tip. She was wrecked in a flat calm and clear weather. She was the first Allied passenger ship to be lost in the war.\n\n=====Rescue=====\nThe [[Aberdeen]] [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] ''Glenogil'' was the first vessel on the scene, and although she attempted to pull off the massive ship, it proved an impossible task, and with the hull already ruptured, ''Oceanic'' would not have stayed afloat long in open waters.<ref>{{cite web| title = Oceanic| publisher =  The Great Ocean Liners | url = http://www.greatoceanliners.net/oceanic2.html| accessdate = 2008-03-28}}</ref> Other ships in the area were called in to assist in the rescue operation that was to follow. All of the ship's crew transferred to the trawler via the ship's lifeboats and were then ferried to the waiting AMC [[RMS Empress of France (1914)#World War I|HMS ''Alsatian'']], and [[HMS Forward (1904)|HMS ''Forward'']].  [[Charles Lightoller]], the ship's First Officer (and also the most senior officer to survive the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]''), was the last man off, taking the navigation room's clock as a souvenir.\n\nThe 573-ton Admiralty salvage vessel ''Lyons'' was dispatched to the scene hurriedly, and in the words of the [[Laird]] of Foula, Professor [[Ian Holbourn (writer)|Ian S. Holbourn]], writing about the disaster in his book ''The Isle of Foula'':\n\n<blockquote>The launch of the Lyons, a salvage boat which hurried to the scene, was capable of a speed of ten knots, yet was unable to make any headway against the tide although she tried for fifteen minutes. Even then it was not the top of the tide, and the officer in charge reckoned the full tide would be 12&nbsp;knots, he confessed he would not have believed it had he been told.<ref name=holbourn>{{cite book| last= Holbourn| first=Ian Stoughton| authorlink=Ian Holbourn (writer)| title=The Isle of Foula| publisher=Birlinn Ltd| year=2001  | isbn=1-84158-161-5}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCommander Smith is said to have come ashore at the remote island\u2019s tiny pier, and on looking back out to sea toward his stranded ship two miles away, commented that the ship would stay on the reef as a monument and nothing would move it. One of the Foula men, wise to the full power and fury of a Shetland storm, is said to have muttered with a cynicism not unknown in those parts \"I\u2018ll give her two weeks\".<ref name=holbourn/>\n\nRemarkably, following a heavy gale that had persisted throughout the night of 29 September, just two weeks after the incident the islanders discovered the following day that the ship had been entirely swallowed up by the sea, where she remains to this day scattered as she fell apart under the pressure of the seas on the Shaalds.\n\nThe disaster was hushed up at the time, since it was felt that it would have been embarrassing to make public how a world-famous liner had run aground in friendly waters in good weather within a fortnight of beginning its service as a naval vessel. The revelation of such gross incompetence at this early stage of the war would have done nothing for national morale.\n\n=====Courts-martial=====\nLt. Blair was court-martialled at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] in November 1914, when he was found guilty of \"stranding or suffering to be stranded\" HMS ''Oceanic'', and was ordered to be reprimanded. He offered in his defence that he was exonerated by the evidence given by Captain Slayter and Commander Smith that he was under their supervision, and that the stranding was due to abnormal currents.\n\nA similar charge was made against Commander Smith at a second court-martial; the evidence for the prosecution was the same as in the previous case, but witnesses were cross-examined with a view to showing that the position of the accused on ''Oceanic'' was not clearly defined by the naval authorities, and that he was understood to be acting solely in an advisory capacity. He was acquitted the following day, as he was found not to have been in command on 8 September.\n\nCaptain Slayter was also acquitted.\n\n==Salvage==\n[[File:The standing stone that isn't - geograph.org.uk - 566188.jpg|thumb|right|One of the ''Oceanic's'' [[propeller]] blades is preserved in [[Fife]].]]\nIn 1924, a salvage company which had been engaged on the scuttled German warships at [[Scapa Flow]] attempted to salvage what remained of the wreck however they were unsuccessful. In 1973 another attempt was made to salvage parts of the wreck and the propellers for scrap.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A21hcu/200611NavyNewsNov06/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fsn129w.snt129.mail.live.com%2Fdefault.aspx |title= Navy News| issue=628| publisher=United Kingdom Ministry of Defence|date=November 2006|page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last1=Chirnside |first1=Mark |title=Oceanic: White Star's \u2018Ship of the Century\u2019 |date=2018 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud, Glos |isbn=9780750985789|ref=harv }}\n*''The Other Titanic'', Simon Martin (Salvage report, 1980).\n*{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Richard|last2=Spong|first2=Harry|last3=Grover|first3=Tom|title=Armed Merchant Cruisers 1878\u20131945|year=2007|publisher=World Warship Society|location=Windsor, UK|isbn=978-0-9543310-8-5|lastauthoramp=y}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Oceanic (ship, 1899)|RMS ''Oceanic''}}\n* [http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/oceanic2.html ''Oceanic'' on thegreatoceanliners.com]\n*{{cite web| url=http://www.greatships.net/oceanic2.html| publisher=Great Ships| title=Oceanic| accessdate=2008-12-13}}\n*[http://whitestarhistory.com/oceanic2 ''Oceanic'' - at the White Star Line History Website.]\n*[http://www.gjenvick.com/HistoricalBrochures/Steamships-OceanLiners/WhiteStarLine/WhiteStarLineServices/1907/index.html White Star Line Brochure 1907] contains photographs and accommodation descriptions for ''Oceanic'' and other White Star ships.\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pryZIsjhmDA YouTube video dedicated to the RMS ''Oceanic'']\n\n{{Largest passenger ships}}\n{{White Star Line ships}}\n{{September 1914 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oceanic (1899)}}\n[[Category:Ships built in Belfast]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean]]\n[[Category:Steamships]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1914]]\n[[Category:Ships of the White Star Line]]\n[[Category:Auxiliary cruisers of the Royal Navy]]\n[[Category:RMS Titanic]]\n[[Category:1899 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Harland and Wolff]]\n", "name_user": "FeanorStar7", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSalvage", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Oceanic_(1899)"}

This is done in a joint sitting of the upper and lower house (except for [[Queensland]], which has a unicameral parliament).  In the event that the state parliament is not in session, the [[Governors of the Australian states|Governor of the state]] (acting on the advice of the state's [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]]) may appoint a replacement senator, but such an appointment lapses if it is not confirmed by a joint sitting of the parliament within 14 days.\n\nPrior to 29 July 1977, the filing of casual vacancies was complex. While senators were elected for a six-year term, people appointed to a casual vacancy only held office until the earlier of the next election for the House of Representatives or the Senate, at which the vacancy would be filled by the electors of the relevant state.<ref name=\"Evans vacancy\">{{cite web |author=Evans, H |author-link1=Harry Evans (Australian Senate clerk) |title=Filling Casual Vacancies before 1977 |work=The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate, Volume 3 |url=http://biography.senate.gov.au/wp-content/docs/filling_casual_vacancies_before_1977.pdf |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref> It was also an established convention that the state parliament choose (or the governor appoint) a replacement from the same [[political party]] as their predecessor, however this convention was not always followed.{{refn|group=n|name=Convention|Of the 66 appointments to 1977, 12 (18%) were from a different party, [[John Shannon (Australian politician)|John Shannon]] (1912), [[John Earle (Australian politician)|John Earle]] (1917); [[Edward Mulcahy (Australian politician)|Edward Mulcahy]] (1919), [[John MacDonald (Australian politician)|John MacDonald]] (1922), [[Henry Barwell|Sir Henry Barwell]] (1925), [[John Verran]] (1927), [[Harry Kneebone]] (1931), [[Patrick Mooney (Australian politician)|Patrick Mooney]] (1931), [[Philip McBride]] (1937), [[Alexander Fraser (Australian politician)|Alexander Fraser]] (1946), [[Cleaver Bunton]], (1975) and [[Albert Field]], (1975).}}\n\nAs a result of the [[Australian referendum, 1977 (Senate Casual Vacancies)|1977 referendum]]:<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A01720 ''Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies)'' Act 1977 (Cth)].</ref>\n*a state legislature must replace a senator with a member of the same political party, and\n*the new senator's term continues until the end of the original senator's term.\n\n===Territories===\nReplacement senators for the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) or the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) are chosen by the relevant territory legislature, under s.44 of the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]''.  Where the legislature is not in session, the choice is made by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory|Administrator of the NT]] (acting on the advice of the territory's [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]]) or the [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory|Chief Minister of the ACT]]. The procedure has been in use in the ACT since 1989 and in NT since 1980.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, replacement senators in the ACT were chosen by a joint sitting of both houses of the Federal Parliament, under s.9 of the ''Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973''.

While senators were elected for a six-year term, people appointed to a casual vacancy only held office until the earlier of the next election for the House of Representatives or the Senate, at which the vacancy would be filled by the electors of the relevant state.<ref name=\"Evans vacancy\">{{cite web |author=Evans, H |author-link1=Harry Evans (Australian Senate clerk) |title=Filling Casual Vacancies before 1977 |work=The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate, Volume 3 |url=http://biography.senate.gov.au/wp-content/docs/filling_casual_vacancies_before_1977.pdf |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref> It was also an established convention that the state parliament choose (or the governor appoint) a replacement from the same [[political party]] as their predecessor, however this convention was not always followed.{{refn|group=n|name=Convention|Of the 66 appointments to 1977, 12 (18%) were from a different party, [[John Shannon (Australian politician)|John Shannon]] (1912), [[John Earle (Australian politician)|John Earle]] (1917); [[Edward Mulcahy (Australian politician)|Edward Mulcahy]] (1919), [[John MacDonald (Australian politician)|John MacDonald]] (1922), [[Henry Barwell|Sir Henry Barwell]] (1925), [[John Verran]] (1927), [[Harry Kneebone]] (1931), [[Patrick Mooney (Australian politician)|Patrick Mooney]] (1931), [[Philip McBride]] (1937), [[Alexander Fraser (Australian politician)|Alexander Fraser]] (1946), [[Cleaver Bunton]], (1975) and [[Albert Field]], (1975).}}\n\nAs a result of the [[Australian referendum, 1977 (Senate Casual Vacancies)|1977 referendum]]:<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A01720 ''Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies)'' Act 1977 (Cth)].</ref>\n*a state legislature must replace a senator with a member of the same political party, and\n*the new senator's term continues until the end of the original senator's term.\n\n===Territories===\nReplacement senators for the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) or the [[Northern Territory]] (NT) are chosen by the relevant territory legislature, under s.44 of the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]''.

The procedure has been in use in the ACT since 1989 and in NT since 1980.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, replacement senators in the ACT were chosen by a joint sitting of both houses of the Federal Parliament, under s.9 of the ''Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973''.

{"title_page": "Fredrique Eleonore Baptiste", "text_new": "'''Fredrique Eleonore Baptiste''' (died 27 July 1827), was a Swedish stage actress and playwright active in Finland.  She belonged to the star attractions of the Finnish theater in the early 19th-century, when theater in Finland was performed by travelling Swedish language theaters. Her plays where successful among travelling theater companies in both Finland and Sweden during the 19th-century.\n\n==Family==\nHer parentage is unknown. According to one theory, she was related to [[Marie Louise Baptiste]]. She was first married to the actor C. H. Smedberg and, after having [[divorce]]d him, to the musician Johan Gustaf Lemke (1790-1825), who in 1824-25 managed the [[Bonuvier Theatre|\u00c5bo theatre house]].\n\n==Stage career==\nBaptiste made her stage debut as a member of the theatre company of Anton Olivier Hoflund in the role of Carolina in ''Den f\u00f6rsonade fadern'' by Lindegren, in [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] on 1 December 1797. Her main career, however, took place in Finland, where theatre was at the time performed by travelling theatre companies from Sweden. She is noted to have performed in [[\u00c5bo]] in 1809, and the following years, she was engaged at the theatre companies of [[Margareta Seuerling]], [[Karl Gustav Bonuvier]] and [[Anders Peter Berggr\u00e9n]].\n\nBaptiste was a star attraction of theatre in Finland in the early 19th-century. A contemporary wrote about her stage career in Finland: \n:\"...all men at the time where quite taken with her, and her company had such an appeal even backstage, that when a major Blom one theatre evening in Kuopio wentured upon the stage, he found himself offering sweets [to her surrounding guests] right until the time the curtain was to be raised.\"<ref>Birger Sch\u00f6ldstr\u00f6m , Seuerling och hans \"com\u00e6dietroupp\".

She translated and reworked old plays, as well as wrote original plays. \nHer plays where successful in contemporary Sweden and Finland, mainly in travelling theatre companies. She seem to have been active as a playwright prior to her career as an actor. Her play ''Den unga enkan'' ('Young Widow') was given 28 times on the [[Stenborg Theatre]] in Stockholm in 1794-98. Her most successful plays was reportedly ''Hugo von Hochberg eller Den \u00e4dla uppoffringen'' ('Hugo von Hochberg or The Noble Sacrifice'), which had its premiere in \u00c5bo in 1819, became very popular and frequently performed until the mid 19th-century by travelling Swedish theatre companies in Sweden and Finland such as those of [[Karl Gustav Bonuvier]], [[Anders Peter Berggr\u00e9n]], [[Josef August Lambert]], [[Erasmus Petter Sj\u00f6vall]] and [[Erik Wilhelm Djurstr\u00f6m]].<ref>Birger Sch\u00f6ldstr\u00f6m , Seuerling och hans \"com\u00e6dietroupp\".
