This also marked the first time two players from the same side scored [[List of A-League hat-tricks|hat-tricks]] in one game ([[Sergio van Dijk]] and [[Marcos Flores]]), and matched the all-time highest match aggregate score of 9 goals scored in one match.\n\nAdelaide finished the season by winning 2\u20131 at [[Adelaide Oval]] against [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] in front of 21,038 spectators&nbsp;\u2013 the club's largest crowd of the season. This ensured the club third place in overall standings at the end of the season, and hosting rights for at least the first week of the knock-out [[2010\u201311 A-League#Finals series|Finals Series]]. Adelaide United went on to defeat [[Wellington Phoenix FC|Wellington Phoenix]] in the first week of the Finals under torrential rain, but succumbed to [[Gold Coast United FC|Gold Coast United]] in the second week and were knocked out of the competition on the back of a 2\u20133 home loss.\n\nOff-season transfers marked the departure of Captain [[Travis Dodd]], long serving players [[Lucas Pantelis]] and [[Robert Cornthwaite (footballer)|Robert Cornthwaite]], and of fan favourites [[Mathew Leckie]] and [[Marcos Flores]] to overseas clubs. In a coup for the club and the [[A-League]], Rini Coolen managed to secure the signatures of [[Australia national association football team|Socceroos]] [[Bruce Djite]], [[Jonathan McKain|Jon McKain]] and [[Dario Vido\u0161i\u0107]]; with the latter being offered the Australian marquee player status at the club for the season.\n\nOn 18 December 2011 it was announced that head coach [[Rini Coolen]] had been sacked and replaced by former coach [[John Kosmina]] as caretaker coach for the rest of the season, including the AFC Champions League group stage of 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.a-league.com.au/article/coolen-out-kosmina-in/wou33auqy6wr1mbu1tr970isc |title=Coolen out, Kosmina in |date=19 December 2011 |website=A-League.com.au |access-date=26 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908063800/http://www.a-league.com.au/article/coolen-out-kosmina-in/wou33auqy6wr1mbu1tr970isc |archive-date=8 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> As part of Kosmina's takeover of the head coaching position, Eugene Galekovi\u0107 was named club captain on 28 December 2011, replacing Jon McKain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Galekovic takes over as Reds skipper |date=28 December 2011 |publisher=Football Federation Australia |url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/galekovic-takes-over-as-reds-skipper/43927 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731115017/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/galekovic-takes-over-as-reds-skipper/43927 |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 July 2012 |work=A-League |accessdate=28 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\nTheir fourth appearance in the competition&nbsp;\u2013 more times than any other Australian club&nbsp;\u2013 Adelaide qualified for the [[2012 AFC Champions League]] playoff round by finishing third in the [[2010\u201311 A-League]]. They were placed in Group E, quickly dubbed the 'Group of Death' by numerous commentators, alongside [[FC Bunyodkor|Bunyodkor]], [[Gamba Osaka]] and [[Pohang Steelers]]. Adelaide qualified through to the Round of 16 for a third time and then went on to qualify for the quarter finals with a 1\u20130 win at home against Nagoya Grampus.\n\nAdelaide faced Bunyodkor in the quarter-finals. Adelaide surrendered a 2\u20130 lead at home, with Bunyodkor clawing back to end 2\u20132. The return leg in Tashkent was again locked at 2\u20132 after 90 minutes of play, requiring the game to go to extra time and possible penalties thereafter. Despite an [[Iain Ramsay]] goal in the third minute to give Adelaide the lead, Bunyodkor eventually eliminated Adelaide by scoring in [[Overtime (sports)|added extra time]]. Adelaide ended the match with nine men, having [[Iain Fyfe]] and [[Fabian Barbiero]] both sent off after receiving two yellow cards.\n\nAdelaide United's 2012\u201313 season was John Kosmina's first full season as permanent coach since being appointed in a caretaker role from Rini Coolen in December 2011. The season was also Kosmina's first in charge at Adelaide since the 2006\u201307 season. John Kosmina had expressed his desire to the club for a two-year extension to his contract, but rumours publicly emerged of assistant coach Michael Valkanis being offered a contract extension, but not Kosmina. The coach resigned shortly thereafter. Valkanis was appointed as interim coach until the end of the season, with former [[Adelaide City FC|Adelaide City]] player [[Sergio Melta]] being appointed as his assistant.\n\nThe Reds finished the A-League season fourth but were knocked out of Championship contention by Brisbane Roar 2\u20131 in an elimination final.\n\nOn 30 April 2013, [[Josep Gombau]] signed a two-season deal as coach, arriving at the club in July 2013.<ref name=\"aufc-newcoach\">{{cite web | url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/adelaideunited/news-display/Gombau-to-coach-Adelaide-United-FC/66320 | title=Gombau to coach Adelaide United FC | publisher=Adelaide United Football Club | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=24 July 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014102521/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/adelaideunited/news-display/Gombau-to-coach-Adelaide-United-FC/66320 | archivedate=14 October 2013}}</ref> In the winter transfer window, Gombau was quick to add Spanish flavour into the squad.

Sergio van Dijk was transferred to [[Persib Bandung]] and Dario Vido\u0161i\u0107 to [[FC Sion|Sion]] for a reported $700,000 transfer fee.\n\nThe Reds had a shaky start to their season under new manager Gombau. They had only a single win in their first nine games for the season and early calls started for the club to show the door to the new man in charge. Gombau quickly changed the club's fortunes, getting his second win in round 10 against the Central Coast Mariners, with a 4\u20130 result. The team continued this form to finish sixth on the table after the 27 home-and-away games, which let them into the finals by two points. Adelaide's season was ended by Central Coast in the elimination final, losing 1\u20130.\n\nThe Reds' highest attendance in the 2013\u201314 season was 16,504 in the round 2 clash with Melbourne Victory at Hindmarsh Stadium which ended in a 2\u20132 draw.\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n|  GK_nat = Australia|  GK = [[Eugene Galekovic|Galekovic (C)]]\n| RCB_nat = Australia| RCB = [[Dylan McGowan|McGowan]]\n| LCB_nat = Australia| LCB = [[Nigel Boogaard|Boogaard]]\n| RB_nat  = Australia|  RB = [[Michael Marrone (footballer)|Marrone]]\n| LB_nat  = Australia|  LB = [[Tarek Elrich|Elrich]]\n| CM_nat  = Spain|  CM = [[Isa\u00edas S\u00e1nchez|Isa\u00edas]]\n| RCM_nat = Australia| RCM = [[James Jeggo|Jeggo]]\n| LCM_nat = Argentina| LCM = [[Marcelo Carrusca|Carrusca]]\n| LW_nat  = Spain|  LW = [[Sergio Cirio|Cirio]]\n| RW_nat  = Australia|  RW = [[Awer Mabil|Mabil]]\n| CF_nat  = Australia|  CF = [[Bruce Djite|Djite]]\n| caption = [[2014 FFA Cup Final]] starting lineup Adelaide United 1 \u2013 0 Perth Glory\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theffacup.com.au/matchcentre/Adelaide-United-v-Perth-Glory/786794#widget-match-day-tabs |title=Adelaide United 1 \u2013 0 Perth Glory FFA Cup Final |publisher=theffacup.com.au.

Originally, the away strip was predominantly white, with red sleeves and yellow trim however in 2009 the club launched a predominantly black 'clash' strip.\n\nThe launch of the new national league also saw Adelaide launch a new badge; while keeping a similar look and feel as its predecessor the new badge takes the form of more traditional football badge with its shield like border.\n\nAdelaide United is most commonly referred to as \"The Reds\" because of their predominantly red playing kit. In February 2009 the club's head coach, Aurelio Vidmar referred to the City of Adelaide as a \"Pissant Town\" after suffering a heartbreaking loss. The club's supporters eventually utilised the name \"Pissants\" as a term of endearment and it became an unofficial nickname of the club between its supporters.\n\n===Kit suppliers and shirt

The shirt was mainly red with a large yellow stripe down both sleeves with blue being used for the short colour and the stripe running down each side of the top. The badge also uses the state colours in a stylised swoosh, above what appears to be a football made with the [[Southern Cross]], as opposed to the traditional hexagonal panels of a football.

United's kit has moved towards a predominately all-red kit, both top and shorts, with black trim. Originally, the away strip was predominantly white, with red sleeves and yellow trim however in 2009 the club launched a predominantly black 'clash' strip.\n\nThe launch of the new national league also saw Adelaide launch a new badge; while keeping a similar look and feel as its predecessor the new badge takes the form of more traditional football badge with its shield like border.\n\nAdelaide United is most commonly referred to as \"The Reds\" because of their predominantly red playing kit. In February 2009 the club's head coach, Aurelio Vidmar referred to the City of Adelaide as a \"Pissant Town\" after suffering a heartbreaking loss. The club's supporters eventually utilised the name \"Pissants\" as a term of endearment and it became an unofficial nickname of the club between its supporters.\n\n===Kit suppliers and shirt

After killing them, rituals of respect are organized. <br />\n[[File:Vad\u00e1szat1.jpg|alt=|right|249x249px]]\n[[File:Vad\u00e1szat3.jpg|232x232px|Vad\u00e1szat3]]\n\n== '''Sources:''' ==\n\n* Interviewing the local government, citizens and hunters\n* <nowiki>http://legnagyobbkonyv.hu</nowiki>\n* <nowiki>https://keptar.oszk.hu/html/kepoldal/index.phtml?id=31570</nowiki>\n* <nowiki>http://www.tirek.hu/lap/szinpetri/cikk/mutat/bekoszonto/</nowiki>\n{{Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County]]\n\n\n{{Borsod-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Heading with bold", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szinpetri"}

The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 4 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1952]], with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship, tied the [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins, and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1963]], Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131 and set a new [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins. Denes retired after the [[1967 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1967]] season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between [[1970 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1970]] and [[1980 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1980]]. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn [[1973 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1973]], the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131, setting a new [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins that still stands. In [[1975 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1975]], the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, [[1978 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1978]] and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In [[1987 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1987]] and [[1988 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1988]] Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC [[2000 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2000]], Gateway [[2002 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2002]]) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in [[1993 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1993]] before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 and returned to the [[1997 NCAA Division I-AA football season|NCAA Playoffs]] in [[1997 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1997]] behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart, which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2007 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2007]], the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in [[2011 WKU Hilltoppers football team|2011]], a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, [[2012 WKU Hilltoppers football team|2012]], that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 4 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1952]], with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship, tied the [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins, and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1963]], Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131 and set a new [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins. Denes retired after the [[1967 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1967]] season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between [[1970 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1970]] and [[1980 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1980]]. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn [[1973 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1973]], the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131, setting a new [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins that still stands. In [[1975 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1975]], the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, [[1978 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1978]] and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In [[1987 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1987]] and [[1988 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1988]] Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC [[2000 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2000]], Gateway [[2002 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2002]]) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in [[1993 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1993]] before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 and returned to the [[1997 NCAA Division I-AA football season|NCAA Playoffs]] in [[1997 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1997]] behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart, which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2007 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2007]], the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in [[2011 WKU Hilltoppers football team|2011]], a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game.

The name comes from the fact that the two universities are separated by about 100 miles.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |Games played\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |First meeting\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |Last meeting\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |Win streak\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |Wins\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |Losses\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |Ties\n!style=\"background:#B01E24; color:white;\" |Win %\n|-\n|67\n|1914, MTSU 47\u20130\n|2018, MTSU 29\u201310\n|3, WKU (2015\u20132017)\n|32\n|34\n|1\n|.492\n|}\n\n===Eastern Kentucky===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bluegrass}}\nWKY's has an inactive rivalry with [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. The two programs have met 84 times in football since 1914. The rivalry has taken a hiatus since leaving EKU behind as WKU transitioned to FBS in 2009.
