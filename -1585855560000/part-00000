Their home ground is [[London Road Stadium]] and the club nickname is The Posh. Their highest finishing position in the Football League was 10th in the Championship. Peterborough won the [[2013\u201314 Football League Trophy]].\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=September 2019}}\n{{Split section|History of Peterborough United F.C.|date=September 2019}}\n\n===1934\u20131990===\nPeterborough United formed in 1934 at Peterborough's Angel Hotel to provide a replacement for [[Peterborough & Fletton United F.C.|Peterborough & Fletton United]], who had folded two years previously.<ref name=clubhistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.theposh.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10427~938455,00.html |title=Club History |publisher=Peterborough United F.C. |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006185904/http://www.theposh.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10427~938455,00.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 }}</ref> The Posh played in the old [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]]. They [[Midland Football League (1889)#Champions|won]] this league on six occasions, including five seasons in a row from 1956 to 1960. The Posh were [[Re-election (Football League)|elected]] to [[The Football League]] for the beginning of the [[1960-61 in English football|1960\u201361]] season, winning [[Football League Division Four|Division Four]].<ref name=fchd>{{fchd|id=PETERBOU|name=Peterborough United}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Fourth Division Championship success in 1960\u201361, The Posh spent seven seasons in the 3rd Division. They reached the quarter-finals of the [[1964\u201365 FA Cup]], beating [[Arsenal F. C.|Arsenal]] and [[Swansea City A. F. C.|Swansea Town]] along the way before going out to [[Chelsea F. C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1965.htm|title=1965|publisher=}}</ref> They were relegated back to the 4th Division for financial irregularities in the summer of 1968. The club took six seasons to return to Division 3, winning the 4th Division championship.\n\nIn 1977\u201378 the club threatened to go one better until they narrowly missed out on promotion to Division 2 when they drew the last game of the season at champions [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] (0\u20130) when a win was needed to go up. The game was notable for the fact that over 2,000 [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] fans travelled to Wrexham to watch the game and cheer on the home side \u2013 Preston were the club who went up because Peterborough did not win. The Wrexham defeat cast a long shadow over the club and it fell into a long decline. Relegation followed in 1979 and Posh subsequently spent 12 years back in the 4th division. The 1980s was a long story of mismanagement and false dawns, punctuated by the odd cup run.\n\n===1991\u20132000===\nIn January 1991, [[Chris Turner (footballer born 1951)|Chris Turner]], who had played in the 1974 Fourth division championship team took over as manager and the team embarked on a run of 13 unbeaten games that propelled them into the top four. Six players were signed on transfer deadline day, which at the time was a record for the number of players signed by one club on a single day. On the final day of the season, Posh travelled to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] needing a win to seal promotion. Despite going two goals down in the first ten minutes, the team rallied and drew level with goals from David Robinson and [[George Berry (footballer)|George Berry]]. However, Posh's closest rivals, [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] lost at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and promotion was achieved.\n\n[[File:PeterboroughUnitedFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Chart of table positions for Peterborough since joining the Football League.]]The following season arguably remains the most successful in the club's history. After an inconsistent start the team hit form during the Autumn when they knocked [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] out of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. The reward was a home tie with a [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] team containing [[Bruce Grobbelaar]], [[Jan M\u00f8lby]], [[Steve McManaman]], [[Dean Saunders]] and [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]]. [[Garry Kimble]] scored the only goal after 19 minutes prompting wild celebrations and a place in the quarter-finals. In the league, the team went from strength to strength and surged up the table. [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] ended the League Cup run after a replay and there was further disappointment when the team missed out on a trip to Wembley in the [[Football League Trophy]] when they lost to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] over two legs in the area final.\n\nProgress continued in the league and a play-off place was clinched on the last day of the season despite a 1\u20130 defeat to champions [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]. The following week, [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] came to London Road for the first leg of the Semi-final. Captain Mick Halsall's last minute equaliser levelled the score at 2\u20132. Three days later, the supporters travelled north more in hope than expectation but they were rewarded when the team came from a goal down to win 2\u20131 with [[Worrell Sterling]] and [[Steve Cooper (footballer, born 1964)|Steve Cooper]] scoring the goals. On 24 May 1992, Peterborough United played at Wembley for the first time, against [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the Third Division playoff final. With Posh winning 2\u20131 and gaining promotion to the new First division. <!-- Why did they?

Their home ground is [[London Road Stadium]] and the club nickname is The Posh. Their highest finishing position in the Football League was 10th in the Championship. Peterborough won the [[2013\u201314 Football League Trophy]].\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=September 2019}}\n{{Split section|History of Peterborough United F.C.|date=September 2019}}\n\n===1934-1990===\nPeterborough United formed in 1934 at Peterborough's Angel Hotel to provide a replacement for [[Peterborough & Fletton United F.C.|Peterborough & Fletton United]], who had folded two years previously.<ref name=clubhistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.theposh.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10427~938455,00.html |title=Club History |publisher=Peterborough United F.C. |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006185904/http://www.theposh.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10427~938455,00.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 }}</ref> The Posh played in the old [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]]. They [[Midland Football League (1889)#Champions|won]] this league on six occasions, including five seasons in a row from 1956 to 1960. The Posh were [[Re-election (Football League)|elected]] to [[The Football League]] for the beginning of the [[1960-61 in English football|1960\u201361]] season, winning [[Football League Division Four|Division Four]].<ref name=fchd>{{fchd|id=PETERBOU|name=Peterborough United}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Fourth Division Championship success in 1960\u201361, The Posh spent seven seasons in the 3rd Division. They reached the quarter-finals of the [[1964\u201365 FA Cup]], beating [[Arsenal F. C.|Arsenal]] and [[Swansea City A. F. C.|Swansea Town]] along the way before going out to [[Chelsea F. C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1965.htm|title=1965|publisher=}}</ref> They were relegated back to the 4th Division for financial irregularities in the summer of 1968. The club took six seasons to return to Division 3, winning the 4th Division championship.\n\nIn 1977\u201378 the club threatened to go one better until they narrowly missed out on promotion to Division 2 when they drew the last game of the season at champions [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] (0\u20130) when a win was needed to go up. The game was notable for the fact that over 2,000 [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] fans travelled to Wrexham to watch the game and cheer on the home side \u2013 Preston were the club who went up because Peterborough did not win. The Wrexham defeat cast a long shadow over the club and it fell into a long decline. Relegation followed in 1979 and Posh subsequently spent 12 years back in the 4th division. The 1980s was a long story of mismanagement and false dawns, punctuated by the odd cup run.\n\n===1991-2000===\nIn January 1991, [[Chris Turner (footballer born 1951)|Chris Turner]], who had played in the 1974 Fourth division championship team took over as manager and the team embarked on a run of 13 unbeaten games that propelled them into the top four. Six players were signed on transfer deadline day, which at the time was a record for the number of players signed by one club on a single day. On the final day of the season, Posh travelled to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] needing a win to seal promotion. Despite going two goals down in the first ten minutes, the team rallied and drew level with goals from David Robinson and [[George Berry (footballer)|George Berry]].

Along with the transport role, the A400M can perform [[aerial refuelling]] and [[medical evacuation]] when fitted with appropriate equipment.\n\nThe A400M's [[maiden flight]], originally planned for 2008, took place on 11 December 2009 from [[Seville]], Spain. Between 2009 and 2010, the A400M faced cancellation as a result of development programme delays and cost overruns; however, the customer nations chose to maintain their support for the project. A total of 174 A400M aircraft had been ordered by eight nations by July 2011. In March 2013, the A400M received [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) certification. The first aircraft was delivered to the French Air Force in August 2013.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe project has its origins in the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, which was established during 1982 by as a [[joint venture]] between [[A\u00e9rospatiale]], [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] (MBB) with the goal of developing a replacement for both the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] and [[Transall C-160]].<ref name=Hewson>Hewson, R. ''The Vital Guide to Military Aircraft'', 2nd ed. Airlife Press, Ltd. 2001.</ref> Varying requirements and the complications of international politics meant that progress on the initiative was slow. During 1989, Lockheed decided to withdraw from the grouping; it went on to independently develop an upgraded Hercules, the [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]]. With the addition of [[Alenia Aermacchi|Alenia]] of Italy and [[EADS CASA|CASA]] of Spain, the FIMA group became [[Euroflag]].\n\nSince no existing turboprop engine in the western world was powerful enough to reach the projected cruise speed of Mach 0.72, a new engine design was required. Originally, the SNECMA M138 turboprop (based on the [[Snecma M88|M88 core]]) was selected, but this powerplant was found to be incapable of satisfying the requirements.<ref>''A400M: engines.

Retrieved: 15 May 2010.</ref> The A400M is positioned, in terms of size, between the C-130 and the [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]]; it can carry heavier loads than the C-130 and is able to use rough landing strips. Along with the transport role, the A400M can perform [[aerial refuelling]] and [[medical evacuation]] when fitted with appropriate equipment.\n\nThe A400M's [[maiden flight]], originally planned for 2008, took place on 11 December 2009 from [[Seville]], Spain. Between 2009 and 2010, the A400M faced cancellation as a result of development programme delays and cost overruns; however, the customer nations chose to maintain their support for the project. A total of 174 A400M aircraft had been ordered by eight nations by July 2011. In March 2013, the A400M received [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) certification. The first aircraft was delivered to the French Air Force in August 2013.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe project has its origins in the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, which was established during 1982 by as a [[joint venture]] between [[A\u00e9rospatiale]], [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] (MBB) with the goal of developing a replacement for both the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] and [[Transall C-160]].<ref name=Hewson>Hewson, R. ''The Vital Guide to Military Aircraft'', 2nd ed. Airlife Press, Ltd. 2001.</ref> Varying requirements and the complications of international politics meant that progress on the initiative was slow. During 1989, Lockheed decided to withdraw from the grouping; it went on to independently develop an upgraded Hercules, the [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]]. With the addition of [[Alenia Aermacchi|Alenia]] of Italy and [[EADS CASA|CASA]] of Spain, the FIMA group became [[Euroflag]].\n\nSince no existing turboprop engine in the western world was powerful enough to reach the projected cruise speed of Mach 0.72, a new engine design was required. Originally, the SNECMA M138 turboprop (based on the [[Snecma M88|M88 core]]) was selected, but this powerplant was found to be incapable of satisfying the requirements.<ref>''A400M: engines.

{"title_page": "Figure (horse)", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}}\n[[Image:American Morgan Horse.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Horse and rider costumed to resemble Figure and Justin Morgan.]]'''Figure''' was a small [[bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion (horse)|stallion]] owned by [[Justin Morgan]]; he became the [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sire]] of the [[Morgan horse]] breed.\n\n==Early years==\nThe stallion was born in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1789. The small, dark colt is  believed to have been sired by an English [[Thoroughbred]] [[stallion (horse)|stallion]] named \"True Briton\", also known as \"Beautiful Bay\" and \"Traveller\", which was foaled in 1768. Figure's [[mare (horse)|dam]] was of \"Wild-Air\" breeding, sired by Diamond, foaled in 1784 in West Springfield. The dam was bred by Justin Morgan, for whom the breed is named. Figure is thought to have stood about 14&nbsp;hh (1.42 m), and to have weighed about 950&nbsp;lb (430&nbsp;kg). He was known for his prepotency, passing on his distinctive looks, conformation, temperament, and athleticism.\n\n==Ownership by Justin Morgan==\nIn 1792, Figure was advertised for stud before he was given as payment for a debt to Justin Morgan (1747-1798), a singing teacher and one-time [[Randolph, Vermont]], Town Clerk. Morgan owned Figure from 1792-1795, advertising him for stud in [[Randolph, Vermont|Randolph]] and [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]] (1793), and [[Royalton, Vermont]] (1794), and [[Williston, Vermont|Williston]] and [[Hinesburg, Vermont]] (1795). He leased Figure to Robert Evans in the fall of 1795 to clear land for a Mr. Fisk at a rate of $15.00 a year.\n\nMorgan later traded the horse to Samuel Allen for land in [[Moretown, Vermont]].  Allen sold the stallion later that year to William Rice of [[Woodstock, Vermont]].\n\n==Accomplishments==\nIn 1796, Figure raced in a sweepstakes in [[Brookfield, Vermont]], beating [[New York (state)|New York]] horses to win $50. That year, he was advertised at stud by Johnathan Shepard of [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], who also raced him in several match races in which he did well. Figure became known as the \"Justin Morgan horse.\"\n\n==Other owners==\nFigure was traded again in 1797, along with a blacksmith shop, to James Hawkins. In 1801 he was recorded as owned by Robert Evans of Randolph. Evans owned the horse until 1804, using the stallion for logging, racing, and breeding, until he fell into debt to Colonel John Goss. Goss collected the horse as part of the debt, and used him to review troops.  He entered the horse in a pulling bee, which the little horse won. In 1805, Goss traded Figure for a mare owned by his brother David.\n\nDavid Goss owned Figure from 1805-1811, where he worked on the farm for 10 months, and was used for breeding for two months each year. He was sold in 1811 to Philip Goss for the breeding season. Philip Goss sold Figure to Jacob Sanderson, who sold him to Jacob Langmeade. Langmeade used the horse to haul freight, and is thought to have abused the aging stallion.\n\nLangmeade sold Figure to Joel Goss and Joseph Rogers at the end of 1811. Figure stood at stud for several years, before he was sold to Samuel Stone in 1817. Stone exhibited the stallion in the Randolph fair. Figure was used as a parade mount by President [[James Monroe]] later that year.\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1819, Figure was sold to his final owner, Levi Bean of [[Chelsea, Vermont]]. Toward the end of his life, Figure was put out to pasture. He died in 1821 from an injury to the flank, caused by a kick, at the age of 32. Figure is now buried in [[Tunbridge, Vermont]].\n\n==Stories, myths and legends==\nMany myths developed surrounding Figure and Justin Morgan.  The popular children's book, ''[[Justin Morgan Had a Horse]]'' by [[Marguerite Henry]], is a fictionalized account of Figure (called \"Little Bub\" in the book) and his early life.  A movie about the pair was made by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]], released in 1972, which took liberties with known events.\n\n==Sire line tree==\n{{tree list}}\n*'''Justin Morgan (Figure)'''<!--b. 1789--><ref name=\"Justin Morgan Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/justin+morgan Justin Morgan Pedigree]</ref>\n**Sherman Morgan<!--b. 1808--><ref name=\"Sherman Morgan Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/sherman+morgan Sherman Morgan Pedigree]</ref>\n***[[Black Hawk (horse)|Black Hawk]]<!--b. 1833--><ref name=\"Black Hawk Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/black+hawk9 Black Hawk Pedigree]</ref>\n****Blood's Black Hawk<!--b. 1847--><ref name=\"Blood's Black Hawk Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/bloods+black+hawk Blood's Black Hawk Pedigree]</ref>\n*****Gist's Black Hawk<!--b. 1852--><ref name=\"Gist's Black Hawk Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/gists+black+hawk Gist's Black Hawk Pedigree]</ref>\n{{tree list/end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Morgan horses]]\n[[Category:1789 animal births]]\n[[Category:1821 animal deaths]]\n[[Category:Individual male horses]]\n[[Category:Individual animals in the United States]]\n[[Category:Foundation horse sires]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}}\n[[Image:American Morgan Horse.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Horse and rider costumed to resemble Figure and Justin Morgan.]]'''Figure''' was a small [[bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion (horse)|stallion]] owned by [[Justin Morgan]]; he became the [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sire]] of the [[Morgan horse]] breed.\n\n==Early years==\nThe stallion was born in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1789.

Since 1996, the nominees have been announced in February, and the winners announced at a gala banquet held in May, usually during the [[BookExpo America]] fair.
