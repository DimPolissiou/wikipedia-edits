Held since 1968 in [[Qu\u00e9bec City]], the 11-day festival takes place every year in July. FEQ's eclectic programming includes the biggest international stars and emerging artists from around the globe. Its main stage is the biggest self-supporting stage in North America. Festival d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec is presented by Bell in collaboration with Coors Light. The 53rd edition of the FEQ will take place from July 8 to 18, 2021.\n\n==History==\nThe festival has been taking place annually since 1968.

Reshef's practice is characterised by a \"Control and Release\" technique, in which she pours diluted paint on a horizontal canvas, tilting it and imprinting on it to create layered gestural compositions.<ref>[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/1d9ca3_53bb3947e27048c985f6c1975fe6b97a.pdf (Control | Release) Catalogue text by Stephen Main (Imprints)]</ref><ref>[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/1d9ca3_8beeb58afa8c44e5b41a87b89d1b0ea0.pdf (Control | Release) Catalogue text by Sagi Refael (Control | Release)]</ref>\n\nReshef's imprinting technique also follows a process similar to \u201ccameraless photography\u201d, commonly known as [[photogram]]ing, but with painterly materials instead of the chemicals and light sensitive papers used in that technique.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Bodies of work and exhibitions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nSince 2016 Reshef has been exhibiting different forms of painting-[[Installation art|installation]], in which unstretched scrolls of paintings create a three-dimensional, overlapping experience for the viewing audience. Her most recent painting-installation is '''\u201cArcadia\u201d''',that debuted as a solo exhibition at the [[Katonah Museum of Art]], [[Katonah, New York]], in October 2019. Alluding to [[Nicolas Poussin|Nicholas Poussin]]\u2019s painting [[Et in Arcadia ego|\u201cEt In Arcadia Ego\u201d]], the installation deals with the tension between the picturesque landscape and environment of the museum\u2019s natural surroundings, and with the potential of disturbance and the suspended aggression that lies underneath the surface, both in American and in Israeli societies.\n\nReshef\u2019s first Installation '''\u201cControl l Release\u201d''' was exhibited in ArtSpace TLV gallery, presenting about 44 meters (142 feet) of painting scrolls, hung from the ceiling to the floor, and surrounding the gallery. The exhibition was accompanied with a two-part catalogue, '''\"Control l Release\"''' and '''\"Imprints\"''', with texts by the New York-based critic and artist, Stephen Maine, and by the Los Angeles-based curator, Sagi Refael.\n\nIn 2017 Reshef had installed her large-scale piece '''\u201cTime Traveler\u201d''' in a solo exhibition at the Tall Wall Space in the [[University of La Verne]], California, following an invitation from Dion Johnson, curator of the University of La Verne art galleries. The process of installing that piece on site was documented by photographer and videographer [[Eric Minh Swenson]].\n\n'''\"Time Traveler\"''' was created with six scrolls of paintings interwoven horizontally and vertically into a beautiful, color-blended monumental grid. The entire installation symbolized the four seasons as a visual loop of the passage of time, with each season interlacing to form one cohesive tapestry. The canvases depict varied techniques, color schemes and atmospheres, reflecting of the era we live in, flooded by images in a non-linear way from all directions. The six scroll paintings are merged together in a collision of simultaneous climates, alluding to appearances of global warming phenomenon as rain and storms in the summer, and heat waves in the winter.\n\nDue to the modular and site-specific nature of '''\u201cTime Traveler\u201d''', its second iteration was installed in a new configuration. Following the invite by Rachel T. Schmid, Curator of Collections and Exhibitions at the Kwan Fong Art Gallery in the [[California Lutheran University]], Reshef had installed '''\u201cTime Traveler: Part ll - Compass\u201d''', as a more politically charged version of the original artwork. By titling it \"Compass\", Reshef suggested a conceptual, artistic lighthouse, directing the viewers to inner introspection, at a time of lack of political and social leaders that can direct their countries and communities onto safe grounds. In this polemic era, the monumentality of the piece offered a sanctuary of silent observation and infinite interpretations to the viewers, suggesting that they follow their own path and inner feelings, and not necessarily what politicians want them to do.\n\nIn the summer of 2018 Reshef presented two new bodies of work, the outdoor installation '''\u201cIntervals\u201d''', on the facade of the Zaritsky Artists\u2019 House in Tel Aviv, and '''\u201cSpectrum\u201d''', at the Soho House in West Hollywood, California.\n\n'''\u201cSpectrum\u201d''' manifested Reshef's interest in the process of art making, and in the different ways to depict the elusive nature of the passage of time and of the fleeting seasons. The 22 paintings in this series, presented monochromatic stages inspired by the different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, stressing the existing yet invisible rays of light known to science. On the shorter end of the spectrum is the ultraviolet waves of radiation, while on the longer end of the spectrum is the infrared wave of light. These both ends also mark the shifting tonalities and full range of hues between warm colors of reds and yellows, to cold colors of blues and purples, also sensualizing a change of moods and atmospheres, from somber to cheerful, from coolness to passion.\n\nBetween the years 2018-2019, Reshef had exhibited three site-specific outdoor murals on the facade of the Zaritsky Artists\u05f3 House in Tel Aviv. The first mural, '''\u201cIntervals\u201d''' (2018), presented a faux architectural facade with twenty \u201cwindows\u201d revealing bold, abstract monochrome paintings. Embodying tonal transitions from the scale of warm to cool colors, these works effectively highlighted a hierarchy of atmospheres in the passage of the seasons through the shades, temperatures and emotional qualities affected by shortening and lengthening cycles of hours and days over the course of a year. Displaying Intervals on the wall of the Artists House comprised the completion of a circle and a gesture to the values of abstract painting represented in early Israeli art by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], for whom this venue is named, and a homage to the movement he cofounded, [[Ofakim Hadashim|\"Ofakim Hadashim\" (\u201cNew Horizons\u201d)]].\n\nReshef\u2019s second mural project at the Artists\u2019 House , '''\u201cEden in Two Acts\u201d''' (2019), was divided into two parts, and was specifically produced to react to the second round of elections in Israel in September 2019.\n\nThe first part of the mural was launched in August 2018, prior to the elections and in order to raise awareness to the importance of voting. The second part of the mural was launched on November 2019, and reacted to the elections\u2019 results. Both \u201cacts\u201d of the project featured different abstract paintings, that alluded to the theme of \u201cLost Paradise\u201d, and to the tension between to harmonious potential of living in peace in the middle east, and specifically in Israel, and was Reshef\u2019s most directly political body of work to date.\n\nAlongside Reshef's immersive painting installations, she continued developing her \u201cimprinting\u201d paintings, resulting with her \u201cGhost Libraries\u201d and \u201cFossil\u201d series of 2017-2018, and \u201cHabitat\u201d of 2019.\n\nEarlier bodies of work present Reshef's technique of painting without brushes, after developing her tilting method of paint use (later titled \u201cControl and Release\u201d) in 2010.\n\n== Personal life ==\nReshef is married to businessperson and academic administrator [[Shai Reshef]]. He is the founder and president of the [[University of the People]].
