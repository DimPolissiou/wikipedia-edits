Since its inception, the band lineup has been a virtual revolving-door of talent with many members coming and going \u2013 Ness has been the only constant member. After {{Age|1978|1|1}} years of performing, Social Distortion continues to tour and record music. Easter Egg\n\nTo date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two [[compilation album|compilations]], one live album, and two [[DVDs]]. They released two albums \u2014 ''[[Mommy's Little Monster (album)|Mommy's Little Monster]]'' (1983) and ''[[Prison Bound]]'' (1988) \u2014 before signing a three-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1989. Social Distortion rose to fame with their 1990 [[Social Distortion (album)|self-titled third album]], which produced their well-known hit singles \"[[Ball and Chain (Social Distortion song)|Ball and Chain]]\", \"[[Story of My Life (Social Distortion song)|Story of My Life]]\", and the cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", and was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=social_distortion&artist=social_distortion&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Many of their later albums, including their second gold record<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> ''[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]'' (1992), were also well received.

Aside from Ness on guitar and [[Casey Royer]] on drums, early members included vocalist Tom Corvin, a former [[Cal State Fullerton Titans men's basketball|Cal State Fullerton basketball]] player and bassist Mark Garrett,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thepitchkc.com/news/article/20609776/channeling-social-d |title=Channeling Social D |publisher=The Pitch |date=March 18, 2004 |accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref> the latter of whom was succeeded by Rikk Agnew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strangereaction.com/2019/04/08/an-interview-with-rikk-agnew/ |title=An Interview with Rikk Agnew |publisher=Strange Reaction |date=April 8, 2019 |accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref> On the origins of the band's name, Royer recalled \"Mike was like 15, trying to play guitar but he couldn't.

After Corvin left in the fall of 1979 to attend graduate school at [[Bob Jones University]], Ness recruited his high school friend [[Dennis Danell]] to join the band on guitar even though Danell had never played an instrument before. When Danell was brought in, the other members left as they did not want to wait for him to learn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brokenheadphones.com/?p=3593|title='CAUSE CASEY ROYER OD'D HIMSELF |publisher=Broken Headphones |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref> Before joining the [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]] in 1980, Royer and Agnew played in a separate band named Social Distortion consisting of Royer on vocals, Rikk Agnew on drums, [[Frank Agnew]] and Tim Maag on guitars, and Mark Garrett on bass. The band's first real show was in early 1979 at the Cuckoo's Nest nightclub on Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa, California. Mike and Dennis remained the only constant members for the next two decades with bass and drum members changing every few years. The Adolescents song \"[[Kids of the Black Hole]]\" and Social Distortion song \"The Playpen\" chronicled this period of the band's history.\n\nIts first single, ''Mainliner/Playpen'' featuring Ness on guitar and vocals, Dennis on bass, and Carrot on drums was released in 1981 on [[Posh Boy Records|Posh Boy]], the label responsible for releasing the first singles and albums of many of the local O.C. punk bands.<ref name=\"history\" /> [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] of [[KROQ-FM]] was responsible for much of the radio play in [[Orange County, California]], that punk received in the early 80s, and took a liking to Social Distortion, releasing the single \"1945\" on his 1981 compilation album, ''Rodney on the ROQ'', ''Blood on the ROQ'' in 1983, and ''The Best Of Rodney on the ROQ'' in 1989.\n\nIn 1982, the band\u2014now consisting of Ness, Danell (who now played rhythm guitar), [[Brent Liles]] on bass, and [[Derek O'Brien (drummer)|Derek O'Brien]] on drums\u2014embarked on their first international tour (US and Canada) with fellow punk band [[Youth Brigade (band)|Youth Brigade]], a trip chronicled in the punk [[rockumentary]] ''[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]'', which was not released until 1984.\n\n===''Mommy's Little Monster'' and first hiatus (1983\u20131985)===\nUpon its return from the ''Another State of Mind'' tour in 1982, they recorded their debut album, ''[[Mommy's Little Monster (album)|Mommy's Little Monster]]''. The album was released in early 1983 on their own label, [[13th Floor Records]]. ''Mommy's Little Monster'' includes the title track as well as the song for which the previous tour was named, \"[[Another State of Mind (song)|Another State of Mind]]\". This was the album that \"gained the band a national name in punk circles\".<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019143622/http://www.socialdistortion.com/history/|title=Social Distortion|date=October 19, 2009|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nNess mentions in his DVD commentary that he really had nowhere to stay when he got back to California after the tour ended, so he would crash on the couch of whoever would have him. He details how he plunged headfirst into serious drug addiction and ended up being strung out on heroin for weeks at a time. In 1983, Liles and O'Brien left the band in the middle of a show on New Year's Eve, and were replaced soon thereafter by Ness' high school friend [[John Maurer]] and a man named [[Bob Stubbs]]. This line-up lasted only a short time until [[Christopher Reece]] joined on drums.<ref name=\"history\" /> Ness's drug habit continued throughout 1984 and 1985 as the band continued to gain success with ''Another State of Mind'' appearing as one of the punk rarities on MTV, and touring in California and Arizona. As a result of Ness's escalating drug habit and troubles with the law, Social Distortion briefly went on hiatus in 1985. During this time, Ness was in and out of various rehabilitation centers and jails.\n\n===First comeback and ''Prison Bound'' (1986\u20131988)===\nThe band reformed in or around 1986, once Ness finished his [[drug rehabilitation]] program. It released its second album, ''[[Prison Bound]]'', two years later in 1988\u2014over five years after their debut. The album included then-newcomers John Maurer on bass and Christopher Reece on drums. Although ''Prison Bound'' never charted on [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']], the title track still receives extensive airplay on Los Angeles radio station, [[KROQ-FM]].\n\nA notable style change takes place in ''Prison Bound'', which takes on a definite [[country music|country/western]] flavor and marks the start of the band's entrance into a style sometimes called \"[[cowpunk]].\" Country legend [[Johnny Cash]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]' [[honky tonk]] style became more prominent influences on Social Distortion's music at this time. There are references to Cash and the Stones in the songs \"Prison Bound\" and \"On My Nerves.\"\n\nFive years had passed since releasing its debut. The success was just beginning and, in fact, taking time between albums became a pattern for Social Distortion. Ness acknowledges in a 2003 interview that it ''is'' a little backward, marketing-wise, to play songs for the fans for a few years before recording them\u2014but it has always worked well for them. \"We know which songs are going to be fan favorites on the record before we even record them.\"<ref>Steininger, Alex. \"Mike Ness on politics, new album, and touring,\" [http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/63h08.html In Music We Trust].

The band then returned to the studio around the summer/fall of 1989, with producer [[Dave Jerden]], to begin recording their [[Social Distortion (album)|self-titled third album]], which was released in 1990. It was Social Distortion's first album that was not financed by the band.<ref name=\"history\" /> The album includes the singles \"[[Ball and Chain (Social Distortion song)|Ball and Chain]]\" and \"[[Story of My Life (Social Distortion song)|Story of My Life]]\" as well as a cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\". The self-titled album fared better than both ''Mommy's Little Monster'' and ''Prison Bound,'' and is often credited as Social Distortion's best known work, with sales continuing {{Age|1990|3|27}} years after its release. It is also sometimes cited as among the best rock albums of 1990\u2014the album is said to \"split the difference between [[rockabilly]] and Ramones-style punk.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,991908,00.html |title=Social Distortion Import Bonus Tracks by Social Distortion @ARTISTdirect |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth album, ''[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]'', was released in 1992. The album included two hit singles\u2014\"[[Bad Luck (Social Distortion song)|Bad Luck]]\", and \"When She Begins\". ''Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell'' surpassed all their previous albums in popularity. The album has a similar sound to the previous, eponymous, album, said to be a blend of \"punk, blues, country and rockabilly\".<ref name=\"ADbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/bio/0,,495103,00.html#bio |title=Social Distortion Biography \u2013 ARTISTdirect Music |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date=2000-02-29 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref> After the release of this album, drummer [[Christopher Reece]] left Social Distortion in 1994 and was replaced by [[Randy Carr]]. Carr toured with the band and played drums on live performances until he left in 1995.\n\nThe band took another hiatus after the release of ''Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell'', and did not return to the studio until 1995.<ref name=\"history\" /> During the break, Social Distortion released a compilation album, ''[[Mainliner: Wreckage From the Past]]'' (1995), featuring pre-''[[Mommy's Little Monster (album)|Mommy's Little Monster]]'' cuts. It contains two versions of \"1945\" and \"Playpen\" from their two indie labels, 13th Floor, and [[Posh Boy Records|Posh Boy]], and also a cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Under My Thumb]]\".\n\nIn June 1994, the band began demoing songs for the fifth album,<ref name=\"demo\">[http://rateyourmusic.com/release/unauth/social_distortion/lost_tracks_ii__the_june_1994_demos/ \"Lost Tracks II: The June 1994 Demos\"] RateYourMusic.com.

The album also included a re-recorded version of \"Under My Thumb\", a cover of the Rolling Stones, as a [[hidden track]].

It released its first (and only) live album, ''[[Live at the Roxy (Social Distortion album)|Live at the Roxy]]'' in 1998.

There have been some rumors claiming that the band broke up again, following his death. He was replaced by former [[U.S. Bombs]], Cadillac Tramps and L.A.'s [[Youth Brigade (band)|Youth Brigade]] guitarist [[Jonny Wickersham]], who had previously been Danell's guitar technician. Biscuits also left during that time, and was replaced by [[Charlie Quintana]].

They are thought to be one of the pioneering bands of the original Southern California punk rock movement out of [[Orange County, California]], and their style closely associated with [[the Dickies]], the [[Germs (band)|Germs]], and other bands from that place and time. In the mid-'80s there was a notable change in their style of music \u2013 taking more from [[country music]] and [[rock and roll]]. Mike Ness admits in the DVD commentary from ''[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]'' that he may have even tried ''too'' hard on the ''Prison Bound'' album. They did eventually find their niche, and the majority of their albums from the mid-80s on to the early '90s are considered to be punk rock or [[rockabilly]] \u2013 a melodic punk sound that is distinctly \u2013 and distinctively \u2013 their own.\n\nSocial Distortion's music is influenced by bands and artists such as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[New York Dolls]], [[Dead Boys]], and [[the Ramones]].<ref>[http://www.socialdistortion.com/news.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429101808/http://www.socialdistortion.com/news.html |date=April 29, 2007 }}</ref> Social Distortion have influenced bands such as [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], [[Green Day]], [[Rise Against]], [[Blink-182]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], [[Volbeat]] and [[Thrice]].

Since its inception, the band lineup has been a virtual revolving-door of talent with many members coming and going \u2013 Ness has been the only constant member. After {{Age|1978|1|1}} years of performing, Social Distortion continues to tour and record music.\n\nTo date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two [[compilation album|compilations]], one live album, and two [[DVDs]]. They released two albums \u2014 ''[[Mommy's Little Monster (album)|Mommy's Little Monster]]'' (1983) and ''[[Prison Bound]]'' (1988) \u2014 before signing a three-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1989. Social Distortion rose to fame with their 1990 [[Social Distortion (album)|self-titled third album]], which produced their well-known hit singles \"[[Ball and Chain (Social Distortion song)|Ball and Chain]]\", \"[[Story of My Life (Social Distortion song)|Story of My Life]]\", and the cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", and was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=social_distortion&artist=social_distortion&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Many of their later albums, including their second gold record<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> ''[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]'' (1992), were also well received.

After Corvin left in the fall of 1979 to attend graduate school at [[Bob Jones University]], Ness recruited his high school friend [[Dennis Danell]] to join the band on guitar even though Danell had never played an instrument before. When Danell was brought in, the other members left as they did not want to wait for him to learn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brokenheadphones.com/?p=3593|title='CAUSE CASEY ROYER OD'D HIMSELF |publisher=Broken Headphones |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref> Before joining the [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]] in 1980, Royer and Agnew played in a separate band named Social Distortion consisting of Royer on vocals, Rikk Agnew on drums, [[Frank Agnew]] and Tim Maag on guitars, and Mark Garrett on bass. The band's first real show was in early 1979 at the Cuckoo's Nest nightclub on Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa, California. Mike and Dennis remained the only constant members for the next two decades with bass and drum members changing every few years. The Adolescents song \"[[Kids of the Black Hole]]\" and Social Distortion song \"The Playpen\" chronicled this period of the band's history.\n\nIts first single, ''Mainliner/Playpen'' featuring Ness on guitar and vocals, Dennis on bass, and Carrot on drums was released in 1981 on [[Posh Boy Records|Posh Boy]], the label responsible for releasing the first singles and albums of many of the local O.C. punk bands.<ref name=\"history\" /> [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] of [[KROQ-FM]] was responsible for much of the radio play in [[Orange County, California]], that punk received in the early 80s, and took a liking to Social Distortion, releasing the single \"1945\" on his 1981 compilation album, ''Rodney on the ROQ'', ''Blood on the ROQ'' in 1983, and ''The Best Of Rodney on the ROQ'' in 1989.\n\nIn 1982, the band\u2014now consisting of Ness, Danell (who now played rhythm guitar), [[Brent Liles]] on bass, and [[Derek O'Brien (drummer)|Derek O'Brien]] on drums\u2014embarked on their first international tour (US and Canada) with fellow punk band [[Youth Brigade (band)|Youth Brigade]], a trip chronicled in the punk [[rockumentary]] ''[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]'', which was not released until 1984.\n\n===''Mommy's Little Monster'' and first hiatus (1983\u20131985)===\nUpon its return from the ''Another State of Mind'' tour in 1982, they recorded their debut album, ''[[Mommy's Little Monster (album)|Mommy's Little Monster]]''. The album was released in early 1983 on their own label, [[13th Floor Records]]. ''Mommy's Little Monster'' includes the title track as well as the song for which the previous tour was named, \"[[Another State of Mind (song)|Another State of Mind]]\". This was the album that \"gained the band a national name in punk circles\".<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019143622/http://www.socialdistortion.com/history/|title=Social Distortion|date=October 19, 2009|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nNess mentions in his DVD commentary that he really had nowhere to stay when he got back to California after the tour ended, so he would crash on the couch of whoever would have him. He details how he plunged headfirst into serious drug addiction and ended up being strung out on heroin for weeks at a time. In 1983, Liles and O'Brien left the band in the middle of a show on New Year's Eve, and were replaced soon thereafter by Ness' high school friend [[John Maurer]] and a man named [[Bob Stubbs]]. This line-up lasted only a short time until [[Christopher Reece]] joined on drums.<ref name=\"history\" /> Ness's drug habit continued throughout 1984 and 1985 as the band continued to gain success with ''Another State of Mind'' appearing as one of the punk rarities on MTV, and touring in California and Arizona. As a result of Ness's escalating drug habit and troubles with the law, Social Distortion briefly went on hiatus in 1985. During this time, Ness was in and out of various rehabilitation centers and jails.\n\n===First comeback and ''Prison Bound'' (1986\u20131988)===\nThe band reformed in or around 1986, once Ness finished his [[drug rehabilitation]] program. It released its second album, ''[[Prison Bound]]'', two years later in 1988\u2014over five years after their debut. The album included then-newcomers John Maurer on bass and Christopher Reece on drums. Although ''Prison Bound'' never charted on [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']], the title track still receives extensive airplay on Los Angeles radio station, [[KROQ-FM]].\n\nA notable style change takes place in ''Prison Bound'', which takes on a definite [[country music|country/western]] flavor and marks the start of the band's entrance into a style sometimes called \"[[cowpunk]].\" Country legend [[Johnny Cash]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]' [[honky tonk]] style became more prominent influences on Social Distortion's music at this time. There are references to Cash and the Stones in the songs \"Prison Bound\" and \"On My Nerves.\"\n\nFive years had passed since releasing its debut. The success was just beginning and, in fact, taking time between albums became a pattern for Social Distortion. Ness acknowledges in a 2003 interview that it ''is'' a little backward, marketing-wise, to play songs for the fans for a few years before recording them\u2014but it has always worked well for them. \"We know which songs are going to be fan favorites on the record before we even record them.\"<ref>Steininger, Alex. \"Mike Ness on politics, new album, and touring,\" [http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/63h08.html In Music We Trust].

The band then returned to the studio around the summer/fall of 1989, with producer [[Dave Jerden]], to begin recording their [[Social Distortion (album)|self-titled third album]], which was released in 1990. It was Social Distortion's first album that was not financed by the band.<ref name=\"history\" /> The album includes the singles \"[[Ball and Chain (Social Distortion song)|Ball and Chain]]\" and \"[[Story of My Life (Social Distortion song)|Story of My Life]]\" as well as a cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\". The self-titled album fared better than both ''Mommy's Little Monster'' and ''Prison Bound,'' and is often credited as Social Distortion's best known work, with sales continuing {{Age|1990|3|27}} years after its release. It is also sometimes cited as among the best rock albums of 1990\u2014the album is said to \"split the difference between [[rockabilly]] and Ramones-style punk.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,991908,00.html |title=Social Distortion Import Bonus Tracks by Social Distortion @ARTISTdirect |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth album, ''[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]'', was released in 1992.

It released its first (and only) live album, ''[[Live at the Roxy (Social Distortion album)|Live at the Roxy]]'' in 1998. Social Distortion went on hiatus again as Ness went solo, releasing two albums, ''[[Cheating at Solitaire]]'' and ''[[Under the Influences]],'' featuring song covers, in 1999.\n\nDennis Danell died on February 29, 2000 in his Newport Beach home after apparently suffering a brain [[aneurysm]], leaving Ness as the only remaining original member of the band. There have been some rumors claiming that the band broke up again, following his death. He was replaced by former [[U.S. Bombs]], Cadillac Tramps and L.A.'s [[Youth Brigade (band)|Youth Brigade]] guitarist [[Jonny Wickersham]], who had previously been Danell's guitar technician. Biscuits also left during that time, and was replaced by [[Charlie Quintana]]. After Danell's death, the band continued touring semi-frequently, playing sold-out shows in the Los Angeles area around the New Year for three straight years.\n\n[[File:Hamburg~41.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The band's 2004\u20132009 lineup, left to right: Wickersham, Harding, Quintana, and Ness]]\nSocial Distortion started work on the follow-up to ''White Light, White Heat, White Trash'' in 2000, which was originally to be released in the fall of that year,<ref name=\"sixthalbum\">[http://www.sxdx.com/news.html SxDx.com News]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227100634/http://www.sxdx.com/news.html |date=February 27, 2009 }} [http://www.sxdx.com/news.html SxDx.com]   .

The band was scheduled to headline the [[Soundwave Festival]] in Australia in February\u2013March 2008, along with [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] and [[The Offspring]], but they cancelled their appearance and released the following statement:\n\n<blockquote>Due to circumstances beyond our control, Social Distortion is regrettably unable to perform at Soundwave Festival 2008 in Australia and must officially withdraw from the bill.

They are thought to be one of the pioneering bands of the original Southern California punk rock movement out of [[Orange County, California]], and their style closely associated with [[the Dickies]], the [[Germs (band)|Germs]], and other bands from that place and time. In the mid-'80s there was a notable change in their style of music \u2013 taking more from [[country music]] and [[rock and roll]]. Mike Ness admits in the DVD commentary from ''[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]'' that he may have even tried ''too'' hard on the ''Prison Bound'' album. They did eventually find their niche, and the majority of their albums from the mid-80s on to the early '90s are considered to be punk rock or [[rockabilly]] \u2013 a melodic punk sound that is distinctly \u2013 and distinctively \u2013 their own.\n\nSocial Distortion's music is influenced by bands and artists such as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[New York Dolls]], [[Dead Boys]], and [[the Ramones]].<ref>[http://www.socialdistortion.com/news.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429101808/http://www.socialdistortion.com/news.html |date=April 29, 2007 }}</ref> Social Distortion have influenced bands such as [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], [[Green Day]], [[Rise Against]], [[Blink-182]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], [[Volbeat]] and [[Thrice]]. The band began playing with fellow [[Orange County, California]] bands such as [[the Adolescents]], [[China White (band)|China White]], [[Shattered Faith]] and [[T.S.O.L.]].
