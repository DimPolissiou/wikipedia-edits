Both explanations were tested by [[David Gal]] in a study where subjects were asked to imagine that they owned a quarter minted in either Denver or Philadelphia. They were then given the choice of exchanging their coin with one minted in the other city, assuming insignificant time and effort involved in this process. It was found that 85% of participants chose to retain their original coin which can be explained by the inertia account of remaining at the status quo. However, the loss aversion account is unable to explain this decision as it does not provide insight into a propensity towards the status-quo when the option values are equivalent.<ref name=Gal />\n\n=== Endowment effect ===\nThe [[endowment effect]], i.e. greater value being placed on objects that are owned than those that are not, has been shown to be caused by loss aversion. This was demonstrated in [[Daniel Kahneman]]'s study in 1990 where participants who were given a mug demanded, on average, around seven dollars to part with it. Whereas, individuals who were not given a mug were only willing to spend, on average, around three dollars on the same mug. This therefore demonstrated that losses exert a greater impact than gains. However, it could also be seen as evidence for psychological inertia as the participants were provided with the same objects and therefore, as they were indifferent to them, they chose to maintain the status quo as there was no incentive to trade.<ref name=\"GalRucker\" />\n\n==Inability to break with tradition==\nThe 1998 article \"Psychological Inertia\" by James Kowalick<ref name=\"Kowalick >{{cite journal |last1=Kowalick |first1=James |title=Psychological Inertia |journal=The Triz Journal |date=1998 |url=https://triz-journal.com/psychological-inertia/}}</ref> refers to a company where the president was displeased that company management had little knowledge of what was going on in the manufacturing department. The management team was not approachable and looked down on employees that were not managers. \"Remaining behind the sacred doors of one's managerial office had become quite a tradition.\" To address this issue, the president asked each manager to present a manufacturing procedure in detail at the staff meeting, having the other managers asking, penetrating questions.

One possible driver that many underlie avolition is psychological inertia. It has been argued that as individuals with schizophrenia may be less able to convert their preferences into actions, they may display an increased tendency to maintain a current state, even if they attribute greater value to a different option available. Therefore, this causes these individuals to display greater levels of psychological inertia, and since this process inhibits their action, its presence could drive avolition. James Gold found that motivational impairments of schizophrenia may be associated with abnormalities in estimating the \"cost\" of effortful behaviour leading to increased psychological inertia which, in turn, could lead to increased avolition in these individuals. However, research into links between psychological inertia and schizophrenia is limited as is their relationship to avolition. For example, research is needed to explore whether the differences in levels of psychological inertia in individuals with schizophrenia only occur when there is a need to engage high levels of inertia or when the individual displays a high level of avolition. Research has shown, however, that the differences in levels of psychological inertia among individuals with schizophrenia is not only due to avolition but could be caused by attention deficits or action-readiness deficits.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suri |first1=Gaurav |last2=Lavaysse |first2=Lindsey |last3=Young |first3=Gerald |last4=Moodie |first4=Craig |last5=Tersakyan |first5=Alen |last6=Gross |first6=James |last7=Gard |first7=David |title=An investigation into the drivers of avolition in schizophrenia |journal=Psychiatry Research |date=January 2018 |volume=261 |pages=225\u2013231 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2018.01.001|pmid=29329039 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nPsychological inertia is believed to be one explanation factor in crime continuity, that is the persistence of criminal behaviour. Glenn Walter's psychological inertia theorem states that crime continuity is partly caused by cognitive factors that account for the continuity in behaviour between past and future criminality and derives from his broader 'lifestyle theory' model, which explains the overall development of a criminal lifestyle. Walter's theorem is based upon Newton's law of inertia which states that a body will remain in motion until acted upon by an outside force, in which here the body in motion is crime. \nWithin this theorem, Walter attributes six slow-changing variables that when combined link past criminality with future criminality. \nThese six cognitive variables are:\n# Criminal thinking (antisocial attitudes and irrational thought patterns)\n# Positive outcome expectancies for crime (belief that crime will have specific positive outcomes)\n# Attribution biases (tendency to view the world as hostile and others as malicious)\n# Efficacy expectations (lack of confidence in one's ability to avoid criminal opportunities in the future)\n# Goals (i.e. focus on short-term goals which becomes detrimental to long-term goals)\n# Values (pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure and immediate gratification)\nThe psychological inertia theorem argues that criminal involvement gives rise to these six cognitive variables which then encourage further offending behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walters |first1=Glenn |title=Crime Continuity and Psychological Inertia: Testing the Cognitive Mediation and Additive Postulates with Male Adjudicated Delinquents |journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology |date=2016 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=237\u2013252 |doi=10.1007/s10940-015-9262-9}}</ref>\n\nTheories surrounding the expectation of behavioural continuity are a topic of debate in the criminal justice community.

Ohio's borders were defined by [[metes and bounds]] in the [[Enabling Act of 1802]] as follows:\n{{quote |Bounded on the east by the Pennsylvania line, on the south by the Ohio River, to the mouth of the [[Great Miami River]], on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami aforesaid, and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of [[Lake Michigan]], running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid, from the mouth of the Great Miami until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line, and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid.}}\n[[File:DSCN4516 portconneautflag e.jpg|right|thumb|The Ohio coast of [[Lake Erie]]]]\n\nOhio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly all of the river itself belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia.

For many years this body of water, over {{convert|20|sqmi|km2}}, was the largest artificial lake in the world. [[:Category:Canals in Ohio|Ohio's canal-building projects]] were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states. Some cities, such as Dayton, owe their industrial emergence to location on canals, and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state.\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{See also|Climate change in Ohio}}\n[[File:Ohio K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Ohio now showing majority as humid subtropical]]\n\nThe climate of Ohio is a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa/Dfb'') throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's [[Bluegrass region]] section, which are located on the northern periphery of the [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and [[Upland South]] region of the United States. Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round. Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are typically fewer [[tornado]] reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the [[Tornado Alley]]. Severe [[lake effect snow]]storms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of [[Lake Erie]], which is located in an area designated as the [[Snowbelt]].\n\nAlthough predominantly not in a subtropical climate, some warmer-climate flora and fauna do reach well into Ohio. For instance, some trees with more southern ranges, such as the [[blackjack oak]], ''Quercus marilandica'', are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia ''([[Magnolia grandiflora]])'', [[Albizia julibrissin]] (mimosa), [[Crape Myrtle]], and even the occasional [[Needle Palm|needle palm]] are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the [[Bluegrass region]] of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]] from [[Cincinnati]] to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's [[common wall lizard]], one of the few examples of permanent \"subtropical\" fauna in Ohio.\n\nDue to flooding resulting in severely damaged highways,

Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved to Zanesville for two years, as part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe, which was the capital from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, to have it near the geographic center of the state.\n\nAlthough many Native Americans had migrated west to evade American encroachment, others remained settled in the state, sometimes assimilating in part. In 1830 under President [[Andrew Jackson]], the US government forced [[Indian Removal]] of most tribes to the [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River.\n\nIn 1835, Ohio fought with [[Michigan]] in the [[Toledo War]], a mostly bloodless boundary war over the Toledo Strip. Only one person was injured in the conflict. Congress intervened, making Michigan's admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], in addition to the eastern third which was already considered part of the state.\n\n===Civil War and growth===\n\nOhio's central position and its population gave it an important place during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads. The industry of Ohio made the state one of the most important states in the Union during the Civil war. Ohio contributed more soldiers per-capita than any other state in the Union.

The result reflected the concerns of the [[Progressive Era]]. It introduced the initiative and the referendum. Also, it allowed the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and [[constitutional amendment]]s originating in the Legislature. Under the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on Ohio's general election ballots every 20 years. The question asks whether a new convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, it has never been approved. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 45365\n|1810= 230760\n|1820= 581434\n|1830= 937903\n|1840= 1519467\n|1850= 1980329\n|1860= 2339511\n|1870= 2665260\n|1880= 3198062\n|1890= 3672329\n|1900= 4157545\n|1910= 4767121\n|1920= 5759394\n|1930= 6646697\n|1940= 6907612\n|1950= 7946627\n|1960= 9706397\n|1970= 10652017\n|1980= 10797630\n|1990= 10847115\n|2000= 11353140\n|2010= 11536504\n|estimate= 11689100\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=Resident Population Data\u20142010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160532/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}</ref><br />2019 Estimate<ref name=PopEstUS>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/OH,US/PST045219|title=QuickFacts Ohio; UNITED STATES|format=|website=2019 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 18, 2020|accessdate=February 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227230303/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/OH,US/PST045219|archive-date=December 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Population===\n\nFrom just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio's population grew faster than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the [[1970 United States Census|1970 census]], which recorded just over 10.65&nbsp;million Ohioans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Population: 1970, Part 37\u2014Ohio, Section 1|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|year=1970|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_oh1-01.pdf|accessdate=March 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415053910/http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_oh1-01.pdf|archive-date=April 15, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Growth then slowed for the next four decades.<ref>{{cite web|last=Balistreri |first=Kelly |title=Ohio Population News: Why did Ohio lose a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives? |publisher=Center for Family and Demographic Research at [[Bowling Green State University]] |date=February 2001 |url=http://www.bgsu.edu/downloads/cas/file36222.pdf |accessdate=March 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516165832/http://www.bgsu.edu/downloads/cas/file36222.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Ohio was 11,689,100 on July 1, 2019, a 1.32% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=PopEstUS/> Ohio's population growth lags that of the entire United States, and [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] are found in a greater density than the United States average. {{As of|2000}}, Ohio's [[center of population]] is located in [[Morrow County, Ohio|Morrow County]],<ref name=\"POPCENTER\">{{cite web|title=2000 Population and Geographic Centers of Ohio |publisher=Ohio Department of Development, Office of Strategic Research |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.odod.state.oh.us/research/FILES/G101.pdf |accessdate=March 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124004820/http://www.odod.state.oh.us/research/FILES/G101.pdf |archivedate=November 24, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> in the [[county seat]] of [[Mount Gilead, Ohio|Mount Gilead]].<ref name=\"POPCEN\">{{cite web|title=Population and Population Centers by State: 2000 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508041813/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |archivedate=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This is approximately {{convert|6346|ft|m}} south and west of Ohio's population center in 1990.<ref name=\"POPCENTER\" />\n[[File:Population Growth Ohio.png|thumb|Graph of Ohio's population growth from 1800 to 2000]]\n\nAs of 2011, 27.6% of Ohio's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.<ref>\"[http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html Americans under age{{nbsp}}1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714084214/http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html |date=July 14, 2016 }}\".

One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as \"Main Market Route 3\", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic [[Lincoln Highway]] which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], and [[Van Wert, Ohio|Van Wert]]. The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Ohio was a major influence on the development of the state. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became [[U.S. Route 30 in Ohio|U.S. Route 30]].\n\nOhio also is home to {{convert|228|mi|km|0}} of the Historic [[National Road]], now [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]].\n\nOhio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate highways.

Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton is one of the heaviest traveled sections of interstate in Ohio.\n\nOhio also has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes. Many of them follow [[rail trail]]s, with conversion ongoing. The [[Ohio to Erie Trail]] (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland.

Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round. Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are typically fewer [[tornado]] reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the [[Tornado Alley]]. Severe [[lake effect snow]]storms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of [[Lake Erie]], which is located in an area designated as the [[Snowbelt]].\n\nAlthough predominantly not in a subtropical climate, some warmer-climate flora and fauna do reach well into Ohio. For instance, some trees with more southern ranges, such as the [[blackjack oak]], ''Quercus marilandica'', are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia ''([[Magnolia grandiflora]])'', [[Albizia julibrissin]] (mimosa), [[Crape Myrtle]], and even the occasional [[Needle Palm|needle palm]] are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the [[Bluegrass region]] of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]] from [[Cincinnati]] to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's [[common wall lizard]], one of the few examples of permanent \"subtropical\" fauna in Ohio.\n\nDue to flooding resulting in severely damaged highways,

Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved to Zanesville for two years, as part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe, which was the capital from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, to have it near the geographic center of the state.\n\nAlthough many Native Americans had migrated west to evade American encroachment, others remained settled in the state, sometimes assimilating in part. In 1830 under President [[Andrew Jackson]], the US government forced [[Indian Removal]] of most tribes to the [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River.\n\nIn 1835, Ohio fought with [[Michigan]] in the [[Toledo War]], a mostly bloodless boundary war over the Toledo Strip. Only one person was injured in the conflict. Congress intervened, making Michigan's admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], in addition to the eastern third which was already considered part of the state.\n\n===Civil War and growth===\n\nOhio's central position and its population gave it an important place during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads. The industry of Ohio made the state one of the most important states in the Union during the Civil war. Ohio contributed more soldiers per-capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Shiloh]], a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties.<ref name=\"knepper233-234\">Knepper (1989), pp. 233\u2013234.</ref> Later that year, when [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops under the leadership of [[Stonewall Jackson]] threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor [[David Tod]] still could recruit 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service.<ref name=\"roseboom188\">Roseboom and Weisenburger (1967), p. 188.</ref> From July 12 to July 23, 1863, Southern Ohio and Indiana were attacked in [[Morgan's Raid]].

The result reflected the concerns of the [[Progressive Era]]. It introduced the initiative and the referendum. Also, it allowed the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and [[constitutional amendment]]s originating in the Legislature. Under the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on Ohio's general election ballots every 20 years. The question asks whether a new convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, it has never been approved. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 45365\n|1810= 230760\n|1820= 581434\n|1830= 937903\n|1840= 1519467\n|1850= 1980329\n|1860= 2339511\n|1870= 2665260\n|1880= 3198062\n|1890= 3672329\n|1900= 4157545\n|1910= 4767121\n|1920= 5759394\n|1930= 6646697\n|1940= 6907612\n|1950= 7946627\n|1960= 9706397\n|1970= 10652017\n|1980= 10797630\n|1990= 10847115\n|2000= 11353140\n|2010= 11536504\n|estimate= 11689100\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=Resident Population Data\u20142010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160532/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}</ref><br />2019 Estimate<ref name=PopEstUS>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/OH,US/PST045219|title=QuickFacts Ohio; UNITED STATES|format=|website=2019 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 18, 2020|accessdate=February 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227230303/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/OH,US/PST045219|archive-date=December 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Population===\n\nFrom just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio's population grew faster than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the [[1970 United States Census|1970 census]], which recorded just over 10.65&nbsp;million Ohioans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Population: 1970, Part 37\u2014Ohio, Section 1|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|year=1970|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_oh1-01.pdf|accessdate=March 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415053910/http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_oh1-01.pdf|archive-date=April 15, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Growth then slowed for the next four decades.<ref>{{cite web|last=Balistreri |first=Kelly |title=Ohio Population News: Why did Ohio lose a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives? |publisher=Center for Family and Demographic Research at [[Bowling Green State University]] |date=February 2001 |url=http://www.bgsu.edu/downloads/cas/file36222.pdf |accessdate=March 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516165832/http://www.bgsu.edu/downloads/cas/file36222.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Ohio was 11,689,100 on July 1, 2019, a 1.32% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=PopEstUS/> Ohio's population growth lags that of the entire United States, and [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] are found in a greater density than the United States average. {{As of|2000}}, Ohio's [[center of population]] is located in [[Morrow County, Ohio|Morrow County]],<ref name=\"POPCENTER\">{{cite web|title=2000 Population and Geographic Centers of Ohio |publisher=Ohio Department of Development, Office of Strategic Research |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.odod.state.oh.us/research/FILES/G101.pdf |accessdate=March 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124004820/http://www.odod.state.oh.us/research/FILES/G101.pdf |archivedate=November 24, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> in the [[county seat]] of [[Mount Gilead, Ohio|Mount Gilead]].<ref name=\"POPCEN\">{{cite web|title=Population and Population Centers by State: 2000 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508041813/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |archivedate=May 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This is approximately {{convert|6346|ft|m}} south and west of Ohio's population center in 1990.<ref name=\"POPCENTER\" />\n[[File:Population Growth Ohio.png|thumb|Graph of Ohio's population growth from 1800 to 2000]]\n\nAs of 2011, 27.6% of Ohio's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.<ref>\"[http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html Americans under age{{nbsp}}1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714084214/http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html |date=July 14, 2016 }}\".

One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as \"Main Market Route 3\", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic [[Lincoln Highway]] which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], and [[Van Wert, Ohio|Van Wert]]. The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Ohio was a major influence on the development of the state. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became [[U.S. Route 30 in Ohio|U.S. Route 30]].\n\nOhio also is home to {{convert|228|mi|km|0}} of the Historic [[National Road]], now [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]].\n\nOhio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate highways. Major east-west through routes include the [[Ohio Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 80 in Ohio|I-80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]]) in the north, [[Interstate 76 in Ohio|I-76]] through [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] to [[Pennsylvania]], [[Interstate 70 in Ohio|I-70]] through [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], and the [[Appalachian Highway (Ohio)|Appalachian Highway]] ([[Ohio State Route 32|State Route 32]]) running from [[West Virginia]] to [[Cincinnati]]. Major north\u2013south routes include [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|I-75]] in the west through [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], Dayton, and Cincinnati, [[Interstate 71|I-71]] through the middle of the state from [[Cleveland]] through Columbus and Cincinnati into [[Kentucky]], and [[Interstate 77 in Ohio|I-77]] in the eastern part of the state from Cleveland through Akron, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]] and [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] south into West Virginia. Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton is one of the heaviest traveled sections of interstate in Ohio.\n\nOhio also has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes. Many of them follow [[rail trail]]s, with conversion ongoing. The [[Ohio to Erie Trail]] (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. [[U.S. Bicycle Route 50]] traverses Ohio from [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] to the Indiana state line outside [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]].<ref name=\"USRN USBR 50\">{{cite web|title=Report to SCOH|first=Marty|last=Vitale|location=Louisville, Kentucky|publisher=Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering, [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]]|date=May 29, 2014|accessdate=June 1, 2014|url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/USRN%20Report%20May%2029%202014.docx|format=Office Open XML|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105136/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/USRN%20Report%20May%2029%202014.docx|archivedate=May 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOhio has several long-distance hiking trails, the most prominent of which is the [[Buckeye Trail]] which extends {{convert|1444|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} in a loop around the state of Ohio. Part of it is on roads and part is on wooded trail. Additionally, the [[North Country Trail]] (the longest of the eleven [[National Scenic Trail]]s authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]]) and the [[American Discovery Trail]] (a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast route across the mid-tier of the [[United States]]) pass through Ohio. Much of these two trails coincide with the Buckeye Trail.\n\n===Air travel===\n\n{{See also|List of airports in Ohio}}\n\nOhio has five international airports, four commercial, and two military. The five international include [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]], [[John Glenn Columbus International Airport]], and [[Dayton International Airport]], Ohio's third largest airport. [[Akron Fulton International Airport]] handles cargo and for private use. [[Rickenbacker International Airport]] is one of two military airfields which is also home to the 7th largest FedEx building in America.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The other military airfield is [[Wright Patterson Air Force Base]] which is one of the largest Air Force bases in the United States.

Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found in [[Education in the United States|other states]]. At the State level, the Ohio Department of Education, which is overseen by the [[Ohio State Board of Education]], governs primary and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level, there are approximately 700 school districts statewide. The [[Ohio Board of Regents]] coordinates and assists with Ohio's institutions of higher education which have recently been reorganized into the [[University System of Ohio]] under Governor Strickland. The system averages an annual enrollment of more than 400,000 students, making it one of the five largest state university systems in the U.S.\n[[File:Tree Map of Majors in Ohio (Bachelor's Degree).png|thumb|upright=2|A treemap depicting the distribution of bachelor's degrees awarded in Ohio in 2014]]\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n\n{{Main|List of colleges and universities in Ohio}}\n\nOhio schools consistently ranking in the top 50 nationally of the [[U.S. News & World Report]] of liberal arts colleges are [[Kenyon College]], [[Oberlin College]], and [[Denison University]].

The State took an increasingly hard line, and [[insurgency|insurgencies]], encouraged by Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led to the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]], the gradual breakup of the [[Somali Armed Forces]]s, and the toppling of Barre's government on 26 January 1991. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime.

Forming the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), the alliance was tasked with assuring security until humanitarian efforts were transferred to the UN.

Local media shortly afterwards alleged that she had returned to Somalia for a five-month stay while still receiving welfare payments. Gurhan admitted in an interview to collecting welfare and having briefly traveled to Somalia in late 1991. However, it was later brought to light that she had been granted [[landed immigrant]] status in June 1991, thereby making her a legal resident of Canada. Additionally, Aidid's rival President Barre had been overthrown in January of that year. This altogether ensured that Gurhan's five-month trip would not have undermined her initial 1989 claim of refugee status. An official probe by Canadian immigration officials into the allegations also concluded that she had obtained her landing papers through normal legal processes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Scott|title=Tory probe into warlord's wife too late to save Lewis|url=http://contests.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_11.04.93/NEWS/med1104.php|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Eye Weekly|date=4 November 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028230350/http://contests.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_11.04.93/NEWS/med1104.php|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Hussein Mohamed Farrah]], son of General Aidid, emigrated to the United States when he was 17 years old.

The State took an increasingly hard line, and [[insurgency|insurgencies]], encouraged by Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led to the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]], the gradual breakup of the [[Somali Armed Forces]]s, and the toppling of Barre's government on 26 January 1991. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by [[United Somali Congress]] (USC) commanders General Aidid and [[Ali Mahdi Mohamed]], in particular, clashed as each sought to exert power over the capital.<ref name=\"Lirs\">Library Information and Research Service, ''The Middle East: Abstracts and Index'', Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p.327.</ref> However, Aidid failed to attract many Somali leaders and intellectuals to the USC's cause, including fellow Frunze graduate General [[Abdullahi Ahmed Irro]], who opted instead to remain politically neutral.<ref name=\"Ahmed\" />\n\n[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 733]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 746|UN Security Council Resolution 746]] led to the creation of the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I|UNOSOM I]] after the dissolution of the central government. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794]] was unanimously passed on December 3, 1992, which approved a coalition led by the [[United States]]. Forming the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), the alliance was tasked with assuring security until humanitarian efforts were transferred to the UN. Landing in 1993, the UN peacekeeping coalition started the two-year [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II]] (UNOSOM II) primarily in the south.<ref>[[Ken Rutherford (scientist)|Ken Rutherford]], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565492609 ''Humanitarianism Under Fire: The US and UN Intervention in Somalia'', Kumarian Press, July 2008] {{ISBN|1-56549-260-9}}</ref>\n\n==Presidency declaration==\nAidid subsequently declared himself President of Somalia in June 1995.<ref name=PRESIDENT-AIDIDS-SOMALIA>{{cite web|title=President Aidid's Somalia|url=http://www.h-net.org/~africa/confrpt/marcus.html|date=September 1995|accessdate=2007-02-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716002145/http://www.h-net.org/~africa/confrpt/marcus.html|archivedate=2009-07-16}}</ref> However, his declaration received no international recognition, as his rival Ali Mahdi Muhammad had already been elected interim president at a conference in [[Djibouti]] and recognized as such by the [[international community]].<ref>[https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/5267/ubc_1994-0415.pdf?sequence=1 Djibouti Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316145832/https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/5267/ubc_1994-0415.pdf?sequence=1 |date=2012-03-16 }}.</ref>\n\nConsequently, Aidid's faction continued its quest for [[hegemony]] in the south.

Local media shortly afterwards alleged that she had returned to Somalia for a five-month stay while still receiving welfare payments. Gurhan admitted in an interview to collecting welfare and having briefly traveled to Somalia in late 1991. However, it was later brought to light that she had been granted [[landed immigrant]] status in June 1991, thereby making her a legal resident of Canada. Additionally, Aidid's rival President Barre had been overthrown in January of that year. This altogether ensured that Gurhan's five-month trip would not have undermined her initial 1989 claim of refugee status. An official probe by Canadian immigration officials into the allegations also concluded that she had obtained her landing papers through normal legal processes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Scott|title=Tory probe into warlord's wife too late to save Lewis|url=http://contests.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_11.04.93/NEWS/med1104.php|accessdate=18 February 2013|newspaper=Eye Weekly|date=4 November 1993|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028230350/http://contests.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_11.04.93/NEWS/med1104.php|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Hussein Mohamed Farrah]], son of General Aidid, emigrated to the United States when he was 17 years old.
