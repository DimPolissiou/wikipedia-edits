His nephew  [[Charles I of Hungary]] (1307\u20131342) exalted his image and veneration, consecrating churches and a monastery in the settlement of [[Lipova, Arad|Lippa]] in his honor, and giving the name of the saint to his eldest son, who later succeeded him on the throne as [[Louis I of Hungary]] (1342\u20131382).\n\nSt Louis of Toulouse was not otherwise widely venerated in the rest of Europe, but the Franciscans embraced him, keeping his day in their calendar and removing his [[relic]]s in 1423 to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], where he was made its patron saint.\n\nHe can be recognized in [[iconography]] as a young bishop, usually wearing a brown or grey Franciscan habit under his cope.  The cope is usually decorated with the French fleur-de-lys.  Sometimes there is a discarded crown by his feet.\n\nA [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[motet]], ''Flos''/''Celsa''/''Quam magnus pontifex'', was written in honor of Louis's canonization in 1317. The piece appears anonymously in the [[Ivrea Codex]] and has been attributed by modern scholars to [[Philippe de Vitry]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa]], a Franciscan mission in California founded in 1772, is named for him as are the surrounding city and county of [[San Luis Obispo, California]].\n\n[[MERU, Holland|Kolleg St Ludwig]] in [[Vlodrop]], the Netherlands, was dedicated to him (not to be confused with Saint Louis of France, who was king of France and undertook many crusades). The college was founded by Franciscan friars in 1905. It had more than 3000 students until the college was closed and sold in 1984. The building had a large statue of Saint Ludwig of Toulouse on the front of the building. The statue has recently been removed from the building and placed beside the road side on the road from Vlodrop to the college (as a road altar) with a short inscription. The building is preserved as a national monument, even though the present owners ([[Transcendental Meditation movement]]) have torn parts of it down.<ref name=Max>{{cite news|title=A Guru's Goals Still Center on Peace and Love|first=Arthur|last=Max|work=The Washington Post|date=February 19, 2006|page=D.01}}</ref> A Vlodrop hotel is also named for Saint Ludwig.<ref>[http://www.stludwig.nl/ St Ludwig Hotel Restaurant]</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
