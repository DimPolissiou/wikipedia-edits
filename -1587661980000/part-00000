Over the years, the school has been heavily criticized for its mascot, the Indians.\n\n==History==\nThis school opened in 1956, having moved from its location in [[Katonah]], which is now Katonah Elementary School, still part of the Katonah-Lewisboro School District. Prior to the [[settler colonialism]] of the late 17th century, this land belonged to [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]], sachem of the Ramapo Indians and the primary proprietor of the lands around [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], including the lands upon which John Jay High School was constructed.<ref name=\"Melvin\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/05/nyregion/indians-no-more-john-jay-vote-rejects-school-s-symbol.html|title=Indians No More?

The extract included the word \"[[vagina]]\", and the girls had been asked to edit the word out because of the expected crowd which would include many young children. They said they would follow this order but then disobeyed (they underlined the word by saying it in unison). The school gave them a one-day suspension - not for what was said, but for their insubordination. The girls decided not to appeal their suspension. They agreed they had been insubordinate, but the incident was widely reported and the original order criticized as an act of [[censorship]]. Many students protested the punishment to no avail.  However, many students also protested the media's portrayal of the situation, believing that the school had acted correctly and that the girls deserved to be punished for their insubordination, for they had previously agreed not to say the word.  The play's author [[Eve Ensler]] gave the students her support<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312121748/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17535427/ Appearance] on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' by the students, the author and the president of the school district's education board</ref> and was invited by parents for a school visit.

John Jay High School has utilized [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]] as their mascot since their founding. Significant debate has surrounded this choice since the late 1980s. In October 1989, after six months of debates in assemblies and classrooms, John Jay Campus Congress, a coalition of students, parents and faculty, voted to abandon their mascot, [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]]. They claimed that the imagery, including feathers, tomahawks, headdresses, and loin-cloth clad natives spearing buffalo,\u00a0perpetuated negative stereotypes about Native Americans and created false associations of violence and savagery that were then applied as generalizations onto indigenous people as a group.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The October 1989 decision to eliminate the Indian mascot was ultimately rejected, as the community was particularly swayed by a Cherokee faculty member who argued that the mascot was a means to honor the chief.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The school principal at the time, John A. Chambers, also argued for the importance of maintaining tradition and school spirit, and the Indians remained intact.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, in 2017, the controversy came to the fore of public discussion once more. On December 19, 2017, John Jay High School students took a poll aimed at gauging opinions on the mascot's potential removal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/12/12/john-jay-cross-river-indian-mascot-must-go/941857001/|title=lohud.com|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Prior to the poll, numerous student and news publications posted articles surrounding the debate, either outlining an overview of the debate in general<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-to-vote-on-school-mascot-name-change/728923/|title=John Jay Students To Vote On School Mascot Name Change|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-vote-to-keep-indians-nickname/729427/|title=John Jay Students Vote To Keep 'Indians' Nickname|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> or articulating arguments against the maintenance of the current mascot on the grounds of cultural appropriation.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.studio23.com/uncategorized/whats-in-a-name|title=What\u2019s in a Name?|website=Studio 23|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Shelbred\">{{Cite web|url=https://jjhsfocus.com/2444/opinions/the-john-jay-indians-respectful-or-racist/|title=The John Jay Indians \u2013 Respectful or Racist?|last=Shelbred|first=Liz|website=The FOCUS|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> These students cited [[cultural appropriation]] as harmful, claiming those who support the mascot trivialize historical oppression by claiming it \u201chonors\u201d Native Americans.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\"/> Not only that, but arguments have been made that the presence of this mascot, as seen through the lens of cultural appropriation, enables privileged individuals to commercialize the stereotypical imagery, as seen through the numerous sweatshirts, caps, and athletic gear emblazoned with images of arrowheads or headdresses, but simultaneously remain prejudiced against those same individuals off whom they are profiting.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Finally, student activists have cited that the use of an \u201cIndian\u201d as a mascot mirrors a larger-scale issue at hand: the district's lack of consciousness related to Native American history.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Ultimately, despite these arguments, the results of the poll showed that 58% of students were in favor of keeping the mascot.<ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\"/>\n\nTwo years later, on October 17, 2019, a Board of Education meeting created further discussion surrounding the removal of the mascot. In this meeting, the Board agreed that the mascot was dated and not politically correct, and requested the School Superintendent, Andrew Selesnick, make a change on the grounds of adherence to fundamental school principles of inclusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://westchester.news12.com/story/41203148/debate-over-katonah-lewisboros-indian-mascot-picks-up-at-school-board-meeting|title=Debate over Katonah Lewisboro's \u2018Indian\u2019 mascot picks up at school board meeting|website=westchester.news12.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/katonah-lewisboro-school-board-could-be-close-to-replacing-indians-mascot/777766/|title=Katonah-Lewisboro School Board Could Be Close To Replacing Indians Mascot|date=2019-10-18|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2019/10/18/katonah-lewisboro-considering-replacing-john-jay-hss-indian-mascot/4018014002/|title=Kat-Lew board considers replacing John Jay HS's 'Indians' mascot|last=Grosserode|first=Sophie|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In response to this meeting, Selesnick composed a letter on October 18, sharing his thoughts. In this letter, he suggests that the mascot is no longer appropriate and that additional discussion regarding the topic should be encouraged. He cites the need for the school to uphold its adherence to the [[Dignity for All Students Act]], which seeks to provide all students with a safe and supportive environment free from discrimination, intimidation, taunting, harassment, and bullying. Thus, if a student expresses that the school's actions are causing harm, the school is responsible to change its behavior. He also emphasizes the ability to maintain school spirit and tradition without causing offense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.klschools.org/groups/7420/superintendent/101819|title=October 18, 2019 - Katonah - Lewisboro School District|website=www.klschools.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Following this letter, a public conversation was hosted on October 28, 2019, open to community members, district residents, and KLSD faculty and administrators, regarding why the Indians mascot has been a conversation in our District since the late 1980s, why it is again today, and possible steps to move forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/77915927637?aff=efbneb|title=KLSD Learning Cafe: The John Jay mascot and how we move forward together|website=Eventbrite|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Information regarding the contents of this meeting has yet to be released.

Over the years, the school has been heavily criticized for its mascot, the Indians.\n\n==History==\nThis school opened in 1956, having moved from its location in [[Katonah]], which is now Katonah Elementary School, still part of the Katonah-Lewisboro School District. Prior to the [[settler colonialism]] of the late 17th century, this land belonged to [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]], sachem of the Ramapo Indians and the primary proprietor of the lands around [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], including the lands upon which John Jay High School was constructed.<ref name=\"Melvin\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/05/nyregion/indians-no-more-john-jay-vote-rejects-school-s-symbol.html|title=Indians No More?

The extract included the word \"[[vagina]]\", and the girls had been asked to edit the word out because of the expected crowd which would include many young children. They said they would follow this order but then disobeyed (they underlined the word by saying it in unison). The school gave them a one-day suspension - not for what was said, but for their insubordination. The girls decided not to appeal their suspension. They agreed they had been insubordinate, but the incident was widely reported and the original order criticized as an act of [[censorship]]. Many students protested the punishment to no avail.  However, many students also protested the media's portrayal of the situation, believing that the school had acted correctly and that the girls deserved to be punished for their insubordination, for they had previously agreed not to say the word.  The play's author [[Eve Ensler]] gave the students her support<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312121748/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17535427/ Appearance] on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' by the students, the author and the president of the school district's education board</ref> and was invited by parents for a school visit.

John Jay High School has utilized [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]] as their mascot since their founding. Significant debate has surrounded this choice since the late 1980s. In October 1989, after six months of debates in assemblies and classrooms, John Jay Campus Congress, a coalition of students, parents and faculty, voted to abandon their mascot, [[Katonah (Native American leader)|Chief Katonah]]. They claimed that the imagery, including feathers, tomahawks, headdresses, and loin-cloth clad natives spearing buffalo,\u00a0perpetuated negative stereotypes about Native Americans and created false associations of violence and savagery that were then applied as generalizations onto indigenous people as a group.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The October 1989 decision to eliminate the Indian mascot was ultimately rejected, as the community was particularly swayed by a Cherokee faculty member who argued that the mascot was a means to honor the chief.<ref name=\"Melvin\"/> The school principal at the time, John A. Chambers, also argued for the importance of maintaining tradition and school spirit, and the Indians remained intact.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, in 2017, the controversy came to the fore of public discussion once more. On December 19, 2017, John Jay High School students took a poll aimed at gauging opinions on the mascot's potential removal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/12/12/john-jay-cross-river-indian-mascot-must-go/941857001/|title=lohud.com|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Prior to the poll, numerous student and news publications posted articles surrounding the debate, either outlining an overview of the debate in general<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-to-vote-on-school-mascot-name-change/728923/|title=John Jay Students To Vote On School Mascot Name Change|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/john-jay-students-vote-to-keep-indians-nickname/729427/|title=John Jay Students Vote To Keep 'Indians' Nickname|date=2017-12-20|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> or articulating arguments against the maintenance of the current mascot on the grounds of cultural appropriation.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.studio23.com/uncategorized/whats-in-a-name|title=What\u2019s in a Name?|website=Studio 23|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Shelbred\">{{Cite web|url=https://jjhsfocus.com/2444/opinions/the-john-jay-indians-respectful-or-racist/|title=The John Jay Indians \u2013 Respectful or Racist?|last=Shelbred|first=Liz|website=The FOCUS|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> These students cited [[cultural appropriation]] as harmful, claiming those who support the mascot trivialize historical oppression by claiming it \u201chonors\u201d Native Americans.<ref name=\"What\u2019s in a Name\"/> Not only that, but arguments have been made that the presence of this mascot, as seen through the lens of cultural appropriation, enables privileged individuals to commercialize the stereotypical imagery, as seen through the numerous sweatshirts, caps, and athletic gear emblazoned with images of arrowheads or headdresses, but simultaneously remain prejudiced against those same individuals off whom they are profiting.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Finally, student activists have cited that the use of an \u201cIndian\u201d as a mascot mirrors a larger-scale issue at hand: the district's lack of consciousness related to Native American history.<ref name=\"Shelbred\"/> Ultimately, despite these arguments, the results of the poll showed that 58% of students were in favor of keeping the mascot.<ref name=\"dailyvoice.com\"/>\n\nTwo years later, on October 17, 2019, a Board of Education meeting created further discussion surrounding the removal of the mascot. In this meeting, the Board agreed that the mascot was dated and not politically correct, and requested the School Superintendent, Andrew Selesnick, make a change on the grounds of adherence to fundamental school principles of inclusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://westchester.news12.com/story/41203148/debate-over-katonah-lewisboros-indian-mascot-picks-up-at-school-board-meeting|title=Debate over Katonah Lewisboro's \u2018Indian\u2019 mascot picks up at school board meeting|website=westchester.news12.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/lewisboro/schools/katonah-lewisboro-school-board-could-be-close-to-replacing-indians-mascot/777766/|title=Katonah-Lewisboro School Board Could Be Close To Replacing Indians Mascot|date=2019-10-18|website=Lewisboro Daily Voice|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2019/10/18/katonah-lewisboro-considering-replacing-john-jay-hss-indian-mascot/4018014002/|title=Kat-Lew board considers replacing John Jay HS's 'Indians' mascot|last=Grosserode|first=Sophie|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In response to this meeting, Selesnick composed a letter on October 18, sharing his thoughts. In this letter, he suggests that the mascot is no longer appropriate and that additional discussion regarding the topic should be encouraged. He cites the need for the school to uphold its adherence to the [[Dignity for All Students Act]], which seeks to provide all students with a safe and supportive environment free from discrimination, intimidation, taunting, harassment, and bullying. Thus, if a student expresses that the school's actions are causing harm, the school is responsible to change its behavior. He also emphasizes the ability to maintain school spirit and tradition without causing offense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.klschools.org/groups/7420/superintendent/101819|title=October 18, 2019 - Katonah - Lewisboro School District|website=www.klschools.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Following this letter, a public conversation was hosted on October 28, 2019, open to community members, district residents, and KLSD faculty and administrators, regarding why the Indians mascot has been a conversation in our District since the late 1980s, why it is again today, and possible steps to move forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/77915927637?aff=efbneb|title=KLSD Learning Cafe: The John Jay mascot and how we move forward together|website=Eventbrite|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Information regarding the contents of this meeting has yet to be released.

Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both women and men as characters and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=New York|pages=150}}</ref>\n\nThere are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as [[qi]]. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things.<ref>Feuchtwang, Sephan. \u201cChinese Religions.\u201d Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third ed., Routledge, 2016, pp. 150-151.</ref> Included among these forms are humans. Many natural [[Dualistic cosmology|dualities]] (such as [[light and dark]], fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical [[Chinese science]] and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of [[traditional Chinese medicine]],<ref name=Porkert1974>{{cite book|author=Porkert|title=The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=MIT Press|year=1974|isbn=0-262-16058-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/theoreticalfound00pork}}</ref> and a central principle of different forms of [[Chinese martial arts]] and exercise, such as [[baguazhang]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|taijiquan]] (t'ai chi), and [[qigong]] (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages of the ''[[I Ching]]''.\n\nThe notion of duality can be found in many areas, such as [[Duality (CoPs)|Communities of Practice]]. The term \"dualistic-monism\" or [[dialectical monism]] has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful [[paradox]] of simultaneous unity and duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Georges Ohsawa]]|year=1976|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oQqDZnm43mkC&printsec=frontcover|title=The Unique Principle|isbn=978-0-918860-17-0|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light).  Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin yang (i.e. [[taijitu]] symbol) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.\n\nIn [[Taoism|Taoist]] metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of [[Confucianism]] on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of [[Dong Zhongshu]] ({{circa}} 2nd century BC), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor Latener|first=Rodney Leon|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Confucianism|volume=2|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2005|page=869|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8239-4079-0}}\n</ref>\n\n== Linguistic aspects ==\nThese [[Chinese language|Chinese]] terms ''yin'' {{lang|zh|\u9670}} or {{lang|zh|\u9634}} \"shady side\" and ''yang'' {{lang|zh|\u967d}} or {{lang|zh|\u9633}} \"sunny side\" are linguistically analyzable in terms of [[Chinese characters]], [[pronunciations]] and [[etymology]], [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]], [[topography]], and [[loanword]]s.\n\n===Characters===\n[[File:Yin yang (Chinese characters).svg|thumb|upright=0.7|\"''Yin-yang''\" in [[seal script]] (top), Traditional (middle), and Simplified (bottom) Chinese characters]]\nThe [[Traditional Chinese characters]] {{linktext|lang=zh|\u9670}}  and {{linktext|lang=zh|\u967d}} for the words ''y\u012bn'' and ''y\u00e1ng'' are both classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic characters]], combining the semantically significant [[Radical 170|\"mound; hill\" radical]] {{linktext|lang=zh|\u961d}} or {{linktext|lang=zh|\u961c}} with the phonetic indicators ''yin'' {{linktext|lang=zh|\u4f8c}} and ''yang'' {{linktext|lang=zh|\u661c}}.

Ames, \"''Yin'' and ''Yang''\", in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy'', ed. by Antonio S. Cua, Routledge, 2002, 847.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, ''tiandi'' {{lang|zh|\u5929\u5730}} \"heaven and earth\" and ''nann\u00fc'' {{lang|zh|\u7537\u5973}} \"women and men\". ''Yinyang'' meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\".<ref name=\"Ames\" />\n\n==History==\nNeedham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]]. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: \"lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\">Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1956</ref> He then discusses [[Zou Yan]] ({{lang|zh|\u9112\u884d}}; 305 \u2013 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\" />\n\n=== Chinese gender roles ===\n\nIn spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being \"necessary\", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]</ref> Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to \"yin\" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.\n\n==Nature==\nIn [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' at chapter 42.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref>&nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.<ref>Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref> Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:<ref>[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] & [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33</ref>\n*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.\n*Illness is the doorway to health.\n*Tragedy turns to comedy.\n*Disasters turn out to be blessings.\n\n==Symbolism and importance==\nYin is the black side, and yang is the white side. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.<ref>Osgood, Charles E. \"From Yang and Yin to and or but.\" Language 49.2 (1973): 380\u2013412 . [[JSTOR]]</ref>\n\nYin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself.<ref>Li CL.

Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Nylan, Michael (2001), ''The Five \"Confucian\" Classics'' (2001), p. 228.</ref> yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268b</span>) and yang is solid (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268a</span>). These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' \u2631) or more yin (''e.g.'' \u2635) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', \u2630 is heavily yang, while \u2637 is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4dd5</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4ddf</span>). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.\n\n===Taijitu===\n[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|The \"taichi symbol\" (''[[taijitu]]'').]]\n{{Main|Taijitu}}\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is represented by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]\").

''Yinyang'' meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\".<ref name=\"Ames\" />\n\n==History==\nNeedham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]].

For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.<ref>Robin R.

Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:<ref>[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] & [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33</ref>\n*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.\n*Illness is the doorway to health.\n*Tragedy turns to comedy.\n*Disasters turn out to be blessings.\n\n==Symbolism and importance==\nYin is the black side, and yang is the white side. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.<ref>Osgood, Charles E. \"From Yang and Yin to and or but.\" Language 49.2 (1973): 380\u2013412 .

These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' \u2631) or more yin (''e.g.'' \u2635) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', \u2630 is heavily yang, while \u2637 is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4dd5</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4ddf</span>). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.\n\n===Taijitu===\n[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|The \"taichi symbol\" (''[[taijitu]]'').]]\n{{Main|Taijitu}}\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is represented by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]\").

Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in [[Celtic art]] and [[Notitia Dignitatum#Depictions|Roman shield markings]].<ref name=\"Giovanni Monastra (2000)\">Giovanni Monastra: \"[http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html#t24 The \"Yin\u2013Yang\" among the Insignia of the Roman Empire?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925054740/http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html |date=2011-09-25 }},\" \"Sophia,\" Vol. 6, No. 2 (2000)</ref><ref name=\"Late Roman Shield Patterns\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/luke/ueda-sarson/MagisterPeditum.html|title=Late Roman Shield Patterns - Magister Peditum|work=www.ne.jp}}</ref><ref name=\"Helmut Nickel (1992), 146, 5\">Helmut Nickel: \"The Dragon and the Pearl,\" ''Metropolitan Museum Journal,'' Vol. 26 (1991), p. 146, Fn. 5</ref>\n\n===Taijiquan===\n{{main|T'ai chi ch'uan}}\nTaijiquan ({{lang|zh|\u592a\u6781\u62f3}}), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. [[Wu Jianquan]], a famous [[Chinese martial arts]] teacher, described Taijiquan as follows:\n\n{{quotation|Various people have offered different explanations for the name ''Taijiquan''. Some have said: \u2013 'In terms of [[meditation|self-cultivation]], one must train from a state of movement towards a state of stillness. ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' comes about through the balance of ''yin'' and ''yang''. In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of the [[I Ching|changes]] of full and empty, one is constantly internally latent, to not outwardly expressive, as if the ''yin'' and ''yang'' of ''Taiji'' have not yet divided apart.' Others say: 'Every movement of ''Taijiquan'' is based on circles, just like the shape of a ''Taijitu''.
