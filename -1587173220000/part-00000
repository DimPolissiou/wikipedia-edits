It is considered as one of the most polarising movie of Indian cinema. A lot of critics and movie enthusiasts have often cited it as a masterpiece while some part of the audience has criticized it for being too complex for a romantic movie and for Indian audience.It features [[Ranbir Kapoor]] and [[Deepika Padukone]] in lead roles. The [[film score]] and [[soundtrack album]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]], while [[lyrics]] for the songs were written by [[Irshad Kamil]].\n\nFilmed briefly in [[Corsica]], [[Indian cities]]\u2013[[Shimla]], [[Delhi]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Kolkata]]; followed by two-day schedule in [[Tokyo]], the film tells the story of character Ved Vardhan Sahni (played by Kapoor) in three stages\u2013as a nine-year-old child, a 19-year-old adolescent and a 30-year-old adult in a drama-based [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear screenplay]]. \n\nThe film was released on 27 November 2015 to mixed reviews by [[film critics]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Tamasha' review roundup: What critics have to say about Ranbir Kapoor-Deepika Padukone starrer|url = http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tamasha-review-roundup-what-critics-have-say-about-ranbir-kapoor-deepika-padukone-starrer-656814|website = International Business Times, India Edition|access-date = 22 January 2016|first = Suparno|last = Sarkar|date = 27 November 2015}}</ref> However, they widely praised the performances of lead actors but criticised the unsatisfactory togetherness of the plot. The film grossed over {{INR}}136 crore worldwide,<ref name=\"BOI rank\">http://www.boxofficeindia.com/worldwide-total-gross.php?year=2015</ref>.<ref name=\"BOI Tamasha\">http://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=3152</ref>The film received nominations for direction, music and performances of the lead actors, notably Kapoor being nominated under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] category. Padukone won the [[Stardust Award for Best Actress]] and Irshad Kamil won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist|Filmfare Award for Best Lyrics]] for his lyrical work to the [[Tamasha (soundtrack)|soundtrack album of the film]].\n\nMuch like Imtiaz Ali's previous film \"[[Rockstar (2011 film)|Rockstar]]\", and his other movies, despite mixed reviews and average grossing at the box office,the film gained a strong [[cult following]] as time passed. The movie is much talked about in film schools and story writing circles and has seen its ratings rise at [[IMDb]] and other review websites. A lot of articles, discussing the philosophical themes and complex ideas that this movie brings, have started popping up. It is praised for it's brilliant direction, excellent writing, character development and complexity of the plot. The movie is also appreciated for its layered meaning, excellent music and background score the performances from the leads. Over time, it has gained the status of a masterpiece and a movie of true art.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins as an onstage skit as part of a spectacle by Ved ([[Ranbir Kapoor]]) and Tara ([[Deepika Padukone]]). The skit presents monotonous office lives of people in general along with their pasts, which are shown through [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences. The film switches to a flashback, in [[Shimla]], showing a child Ved being fascinated by the stories narrated by a roadside storyteller ([[Piyush Mishra]]) who keeps mixing up his [[character (arts)|characters]].\n\nThe film then shifts to a time where Tara meets an adult Ved while both are holidaying in [[Corsica]]. After instantly connecting, they come up with an amusing verbal pact to keep their real identities undisclosed, with hopes of not falling in love, as they explore the island together. One of their frequent jovial activities include pretending to be movie characters where Ved often poses as [[Don (1978 film)|\"Don\"]] and Tara, as [[Zanjeer (1973 film)|\"Mona Darling\"]]. As their bond grows stronger, Tara realizes she is falling in love with Ved and afterwards, decides to leave Corsica despite their [[romantic friendship]]. The film moves back to another flashback where a young Ved is seen questioning the storyteller about the reason for happy times ending quickly, after noticing a sad part in all of his stories. \n\nIn [[India]], after Tara returns to [[Kolkata]], her father (Nikhil Bhagat) hands her over his [[tea]] business and she expands it by starting a line of tea boutiques, taking the company ahead. Four years later, after going to [[Delhi]] for work, she meets Ved one day, much to her surprise, and learns he is now a product manager. They reveal their original identities and she becomes excited to spend time with him, ready to act on her initial love for him. However, as they spend time together, she notices how vastly his charismatic persona and carefree attitude has changed. He talks differently, behaves more formally at their dates and shows up at a fixed time at her place. His monotonous and tedious lifestyle on a daily basis, from morning to evening in a similar pattern, includes him waking up on time, completing the morning chores, wiping the car, ignoring the [[Hijra (Indian subcontinent)|hijra]] on the way, helping an elderly woman at his office, giving a presentation for work, and, meeting Tara in the evening. Ved, now more reserved, [[proposal (marriage)|proposes]] to Tara with a [[ring (jewellery)|ring]] on his [[birthday]] but she declines as she is unhappy with this reserved version of him. Ved leaves for his home and on the way, the driver (Ishteyak Khan) tells him about how his dreams of becoming a singer were crushed in earning his livelihood. Ved breaks down and his residual mental disorder is triggered.<!--splitting of mental functions, as referred in the article--><ref>{{Cite web|title = Deepika and Ranbir's Chemistry in Tamasha is Electrifying|url = http://www.thequint.com/entertainment/2015/09/22/deepika-and-ranbirs-chemistry-in-tamasha-is-electrifying|website = The Quint|accessdate = 5 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nDue to his [[borderline personality disorder]], Ved ends up upsetting his boss with nonsensical presentations and random behavior display in business meetings. As Ved begs Tara to come back to his life, she indirectly informs him she is fixated in his cheerful personality from Corsica instead of his attitude of simply living by societal conventions. After claiming his lively nature to be his true, undiscovered identity and politely asking him to genuinely figure himself out, Tara tearfully expresses her realization of unintentionally hurting him and apologizes. Frustrated and confused, Ved leaves in tears. The next day, he slightly changes his daily routine at the office, gives the ring to the eunuch and afterwards gets evicted from his workplace for his continuous mindless actions.\n\nVed returns to [[Shimla]] and gets in a tussle with his father, Brijmohan Sahni ([[Javed Sheikh]]), after telling him he had lost his job and had been wandering around for six months. Ved then gains introspection from a [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] in the [[mirror]], as he decides to meet the old storyteller from his childhood in order to complete his own story. Upon their encounter, the old storyteller criticizes Ved's irrationality, and confronts him to complete his own story. This opens Ved's eyes and he goes back to his house where he starts narrating events which happened in their family, using [[theatrics]] and [[metaphors]] in the form of [[Storytelling|storytelling]] to the family audience. Moved by his art of storytelling, Brijmohan forgives him for leaving his job and lets him pursue his life as he wishes.\n\nVed returns to Delhi and accepts the ring being kindly returned to him by the eunuch. Tara, after finishing a business meeting at [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] in [[Tokyo]], is surprised when Ved shows up back with his gleeful attitude and they both happily begin impersonating characters again. The film goes into a flashback and through a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage sequence]], shows Ved in three of his stages as a child, an adolescent and an adult, sequentially. The film cuts back to the onstage skit again, which is in continuation of the opening scene of the film and the elaborated allegorical spectacle, as Ved and Tara prepare for its conclusion. The film ends with Ved taking bow amid the applause of audience.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]] as Ved Vardhan Sahni/Don\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Tara Maheshwari/Mona Darling\n* Yash Sehgal as younger Ved Vardhan Sahni\n* [[Javed Sheikh]] as Brij Mohan Sahni, Ved's father<ref name=\"Chagani 2015\">{{cite web | last=Chagani | first=Anum Rehman | title=Javed Sheikh to play Ranbir Kapoor's father in 'Tamasha' | website=DAWN.COM | date=12 February 2015 | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1163128 | accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Sushma Seth]] as Ved's grandmother\n* [[Vivek Mushran]] as Ved's boss<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|title = Tamasha: Some genuine frights but too much orchestrated silliness|url = http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/tamasha-some-genuine-frights-but-too-much-orchestrated-silliness/20151127.htm|website = Rediff|accessdate = 27 November 2015}}</ref> \n* Kshitij Sharma as Theatre Artist<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7066115/ Official IMDb profile of Kshitij Sharma (Award winning actor and filmmaker)]</ref>\n* Nikhil Bhagat as Tara's father<ref name=\"devlp2\" />\n* Faraaz Servaia as Tara's brother<ref name=\"devlp2\" />\n* Punam Singh as Tea Executive<ref name=\"devlp2\" />\n* [[Piyush Mishra]] as Storyteller\n* [[Ishtiyak Khan]] as auto-rickshaw driver\n* Svetlana Tulasi as the Hindu Goddess Sita <ref>http://www.svetlanatulasi.com</ref>\n* [[Himanshu Sharma]] as Lord Ram, Prince of Ayodhya.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote=\"This thought played in my mind for very long, basically who are we?

The film grossed over {{INR}}136 crore worldwide,<ref name=\"BOI rank\">http://www.boxofficeindia.com/worldwide-total-gross.php?year=2015</ref>.<ref name=\"BOI Tamasha\">http://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=3152</ref>The film received nominations for direction, music and performances of the lead actors, notably Kapoor being nominated under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] category. Padukone won the [[Stardust Award for Best Actress]] and Irshad Kamil won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist|Filmfare Award for Best Lyrics]] for his lyrical work to the [[Tamasha (soundtrack)|soundtrack album of the film]].\n\nMuch like Imtiaz Ali's previous film \"[[Rockstar (2011 film)|Rockstar]]\",despite mix reviews and low box office results,the film is gaining a strong [[Cult following]] from Audiences,as seen from it's rise of popularity like increase in it's IMDB rating and several articles being written on it's philosophical ideas and themes.It is appreciated for it's Brilliant direction,plot,writing, Characters and there developement,the Music and songs,Performances of the lead and the Sheer complexity and message the film conveys through it's plot about society.Many consider it a Masterpiece and film of true art.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins as an onstage skit as part of a spectacle by Ved ([[Ranbir Kapoor]]) and Tara ([[Deepika Padukone]]). The skit presents monotonous office lives of people in general along with their pasts, which are shown through [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences. The film switches to a flashback, in [[Shimla]], showing a child Ved being fascinated by the stories narrated by a roadside storyteller ([[Piyush Mishra]]) who keeps mixing up his [[character (arts)|characters]].\n\nThe film then shifts to a time where Tara meets an adult Ved while both are holidaying in [[Corsica]]. After instantly connecting, they come up with an amusing verbal pact to keep their real identities undisclosed, with hopes of not falling in love, as they explore the island together. One of their frequent jovial activities include pretending to be movie characters where Ved often poses as [[Don (1978 film)|\"Don\"]] and Tara, as [[Zanjeer (1973 film)|\"Mona Darling\"]]. As their bond grows stronger, Tara realizes she is falling in love with Ved and afterwards, decides to leave Corsica despite their [[romantic friendship]]. The film moves back to another flashback where a young Ved is seen questioning the storyteller about the reason for happy times ending quickly, after noticing a sad part in all of his stories. \n\nIn [[India]], after Tara returns to [[Kolkata]], her father (Nikhil Bhagat) hands her over his [[tea]] business and she expands it by starting a line of tea boutiques, taking the company ahead. Four years later, after going to [[Delhi]] for work, she meets Ved one day, much to her surprise, and learns he is now a product manager. They reveal their original identities and she becomes excited to spend time with him, ready to act on her initial love for him. However, as they spend time together, she notices how vastly his charismatic persona and carefree attitude has changed. He talks differently, behaves more formally at their dates and shows up at a fixed time at her place. His monotonous and tedious lifestyle on a daily basis, from morning to evening in a similar pattern, includes him waking up on time, completing the morning chores, wiping the car, ignoring the [[Hijra (Indian subcontinent)|hijra]] on the way, helping an elderly woman at his office, giving a presentation for work, and, meeting Tara in the evening. Ved, now more reserved, [[proposal (marriage)|proposes]] to Tara with a [[ring (jewellery)|ring]] on his [[birthday]] but she declines as she is unhappy with this reserved version of him. Ved leaves for his home and on the way, the driver (Ishteyak Khan) tells him about how his dreams of becoming a singer were crushed in earning his livelihood. Ved breaks down and his residual mental disorder is triggered.<!--splitting of mental functions, as referred in the article--><ref>{{Cite web|title = Deepika and Ranbir's Chemistry in Tamasha is Electrifying|url = http://www.thequint.com/entertainment/2015/09/22/deepika-and-ranbirs-chemistry-in-tamasha-is-electrifying|website = The Quint|accessdate = 5 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nDue to his [[borderline personality disorder]], Ved ends up upsetting his boss with nonsensical presentations and random behavior display in business meetings. As Ved begs Tara to come back to his life, she indirectly informs him she is fixated in his cheerful personality from Corsica instead of his attitude of simply living by societal conventions. After claiming his lively nature to be his true, undiscovered identity and politely asking him to genuinely figure himself out, Tara tearfully expresses her realization of unintentionally hurting him and apologizes. Frustrated and confused, Ved leaves in tears. The next day, he slightly changes his daily routine at the office, gives the ring to the eunuch and afterwards gets evicted from his workplace for his continuous mindless actions.\n\nVed returns to [[Shimla]] and gets in a tussle with his father, Brijmohan Sahni ([[Javed Sheikh]]), after telling him he had lost his job and had been wandering around for six months. Ved then gains introspection from a [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] in the [[mirror]], as he decides to meet the old storyteller from his childhood in order to complete his own story. Upon their encounter, the old storyteller criticizes Ved's irrationality, and confronts him to complete his own story. This opens Ved's eyes and he goes back to his house where he starts narrating events which happened in their family, using [[theatrics]] and [[metaphors]] in the form of [[Storytelling|storytelling]] to the family audience. Moved by his art of storytelling, Brijmohan forgives him for leaving his job and lets him pursue his life as he wishes.\n\nVed returns to Delhi and accepts the ring being kindly returned to him by the eunuch. Tara, after finishing a business meeting at [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] in [[Tokyo]], is surprised when Ved shows up back with his gleeful attitude and they both happily begin impersonating characters again. The film goes into a flashback and through a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage sequence]], shows Ved in three of his stages as a child, an adolescent and an adult, sequentially. The film cuts back to the onstage skit again, which is in continuation of the opening scene of the film and the elaborated allegorical spectacle, as Ved and Tara prepare for its conclusion. The film ends with Ved taking bow amid the applause of audience.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]] as Ved Vardhan Sahni/Don\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Tara Maheshwari/Mona Darling\n* Yash Sehgal as younger Ved Vardhan Sahni\n* [[Javed Sheikh]] as Brij Mohan Sahni, Ved's father<ref name=\"Chagani 2015\">{{cite web | last=Chagani | first=Anum Rehman | title=Javed Sheikh to play Ranbir Kapoor's father in 'Tamasha' | website=DAWN.COM | date=12 February 2015 | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1163128 | accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Sushma Seth]] as Ved's grandmother\n* [[Vivek Mushran]] as Ved's boss<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|title = Tamasha: Some genuine frights but too much orchestrated silliness|url = http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/tamasha-some-genuine-frights-but-too-much-orchestrated-silliness/20151127.htm|website = Rediff|accessdate = 27 November 2015}}</ref> \n* Kshitij Sharma as Theatre Artist<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7066115/ Official IMDb profile of Kshitij Sharma (Award winning actor and filmmaker)]</ref>\n* Nikhil Bhagat as Tara's father<ref name=\"devlp2\" />\n* Faraaz Servaia as Tara's brother<ref name=\"devlp2\" />\n* Punam Singh as Tea Executive<ref name=\"devlp2\" />\n* [[Piyush Mishra]] as Storyteller\n* [[Ishtiyak Khan]] as auto-rickshaw driver\n* Svetlana Tulasi as the Hindu Goddess Sita <ref>http://www.svetlanatulasi.com</ref>\n* [[Himanshu Sharma]] as Lord Ram, Prince of Ayodhya.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote=\"This thought played in my mind for very long, basically who are we?

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing, or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposite to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing, or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer \u2013 C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, amount of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customers wants and needs. B2C demand is primary because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing, or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposite to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing, or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer \u2013 C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, amount of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customers wants and needs. B2C demand is primary because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

The trophy depicts a [[gilded]] [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. The Grammys are the second of the Big Three networks' major music awards held annually (between the [[American Music Award]]s in fall, and [[Billboard Music Award]]s in summer).\n\nIt is considered one of the [[EGOT|four major annual American entertainment awards]], along with the [[Academy Awards]] (film), the [[Emmy Award]]s (television), and the [[Tony Award]]s (theater and Broadway).\n\nThe [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor and respect the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, [[The Recording Academy|the Academy]] overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012.\n\nThe [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] were held on January 26, 2020, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==History==\nThe Grammys had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610020129/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|archive-date=June 10, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would not earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]]. This was the beginning of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the [[phonograph]], [[Thomas Edison]].

[[Adele]] won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and the other three in 2012 and 2017.\n\nOther awards are given for performance and production in specific genres, as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.\n\nBecause of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. The many other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast 'Premiere Ceremony' earlier in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.\n\n===2012 category restructuring===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY\u00ae CONTINUES EVOLUTION OF GRAMMY\u00ae AWARDS|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}</ref> The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.\n\nIn the [[Rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.\n\nIn [[R&B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&B album and other R&B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&B Album]] category.<ref>{{cite web |title=Explanation For Category Restructuring |url=https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring |website=GRAMMY.com |language=en |date=5 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.\n\nThe most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |date=June 4, 2009 |access-date=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190520/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |archive-date=June 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT090605\">{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.\n\nIn the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.\n\nThere were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word \"gospel\" in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore, the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process|title=The Academy Continues Evolution Of GRAMMY Awards Process|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince 2012 there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields.

Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, involving more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is entered in the correct category.\n\nThe resulting lists of eligible entries are circulated to Voting Members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.<ref name=\"VotingProcess\">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.\n\nWhereas members of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings. Instead, they receive access to a private online listening function.\n\n==Final voting==\nAfter nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].<ref name=\"VotingProcess\" /> Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two or more nominees who tie are all considered winners). Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.\n\nIn both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries they may not vote in either round of voting.\n\nThe eligibility period for the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] is October 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8504120/grammy-eligibility-year-close-one-month-early</ref>\n\n==Grammy Legend==\n{{main|Grammy Legend Award}}\n\nA special Grammy Award of merit is awarded intermittently to recognize \"ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field\".<ref name=\"Grammy Legend Award\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |title=Grammy Legend Award |publisher=Grammy.com |access-date=December 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207040854/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |archive-date=December 7, 2010 |df= }}</ref>  It has been called the '''Grammy Legend Award''' and the '''Grammy Living Legend Award''' at different ceremonies.  {{As of|2018|post=,}} only fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.\n\n==Salute to Industry Icons Award==\nThe Salute to Industry Icons Award honors those who have made innovate contributions to the music industry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/clarence-avant-to-be-honored-at-clive-davis-pre-grammy-gala-1203120416/ |title=Clarence Avant to Be Honored at Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Gala   |date=2019-01-28 |website=Variety |language=en |access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8494949/clarence-avant-2019-grammy-salute-industry-icons-award |title=Clarence Avant to Receive 2019 Grammy Salute to Industry Icons Award |website=Billboard |access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref> Recipients include:\n\n* [[Herb Alpert]] & [[Jerry Moss]]\n* [[Irving Azoff]]\n* [[Martin Bandier]]\n* [[Richard Branson]]\n* [[Clive Davis]]\n* [[Shatta Wale]]\n* [[Ahmet Ertegun]]\n* [[David Geffen]]\n* [[Berry Gordy]]\n* [[Lucian Grainge]]\n* [[Jay-Z]]\n* [[Debra L.

[[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.\n\nThe 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles\u2019 [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nIn 2000 the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year.

Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.}}\n\n===Formatting===\nThe Grammys' eligibility period \u2013 which runs from October 1 to September 30 each year<ref>{{Cite web|title = FAQs|url = https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/voting-process/faqs#two |website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref> \u2013 is also a perennial source of complaints and confusion. Because records that are released in the last quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards (the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time), fans often think a favorite artist has been snubbed (e.g., Adele, whose ''25'' was released in November 2015 and so was not nominated that year despite massive sales<ref>{{Cite web|title = Here's Why Adele Wasn't Nominated for Any Grammys This Year |url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adele-grammys-snub-why-wasnt-846425|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = |date = 7 December 2015|first = Erin|last = Strecker}}</ref>). Conversely, the same issue means that the Grammys often recognize work that no longer feels current by the time it wins. [[Taylor Swift]]'s ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', for example, won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album was released in October 2014. The same was the case with [[Adele]]\u2019s ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]''. It was released in November 2015 but received the award in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Truth Behind This Year's Maddening Grammy Nominations|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/brianmcmanus/the-truth-behind-this-years-maddening-grammy-nominations#.qyONGwObxO |website = BuzzFeed|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Racism in Grammy Awards===\nThe Grammys have also been accused of being unfavorable and [[Racism in Grammy Awards|racist]] to [[African American|black]] recording artists. Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] accused the awards in a 2017 interview of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist due to his previous work and heritage. He criticized the snubbing of \"[[One Dance]]\" for the prestigious award of Record of the Year and the nomination of \"[[Hotline Bling]]\" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] despite it not being a rap song.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/drake-meets-semtex-for-more-talk|title=Drake Meets Semtex For More Talk|newspaper=A Nation of Billions|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of \"sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Adele, Beyonc\u00e9, and the Grammys' Fear of Progress |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/adele-beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-progress-25-lemonade/516426/ |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date=February 13, 2017 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> Drake did not attend the 2017 Awards Ceremony where he was nominated.

Steve Knopper of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine believed that she lost due to the Grammy voters being all white males and as well as for her pro-Black performance during the [[Super Bowl 50 halftime show]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-2017-5-reasons-why-adele-won-album-of-the-year-instead-of-beyonce-118375/|title= Grammys 2017: 5 Reasons Why Adele Won Album of the Year Instead of Beyonce\n|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' also criticized Beyonce's loss stating that \"black artists have struggled to win album of the year\". They also felt ''25'' won only due to the album's record-breaking sales rather than having a cultural significance and a large impact that ''Lemonade'' had in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2017/02/13/why-beyonce-lemonade-lost-the-grammys-why-she-should-have-won/97847070/|title=Why Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 'Lemonade' lost the Grammys - and why she should have won|work=USA Today|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> Singer Adele also expressed that ''Lemonade'' should have won over her for Album of the Year, stating in her acceptance speech. In her acceptance speech during the show, she stated:\n{{quote|I can't possibly accept this award. And I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful and gracious. But my artist of my life is Beyonce. And this album to me, the ''Lemonade'' album, is just so monumental. Beyonce, it's so monumental.

Notably at the [[60th Grammy Awards]], New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] made media headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She rumored that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to [[Tom Petty]] but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Award and stated that each of the male nominees were allowed solo performances. Lorde's mother also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article which stated that only nine percent of nominees at the previous six Grammy Awards were women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-lorde-turned-grammy-performance-2230515|title=Here's why Lorde turned down a Grammy performance - NME|date=January 28, 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Following the 60th ceremony, many media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist [[SZA (singer)|SZA]] who did not win in any of her five nominated categories and to the [[Best Pop Solo Performance]] category which was composed of four female nominees but won by [[Ed Sheeran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/grammys-essay-women-artists-2018|title=How the 2018 Grammys failed women artists|publisher=}}</ref> In an interview, [[Neil Portnow]], President of the Recording Academy attracted controversy by stating that female artists need to \"step up\" in order to win awards.

It was reported that Grande felt \"insulted\" when producers refused to allow the singer to perform her latest single \"[[7 Rings]]\". They compromised by having the singer perform the song as part of a medley under the condition that the producers chose the second song, causing Grande to pull out of the show. It was also speculated that the same stipulations were not imposed on the other performers of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/ariana-grande-not-attending-grammys-after-disagreements-with-producers-1203129734/|title=Ariana Grande Not Attending Grammys After Disagreements With Producers|first=Jem|last=Aswad|date=February 5, 2019|website=Variety}}</ref> A few days later, the singer broke her silence when she accused Grammy producer [[Ken Ehrlich]] for lying about why she dropped out of the show. Ehrlich stated that Grande \"felt it was too late for her to pull something together\". Grande responded stating:\n{{quote|I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken, it was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.

The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/atgrammysbehinds0000ehrl }}</ref> [[CBS]] bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by the late [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.\n\nThe Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011, that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract, the network would also air a \"nominations concert\" special in the last week of November where the nominees are released during the special that is exclusive to CBS, rather than the traditional early-morning press conference with a release of the nominations seen with most major awards ceremonies which any network takes as part of a [[press pool]]. This was pulled off after the 2016 concert due to low ratings and criticism about the announcement format, and as of the 2017 nominations, they are revealed during a roundtable conversation about the nominations with Recording Academy representatives during ''[[CBS This Morning]]''. In [[58th Grammy Awards|2016]], the Grammys became the first awards show to be broadcast live in all U.S. territories, and for decades, alongside the [[Academy Awards]], [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and [[Tony Awards]], have aired live in more than 150 countries worldwide.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2019, the Grammys were held on the second Sunday of February (the week after the [[Super Bowl]]), with two exceptions: if that day was February 14 ([[Valentine's Day]]), it was moved to the following day; if it was a [[Winter Olympics]] year, it was held earlier on the last Sunday of January (the week before the [[Super Bowl]]). Starting in 2020, the [[Academy Award]]s ceremony will move back to the second Sunday of February, forcing the Grammys to move back to the last Sunday of January to avoid a conflict with either the Oscars or the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.showbiz411.com/2018/08/08/oscars-vs-grammys-academy-awards-takes-traditional-grammy-award-date-for-2020|title=Grammy Awards Furious Oscars Ambushed Them on Traditional Date: \"It was a very disrespectful move on their part\"|date=August 8, 2018|publisher=[[Showbiz411]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/grammy-awards-air-dates-2020-2021-cbs-1202487764/|title=Grammy Awards Sets Dates For 2020 & 2021|date=October 23, 2018|magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> To allow sufficient time for preparation, the cutoff date for eligible recordings will move from September 30 to August 31.

The trophy depicts a [[gilded]] [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. The Grammys are the second of the Big Three networks' major music awards held annually (between the [[American Music Award]]s in fall, and [[Billboard Music Award]]s in summer).\n\nIt is considered one of the [[EGOT|four major annual American entertainment awards]], along with the [[Academy Awards]] (film), the [[Emmy Award]]s (television), and the [[Tony Award]]s (theater and Broadway).\n\nThe [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor and respect the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, [[The Recording Academy|the Academy]] overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012.\n\nThe [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] were held on January 26, 2020, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==History==\nThe Grammys had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610020129/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|archive-date=June 10, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would not earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]]. This was the beginning of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the [[phonograph]], [[Thomas Edison]].

[[Adele]] won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and the other three in 2012 and 2017.\n\nOther awards are given for performance and production in specific genres, as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.\n\nBecause of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. The many other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast 'Premiere Ceremony' earlier in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.\n\n===2012 category restructuring===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY\u00ae CONTINUES EVOLUTION OF GRAMMY\u00ae AWARDS|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}</ref> The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.\n\nIn the [[Rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.\n\nIn [[R&B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&B album and other R&B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&B Album]] category.<ref>{{cite web |title=Explanation For Category Restructuring |url=https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring |website=GRAMMY.com |language=en |date=5 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.\n\nThe most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |date=June 4, 2009 |access-date=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190520/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |archive-date=June 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT090605\">{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.\n\nIn the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.\n\nThere were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word \"gospel\" in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore, the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process|title=The Academy Continues Evolution Of GRAMMY Awards Process|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince 2012 there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields.

Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, involving more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is entered in the correct category.\n\nThe resulting lists of eligible entries are circulated to Voting Members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.<ref name=\"VotingProcess\">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.\n\nWhereas members of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings. Instead, they receive access to a private online listening function.\n\n==Final voting==\nAfter nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].<ref name=\"VotingProcess\" /> Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two or more nominees who tie are all considered winners). Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.\n\nIn both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries they may not vote in either round of voting.\n\nThe eligibility period for the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] is October 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8504120/grammy-eligibility-year-close-one-month-early</ref>\n\n==Grammy Legend==\n{{main|Grammy Legend Award}}\n\nA special Grammy Award of merit is awarded intermittently to recognize \"ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field\".<ref name=\"Grammy Legend Award\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |title=Grammy Legend Award |publisher=Grammy.com |access-date=December 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207040854/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Legends/ |archive-date=December 7, 2010 |df= }}</ref>  It has been called the '''Grammy Legend Award''' and the '''Grammy Living Legend Award''' at different ceremonies.  {{As of|2018|post=,}} only fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.\n\n==Salute to Industry Icons Award==\nThe Salute to Industry Icons Award honors those who have made innovate contributions to the music industry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/clarence-avant-to-be-honored-at-clive-davis-pre-grammy-gala-1203120416/ |title=Clarence Avant to Be Honored at Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Gala   |date=2019-01-28 |website=Variety |language=en |access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8494949/clarence-avant-2019-grammy-salute-industry-icons-award |title=Clarence Avant to Receive 2019 Grammy Salute to Industry Icons Award |website=Billboard |access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref> Recipients include:\n\n* [[Herb Alpert]] & [[Jerry Moss]]\n* [[Irving Azoff]]\n* [[Martin Bandier]]\n* [[Richard Branson]]\n* [[Clive Davis]]\n* [[Shatta Wale]]\n* [[Ahmet Ertegun]]\n* [[David Geffen]]\n* [[Berry Gordy]]\n* [[Lucian Grainge]]\n* [[Jay-Z]]\n* [[Debra L.

[[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.\n\nThe 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles\u2019 [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nIn 2000 the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year.

Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.}}\n\n===Formatting===\nThe Grammys' eligibility period \u2013 which runs from October 1 to September 30 each year<ref>{{Cite web|title = FAQs|url = https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/voting-process/faqs#two |website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref> \u2013 is also a perennial source of complaints and confusion. Because records that are released in the last quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards (the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time), fans often think a favorite artist has been snubbed (e.g., Adele, whose ''25'' was released in November 2015 and so was not nominated that year despite massive sales<ref>{{Cite web|title = Here's Why Adele Wasn't Nominated for Any Grammys This Year |url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adele-grammys-snub-why-wasnt-846425|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = |date = 7 December 2015|first = Erin|last = Strecker}}</ref>). Conversely, the same issue means that the Grammys often recognize work that no longer feels current by the time it wins. [[Taylor Swift]]'s ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'', for example, won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album was released in October 2014. The same was the case with [[Adele]]\u2019s ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]''. It was released in November 2015 but received the award in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Truth Behind This Year's Maddening Grammy Nominations|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/brianmcmanus/the-truth-behind-this-years-maddening-grammy-nominations#.qyONGwObxO |website = BuzzFeed|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Racism in Grammy Awards===\nThe Grammys have also been accused of being unfavorable and [[Racism in Grammy Awards|racist]] to [[African American|black]] recording artists. Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] accused the awards in a 2017 interview of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist due to his previous work and heritage. He criticized the snubbing of \"[[One Dance]]\" for the prestigious award of Record of the Year and the nomination of \"[[Hotline Bling]]\" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] despite it not being a rap song.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/drake-meets-semtex-for-more-talk|title=Drake Meets Semtex For More Talk|newspaper=A Nation of Billions|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of \"sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Adele, Beyonc\u00e9, and the Grammys' Fear of Progress |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/adele-beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-progress-25-lemonade/516426/ |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date=February 13, 2017 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> Drake did not attend the 2017 Awards Ceremony where he was nominated.

Steve Knopper of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine believed that she lost due to the Grammy voters being all white males and as well as for her pro-Black performance during the [[Super Bowl 50 halftime show]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-2017-5-reasons-why-adele-won-album-of-the-year-instead-of-beyonce-118375/|title= Grammys 2017: 5 Reasons Why Adele Won Album of the Year Instead of Beyonce\n|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' also criticized Beyonce's loss stating that \"black artists have struggled to win album of the year\". They also felt ''25'' won only due to the album's record-breaking sales rather than having a cultural significance and a large impact that ''Lemonade'' had in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2017/02/13/why-beyonce-lemonade-lost-the-grammys-why-she-should-have-won/97847070/|title=Why Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 'Lemonade' lost the Grammys - and why she should have won|work=USA Today|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> Singer Adele also expressed that ''Lemonade'' should have won over her for Album of the Year, stating in her acceptance speech. In her acceptance speech during the show, she stated:\n{{quote|I can't possibly accept this award. And I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful and gracious. But my artist of my life is Beyonce. And this album to me, the ''Lemonade'' album, is just so monumental. Beyonce, it's so monumental.

Notably at the [[60th Grammy Awards]], New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] made media headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She rumored that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to [[Tom Petty]] but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Award and stated that each of the male nominees were allowed solo performances. Lorde's mother also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article which stated that only nine percent of nominees at the previous six Grammy Awards were women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-lorde-turned-grammy-performance-2230515|title=Here's why Lorde turned down a Grammy performance - NME|date=January 28, 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Following the 60th ceremony, many media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist [[SZA (singer)|SZA]] who did not win in any of her five nominated categories and to the [[Best Pop Solo Performance]] category which was composed of four female nominees but won by [[Ed Sheeran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/grammys-essay-women-artists-2018|title=How the 2018 Grammys failed women artists|publisher=}}</ref> In an interview, [[Neil Portnow]], President of the Recording Academy attracted controversy by stating that female artists need to \"step up\" in order to win awards.

It was reported that Grande felt \"insulted\" when producers refused to allow the singer to perform her latest single \"[[7 Rings]]\". They compromised by having the singer perform the song as part of a medley under the condition that the producers chose the second song, causing Grande to pull out of the show. It was also speculated that the same stipulations were not imposed on the other performers of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/ariana-grande-not-attending-grammys-after-disagreements-with-producers-1203129734/|title=Ariana Grande Not Attending Grammys After Disagreements With Producers|first=Jem|last=Aswad|date=February 5, 2019|website=Variety}}</ref> A few days later, the singer broke her silence when she accused Grammy producer [[Ken Ehrlich]] for lying about why she dropped out of the show. Ehrlich stated that Grande \"felt it was too late for her to pull something together\". Grande responded stating:\n{{quote|I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken, it was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.

The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/atgrammysbehinds0000ehrl }}</ref> [[CBS]] bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by the late [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.\n\nThe Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011, that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract, the network would also air a \"nominations concert\" special in the last week of November where the nominees are released during the special that is exclusive to CBS, rather than the traditional early-morning press conference with a release of the nominations seen with most major awards ceremonies which any network takes as part of a [[press pool]]. This was pulled off after the 2016 concert due to low ratings and criticism about the announcement format, and as of the 2017 nominations, they are revealed during a roundtable conversation about the nominations with Recording Academy representatives during ''[[CBS This Morning]]''. In [[58th Grammy Awards|2016]], the Grammys became the first awards show to be broadcast live in all U.S. territories, and for decades, alongside the [[Academy Awards]], [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and [[Tony Awards]], have aired live in more than 150 countries worldwide.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2019, the Grammys were held on the second Sunday of February (the week after the [[Super Bowl]]), with two exceptions: if that day was February 14 ([[Valentine's Day]]), it was moved to the following day; if it was a [[Winter Olympics]] year, it was held earlier on the last Sunday of January (the week before the [[Super Bowl]]). Starting in 2020, the [[Academy Award]]s ceremony will move back to the second Sunday of February, forcing the Grammys to move back to the last Sunday of January to avoid a conflict with either the Oscars or the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.showbiz411.com/2018/08/08/oscars-vs-grammys-academy-awards-takes-traditional-grammy-award-date-for-2020|title=Grammy Awards Furious Oscars Ambushed Them on Traditional Date: \"It was a very disrespectful move on their part\"|date=August 8, 2018|publisher=[[Showbiz411]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/grammy-awards-air-dates-2020-2021-cbs-1202487764/|title=Grammy Awards Sets Dates For 2020 & 2021|date=October 23, 2018|magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> To allow sufficient time for preparation, the cutoff date for eligible recordings will move from September 30 to August 31.

By 1929, it had evolved into a car sales and maintenance business run by his son and namesake [[Charles Todd (New Zealand)|Charles Todd]] after the company began importing motor vehicles.\n\nThis automotive business would define the Todd family business until well into the 1980s. Charles Todd was credited with bringing the first motor car into Otago and in 1908 acquired a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] dealership in [[Dunedin]] then in 1928 acquired the Rootes Group franchise for [[Hillman]], [[Humber]] and [[Commer]] and obtained an Auckland branch.\n\nDuring the protectionist years of the 1930s the Todd family formed Todd Motor Industries Limited and in 1934 built an automotive assembly plant in [[Petone]] to reassemble vehicles imported as parts from [[Chrysler|Chrysler (USA)]] and [[Rootes Group|Rootes]]. According to the Todd Energy website by 1964, Todd Motors was assembling and selling over 10,000 cars per year. In 1970 the company purchased the New Zealand Mitsubishi franchise. This franchise and assembly plants were sold to [[Mitsubishi Motors]] in 1987.\n\nThe Todd family also founded ''Europa'' an oil importing and retail business that owned terminal services at four major ports and a chain of petrol stations across New Zealand. According to the Todd Energy website, this business was founded during disruptions in the petrol industry in 1929. Europa was originally named 'Associated Motorists Petrol Company Limited' (AMPC) and was formed in 1931. The company imported petrol from the Soviet Union from 1933, and was supported by the New Zealand Farmers' Union and various regional Automobile Associations. Because of price under-cutting by overseas oil companies, the government introduced price regulation of petrol from 1933.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/4t20/1\n|title=Todd, Charles - Biography\n|first=Tony |last=Nightingale \n|work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography\n|publisher= Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand\n|date= 30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Todd Energy]], Europa was the first to offer electric petrol pumps in New Zealand, the first to use articulated road tankers for fuel distribution and the first chain to operate service station convenience stores.\n\nThe Todd family also developed interests in the prospecting for, extraction of and refining of petroleum products. In 1954 they acquired prospecting licenses around New Zealand and developed joint venture agreements with Shell Oil New Zealand Limited and BP New Zealand. The discovery of the [[Kapuni]] gas and condensate field in 1959 meant that the Todd family together with Shell and BP became major players in the New Zealand petroleum production business.\n\nLater discoveries in the famous [[Maui gas field]] meant the Todd family was intimately involved in supplying a majority of New Zealand's LPG and CNG natural gas for energy generation as well as fuel for the transport industry. Together with Shell, BP and the Government-owned Petrocorp began production in 1980.\n\nIn 1972 BP New Zealand took a 60 percent interest in Europa, purchasing the company\u2019s marketing and refining interests including the Europa petrol stations. The two retail brands continued to operate independently, however in 1989 they were brought under the BP brand.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/newzealand/corporate_newzealand/STAGING/local_assets/downloads_pdfs/h/history_of_bp_nz.pdf|title=History of BP NZ|publisher=BP}}</ref>\n\nTodd continued its involvement in the exploration and production businesses.\n\nWhen sold to Mitsubishi in 1987, Todd Motors was assembling a wide range of cars, and light and heavy commercial vehicles. During the 1980s the Company held the number two market share position in the New Zealand automobile industry. The sale bought the Todd family's involvement in the New Zealand automotive industry to a close.\n\n==Investments==\nThe Todd Corporation has interests in oil and gas exploration and production, electricity generation, property development, healthcare, minerals, technology.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.toddcorporation.com/content/our-businesses-investments| title=Our Businesses & Investments| publisher=Todd Corporation| accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n* Integria Healthcare\n* Parts Trader Markets\n* Todd Energy\n* Todd Minerals\n* Todd Property\n\n===Previous investments===\n* A 35.0% shareholding in [[Metlifecare Limited]], Todd Capital sold its entire shareholding in November 2005.\n* A 14.2% shareholding in Independent Newspapers Limited (INL)\n* A 25.0% shareholding in [[Clear Communications]]\n* A 20.0% shareholding in [[AAPT Limited]],\n* A 21.0% shareholding in UtiliCorp NZ Inc\n* An interest in [[Sky Network Television]] a pay television operator\n* A 54% shareholding in King Country Energy Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kce.co.nz/get-to-know-us/ |title=About KCE |publisher=King Country Energy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703002929/http://www.kce.co.nz/get-to-know-us/ |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Todd Energy==\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = Todd Energy\n| logo             = [[Image:ToddEnergyLogo.png]]\n| type             = Private \n| traded_as        = \n| foundation       = {{start date|1929}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.toddenergy.co.nz/about/history/| title=History| publisher=Todd Energy| accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n| founder          = \n| location_city    = [[Wellington]]\n| location_country = [[New Zealand]]\n| locations        = \n| area_served      = \n| key_people       = Paul Moore, CEO\n| industry         = Oil Production <br /> [[Natural gas|Natural gas wholesaling]] <br /> [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG wholesaling]]\n| products         = \n| services         = \n| revenue          = \n| operating_income = \n| net_income       = \n| assets           = \n| equity           = \n| owner            = \n| num_employees    = 450\n| parent           = Todd Corporation\n| divisions        =Todd Energy Canada Ltd ('''TEC''') <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.toddenergy.co.nz/about/news/todd-energy-canada-investment/| title=Todd Energy Canada investment| date=27 June 2014| publisher=Todd Energy}}</ref>\n| subsid           = Nova Energy\n| homepage         = [http://www.toddenergy.co.nz/ www.toddenergy.co.nz]\n| footnotes        = \n}}\n'''Todd Energy''' is a diversified energy company based in [[New Zealand]].

By 1929, it had evolved into a car sales and maintenance business run by his son and namesake [[Charles Todd (New Zealand)|Charles Todd]] after the company began importing motor vehicles.\n\nThis automotive business would define the Todd family business until well into the 1980s. Charles Todd was credited with bringing the first motor car into Otago and in 1908 acquired a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] dealership in [[Dunedin]] then in 1928 acquired the Rootes Group franchise for [[Hillman]], [[Humber]] and [[Commer]] and obtained an Auckland branch.\n\nDuring the protectionist years of the 1930s the Todd family formed Todd Motor Industries Limited and in 1934 built an automotive assembly plant in [[Petone]] to reassemble vehicles imported as parts from [[Chrysler|Chrysler (USA)]] and [[Rootes Group|Rootes]]. According to the Todd Energy website by 1964, Todd Motors was assembling and selling over 10,000 cars per year. In 1970 the company purchased the New Zealand Mitsubishi franchise. This franchise and assembly plants were sold to [[Mitsubishi Motors]] in 1987.\n\nThe Todd family also founded ''Europa'' an oil importing and retail business that owned terminal services at four major ports and a chain of petrol stations across New Zealand. According to the Todd Energy website, this business was founded during disruptions in the petrol industry in 1929. Europa was originally named 'Associated Motorists Petrol Company Limited' (AMPC) and was formed in 1931. The company imported petrol from the Soviet Union from 1933, and was supported by the New Zealand Farmers' Union and various regional Automobile Associations. Because of price under-cutting by overseas oil companies, the government introduced price regulation of petrol from 1933.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/4t20/1\n|title=Todd, Charles - Biography\n|first=Tony |last=Nightingale \n|work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography\n|publisher= Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand\n|date= 30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Todd Energy]], Europa was the first to offer electric petrol pumps in New Zealand, the first to use articulated road tankers for fuel distribution and the first chain to operate service station convenience stores.\n\nThe Todd family also developed interests in the prospecting for, extraction of and refining of petroleum products. In 1954 they acquired prospecting licenses around New Zealand and developed joint venture agreements with Shell Oil New Zealand Limited and BP New Zealand. The discovery of the [[Kapuni]] gas and condensate field in 1959 meant that the Todd family together with Shell and BP became major players in the New Zealand petroleum production business.\n\nLater discoveries in the famous [[Maui gas field]] meant the Todd family was intimately involved in supplying a majority of New Zealand's LPG and CNG natural gas for energy generation as well as fuel for the transport industry. Together with Shell, BP and the Government-owned Petrocorp began production in 1980.\n\nIn 1972 BP New Zealand took a 60 percent interest in Europa, purchasing the company\u2019s marketing and refining interests including the Europa petrol stations. The two retail brands continued to operate independently, however in 1989 they were brought under the BP brand.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/newzealand/corporate_newzealand/STAGING/local_assets/downloads_pdfs/h/history_of_bp_nz.pdf|title=History of BP NZ|publisher=BP}}</ref>\n\nTodd continued its involvement in the exploration and production businesses.\n\nWhen sold to Mitsubishi in 1987, Todd Motors was assembling a wide range of cars, and light and heavy commercial vehicles. During the 1980s the Company held the number two market share position in the New Zealand automobile industry. The sale bought the Todd family's involvement in the New Zealand automotive industry to a close.\n\n==Investments==\nThe Todd Corporation has interests in oil and gas exploration and production, electricity generation, property development, healthcare, minerals, technology.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.toddcorporation.com/content/our-businesses-investments| title=Our Businesses & Investments| publisher=Todd Corporation| accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n* Integria Healthcare\n* Parts Trader Markets\n* Todd Energy\n* Todd Minerals\n* Todd Property\n\n===Previous investments===\n* A 35.0% shareholding in [[Metlifecare Limited]], Todd Capital sold its entire shareholding in November 2005.\n* A 14.2% shareholding in Independent Newspapers Limited (INL)\n* A 25.0% shareholding in [[Clear Communications]]\n* A 20.0% shareholding in [[AAPT Limited]],\n* A 21.0% shareholding in UtiliCorp NZ Inc\n* An interest in [[Sky Network Television]] a pay television operator\n* A 54% shareholding in King Country Energy Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kce.co.nz/get-to-know-us/ |title=About KCE |publisher=King Country Energy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703002929/http://www.kce.co.nz/get-to-know-us/ |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Todd Energy==\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = Todd Energy\n| logo             = [[Image:ToddEnergyLogo.png]]\n| type             = Private \n| traded_as        = \n| foundation       = {{start date|1929}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.toddenergy.co.nz/about/history/| title=History| publisher=Todd Energy| accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n| founder          = \n| location_city    = [[Wellington]]\n| location_country = [[New Zealand]]\n| locations        = \n| area_served      = \n| key_people       = Paul Moore, CEO\n| industry         = Oil Production <br /> [[Natural gas|Natural gas wholesaling]] <br /> [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG wholesaling]]\n| products         = \n| services         = \n| revenue          = \n| operating_income = \n| net_income       = \n| assets           = \n| equity           = \n| owner            = \n| num_employees    = 450\n| parent           = Todd Corporation\n| divisions        =Todd Energy Canada Ltd ('''TEC''') <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.toddenergy.co.nz/about/news/todd-energy-canada-investment/| title=Todd Energy Canada investment| date=27 June 2014| publisher=Todd Energy}}</ref>\n| subsid           = Nova Energy\n| homepage         = [http://www.toddenergy.co.nz/ www.toddenergy.co.nz]\n| footnotes        = \n}}\n'''Todd Energy''' is a diversified energy company based in [[New Zealand]].
