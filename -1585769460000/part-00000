The far western end of the street only became known as Westbourne Grove relatively recently in 1938, having previously been called Archer Street.  In 1929, the novelist [[A.J.

The area is first recorded in 1222 as Westeburn.  Westbourne Green is first recorded as Westborne Grene in 1548. Westbourne Green formed part of the parish of [[Paddington]].\n\nThere was a small settlement to the north of what is now Westbourne Grove at Westbourne Green.  It had five main houses.  The largest of these was Westbourne Place or Westbourne House, which was rebuilt in 1745 by the architect Isaac Ware as an elegant Georgian mansion of three storeys with a frontage of nine windows divided into three parts.  The central third was topped by a large pediment and contained the main door, which also had a pediment over it.  The lower two storeys were formed into bays at each end, which contained three windows each.  Amongst the well-known residents of this house were Sir William Yorke, baronet; the Venetian ambassador; the architect [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] (a great great nephew of the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]]); and the General Commander in Chief of the Army, Viscount Hill, who left in 1836 (and who gave his name to the modern road bridge north of Westbourne Grove called Lord Hill's Bridge).  The house was demolished in 1836 to make way for the houses and gardens of what is now Westbourne Park Villas.  [[Thomas Hardy]] lived in this area, mainly at no 16 Westbourne Park Villas, which was his home 1863\u201367.\n\nAlso north of what is now Westbourne Grove was Westbourne Farm which was the home, between 1815 - 1817, of the actress [[Sarah Siddons]], who lived there with her daughter.

Sometime in the middle of the 18th century, the municipality is part of the township of Allabok which covers the moderate slopes of the mountain ranges overlooking the China Sea. During those times, war tribes was prevalent. Allabok involved itself in a tribal war headed by Bagulin who led the community to victory. From then on until his death, the people highly regarded him as their noble leader. After his death, consensus with the residents together with the concurrence of Spanish authorities resulted in naming the community after Bagulin. At present, Kankanaey still dominate the town\u2019s population.\n\nAnother etymological version states that \"Bagulin\" was derived from the term ''bago'' which means \"lowland natives\". This version is further supported by the fact that [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]]s comprise some 85% of the municipal population.\n\n==Geography==\nBagulin is situated at the interior eastern portion of La Union. It is generally mountainous and forested. It is bounded by the following municipalities:\n* North \u2014 [[San Gabriel, La Union|San Gabriel]]\n* West \u2014 City of [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]]\n* Southwest \u2014 [[Naguilian, La Union|Naguilian]]\n* South \u2014 [[Burgos, La Union|Burgos]]\n* East \u2014 [[Kapangan, Benguet|Kapangan]]\n\nBagulin is {{convert|31|km}} away from San Fernando, the regional center, {{convert|14|km}} away from Naguilian, its nearby town and {{convert|62|km}} away from Baguio City. Its main entrance to lowland municipalities is through the Naguilian-Bagulin Road. It can be reached by vehicles and any regular means of transportation via the town of Naguilian.\n\n===Barangays===\nBagulin is politically subdivided into 10 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n* Alibangsay\n* Baay\n* Cambaly\n* Cardiz\n* Dagup\n* Libbo\n* Suyo (''[[Poblacion]]'')\n* Tagudtud\n* Tio-angan\n* Wallayan\n{{div col end}}\n\n==History==\nThe community was moved to Picdel, a narrow valley strip along Naguilian-Bagulin river. By 1903, the American regime established a paramilitary government and institutional facilities. Education was introduced and a bamboo community hall roofed with cogon was erected. As of 1903, the community was under the jurisdiction of the Mountain Province, sub-province of Benguet with capital at La Trinidad. By 1918, under the agreement of Governor Guzman of Mt. Province and Governor Pio Ancheta of La Union, Bagulin became a municipal district of Burgos under the province of La Union.\n\nBy 1928, the community centers was moved to a nearby settlement called Suyo where the present town center is situated. The former community center was named \u201cNangalisan\u201d which means an abandoned place in the Ilokano language. Settlers who improved Suyo were Ilokano people who came from Naguilian. At that time, a bamboo chalet was constructed to serve as an administrative hall. The administration then was composed of the Mayor, a Secretary-Treasurer and one policeman. Municipal income is very small that the administration had to prod reluctant taxpayers to pay their dues.\n\nOn June 25, 1963, Bagulin was transformed into a regular, full-pledged municipality by virtue of ''Executive Order No. 42''.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bagulin\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = 2419\n| 1939 = 3584\n| 1948 = 3101\n| 1960 = 4407\n| 1970 = 5338\n| 1975 = 6423\n| 1980 = 7009\n| 1990 = 9418\n| 1995 = 10780\n| 2000 = 11857\n| 2007 = 12521\n| 2010 = 12590\n| 2015 = 13456\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Bagulin was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==National Cultural Treasure==\nThe town is home to one National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines, which is the Burial Caves of Sitio Alabok in Barangay Cambali.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=150px>\nFvfBagulin0115 39.JPG|Municipal hall\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0279 07.JPG|Police station\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0076 24.JPG|Street view\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0279 25.JPG|Landscape\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0076 10.JPG|[[Thysanolaena maxima|Tiger grass]], used for making soft brooms\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051226090252/http://www.bagulin.gov.ph/ Municipality of Bagulin]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120523033553/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=2&frmIdProvince=20&frmIdLgu=262 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Bagulin\n|North     = [[San Gabriel, La Union|San Gabriel]]\n|East      = [[Kapangan, Benguet]]\n|South     = [[Burgos, La Union|Burgos]]\n|Southwest = [[Naguilian, La Union|Naguilian]]\n|West      = [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]]\n}}\n{{La Union}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of La Union]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                   = {{PH wikidata|name}}\n| image_skyline          = File:FvfBagulin0115 37.JPG\n| image_caption          = Bagulin town center\n| image_seal             = Ph seal la union bagulin.jpg\n| seal_size              = 100x80px\n| image_map              = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption            = {{PH wikidata|map_caption}}\n| image_map1             = {{Infobox mapframe|id={{#invoke:Wikibase|id}}}}\n| pushpin_map            = Philippines\n| pushpin_label_position = left\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location within the {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| coordinates            = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| settlement_type        = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| subdivision_type1      = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1      = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| subdivision_type2      = [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2      = {{PH wikidata|province}}\n| official_name          = {{PH wikidata|official_name}}\n| native_name            =\n| other_name             =\n| nickname               =\n| motto                  =\n| anthem                 =\n| subdivision_type3      = [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|District]]\n| subdivision_name3      = [[Legislative districts of La Union#2nd District|2nd District]]\n| established_title      = Founded\n| established_date       = 1963\n| parts_type             = [[Barangay]]s\n| parts_style            = para\n| p1                     = 10 (see [[#Barangays|Barangays]])\n| leader_title           = {{PH wikidata|leader_title}} <!--mayor-->\n| leader_name            = Virgilio C.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\nTradition reveals that Bagulin derived its name from a Kankanaey tribal leader. Sometime in the middle of the 18th century, the municipality is part of the township of Allabok which covers the moderate slopes of the mountain ranges overlooking the China Sea. During those times, war tribes was prevalent. Allabok involved itself in a tribal war headed by Bagulin who led the community to victory. From then on until his death, the people highly regarded him as their noble leader. After his death, consensus with the residents together with the concurrence of Spanish authorities resulted in naming the community after Bagulin. At present, Kankanaey still dominate the town\u2019s population.\n\nAnother etymological version states that \"Bagulin\" was derived from the term ''bago'' which means \"lowland natives\". This version is further supported by the fact that [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]]s comprise some 85% of the municipal population.\n\n==Geography==\nBagulin is situated at the interior eastern portion of La Union. It is generally mountainous and forested. It is bounded by the following municipalities:\n* North \u2014 [[San Gabriel, La Union|San Gabriel]]\n* West \u2014 City of [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]]\n* Southwest \u2014 [[Naguilian, La Union|Naguilian]]\n* South \u2014 [[Burgos, La Union|Burgos]]\n* East \u2014 [[Kapangan, Benguet|Kapangan]]\n\nBagulin is {{convert|31|km}} away from San Fernando, the regional center, {{convert|14|km}} away from Naguilian, its nearby town and {{convert|62|km}} away from Baguio City. Its main entrance to lowland municipalities is through the Naguilian-Bagulin Road. It can be reached by vehicles and any regular means of transportation via the town of Naguilian.\n\n==Barangays==\nBagulin is politically subdivided into 10 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n* Alibangsay\n* Baay\n* Cambaly\n* Cardiz\n* Dagup\n* Libbo\n* Suyo (''[[Poblacion]]'')\n* Tagudtud\n* Tio-angan\n* Wallayan\n{{div col end}}\n\n==History==\nThe community was moved to Picdel, a narrow valley strip along Naguilian-Bagulin river. By 1903, the American regime established a paramilitary government and institutional facilities. Education was introduced and a bamboo community hall roofed with cogon was erected. As of 1903, the community was under the jurisdiction of the Mountain Province, sub-province of Benguet with capital at La Trinidad. By 1918, under the agreement of Governor Guzman of Mt. Province and Governor Pio Ancheta of La Union, Bagulin became a municipal district of Burgos under the province of La Union.\n\nBy 1928, the community centers was moved to a nearby settlement called Suyo where the present town center is situated. The former community center was named \u201cNangalisan\u201d which means an abandoned place in the Ilokano language. Settlers who improved Suyo were Ilokano people who came from Naguilian. At that time, a bamboo chalet was constructed to serve as an administrative hall. The administration then was composed of the Mayor, a Secretary-Treasurer and one policeman. Municipal income is very small that the administration had to prod reluctant taxpayers to pay their dues.\n\nOn June 25, 1963, Bagulin was transformed into a regular, full-pledged municipality by virtue of ''Executive Order No. 42''.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bagulin\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = 2419\n| 1939 = 3584\n| 1948 = 3101\n| 1960 = 4407\n| 1970 = 5338\n| 1975 = 6423\n| 1980 = 7009\n| 1990 = 9418\n| 1995 = 10780\n| 2000 = 11857\n| 2007 = 12521\n| 2010 = 12590\n| 2015 = 13456\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Bagulin was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==National Cultural Treasure==\nThe town is home to one National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines, which is the Burial Caves of Sitio Alabok in Barangay Cambali.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=150px>\nFvfBagulin0115 39.JPG|Municipal hall\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0279 07.JPG|Police station\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0076 24.JPG|Street view\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0279 25.JPG|Landscape\nFile:FvfBagulinLU0076 10.JPG|[[Thysanolaena maxima|Tiger grass]], used for making soft brooms\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051226090252/http://www.bagulin.gov.ph/ Municipality of Bagulin]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120523033553/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=2&frmIdProvince=20&frmIdLgu=262 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Bagulin\n|North     = [[San Gabriel, La Union|San Gabriel]]\n|East      = [[Kapangan, Benguet]]\n|South     = [[Burgos, La Union|Burgos]]\n|Southwest = [[Naguilian, La Union|Naguilian]]\n|West      = [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]]\n}}\n{{La Union}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of La Union]]\n", "name_user": "P199", "label": "safe", "comment": "map formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagulin"}

{"title_page": "Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825", "text_new": "{{Campaignbox Greek War of Independence}}\nThe '''[[Greek War of Independence]]''' was marked by two '''civil wars''', which took place in 1824&ndash;1825. The conflict had both political and regional dimensions, as it pitted the Roumeliotes (the people of [[Continental Greece]]) and the Islanders (the shipowners, especially from [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] island), against the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesians]] or [[Morea|Moreotes]]. It divided the young nation, and seriously weakened the military preparedness of the [[Greeks|Greek]] forces in the face of the oncoming [[History of Ottoman Egypt|Egyptian]] intervention in the conflict.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kolokotronis01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], one of the main military leaders of the Greeks. The Peloponnese was his powerbase.]]\n\nBy the end of March 1821, the [[Peloponnese]] was in open revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and by October 1821 the Greeks under [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] had already captured [[Kalamata]] and [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. After the fall of Kalamata, the Messenian Senate, the first of the Greeks' local governing councils, held its inaugural session. At almost the same time, the Achean Directorate was summoned in Patras. With the initiative of the Messenian Senate, a Peloponnesian assembly convened, and elected on May 26 a Senate. Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] in the western part, and [[Theodoros Negris]] in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two [[Greek local statutes|local statutes]], the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece. The statutes provided for the creation of two local administrative organs in Central Greece, an [[Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece|Areopagus]] in the east, and a [[Senate of Western Continental Greece|Senate]] in the west.<ref>Koliopoulos & Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', pp. 14&ndash;17.<br/>* Papageorgiou, \"First Year of Freedom\", pp. 67&ndash;70.</ref> The three local statutes were recognized by the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus|First National Assembly]], but  were later dissolved by the [[Second National Assembly at Astros|Second National Assembly]].<ref>Koliopoulos & Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', pp. 19&ndash;20.<br/>* Theodoridis, \"A Modern State\", pp. 129&ndash;130.</ref>\n\nThe First National Assembly was formed at [[Epidaurus]] in late December 1821, consisted almost exclusively of Peloponnesian notables. The Assembly composed the [[Greek Constitution of 1822|first Greek Constitution]] and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of no significance.<ref>Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 87-9.</ref> Military leaders and representative of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate, which was not dissolved by the National Assembly. The Senate actually governed Peloponnese, while the central government was too weak to exercise its power. Seeing the impasse and the growing power of the Peloponnesian captains, Mavrokordatos and the Hydriots proposed the dissolution of the Senate and its incorporation into the National Assembly. Mavromichalis accepted the proposal, but the military leaders rejected it. After the rejection of the proposal, the central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis who controlled the fort of [[Nafplion]]. In November 1822, the central administration promulgated the law for the election of representative for the new National Assembly, but Kolokotronis defied the law, and declared that Peloponnese will organize its own assembly for the elections of the new members of the Senate.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 143&ndash;148</ref>\n\n==First civil war==\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825\n| partof      = the [[Greek War of Independence]]\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| date        = autumn 1823 \u2013 June 1824\n| place       = [[Peloponnese]]\n| map_type    = \n| map_size    = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| result      = Agreement between the two factions, partial victory of the Government\n| status      = \n| combatant1  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Kodjabashis|Primates]] and supporters of the Government\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon image|Greek Revolution flag.svg}} Military leaders and supporters of [[Philiki Etaireia]]\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]]\n| commander2  = {{flagicon image|Greek Revolution flag.svg}} [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]\n| strength1   = \n| strength2   =  \n}}\n\nThe provisional government decided that the National Assembly would take place in Nafplio, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and proposed that the Assembly take place in Nafplion, while the city remained under his control. His stance divided his supporters and weakened him politically. Most of the members of the Peloponnesian Senate obeyed the decisions of the government, and the captains were forced to negotiate their participation in the Assembly. Finally, the Second National Assembly was gathered in March 1823 in [[Astros, Greece|Astros]]. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of regional bodies, a [[Greek Constitution of 1823|new constitution]] was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and legislative bodies.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 148&ndash;151</ref>\n\nTrying to coax the military leaders, the central administration proposed to Kolokotronis to participate in the executive body as vice-president. Kolokotronis accepted, but his actions caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused the rage of the members of the legislative body, which was controlled by the [[Continental Greece|Roumeliotes]] and the [[Hydra Island|Hydriots]]. Both Kolokotronis and his president in the executive, [[Petros Mavromichalis]], were harshly criticized by the members of the legislative body.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 152&ndash;154</ref> The crisis culminated when the legislative overturned the executive and dismissed its members. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, some Achaean notables&mdash;[[Andreas Zaimis]] and [[Andreas Londos]] were the most prominent&mdash;and others, such as Papaflessas, was formed at [[Kranidi]] with [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Kountouriotis]] as president.\n\nThe war started in early March 1824, when the government asked [[Panos Kolokotronis]] to surrender Nafplion. Panos denied and the government decided to besiege the city. On 22 March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Tripolitsa, and after two weeks of fighting an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from the one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other. The old executive was finally dissolved, and Kolokotronis fled the city. On 22 May the first phase of the civil war officially ended. Most members of the new executive however wanted a complete victory over their opponents, and were thus displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered. Kolokotronis and Mavromichalis retreated, but they intended to regroup their forces and launch a new offensive. Additionally, Panos Kolokotronis agreed to surrender Nafplion only to Londos and Zaimis, an arrangement which again resulted in the intensification of the mistrust of the government towards the two Achaean notables, who were still allies of the central administration.<ref>Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79&ndash;81<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 154&ndash;161</ref>\n\n==Second civil war==\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825\n| partof      = the [[Greek War of Independence]]\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| date        = October 1824 \u2013 February 1825\n| place       = [[Peloponnese]]\n| map_type    = \n| map_size    = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| result      = Victory of Roumeliotes and Islanders, imprisoment of Kolokotronis\n| status      = \n| combatant1  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Continental Greece|Roumeliotes]] and Islanders ([[Hydra (island)|Hydra]])\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Morea|Moreotes]]\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}}  [[Georgios Kountouriotis]]<br>{{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Ioannis Kolettis]]\n| commander2  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]<br>{{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Andreas Londos]]<br>{{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Kanellos Deligiannis]] \n| strength1   = \n| strength2   =  \n}}\n\n[[File:Jean Koletti.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ioannis Kolettis]]]]\n\nDuring this period the two first instalments of the English loan had arrived, an event which strengthened the position of the government; but the infighting was not yet over.

Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period because of an additional reason: he could not overcome the death of his son, Panos, killed by his opponents. While the Peloponnesians were undecided about their further moves, the government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and [[Souliots]], several of whom previously served the Peloponnesians. The plan of the government was implemented by Kolettis, who ordered two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliots to invade the Peloponnese. On 23 November, the first of these bodies under Gouras occupied [[Corinth]] and raided the province. The second body under [[Georgios Karaiskakis]], [[Kitsos Tzavelas]] and others, attacked in Achaea Londos and Zaimis, who retreated and then fled to [[Kalamos (island)|Kalamos]]. In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, raided once again Peloponnese, and arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis' family and others. The next month Mavrokordatos assumed the position of the president of the executive. In May 1825, under the pressure of the Egyptian intervention of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], those imprisoned were released and granted amnesty.<ref>Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79&ndash;81<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 164&ndash;170.</ref>\n\n==Citations==\n {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Dakin|authorlink=Douglas Dakin|year=1973|title=The Greek struggle for independence, 1821-1833|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-02342-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=Theodoros Kolokotronis |last=Dimitropoulos |first=Dimitris |year=2009|location=Athens|language=Greek |publisher=Ta Nea |isbn=978-960-469-707-6|chapter=Kolokotronis during the Infighting}}\n* {{cite book |title=Greece: the Modern Sequel |last=Koliopoulos |first=John S. |author2=Veremis, Thanos M. |year=2004 |publisher=C.

The conflict had both political and regional dimensions, as it pitted the Roumeliotes (the people of [[Continental Greece]]) and the Islanders (the shipowners, especially from [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] island), against the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesians]] or [[Morea|Moreotes]]. It divided the young nation, and seriously weakened the military preparedness of the [[Greeks|Greek]] forces in the face of the oncoming [[History of Ottoman Egypt|Egyptian]] intervention in the conflict.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kolokotronis01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], one of the main military leaders of the Greeks. The Peloponnese was his powerbase.]]\n\nBy the end of March 1821, the [[Peloponnese]] was in open revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and by October 1821 the Greeks under [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] had already captured [[Kalamata]] and [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. After the fall of Kalamata, the Messenian Senate, the first of the Greeks' local governing councils, held its inaugural session. At almost the same time, the Achean Directorate was summoned in Patras. With the initiative of the Messenian Senate, a Peloponnesian assembly convened, and elected on May 26 a Senate. Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] in the western part, and [[Theodoros Negris]] in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two [[Greek local statutes|local statutes]], the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece. The statutes provided for the creation of two local administrative organs in Central Greece, an [[Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece|Areopagus]] in the east, and a [[Senate of Western Continental Greece|Senate]] in the west.<ref>Koliopoulos & Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', pp. 14&ndash;17.<br/>* Papageorgiou, \"First Year of Freedom\", pp. 67&ndash;70.</ref> The three local statutes were recognized by the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus|First National Assembly]], but  were later dissolved by the [[Second National Assembly at Astros|Second National Assembly]].<ref>Koliopoulos & Veremis, ''Greece: the Modern Sequel'', pp. 19&ndash;20.<br/>* Theodoridis, \"A Modern State\", pp. 129&ndash;130.</ref>\n\nThe First National Assembly was formed at [[Epidaurus]] in late December 1821, consisted almost exclusively of Peloponnesian notables. The Assembly composed the [[Greek Constitution of 1822|first Greek Constitution]] and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of no significance.<ref>Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 87-9.</ref> Military leaders and representative of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate, which was not dissolved by the National Assembly. The Senate actually governed Peloponnese, while the central government was too weak to exercise its power. Seeing the impasse and the growing power of the Peloponnesian captains, Mavrokordatos and the Hydriots proposed the dissolution of the Senate and its incorporation into the National Assembly. Mavromichalis accepted the proposal, but the military leaders rejected it. After the rejection of the proposal, the central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis who controlled the fort of [[Nafplion]]. In November 1822, the central administration promulgated the law for the election of representative for the new National Assembly, but Kolokotronis defied the law, and declared that Peloponnese will organize its own assembly for the elections of the new members of the Senate.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 143&ndash;148</ref>\n\n==First civil war==\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825\n| partof      = the [[Greek War of Independence]]\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| date        = autumn 1823 \u2013 June 1824\n| place       = [[Peloponnese]]\n| map_type    = \n| map_size    = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| result      = Agreement between the two factions, partial victory of the Government\n| status      = \n| combatant1  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Kodjabashis|Primates]] and supporters of the Government\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon image|Greek Revolution flag.svg}} Military leaders and supporters of [[Philiki Etaireia]]\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|Greece|old}} [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]]\n| commander2  = {{flagicon image|Greek Revolution flag.svg}} [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]\n| strength1   = \n| strength2   =  \n}}\n\nThe provisional government decided that the National Assembly would take place in Nafplio, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and proposed that the Assembly take place in Nafplion, while the city remained under his control. His stance divided his supporters and weakened him politically. Most of the members of the Peloponnesian Senate obeyed the decisions of the government, and the captains were forced to negotiate their participation in the Assembly. Finally, the Second National Assembly was gathered in March 1823 in [[Astros, Greece|Astros]]. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of regional bodies, a [[Greek Constitution of 1823|new constitution]] was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and legislative bodies.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 148&ndash;151</ref>\n\nTrying to coax the military leaders, the central administration proposed to Kolokotronis to participate in the executive body as vice-president. Kolokotronis accepted, but his actions caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused the rage of the members of the legislative body, which was controlled by the [[Continental Greece|Roumeliotes]] and the [[Hydra Island|Hydriots]].

It was commissioned by [[Henry Tate|Sir Henry Tate]] on land donated by [[Frederick Nettlefold]]: both of these local philanthropists are buried in [[West Norwood Cemetery]].\n* [[Mrs Woodford Fawcett Fountain]] - on a traffic island in front of St Luke's Church, where Norwood Road splits into Norwood High Street and Knights Hill. Mrs Fawcett was a local [[temperance movement in the United Kingdom|temperance]] campaigner and is buried in [[West Norwood Cemetery]] whose entrance faces the fountain.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Lambeth Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Norwood ward of Lambeth Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]\n\"Norwood\" recalls the \"Great North Wood\", a name that was formerly used for the hilly and wooded area to the north of Croydon. Before 1885 West Norwood station and the surrounding area was known as \"Lower Norwood\", reflecting its being at a lower altitude than [[Upper Norwood]].\n\n[[John Rocque]]'s 1745 map of London and the surrounding area includes the Horns Tavern at Knight's Hill, opposite what is now the main entrance to West Norwood station, with a largely undeveloped valley stretching to 'Island Green' in the north, approximately where [[Herne Hill railway station]] stands now. The enclosure map of 50 years later shows that little of the original woodland remained by then, other than a few coppices.\n\nThe future development of West Norwood was assisted by the Lambeth Manor Enclosure Act of 1806. Much of the land covered by this Act was owned either by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or by [[Lord Thurlow]], who died in the same year.\n\nMost of the current main roads were either ancient or laid out in accordance with the provisions of the enclosure award. The River [[Effra]] ran alongside the current Elder Road, in a northerly direction, and was prone to flooding.\n\nThe area was over a mile from the nearest parish church (at St Leonard, Streatham), so [[St Luke's Church, West Norwood|St. Luke's]] was provided under the [[Waterloo church#South London|Waterloo church]] scheme and completed in 1825. The houses in the parish at that period consisted largely of substantial villas along the main roads and more humble cottages mainly situated between Knights Hill and the High Street. The [[West Norwood Cemetery|South Metropolitan Cemetery]] was laid out in 1837 to provide burial facilities largely for the population of crowded areas that were closer to the centre of London.\n\nThe railway line from London to the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] was opened in 1856 with a station at Lower Norwood (since renamed West Norwood). These improved communications heralded major changes. Many of the larger houses and gardens were demolished and replaced with predominantly more modest housing over the next four decades.\n\nNorwood High Street contained the earliest group of shops in the area but never developed into a major shopping centre, as the main shopping parades were built during the decades around 1900 along Norwood Road between York Hill and West Norwood station. Horse-drawn trams shuttled passengers along this road from the terminus in front of St Luke's Church towards the middle of London.\n\nExtensive anecdotal and other historical material from the 19th and early 20th centuries has been written up by Mr J B Wilson, a local undertaker.<ref>J.B. Wilson & H.A. Wilson ''The Story of Norwood'' {{ISBN|0-9515384-1-1}}</ref>\n\nThe two world wars witnessed fatalities and bomb damage to many buildings in the area, with York Hill and the areas around the railway suffering particularly badly. Chatsworth Baptist church had to be rebuilt after a direct hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=landmark_fullsize&id=126 |title=Chatsworth Way, West Norwood: World War II Incident |publisher=Landmark.lambeth.gov.uk |date=1944-09-18 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref> Many of the post-war [[Council house|estates]] were built on bomb sites or replaced areas which had experienced damage.\n\nAn Art Deco cinema, named The Regal, was built at 304 Norwood Road in the late 1920s. It was designed by architect F Edward Jones (who also designed Madame Tussaud's) and opened on 16 January 1930. The cinema sat 2,010 and was equipped with a Christie Manual organ. The cinema closed on 8 February 1964 with a double screening of [[Peter Sellers]]' ''I'm Alright Jack'' and ''Two Way Stretch''. Following its closure, the building became a Top Rank Bingo Club a few months later and remained open until 1978. The building was demolished in November 1981 and a B&Q store can be seen today on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=landmark&id=12160|title=Regal Cinema, Norwood Road, West Norwood|website=landmark.lambeth.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, a considerable amount of council housing was constructed in West Norwood. The York Hill, Fern Lodge, Portobello and Holderness Estates arose during the late 1940s and the 1950s on the sites of houses with large gardens that had been destroyed by bombing or were simply demolished. Later houses and flats, such as in the Dunbar Street area, took the place of Victorian dwellings that were cleared away as slums or, alternatively, to achieve a higher density of development. The Woodvale Estate in Elder Road was erected on the site of the \"Lambeth New Schools\", which had been part of the local Workhouse and that had been renamed as \"Wood Vale\" before demolition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lambeth Workhouse|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Lambeth/|accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref>\n\nParts of West Norwood have been declared conservation areas including the area around the cemetery, Lancaster Avenue and Rosendale Road.

It includes the hilly land between the western end of Thurlow Park Road (South Circular), Peabody Hill and Lovelace Road, and is now partly used by Rosendale Allotments in [[SE21]]. The green area is still marked as Knight's Hill on large scale maps but is normally not marked as such on modern street maps in order to avoid confusion. Originally, the northern Knight's Hill farm was part of the Manor of Levehurst, and later of the Manor of Leigham Court and the parish of Streatham.<ref>Ben Weinreb & Christopher Hibbert, ''The London Encyclopedia'', {{ISBN|0-333-57688-8}} ''West Norwood''</ref>\n\n=== The Jewish Orphanage ===\nThe main building of the Norwood Home for Jewish Children (\"The Jewish Orphanage\") was completed in 1862.

In the 1970s, the charity moved out of the area and the main site was sold to Lambeth Council, which developed much of it for a housing estate, keeping only a small area beside the railway line as open space and converting the synagogue into a community facility known as the Norwood Hall.  Some of this open space is now occupied by the West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre but the site of Norwood Hall has been landscaped.

B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Norwood ward of Lambeth Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]\n\"Norwood\" recalls the \"Great North Wood\", a name that was formerly used for the hilly and wooded area to the north of Croydon. Before 1885 West Norwood station and the surrounding area was known as \"Lower Norwood\", reflecting its being at a lower altitude than [[Upper Norwood]].\n\n[[John Rocque]]'s 1745 map of London and the surrounding area includes the Horns Tavern at Knight's Hill, opposite what is now the main entrance to West Norwood station, with a largely undeveloped valley stretching to 'Island Green' in the north, approximately where [[Herne Hill railway station]] stands now. The enclosure map of 50 years later shows that little of the original woodland remained by then, other than a few coppices.\n\nThe future development of West Norwood was assisted by the Lambeth Manor Enclosure Act of 1806. Much of the land covered by this Act was owned either by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or by [[Lord Thurlow]], who died in the same year.\n\nMost of the current main roads were either ancient or laid out in accordance with the provisions of the enclosure award. The River [[Effra]] ran alongside the current Elder Road, in a northerly direction, and was prone to flooding.\n\nThe area was over a mile from the nearest parish church (at St Leonard, Streatham), so [[St Luke's Church, West Norwood|St. Luke's]] was provided under the [[Waterloo church#South London|Waterloo church]] scheme and completed in 1825. The houses in the parish at that period consisted largely of substantial villas along the main roads and more humble cottages mainly situated between Knights Hill and the High Street. The [[West Norwood Cemetery|South Metropolitan Cemetery]] was laid out in 1837 to provide burial facilities largely for the population of crowded areas that were closer to the centre of London.\n\nThe railway line from London to the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] was opened in 1856 with a station at Lower Norwood (since renamed West Norwood). These improved communications heralded major changes. Many of the larger houses and gardens were demolished and replaced with predominantly more modest housing over the next four decades.\n\nNorwood High Street contained the earliest group of shops in the area but never developed into a major shopping centre, as the main shopping parades were built during the decades around 1900 along Norwood Road between York Hill and West Norwood station. Horse-drawn trams shuttled passengers along this road from the terminus in front of St Luke's Church towards the middle of London.\n\nExtensive anecdotal and other historical material from the 19th and early 20th centuries has been written up by Mr J B Wilson, a local undertaker.<ref>J.B.

The cinema closed on 8 February 1964 with a double screening of [[Peter Sellers]]' ''I'm Alright Jack'' and ''Two Way Stretch''. Following its closure, the building became a Top Rank Bingo Club a few months later and remained open until 1978. The building was demolished in November 1981 and a B&Q store can be seen today on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=landmark&id=12160|title=Regal Cinema, Norwood Road, West Norwood|website=landmark.lambeth.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, a considerable amount of council housing was constructed in West Norwood. The York Hill, Fern Lodge, Portobello and Holderness Estates arose during the late 1940s and the 1950s on the sites of houses with large gardens that had been destroyed by bombing or were simply demolished. Later houses and flats, such as in the Dunbar Street area, took the place of Victorian dwellings that were cleared away as slums or, alternatively, to achieve a higher density of development. The Woodvale Estate in Elder Road was erected on the site of the \"Lambeth New Schools\", which had been part of the local Workhouse and that had been renamed as \"Wood Vale\" before demolition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lambeth Workhouse|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Lambeth/|accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref>\n\nParts of West Norwood have been declared conservation areas including the area around the cemetery, Lancaster Avenue and Rosendale Road. Local landmarks such as St Luke's Church, the late Victorian fire station (now the [[South London Theatre]]) on Norwood High Street, by the architect [[Robert Pearsall (architect)|Robert Pearsall]].,<ref>{{cite web|title=London\u2019s Oldest Operational Fire Station|url=http://e-shootershill.co.uk/closure-threat-for-londons-oldest-operational-fire-station/|work=e-shootershill.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref> The early 20th-century former fire station at Norwood Road and the original public library at Knights Hill are Grade II listed buildings.\n\n===Knights Hill===\nConfusingly, there are two areas called Knight's Hill nearby; the names of both areas have similar origins, both belonging to Thomas Knyght in 1545, and in the south was known as Knight's Hill Common while the hill to the north was known as Knight's Hill Farm.\n* The better-known area is the residential area and [[Dulwich and West Norwood (UK Parliament constituency)|electoral ward]] to the south west by the road called Knights Hill.\nThe southern Knight's Hill Common originally formed part of Lambeth Manor and contained land called Julian's, which is remembered through the street name of St Julian's Farm Road.\nThe hill formed the nucleus of the vast estate in Lambeth and Streatham that [[Lord Thurlow]] acquired during the 18th Century,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49779&strquery=Vicar's+Oak|title=Norwood: Introduction - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>\n* The second Knight's Hill is above the Tulse Hill railway tunnel, near [[West Dulwich railway station]] &ndash; which was originally called Lower Knights Hill station. It includes the hilly land between the western end of Thurlow Park Road (South Circular), Peabody Hill and Lovelace Road, and is now partly used by Rosendale Allotments in [[SE21]]. The green area is still marked as Knight's Hill on large scale maps but is normally not marked as such on modern street maps in order to avoid confusion. Originally, the northern Knight's Hill farm was part of the Manor of Levehurst, and later of the Manor of Leigham Court and the parish of Streatham.<ref>Ben Weinreb & Christopher Hibbert, ''The London Encyclopedia'', {{ISBN|0-333-57688-8}} ''West Norwood''</ref>\n\n=== The Jewish Orphanage ===\nThe main building of the Norwood Home for Jewish Children (\"The Jewish Orphanage\") was completed in 1862. It was a three-storey edifice, with the appearance of a Jacobean palace<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landmark.lambeth.gov.uk/display_page.asp?section=landmark_fullsize&id=8622 |title='&#39;landmark.lambeth.gov.uk'&#39; |publisher=Landmark.lambeth.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref> This structure was demolished in 1963, after the children had moved in groups to live in nine houses supervised by house parents in a less institutional environment, meeting for communal activities at a new synagogue built on the original site. In the 1970s, the charity moved out of the area and the main site was sold to Lambeth Council, which developed much of it for a housing estate, keeping only a small area beside the railway line as open space and converting the synagogue into a community facility known as the Norwood Hall.  Some of this open space is now occupied by the West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre but the site of Norwood Hall has been landscaped. An account of a boy's experiences of living at the Orphanage between 1928 and 1933 can be found online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/story249/story249.htm?identifier=stories/story249/story249.htm&ProjectNo=9 |title=Reminiscences of a Childhood in the Jewish Orphanage, 1920-1933|accessdate=2015-05-11}}</ref>\n\nOf the original buildings only the porter's lodge off Knights Hill now remains, its curving Dutch-gables, red brick with black [[diapering|diaperwork]] and [[mullion]]ed windows echoing the design of the main 3-storey institution. The Arnold & Jane Gabriel Home was built on the Wolfington Road frontage of the orphanage in 1910; it was converted into Julians primary school in 2012, which now features a colourful modern extension to the original building.\n\nThe charity that operated the orphanage in West Norwood retains an echo of its previous location in its current name [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]].\n\n===Historical local photographs===\n* [http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/lambeth/lambeth-assets/galleries/norwood Images of Norwood]\n\n==Churches==\nDuring recent years, the number and variety of churches has increased, reflecting the diverse origins of many new residents.
