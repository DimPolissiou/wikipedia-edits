Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=\"ref8\"/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=\"ref16\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=Powlesland/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=SteerBurns>{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age. They begin their breeding season fairly early in August or September (Southern Hemisphere spring) and thus can make use of the winter's remaining food stores during this time.<ref name=Powlesland/> They build open-cup nests in tree-forks or inside tree cavities. Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again. Modal clutch size is two eggs,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S. S.|last2=Jamieson|first2=I. G.|last3=Wallis|first3=G.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=\"ref8\"/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=\"ref16\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.
