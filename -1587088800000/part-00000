For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. say). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cwill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. say). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri.

The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In addition, Japan made major military moves into Southeast Asia and the [[East Indies]] islands of the South Pacific Ocean against the British and Dutch colonies, opening a new wider Pacific phase in the Second World War. The Japanese renamed Guam {{lang|ja-Latn|\u014cmiya-jima}} (Great Shrine Island).\n\nThe [[Northern Mariana Islands]] had become a League of Nations mandate assigned to Japan in 1919, pursuant to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919. [[Chamorros]] indigenous island people from the Northern Marianas were brought to Guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying Japanese force. The Guamanian Chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the Japanese military. After the war, this would cause resentment between the Guamanian Chamorros and the Chamorros of the Northern Marianas. Guam's Chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them, whereas having been administered by Japan for over 30 years, the Northern Mariana Chamorros were loyal to the Japanese government.\n\nThe [[Japanese occupation of Guam]] lasted for approximately 31 months. During this period, the indigenous people of Guam were subjected to forced labor, family separation, incarceration, execution, concentration camps and forced prostitution. Approximately 1,000 people died during the occupation, according to later [[United States Congress|Congressional]] committee testimony in 2004.

Few indigenous pre-Hispanic customs remained following Spanish contact. Hispanic influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs, and fashion.\n\nDuring Spanish rule (1668\u20131898) the majority of the population was converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole, and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from [[Mesoamerica]], principally Mexico, from Spanish trade with Asia.\n\nThe modern [[Chamorro language]] has many historical parallels to modern [[Philippine languages]] in that it is an [[Austronesian language]] which has absorbed much Spanish vocabulary. The language lies within the [[Malayo-Polynesian language]]s subgroup, along with such languages as Tagalog, Indonesian, Hawaiian, and Maori. Unlike most other languages of the [[Pacific Islands]], Chamorro does belong to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] subgroup of the Austronesian languages.\n\nAs with [[Filipinos]], many Chamorros have [[Spanish name|Spanish surnames]], although also like most Filipinos few of the inhabitants are themselves descended from the Spaniards. Instead, Spanish names and surnames became commonplace after their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the historical event of the imposition of the [[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]] in Guam and other territories of the [[Spanish East Indies]], most notably the Philippines.\n\nDue to foreign cultural influence from Spain, most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost, though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-Hispanic culture in the last few decades. Some scholars have traveled throughout the Pacific Islands conducting research to study what the original Chamorro cultural practices such as dance, language, and canoe building may have been like.\n\nTwo aspects of indigenous pre-Hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule' and inafa'maolek. Chenchule' is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of Chamorro society. It is rooted in the core value of inafa'maolek. Historian Lawrence Cunningham in 1992 wrote, \"In a Chamorro sense, the land and its produce belong to everyone. {{lang|ch|[[Inafa'maolek]]}}, or interdependence, is the key, or central value, in Chamorro culture&nbsp;... {{lang|ch|Inafa'maolek}} depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing. This is the armature, or core, that everything in Chamorro culture revolves around. It is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than [[individualism]] and private property rights.\"\n\n[[File:Chamorro performers.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chamorro people]]]]\nThe core culture or Pengngan Chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect: from sniffing over the hands of the elders (called mangnginge in Chamorro), the passing down of legends, chants, and courtship rituals, to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds. Other practices predating Spanish conquest include [[Outrigger canoe|galaide']] canoe-making, making of the [[belembaotuyan]] (a string musical instrument made from a gourd), fashioning of {{lang|ch|\u00e5cho' atupat}} slings and slingstones, tool manufacture, {{lang|ch|[[M\u00e5tan Guma']]}} burial rituals, and preparation of herbal medicines by [[Suruhanu]].\n\nMaster craftsmen and women specialize in weavings, including plaited work ([[coconut|niyok]]- and [[pandanus|\u00e5kgak]]-leaf baskets, mats, bags, hats, and food containments), loom-woven material ([[plumeria|kalachucha-hibiscus]] and banana fiber skirts, belts and burial shrouds), and body ornamentation (bead and shell necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts, and combs made from tortoise shells and [[Spondylus]]).\n\nWhile only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms, the resurgence of interest among the Chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young Chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the Chamorro people.\n\n===Sports===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2019}}\nThe [[Guam national football team]] was founded in 1975 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1996.

The transfer may be as late as 2020. In addition, the Defense Authorization Act cut approximately $320 million from the 2011 budget request.\n\nVillagers and the military community are interconnected in many ways. Many villagers serve in the military or are retired. Many active duty personnel and Defense Department civilians also live in the villages outside of the military installation areas.

Guam currently serves twelve submarine cables, with most continuing to China.\n\n[[File:US to Guam First Flight Cover 1935.jpg|thumb|right|Cover carried both directions on the first commercial flights between Guam and the United States, October 5\u201324, 1935]]\nIn 1899, the local postage stamps were overprinted \"Guam\" as was done for the other former Spanish colonies, but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular U.S. postage stamps have been used ever since. Because Guam is also part of the U.S. Postal System ([[List of U.S. state abbreviations|postal abbreviation]]: GU, [[ZIP code|ZIP code range]]: 96910\u201396932), mail to Guam from the U.S. mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required. Private shipping companies, such as FedEx, UPS, and DHL, however, have no obligation to do so, and do not regard Guam as domestic.\n\nThe speed of mail traveling between Guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year. Light, first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland, but larger first-class or Priority items can take a week or two. Fourth-class mail, such as magazines, are transported by sea after reaching Hawaii. Most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes, although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available. Incoming mail not from the Americas should be addressed to \"Guam\" instead of \"USA\" to avoid being routed the long way through the U.S. mainland and possibly charged a higher rate (especially from Asia).\n\nThe Commercial Port of Guam is the island's lifeline because most products must be shipped into Guam for consumers. It receives the weekly calls of the Hawaii-based shipping line [[Matson, Inc.]] whose container ships connect Guam with Honolulu, Hawaii, Los Angeles, California, Oakland, California and Seattle, Washington. The port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the Micronesian region. The port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island's U.S. Department of Defense installations, Andersen Air Force Base and Commander, Naval Forces Marianas and eventually the Third Marine Expeditionary Force.\n\nGuam is served by the [[Antonio B.

Since Guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction, passengers arriving directly from the United States skip immigration and proceed directly to Guam Customs and Quarantine.\n\nHowever, due to the [[Visa waiver program#Guam and Northern Mariana Islands Visa Waiver Program|Guam and CNMI visa waiver program]] for certain countries, an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on Guam for flights to the States. For travel from the Northern Mariana Islands to Guam, a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to Guam. On flights from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands, no immigration check is performed. Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point, however, does require a passport.\n\nMost residents travel within Guam using personally owned vehicles. The local government currently outsources the only public bus system ([[Guam Regional Transit Authority]]), and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locations.\n\n==Ecology==\n===Brown tree snake===\n\nBelieved to be a [[stowaway]] on a U.S. military transport near the end of World War II, the [[brown tree snake]] (''Boiga irregularis'') was accidentally introduced to Guam, which previously had no native species of snake. It nearly eliminated the native bird population. The problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island. The brown tree snake, known locally as the ''kulebla'', is native to northern and eastern coasts of [[Australia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is slightly [[venomous]], but relatively harmless to human beings; it is nocturnal. Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam, residents rarely see them. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow. The [[United States Geological Survey]] also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Resources/Education/BTS/|title=USGS: The Brown Tree Snake on Guam|access-date=July 28, 2007|author=Fritts, T.H.|author2=D.

Much of Guam's foliage was lost during [[World War II]]. In 1947, the U.S. military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent [[erosion]]. Tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905.<ref>Stafford, William Edwin (1905) ''Useful Plants of Guam''</ref>\n\nIn southern Guam, non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape. Although the colorful and impressive flame tree (''[[Delonix regia]]'') is found throughout the Marianas, the tree on Guam has been largely decimated.\n\nThe Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) infestation has become an epidemic event of palm tree damage on Guam. The CRB infects palm trees by burrowing into the tips of the palms, effectively killing the plant by destroying the [[shoot apical meristem]] during the process. While the grubs and larvae of CRB do no actual harm to palms, they populate and grow within the damaged crowns of the palm trees, which is a specific mating habit of Guam CRBs.\n\nA possible solution to the crisis, which has been ecologically analyzed in Western Samoa, would be the introduction of CRB predators. Centipedes, ''[[Scolopendra morsitans|Scolopendra Morsitans]],'' have been found to seek out and eat the larvae of the beetle in logs and other breeding grounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hinckley|first=Alden|date=1967|title=Associates of The Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle In Western Samoa|url=http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/9(3)-505.pdf|journal=Pacific Insects|volume=9|pages=505\u2013511|via=|access-date=June 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830102806/http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/9(3)-505.pdf|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Manual insertion of the centipedes, or introduction of volatile attractors within the plant, may cause a significant dent in Guam's CRB mortality.

Invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas. Grasslands and \"barrens\" have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion. During the rainy season, sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the [[Fena Lake]] Reservoir and [[Ugum River]], leading to water quality problems for southern Guam. Eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island. Soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers (planting trees) have had little success in preserving natural habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/Park/Natural/fire/fireguam.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213232039/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/Park/Natural/fire/fireguam.htm|archive-date=December 13, 2007|work=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|author=National Park Service|title=Fire and Guam|access-date=June 16, 2007|author-link=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\n===Aquatic preserves===\n[[File:Tumon Beach.JPG|thumb|Having previously experienced extensive [[dredging]], Tumon Bay is now a marine wildlife preserve.]]\n[[File:Whitespotted boxfish Ostracion meleagris photo Randall J E.jpg|thumb|[[Whitespotted boxfish]] (''[[Ostracion meleagris]]'')]]\nEfforts have been made to protect Guam's coral reef habitats from pollution, eroded silt and overfishing, problems that have led to decreased fish populations.

Few indigenous pre-Hispanic customs remained following Spanish contact. Hispanic influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs, and fashion.\n\nDuring Spanish rule (1668\u20131898) the majority of the population was converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole, and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from [[Mesoamerica]], principally Mexico, from Spanish trade with Asia.\n\nThe modern [[Chamorro language]] has many historical parallels to modern [[Philippine languages]] in that it is an [[Austronesian language]] which has absorbed much Spanish vocabulary. The language lies within the [[Malayo-Polynesian language]]s subgroup, along with such languages as Tagalog, Indonesian, Hawaiian, and Maori. Unlike most other languages of the [[Pacific Islands]], Chamorro does belong to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] subgroup of the Austronesian languages.\n\nAs with [[Filipinos]], many Chamorros have [[Spanish name|Spanish surnames]], although also like most Filipinos few of the inhabitants are themselves descended from the Spaniards. Instead, Spanish names and surnames became commonplace after their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the historical event of the imposition of the [[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]] in Guam and other territories of the [[Spanish East Indies]], most notably the Philippines.\n\nDue to foreign cultural influence from Spain, most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost, though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-Hispanic culture in the last few decades. Some scholars have traveled throughout the Pacific Islands conducting research to study what the original Chamorro cultural practices such as dance, language, and canoe building may have been like.\n\nTwo aspects of indigenous pre-Hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule' and inafa'maolek. Chenchule' is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of Chamorro society. It is rooted in the core value of inafa'maolek. Historian Lawrence Cunningham in 1992 wrote, \"In a Chamorro sense, the land and its produce belong to everyone. {{lang|ch|[[Inafa'maolek]]}}, or interdependence, is the key, or central value, in Chamorro culture&nbsp;... {{lang|ch|Inafa'maolek}} depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing. This is the armature, or core, that everything in Chamorro culture revolves around. It is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than [[individualism]] and private property rights.\"\n\n[[File:Chamorro performers.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chamorro people]]]]\nThe core culture or Pengngan Chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect: from sniffing over the hands of the elders (called mangnginge in Chamorro), the passing down of legends, chants, and courtship rituals, to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds. Other practices predating Spanish conquest include [[Outrigger canoe|galaide']] canoe-making, making of the [[belembaotuyan]] (a string musical instrument made from a gourd), fashioning of {{lang|ch|\u00e5cho' atupat}} slings and slingstones, tool manufacture, {{lang|ch|[[M\u00e5tan Guma']]}} burial rituals, and preparation of herbal medicines by [[Suruhanu]].\n\nMaster craftsmen and women specialize in weavings, including plaited work ([[coconut|niyok]]- and [[pandanus|\u00e5kgak]]-leaf baskets, mats, bags, hats, and food containments), loom-woven material ([[plumeria|kalachucha-hibiscus]] and banana fiber skirts, belts and burial shrouds), and body ornamentation (bead and shell necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts, and combs made from tortoise shells and [[Spondylus]]).\n\nWhile only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms, the resurgence of interest among the Chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young Chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the Chamorro people.\n\n===Sports===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2019}}\nThe [[Guam national football team]] was founded in 1975 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1996.

Because Guam is also part of the U.S. Postal System ([[List of U.S. state abbreviations|postal abbreviation]]: GU, [[ZIP code|ZIP code range]]: 96910\u201396932), mail to Guam from the U.S. mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required.

Light, first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland, but larger first-class or Priority items can take a week or two. Fourth-class mail, such as magazines, are transported by sea after reaching Hawaii. Most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes, although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available. Incoming mail not from the Americas should be addressed to \"Guam\" instead of \"USA\" to avoid being routed the long way through the U.S. mainland and possibly charged a higher rate (especially from Asia).\n\nThe Commercial Port of Guam is the island's lifeline because most products must be shipped into Guam for consumers. It receives the weekly calls of the Hawaii-based shipping line [[Matson, Inc.]] whose container ships connect Guam with Honolulu, Hawaii, Los Angeles, California, Oakland, California and Seattle, Washington. The port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the Micronesian region.

On flights from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands, no immigration check is performed. Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point, however, does require a passport.\n\nMost residents travel within Guam using personally owned vehicles. The local government currently outsources the only public bus system ([[Guam Regional Transit Authority]]), and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locations.\n\n==Ecology==\n===Brown tree snake===\n\nBelieved to be a [[stowaway]] on a U.S. military transport near the end of World War II, the [[brown tree snake]] (''Boiga irregularis'') was accidentally introduced to Guam, which previously had no native species of snake. It nearly eliminated the native bird population. The problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island. The brown tree snake, known locally as the ''kulebla'', is native to northern and eastern coasts of [[Australia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is slightly [[venomous]], but relatively harmless to human beings; it is nocturnal. Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam, residents rarely see them. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow. The [[United States Geological Survey]] also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Resources/Education/BTS/|title=USGS: The Brown Tree Snake on Guam|access-date=July 28, 2007|author=Fritts, T.H.|author2=D.

Among them were the [[Guam rail]] (or ''ko'ko''' bird in Chamorro) and the [[Guam flycatcher]], both common throughout the island. Today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the Guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources. The devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades.

Much of Guam's foliage was lost during [[World War II]]. In 1947, the U.S. military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent [[erosion]]. Tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905.<ref>Stafford, William Edwin (1905) ''Useful Plants of Guam''</ref>\n\nIn southern Guam, non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape. Although the colorful and impressive flame tree (''[[Delonix regia]]'') is found throughout the Marianas, the tree on Guam has been largely decimated.\n\nThe Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) infestation has become an epidemic event of palm tree damage on Guam. The CRB infects palm trees by burrowing into the tips of the palms, effectively killing the plant by destroying the [[shoot apical meristem]] during the process. While the grubs and larvae of CRB do no actual harm to palms, they populate and grow within the damaged crowns of the palm trees, which is a specific mating habit of Guam CRBs.\n\nA possible solution to the crisis, which has been ecologically analyzed in Western Samoa, would be the introduction of CRB predators. Centipedes, ''[[Scolopendra morsitans|Scolopendra Morsitans]],'' have been found to seek out and eat the larvae of the beetle in logs and other breeding grounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hinckley|first=Alden|date=1967|title=Associates of The Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle In Western Samoa|url=http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/9(3)-505.pdf|journal=Pacific Insects|volume=9|pages=505\u2013511|via=|access-date=June 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830102806/http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/9(3)-505.pdf|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Manual insertion of the centipedes, or introduction of volatile attractors within the plant, may cause a significant dent in Guam's CRB mortality.

Apart from being a world-renowned theatre artist, Lai is also an award-winning filmmaker, and a practitioner of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and has translated multiple books on the subject.\n\n==Life==\nLai was born on 25 October 1954 in [[Washington D.C.]], where his father was serving in the [[Republic of China]]'s Embassy. He returned to [[Taiwan]] with his mother in 1966. Lai studied English literature at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] and graduated in 1976. In 1978, Lai married [[Ding Nai-chu]] (\u4e01\u4e43\u7afa). After the marriage, the couple went to the US for further studies. The couple have two daughters: Stephanie, an actress, and Celeste Lai, a New York-based animator.\n\nLai received his [[Ph.D.]] in Dramatic Art from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1983. After his return to Taiwan, Lai taught and served as Dean of School of Theatre Arts at [[Taipei National University of the Arts]]. In 1984, Lai and Ding, along with Taiwanese actors Lee Li-chun and Lee Kuo-hsiu, founded Performance Workshop,<ref>[http://www.pwshop.com/en/about_us/ \u8868\u6f14\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a]</ref> a contemporary theatre group that has become one of the most celebrated in the Chinese world. Lai became the Artistic Director while Ding served as the Managing Director. Their work has revitalized theatre in Taiwan and continually pioneered new horizons in modern Chinese theatre. Since its founding in 1984, Performance Workshop has produced more than 40 of Lai's theatrical works and collaborations, including iconic pieces such as [[Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land]], The Village, A Dream Like a Dream, and AGO.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Lai taught at [[Stanford University]] as Visiting Professor and Resident Artist for the I.D.A. program. In 2013 he lectured at Berkeley as Avenali Fellow and Artist in Residence. In 2019 he taught at Berkeley as Artist-in-Residence.\n\nA prolific author of 40 original performed plays to date, Lai was also commissioned by the government of the [[Republic of China]] to work on a number of large-scale events in Taiwan. In 2009 Lai was Creative Director of the acclaimed Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the International Deaflympics Games in Taipei. In 2010, Lai worked as [[Creative Director]] for the Gala in Celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Founding of the [[Republic of China]]. Also In 2010 he served as Creative Director for the Taipei International Flora Exposition. Lai took on the position of General Consultant for the 2011 [[Taiwan]] Lantern Festival held in Miaoli County, attracting a whopping 8.02 million visitors. In May 2013, along with Chen Xianghong, actor Huang Lei, and theatre director Meng Jinghui, Lai co-founded the [[Wuzhen Theatre Festival]], for which he serves as Festival Director. \nIn April 2015, Lai's opus magnum [[Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land]] had its professional American premiere, in English, at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]], running from April 15 through October 31.\n\nIn December 2015, Lai opened Theatre Above, a 699-seat theatre located in Xujiahui, [[Shanghai]], dedicated to the performance of his works.\n\nIn 2016, Lai directed the San Francisco Opera's production of the Chinese classic ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.<ref>Qin, Amy [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/asia/china-taiwan-theater-stan-lai.html?_r=0 Theater\u2019s Evolving Role in China and Taiwan] ''New York Times''. September 28, 2016</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, Lai's Nightwalk in the Chinese Garden had its premiere at the [[Huntington Library]]. The site-specific piece was produced in collaboration with the Huntington and CalArts Center for New Performance, and in association with the Shanghai Kunqu Troupe.\n\n== Works ==\nStan Lai's plays have been described as \"The pinnacle of our era of theatre.\" (The Beijing News)<ref>[http://www.bjnews.com.cn/opinion/2010/02/09/9028.html \u300a\u5bf6\u5cf6\u4e00\u6751\u300b \u4ed6\u5011\u53f0\u7063\u9019\u4e9b\u5e74]</ref> Since 1984, his over 30 original plays have continually pioneered the way toward new horizons in modern Chinese theatre. China's prominent literary  critic Yu Qiuyu says that Lai's work \u201calways has the ability to touch the heartstrings of countless audiences.\u201d\n\nLai's most famous works includes ''That Evening, We Performed Crosstalk'' (1985), which revived the dying art of \"Crosstalk\" in Taiwan; ''The Village'' (2008), described by the ''China Times'' as \"a collectible treasure for our generation\" and by the Beijing News as \"The pinnacle of our era of theatre\";<ref>\u3008\u4e00\u500b\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u73cd\u85cf\u3009\uff0c\u4e2d\u570b\u6642\u5831\uff0c2008-12-08</ref> the 8 hour epic ''A Dream Like A Dream'' (2000), described by prominent theatre critic Raymond Zhou as \"a major milestone in Chinese theater, possibly the greatest Chinese-language play since time immemorial\";<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2013-04/15/content_16407602.htm Cosmic Dream Drama ]</ref> and perhaps his best known play [[Secret Love for the Peach Blossom Spring|Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land]] (1986), described by the [[New York Times]] as \"may be the most popular contemporary play in China\u2026by the end, the audience is left to contemplate the burdens of memory, history, longing, love and the power of theater itself.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/arts/04iht-blossom.4097853.html?_r=3&pagewanted=2& Acclaim in China for tried and true 'Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land']</ref> Unauthorized productions of the play in China alone number over an astounding 1,000 performances. In 2007, Lai directed his own English translation of the play at [[Stanford University]].\n\nLai's \u201ccrosstalk\u201d (xiangsheng) plays, starting with the groundbreaking ''That Evening, We Performed Crosstalk'' (1985) have virtually forged a new theatrical genre. These hugely popular works have resuscitated the dying traditional performing art form of Xiangsheng. His epic 8 hour ''A Dream Like A Dream'' (2000), which has been compared to [[Peter Brook]]'s Mahabharata, \u201cmay be the most cosmic piece of theater in the Chinese-language canon,\"<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2013-04/15/content_16407602.htm Cosmic Dream Drama ]</ref> revealing Buddhist and universal themes of suffering and recurring life cycles in a unique performance format devised by Lai that places the audience in the center of the space, with performance surrounding audience.\n\nLai remains a significant cultural bridge between Taiwan and China, and his influence on contemporary Chinese culture continues to grow. Aside from his creative bases in Shanghai and Taipei, Lai has been commissioned to create new works in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Beijing. In 2009 Lai was also chief director of the [[Deaflympics]] Opening and Closing Ceremonies held in Taipei, which received high acclaim for their aesthetic beauty and representation of the deaf spirit. The ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' describes his work as \"the most exciting theatre in the Chinese-speaking world.\"<ref>Acts of Defiance, Lincoln Kaye, Far Eastern Economic Review, 1990-07-26</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' calls it \"the most recent piece of evidence that Taiwan is creating the boldest Chinese art in Asia today.\"<ref>A New Model Monkey King, Newsweek,1988-2-29</ref> ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' says \"His work is never one dimensional or linear, there are always layers to it.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/arts/13iht-jessop.1.20170923.html  Preserving Taiwan\u2019s Collective Memory, New York Times, 2009-02-13]</ref> In 2013, Lai served as the  Artistic Director of the Inaugural [[:zh-tw:\u4e4c\u9547\u620f\u5267\u8282|Wuzhen Theatre Festival]] in the scenic water town of Wuzhen, China. ''A Dream Like A Dream'' opened the festival.\n\nLai's main tool for playwriting is his use of improvisation in collaboration with the actors, which include many of the most respected names of the time. This is a method he learned from his mentor Shireen Strooker of the Amsterdam Werkteater, and he is one of the world's foremost exponents of using improvisation as a creative tool. His 40 plays are widely varied in style and reflect on the individuality of each project he undertakes, as well as the uniqueness of each cast he works with.\n\nLai has also written and directed two widely acclaimed feature films, ''The Peach Blossom Land'' (1992) and ''The Red Lotus Society'' (1994). The former received top prizes at the Berlin, Tokyo, and Singapore international film festivals. His improvisational experiment in television, ''All In the Family are Humans'' (1995\u201397), was a surprising alternative hit on Taiwan TV and ran for 600 episodes. Lai occasionally directs the works of others, including the Chinese language premiere of [[Angels in America]], Part I, which he translated. He has also directed innovative versions of Western classics, including an evening of Samuel Beckett plays in an ancient Chinese garden environment, [[Mozart]]\u2019s operas [[Don Giovanni]], [[Cosi fan tutte]] and [[The Marriage of Figaro]], all set in Chinese backgrounds, in collaboration with Taiwan's National Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn 2007, Lai became a best-selling author in Taiwan and China with his book on creativity called Stan Lai On Creativity (Chinese Pinyin: Lai Shengchuan de Chuangyixue), based on a course on Creativity he taught at [[Stanford University]]. This book has gained a reputation in business as well as artistic readers as a unique take on how one can train in creativity. His plays have been published in numerous Chinese editions in both Taiwan and China, as well as in English versions from Oxford and Columbia University Press. In 2011 Lai embarked on a book tour with his Stan Lai On Theatre, sharing his experience as a playwright/director for the past three decades. A collection of nine major Lai plays was published in Chinese by [[CITIC Press Group]] in 2019. A collection of 12 plays by Lai is scheduled to be published in English by the [[University of Michigan Press]] in 2020.\n\n=== Plays, as writer and director ===\n\n'''Note''': Lai's plays are often written in collaboration with his actors over a process of creative rehearsals which he initiates, structures and supervises, and is responsible for the original idea, the outline, and the writing of the final script. Credit to collaborative members is given in each individual house program. Performances are in Taiwan unless otherwise noted.\n* ''We All Grew Up This Way'' - \u300a\u6211\u5011\u90fd\u662f\u9019\u6a23\u9577\u5927\u7684\u300b (1984)\n* ''Plucking Stars'' - \u300a\u6458\u661f\u300b (1984)\n* ''The Passer By'' -

Apart from being a world-renowned theatre artist, Lai is also an award-winning filmmaker, and a practitioner of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and has translated multiple books on the subject.\n\n==Life==\nLai was born on 25 October 1954 in [[Washington D.C.]], where his father was serving in the [[Republic of China]]'s Embassy. He returned to [[Taiwan]] with his mother in 1966. Lai studied English literature at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] and graduated in 1976. In 1978, Lai married [[Ding Nai-chu]] (\u4e01\u4e43\u7afa). After the marriage, the couple went to the US for further studies. The couple have two daughters: Stephanie, an actress, and Celeste Lai, a New York-based animator.\n\nLai received his [[Ph.D.]] in Dramatic Art from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1983. After his return to Taiwan, Lai taught and served as Dean of School of Theatre Arts at [[Taipei National University of the Arts]]. In 1984, Lai and Ding, along with Taiwanese actors Lee Li-chun and Lee Kuo-hsiu, founded Performance Workshop,<ref>[http://www.pwshop.com/en/about_us/ \u8868\u6f14\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a]</ref> a contemporary theatre group that has become one of the most celebrated in the Chinese world. Lai became the Artistic Director while Ding served as the Managing Director. Their work has revitalized theatre in Taiwan and continually pioneered new horizons in modern Chinese theatre. Since its founding in 1984, Performance Workshop has produced more than 40 of Lai's theatrical works and collaborations, including iconic pieces such as [[Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land]], The Village, A Dream Like a Dream, and AGO.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Lai taught at [[Stanford University]] as Visiting Professor and Resident Artist for the I.D.A. program. In 2013 he lectured at Berkeley as Avenali Fellow and Artist in Residence. In 2019 he taught at Berkeley as Artist-in-Residence.\n\nA prolific author of 40 original performed plays to date, Lai was also commissioned by the government of the [[Republic of China]] to work on a number of large-scale events in Taiwan. In 2009 Lai was Creative Director of the acclaimed Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the International Deaflympics Games in Taipei. In 2010, Lai worked as [[Creative Director]] for the Gala in Celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Founding of the [[Republic of China]]. Also In 2010 he served as Creative Director for the Taipei International Flora Exposition. Lai took on the position of General Consultant for the 2011 [[Taiwan]] Lantern Festival held in Miaoli County, attracting a whopping 8.02 million visitors. In May 2013, along with Chen Xianghong, actor Huang Lei, and theatre director Meng Jinghui, Lai co-founded the [[Wuzhen Theatre Festival]], for which he serves as Festival Director. \nIn April 2015, Lai's opus magnum [[Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land]] had its professional American premiere, in English, at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]], running from April 15 through October 31.\n\nIn December 2015, Lai opened Theatre Above, a 699-seat theatre located in Xujiahui, [[Shanghai]], dedicated to the performance of his works.\n\nIn 2016, Lai directed the San Francisco Opera's production of the Chinese classic ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.<ref>Qin, Amy [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/asia/china-taiwan-theater-stan-lai.html?_r=0 Theater\u2019s Evolving Role in China and Taiwan] ''New York Times''. September 28, 2016</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, Lai's Nightwalk in the Chinese Garden had its premiere at the [[Huntington Library]]. The site-specific piece was produced in collaboration with the Huntington and CalArts Center for New Performance, and in association with the Shanghai Kunqu Troupe.\n\n== Works ==\nStan Lai's plays have been described as \"The pinnacle of our era of theatre.\" (The Beijing News)<ref>[http://www.bjnews.com.cn/opinion/2010/02/09/9028.html \u300a\u5bf6\u5cf6\u4e00\u6751\u300b \u4ed6\u5011\u53f0\u7063\u9019\u4e9b\u5e74]</ref> Since 1984, his over 30 original plays have continually pioneered the way toward new horizons in modern Chinese theatre. China's prominent literary  critic Yu Qiuyu says that Lai's work \u201calways has the ability to touch the heartstrings of countless audiences.\u201d\n\nLai's most famous works includes ''That Evening, We Performed Crosstalk'' (1985), which revived the dying art of \"Crosstalk\" in Taiwan; ''The Village'' (2008), described by the ''China Times'' as \"a collectible treasure for our generation\" and by the Beijing News as \"The pinnacle of our era of theatre\";<ref>\u3008\u4e00\u500b\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u73cd\u85cf\u3009\uff0c\u4e2d\u570b\u6642\u5831\uff0c2008-12-08</ref> the 8 hour epic ''A Dream Like A Dream'' (2000), described by prominent theatre critic Raymond Zhou as \"a major milestone in Chinese theater, possibly the greatest Chinese-language play since time immemorial\";<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2013-04/15/content_16407602.htm Cosmic Dream Drama ]</ref> and perhaps his best known play [[Secret Love for the Peach Blossom Spring|Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land]] (1986), described by the [[New York Times]] as \"may be the most popular contemporary play in China\u2026by the end, the audience is left to contemplate the burdens of memory, history, longing, love and the power of theater itself.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/arts/04iht-blossom.4097853.html?_r=3&pagewanted=2& Acclaim in China for tried and true 'Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land']</ref> Unauthorized productions of the play in China alone number over an astounding 1,000 performances. In 2007, Lai directed his own English translation of the play at [[Stanford University]].\n\nLai's \u201ccrosstalk\u201d (xiangsheng) plays, starting with the groundbreaking ''That Evening, We Performed Crosstalk'' (1985) have virtually forged a new theatrical genre. These hugely popular works have resuscitated the dying traditional performing art form of Xiangsheng. His epic 8 hour ''A Dream Like A Dream'' (2000), which has been compared to [[Peter Brook]]'s Mahabharata, \u201cmay be the most cosmic piece of theater in the Chinese-language canon,\"<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2013-04/15/content_16407602.htm Cosmic Dream Drama ]</ref> revealing Buddhist and universal themes of suffering and recurring life cycles in a unique performance format devised by Lai that places the audience in the center of the space, with performance surrounding audience.\n\nLai remains a significant cultural bridge between Taiwan and China, and his influence on contemporary Chinese culture continues to grow. Aside from his creative bases in Shanghai and Taipei, Lai has been commissioned to create new works in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Beijing. In 2009 Lai was also chief director of the [[Deaflympics]] Opening and Closing Ceremonies held in Taipei, which received high acclaim for their aesthetic beauty and representation of the deaf spirit. The ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' describes his work as \"the most exciting theatre in the Chinese-speaking world.\"<ref>Acts of Defiance, Lincoln Kaye, Far Eastern Economic Review, 1990-07-26</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' calls it \"the most recent piece of evidence that Taiwan is creating the boldest Chinese art in Asia today.\"<ref>A New Model Monkey King, Newsweek,1988-2-29</ref> ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' says \"His work is never one dimensional or linear, there are always layers to it.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/arts/13iht-jessop.1.20170923.html  Preserving Taiwan\u2019s Collective Memory, New York Times, 2009-02-13]</ref> In 2013, Lai served as the  Artistic Director of the Inaugural [[:zh-tw:\u4e4c\u9547\u620f\u5267\u8282|Wuzhen Theatre Festival]] in the scenic water town of Wuzhen, China. ''A Dream Like A Dream'' opened the festival.\n\nLai's main tool for playwriting is his use of improvisation in collaboration with the actors, which include many of the most respected names of the time. This is a method he learned from his mentor Shireen Strooker of the Amsterdam Werkteater, and he is one of the world's foremost exponents of using improvisation as a creative tool. His 40 plays are widely varied in style and reflect on the individuality of each project he undertakes, as well as the uniqueness of each cast he works with.\n\nLai has also written and directed two widely acclaimed feature films, ''The Peach Blossom Land'' (1992) and ''The Red Lotus Society'' (1994). The former received top prizes at the Berlin, Tokyo, and Singapore international film festivals. His improvisational experiment in television, ''All In the Family are Humans'' (1995\u201397), was a surprising alternative hit on Taiwan TV and ran for 600 episodes. Lai occasionally directs the works of others, including the Chinese language premiere of [[Angels in America]], Part I, which he translated. He has also directed innovative versions of Western classics, including an evening of Samuel Beckett plays in an ancient Chinese garden environment, [[Mozart]]\u2019s operas [[Don Giovanni]], [[Cosi fan tutte]] and [[The Marriage of Figaro]], all set in Chinese backgrounds, in collaboration with Taiwan's National Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn 2007, Lai became a best-selling author in Taiwan and China with his book on creativity called Stan Lai On Creativity (Chinese Pinyin: Lai Shengchuan de Chuangyixue), based on a course on Creativity he taught at [[Stanford University]]. This book has gained a reputation in business as well as artistic readers as a unique take on how one can train in creativity. His plays have been published in numerous Chinese editions in both Taiwan and China, as well as in English versions from Oxford and Columbia University Press. In 2011 Lai embarked on a book tour with his Stan Lai On Theatre, sharing his experience as a playwright/director for the past three decades. A collection of nine major Lai plays was published in Chinese by [[CITIC Press Group]] in 2019. A collection of 12 plays by Lai is scheduled to be published in English by the [[University of Michigan Press]] in 2020.\n\n=== Plays, as writer and director ===\n\n'''Note''': Lai's plays are often written in collaboration with his actors over a process of creative rehearsals which he initiates, structures and supervises, and is responsible for the original idea, the outline, and the writing of the final script. Credit to collaborative members is given in each individual house program. Performances are in Taiwan unless otherwise noted.\n* ''We All Grew Up This Way'' - \u300a\u6211\u5011\u90fd\u662f\u9019\u6a23\u9577\u5927\u7684\u300b (1984)\n* ''Plucking Stars'' - \u300a\u6458\u661f\u300b (1984)\n* ''The Passer By'' -

It was published by [[Shogakukan]] in their ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' magazine between 1994 and 2001, with the chapters collected and reprinted into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story revolves around [[Kenzo Tenma]], a Japanese surgeon living in Germany whose life enters turmoil after getting himself involved with [[Johan Liebert]], one of his former patients, who is revealed to be a dangerous serial killer.\n\nUrasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel ''Another Monster'', a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter's point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] into a 74-episode [[anime]] TV series, which aired on [[Nippon TV]] from April 2004 to September 2005. It was directed by [[Masayuki Kojima]], written by Tatsuhiko Urahata and featured character design by [[Kitar\u014d K\u014dsaka]]. The manga and anime were both been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for English releases in North America, and the anime was broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, [[Siren Visual]] licensed the anime for [[Australia]]. ''Monster'' has been critically acclaimed, with the manga winning several awards, and its anime adaptation called one of the best of the decade.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Monster characters}}\n\n[[Kenzo Tenma|Dr. Kenzo Tenma]] is a young Japanese [[neurosurgery|brain surgeon]], working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[West Germany]]. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins [[Johan Liebert|Johan]] and [[Anna Liebert]] into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. [[Director Heinemann]] and the other doctors in Tenma's way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have no evidence and can only question him.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers mutters about a \"monster.\" Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers' room dead and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma's attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked to stop him.\n\nTenma is suspected by the police, particularly [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] [[Inspector Lunge]], and he tries to find more information about Johan. He soon discovers that the boy's sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her foster parents, on her birthday; he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her foster parents. Tenma eventually learns the origins of this \"monster\": from the former [[East Germany]]'s attempt to use a secret [[orphanage]] known as \"511 Kinderheim\" to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children's books used in a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] experiment in the former [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this \"monster\", and vows to fix the mistake he made by saving Johan's life.\n\n==Production==\nUrasawa revealed that he pitched the idea of writing a manga about the medical field around 1986, but could tell his editor was not enjoying the idea. So he jokingly proposed a story about women's judo, and that lead to his first solo work ''[[Yawara!]]'' (1986\u20131993).<ref name=\"alltheanime\">{{cite web|url = http://nekopop.com/2019/01/naoki-urasawa-interview-creator-monster-20th-century-boys-japan-house-los-angeles-2019/|title = Naoki Urasawa \u2013 Interview with creator of Monster, 20th Century Boys at JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles (2019)|publisher = All the Anime|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> \n\nThe original idea for ''Monster'' came from the 1960s American television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which had a strong impact on Urasawa when he saw it at the age of eight. In the story a doctor is wrongfully convicted of murder, but escapes and searches for the real killer while on the run from the police.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/> He said that his editor was adamant that the series would not do well, and tried to stop him from creating it.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/>\n\nThe Japanese medical industry was strongly influenced by the German one, thus it seemed natural to the author to set ''Monster'' in Germany. [[Post-war]] Germany was chosen so that the [[neo-Nazi]] movement could be included in the story.<ref name=\"crunchy\">{{cite web|url = https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/02/06-1/interview-all-you-need-is-a-white-piece-of-paper-and-pen-a-conversation-with-monster-and-21st-century-boys-creator-naoki-urasawa|title = INTERVIEW: All You Need is a White Piece of Paper and Pen: A Conversation with Monster and 20th Century Boys Creator Naoki Urasawa |date = 2019-02-06|publisher = [[Crunchyroll]]|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> When he started ''Monster'' at the end of 1994, Urasawa was already writing ''[[Happy!

Writing both ''Monster'' and ''20th Century Boys'' at the same time caused him to be briefly hospitalized for exhaustion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Monster\u2019s Naoki Urasawa Celebrated In Career-Spanning Exhibition |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/monsters-naoki-urasawa-celebrated-in-career-spanning-exhibition/ |publisher=[[Otaku USA]] |date= 2016-02-11 |accessdate=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Monster chapters}}\nWritten and illustrated by [[Naoki Urasawa]], ''Monster'' was published in ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' from December 1994 to December 2001.

It was published by [[Shogakukan]] in their ''[[Big Comic Original]]'' magazine between 1994 and 2001, with the chapters collected and reprinted into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. The story revolves around [[Kenzo Tenma]], a Japanese surgeon living in Germany whose life enters turmoil after getting himself involved with [[Johan Liebert]], one of his former patients, who is revealed to be a dangerous serial killer.\n\nUrasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel ''Another Monster'', a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter's point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] into a 74-episode [[anime]] TV series, which aired on [[Nippon TV]] from April 2004 to September 2005. It was directed by [[Masayuki Kojima]], written by Tatsuhiko Urahata and featured character design by [[Kitar\u014d K\u014dsaka]]. The manga and anime were both been licensed by [[Viz Media]] for English releases in North America, and the anime was broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, [[Siren Visual]] licensed the anime for [[Australia]]. ''Monster'' has been critically acclaimed, with the manga winning several awards, and its anime adaptation called one of the best of the decade.\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Monster characters}}\n\n[[Kenzo Tenma|Dr. Kenzo Tenma]] is a young Japanese [[neurosurgery|brain surgeon]], working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[West Germany]]. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins [[Johan Liebert|Johan]] and [[Anna Liebert]] into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. [[Director Heinemann]] and the other doctors in Tenma's way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have no evidence and can only question him.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers mutters about a \"monster.\" Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers' room dead and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma's attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked to stop him.\n\nTenma is suspected by the police, particularly [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] [[Inspector Lunge]], and he tries to find more information about Johan. He soon discovers that the boy's sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her foster parents, on her birthday; he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her foster parents. Tenma eventually learns the origins of this \"monster\": from the former [[East Germany]]'s attempt to use a secret [[orphanage]] known as \"511 Kinderheim\" to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children's books used in a [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] experiment in the former [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this \"monster\", and vows to fix the mistake he made by saving Johan's life.\n\n==Production==\nUrasawa revealed that he pitched the idea of writing a manga about the medical field around 1986, but could tell his editor was not enjoying the idea. So he joking proposed a story about women's judo, and that lead to his first solo work ''[[Yawara!]]'' (1986\u20131993).<ref name=\"alltheanime\">{{cite web|url = http://nekopop.com/2019/01/naoki-urasawa-interview-creator-monster-20th-century-boys-japan-house-los-angeles-2019/|title = Naoki Urasawa \u2013 Interview with creator of Monster, 20th Century Boys at JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles (2019)|publisher = All the Anime|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> \n\nThe original idea for ''Monster'' came from the 1960s American television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which had a strong impact on Urasawa when he saw it at the age of eight. In the story a doctor is wrongfully convicted of murder, but escapes and searches for the real killer while on the run from the police.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/> He said that his editor was adamant that the series would not do well, and tried to stop him from creating it.<ref name=\"alltheanime\"/>\n\nThe Japanese medical industry was strongly influenced by the German one, thus it seemed natural to the author to set ''Monster'' in Germany. [[Post-war]] Germany was chosen so that the [[neo-Nazi]] movement could be included in the story.<ref name=\"crunchy\">{{cite web|url = https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/02/06-1/interview-all-you-need-is-a-white-piece-of-paper-and-pen-a-conversation-with-monster-and-21st-century-boys-creator-naoki-urasawa|title = INTERVIEW: All You Need is a White Piece of Paper and Pen: A Conversation with Monster and 20th Century Boys Creator Naoki Urasawa |date = 2019-02-06|publisher = [[Crunchyroll]]|accessdate = 2020-02-15}}</ref> When he started ''Monster'' at the end of 1994, Urasawa was already writing ''[[Happy!
