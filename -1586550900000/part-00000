His design work also included functional and decorative [[architectural glass]] and ceramics, furniture, home appliances, and literary illustration.\n\nIn a prodigious career lasting more than 40 years, Dodd left many extant structures on both east and west coasts and in the midwest and upper south, among the best known of these being the original Presbyterian Seminary campus (now [[Jefferson Community and Technical College|Jefferson Community & Technical College]]), the Weissinger-Gaulbert Apartments, and the old YMCA building, all three in [[downtown Louisville]]. Also notable \nare his numerous residential and ecclesiastical designs still in use in Kentucky and Tennessee.  In California, examples of his extant work include the Pacific Center and Hearst's [[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]] Building in downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and the [[San Gabriel Mission Playhouse]] south of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].
