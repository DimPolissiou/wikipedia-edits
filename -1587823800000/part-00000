In jazz chords and theory, most [[triad (music)|triad]]s that appear in [[lead sheet]]s or [[fake book]]s can have [[Seventh (chord)|sevenths]] added to them, using the performer's discretion and ear. For example, if a tune is in the key of C, if there is a G chord, the chord-playing performer usually [[Chord voicing|voices]] this chord as G<sup>7</sup>. While the notes of a G<sup>7</sup> chord are G\u2013B\u2013D\u2013F, jazz often omits the [[Fifth (chord)|fifth]] of the chord\u2014and even the [[Root (chord)|root]] if playing in a group. However, not all jazz pianists leave out the root when they play voicings: [[Bud Powell]], one of the best-known of the bebop pianists, and [[Horace Silver]], whose quintet included many of jazz's biggest names from the 1950s to the 1970s, included the root note in their voicings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-voicings/powell-voicings/|title=Bud Powell Chord Voicings - The Jazz Piano Site|work=The Jazz Piano Site|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/259793476/5-Ways-to-Play-Like-Horace-Silver|title=5 Ways to Play Like Horace Silver {{!}} Jazz {{!}} Piano|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n[[jazz improvisation|Improvising]] chord-playing musicians who omit the root and fifth are given the option to play other notes. For example, if a seventh chord, such as G<sup>7</sup>, appears in a lead sheet or fake book, many chord-playing performers add the [[ninth]] or [[thirteenth]] to the chord, even though the lead sheet does not specify these additional notes. Jazz players can add these additional, upper notes\u2013seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth\u2013because they can create an important part of the jazz sound. Lead sheets and fake books often do not detail how to voice the chord because a lead sheet or fake book is only intended to provide basic guide to the harmony. An experienced \"[[comping]]\" performer playing [[electric guitar]] or [[piano]] adds the extra notes as chosen according to the style and desired sound of that musician.\n\nIn voicing jazz chords, performers focus first on the seventh and the major or minor third of the chord, with the latter indicating the [[major and minor|chord quality]], along with added [[extended chord|chord extensions]] (e.g., ninths, elevenths, or thirteenths, even if not indicated in the lead sheet or fake book) to add tone \"colour\" to the chord. As such, a [[jazz guitar]]ist or [[jazz piano]] player might \"voice\" a printed G<sup>7</sup> chord with the notes B\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A, which would be the third, sixth (thirteenth), flat seventh, and ninth of the chord. Jazz chord-playing musicians may also add [[altered chord|altered chord tones]] (e.g., {{music|b}}9, {{music|#}}9, {{music|#}}11, {{music|b}}13) and [[Added tone chord|added tones]]. An example of an [[altered dominant]] chord in the key of C, built on a G would be to voice the chord as \"B\u2013C{{music|#}}\u2013E\u2013F\u2013A{{music|b}}\"; this would be G<sup>7({{music|b}}9{{music|#}}11)</sup>.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n===Intervals===\nEach chord is described as a series of [[Interval (music)|intervallic]] relationships to the root of the chord. This provides an accurate and easily understandable basis for working out these chords in each key.\n\nThe terms used to describe intervals are as follows:\n*'''r''' = [[root (chord)|root]] of the chord (while the root is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the root is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|flat}}2''' = minor second = 1 [[semitone]] (half step) above the root\n*'''2''' = [[major second]] = 2 semitones above root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}2''' = [[augmented second]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}3''' = [[minor third]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''3''' = [[major third]] = 4 semitones above the root\n*'''4''' = [[perfect fourth]] = 5 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}4''' = [[Augmented Fourth|augmented fourth]] ([[tritone]]) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}5''' = [[diminished fifth]] (tritone) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''5''' = [[perfect fifth]] = 7 semitones above the root (while the fifth is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the fifth is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|sharp}}5''' = [[augmented fifth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}6''' = [[minor sixth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''6''' = [[major sixth]] = 9 semitones above the root\n*'''7''' = [[minor seventh]] = 10 semitones above the root\n*'''M7''' = [[major seventh]] = 11 semitones above the root\n\nAll [[Inversion (music)#Root position|root chords]] are described starting with the lowest note, and ascending in pitch. For instance, a chord described as\n\n:root, 3, 5.\n\ncontains the root, a major third above the root, and a perfect fifth above the root. It is a [[Major chord|major triad]]. If this chord were built on C (with C as the root), it would contain the notes\n\n:C, E, G.\n\n==== Compound intervals ====\n[[Interval (music)#Number|Compound intervals]] are intervals larger than an [[octave]]. They can also be described as an octave plus a simple interval. Note that this is not a complete list of compound intervals, only those that are commonly used in jazz chords.\n\n*'''{{music|flat}}9''' = compound minor second ([[minor ninth]]) = 1 semitone + an octave = 13 semitones above the root\n*'''9''' = compound major second ([[ninth]]) = 2 semitones + an octave = 14 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}9'''/'''{{music|flat}}10''' = compound [[augmented second]]/minor third (augmented ninth/minor tenth) = 3 semitones + an octave = 15 semitones above the root.\n*'''10''' = compound major third ([[tenth (music)|tenth]]) = 4 semitones + an octave = 16 semitones above the root\n*'''11''' = compound perfect fourth ([[eleventh]]) = 5 semitones + an octave = 17 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}11''' = compound augmented fourth  (augmented eleventh) = 6 semitones + an octave = 18 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}13''' = compound minor sixth (minor thirteenth) = 8 semitones + an octave = 20 semitones above the root\n*'''13''' = compound major sixth ([[thirteenth]]) = 9 semitones + an octave = 21 semitones above the root\n\n===Extensions===\n\nOptional extensions to the chords are written in parentheses, e.g. ({{music|sharp}}11). These notes are not necessary to define the function of the chord, but are included to add colour or fill out the sound according to the tastes of the performer. Extensions may be written into the chords when a specific colour or texture is warranted, or the chords in a lead sheet or fake book may simply state \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\". This does not mean that the chord-playing performer can only perform four-note [[dominant seventh]] chords. Chord-playing performers can use their ear, their sense of good taste acquired from listening to jazz, and their knowledge of the style of the tune being played (e.g., is it a [[bebop]] tune or a [[jazz fusion]] tune) to help guide her use of extension notes, altered extensions, and added tones. In a band, the [[bandleader]] might request that certain voicings be used (e.g., {{music|b}}9/{{music|#}}11) or request that certain other voicings be avoided (e.g., {{music|b}}13), due to the bandleader's taste.\n\n===Voicings===\n\nChords are described here in terms of intervals relative to the root of the chord, arranged from smaller intervals to larger. This is a standard method used when describing jazz chords as it shows them hierarchically: Lower intervals (third, [[fifth (chord)|fifth]] and seventh) are more important in defining the function of the chord than the upper intervals or extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), which add color. Although it is possible to play the chords as described here literally, it is possible to use different orderings of the same notes, known as a voicings, or even by omitting certain notes.{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=C<sup>13({{music|sharp}}11)</sup>|max-width=}}For instance, the dominant seventh {{music|sharp}}11 or [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] dominant, C<sup>7{{music|sharp}}11</sup>, comprises the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, (5), 7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11, (13).\n\nBasing this chord on the pitch, C, results in the pitches:\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, G, B{{music|flat}}, D, F{{music|sharp}}, A.\n\nThe same chord type may also be voiced:\n\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, B{{music|flat}}, F{{music|sharp}}, A, D, F{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThis voicing omits both the root and the perfect fifth (G) and raises the major ninth (D) by an octave. The augmented eleventh (F{{music|sharp}}) is also played twice in two different registers. This is known as \"[[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]\".\n\n===Improvisation===\n\n[[File:Notes bell curve.png|thumb|An arrangement of musical intervals according to how satisfying they may sound.]]\n\nJazz improvisation is partly about selecting intervals within the chord or melody being played at a particular place in a song. While there are no right or wrong choices if notes are played in correct context, the graphic suggests how choices can be anything from boring through interesting to 'wrong' sounding, but of course these judgments are strongly a matter of taste and experience. Notes farther from the chord can often be inserted between other notes that are on the chord, such as E-Eb-Db-C over a C7 chord.\n\n==Chord types==\n===Basic chord types===\n\nThe above chords, despite their differences, share the same harmonic function and can be used interchangeably.\n\n==== Major chords ====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u03947</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root, 3, 5, M7, (9).\nThe symbols '''<sup>M7</sup>''' and '''<sup>\u03947</sup>''' have the same meaning as '''maj<sup>7</sup>''' or just '''<sup>\u0394</sup>'''. Often melody notes or other pitches influence an improviser's choice of chord types. For example, if the melody note is the root of the chord, including a major seventh can cause dissonance.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major sixth chord on C i.e. C<sup>6</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major sixth chord]] contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a d>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major 6/9 chord on C i.e. C<sup>6/9</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[6/9 chord]] (C<sup>6/9</sup> or C<sup>6add9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6, 9.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Lydian chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Lydian chord]] (C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, M7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11 (13).\nThe Lydian chord has a strange quirk, where if you put the root both above and below the augmented eleventh it creates an unpleasant dissonance of a [[tritone]]. This is not usually a problem in a jazz context, as chord-playing musicians often omit the root.\n\nThe interval of the sixth is used, even though it is described after other compound intervals and perhaps should also be a compound interval (i.e., 13th). However, a convention in jazz dictates that when describing the major sixth, generally use the simple interval, i.e., 6 is often used instead of the compound interval, i.e., 13. This helps avoid confusion with the [[dominant thirteenth chord]].\n\n====Basic dominant chords====\nThe term ''basic'' can be used to describe [[Dominant chord|dominant chords]] based on the major scale.{{citation needed|April 2020}} In many instances, dominant chords written as a basic chord (e.g., C<sup>13</sup>) can substitute for a more complex chord, as long as it remains part of the same group (i.e., dominant chords) and does not clash with the melody note.\n\nDominant chords are considered to sound unstable in a [[classical music]] harmony context, and so in a classical piece, these chords often resolve down a perfect fifth or up a perfect fourth (e.g. '''C<sup>7</sup>''' tends to resolve onto chords based on '''F''', such as F major or F minor). However, in a jazz context, particularly in music from the 1940s [[bebop]] era and later decades, dominant chords were no longer treated as \"unstable\" chords. Some bebop tunes use a dominant chord as the [[tonic (music)|tonic chord]] and also use dominant chords for the chords that would typically be minor chords in a [[Classical music|Classical]] piece or a [[Swing music|swing]] arrangement. For example, while a Classical piece and a swing arrangement might use the following chord sequence in the key of C major: \"{{nowrap|C \u2013 Am \u2013 Dm \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", a bebop [[bandleader]] might reharmonize the same progression as \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", making a sequence of dominant seventh chords, so long as the new dominant chord harmonies were compatible with the tune's melody. For more details, see [[chord progression]].\n\nMany of the chordal alterations used in jazz are derived from minor scale modes, as opposed to the major scale modes. (See [[musical mode]]). If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a {{music|flat}}13th, it can be substituted for a C<sup>13{{music|flat}}9</sup>. Likewise a C<sup>9</sup> can often be substituted for a Cmaj<sup>9{{music|sharp}}5</sup>, as long as the 9th is retained or the {{music|flat}}9th and {{music|sharp}}9th is avoided.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes>1\n   <c e g bes d>1\n   <c e g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant seventh, ninth, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. C<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>9</sup>, and C<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A [[dominant seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), (13).\n\nA [[dominant ninth chord]] (C<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, 9, (13).\n\nA [[dominant thirteenth chord]] (C<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), 13.\n\nThis symbol is often used if the 13th is found in the melody.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c f g>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Sus chord on C i.e. C<sup>sus4</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Suspended chord|sus, or suspended, chord]] (C<sup>7sus4</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, 4, 5, 7, (9), (13).\n\n====Minor seventh chords====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c es g bes>1\n   <c es g bes d>1\n   <c es g bes d f>1\n   <c es g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Minor seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. Cm<sup>7</sup>, Cm<sup>9</sup>, Cm<sup>11</sup>, Cm<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A minor seventh chord (C\u2212<sup>7</sup>, Cmin<sup>7</sup>, Cmi<sup>7</sup>, or Cm<sup>7</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), (13).\n\nA minor ninth chord (C\u2212<sup>9</sup>, Cmin<sup>9</sup>, Cmi<sup>9</sup>, or Cm<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, 9, (11), (13).\n\nA minor eleventh chord (C\u2212<sup>11</sup>, Cmin<sup>11</sup>, Cmi<sup>11</sup>, or Cm<sup>11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), 11, (13).\n\nA minor thirteenth chord (C\u2212<sup>13</sup>, Cmin<sup>13</sup>, Cmi<sup>13</sup>, or Cm<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), 13.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Complex dominant chords===\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Augmented seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nThese chords can be voiced in a great variety of ways, including building the chord on the 7 (minor seventh).

In jazz chords and theory, most [[triad (music)|triad]]s that appear in [[lead sheet]]s or [[fake book]]s can have [[Seventh (chord)|sevenths]] added to them, using the performer's discretion and ear. For example, if a tune is in the key of C, if there is a G chord, the chord-playing performer usually [[Chord voicing|voices]] this chord as G<sup>7</sup>.

However, not all jazz pianists leave out the root when they play voicings: [[Bud Powell]], one of the best-known of the bebop pianists, and [[Horace Silver]], whose quintet included many of jazz's biggest names from the 1950s to the 1970s, included the root note in their voicings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-voicings/powell-voicings/|title=Bud Powell Chord Voicings - The Jazz Piano Site|work=The Jazz Piano Site|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/259793476/5-Ways-to-Play-Like-Horace-Silver|title=5 Ways to Play Like Horace Silver {{!}} Jazz {{!}} Piano|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n[[jazz improvisation|Improvising]] chord-playing musicians who omit the root and fifth are given the option to play other notes. For example, if a seventh chord, such as G<sup>7</sup>, appears in a lead sheet or fake book, many chord-playing performers add the [[ninth]] or [[thirteenth]] to the chord, even though the lead sheet does not specify these additional notes. Jazz players can add these additional, upper notes\u2013seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth\u2013because they can create an important part of the jazz sound. Lead sheets and fake books often do not detail how to voice the chord because a lead sheet or fake book is only intended to provide basic guide to the harmony.

This provides an accurate and easily understandable basis for working out these chords in each key.\n\nThe terms used to describe intervals are as follows:\n*'''r''' = [[root (chord)|root]] of the chord (while the root is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the root is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|flat}}2''' = minor second = 1 [[semitone]] (half step) above the root\n*'''2''' = [[major second]] = 2 semitones above root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}2''' = [[augmented second]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}3''' = [[minor third]] = 3 semitones above the root\n*'''3''' = [[major third]] = 4 semitones above the root\n*'''4''' = [[perfect fourth]] = 5 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}4''' = [[Augmented Fourth|augmented fourth]] ([[tritone]]) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}5''' = [[diminished fifth]] (tritone) = 6 semitones above the root\n*'''5''' = [[perfect fifth]] = 7 semitones above the root (while the fifth is widely used in [[classical music]], [[pop music]] and [[rock music]] chord voicings, in jazz, the fifth is often omitted by the chord-playing performer(s))\n*'''{{music|sharp}}5''' = [[augmented fifth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}6''' = [[minor sixth]] = 8 semitones above the root\n*'''6''' = [[major sixth]] = 9 semitones above the root\n*'''7''' = [[minor seventh]] = 10 semitones above the root\n*'''M7''' = [[major seventh]] = 11 semitones above the root\n\nAll [[Inversion (music)#Root position|root chords]] are described starting with the lowest note, and ascending in pitch. For instance, a chord described as\n\n:root, 3, 5.\n\ncontains the root, a major third above the root, and a perfect fifth above the root. It is a [[Major chord|major triad]]. If this chord were built on C (with C as the root), it would contain the notes\n\n:C, E, G.\n\n==== Compound intervals ====\n[[Interval (music)#Number|Compound intervals]] are intervals larger than an [[octave]]. They can also be described as an octave plus a simple interval. Note that this is not a complete list of compound intervals, only those that are commonly used in jazz chords.\n\n*'''{{music|flat}}9''' = compound minor second ([[minor ninth]]) = 1 semitone + an octave = 13 semitones above the root\n*'''9''' = compound major second ([[ninth]]) = 2 semitones + an octave = 14 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}9'''/'''{{music|flat}}10''' = compound [[augmented second]]/minor third (augmented ninth/minor tenth) = 3 semitones + an octave = 15 semitones above the root.\n*'''10''' = compound major third ([[tenth (music)|tenth]]) = 4 semitones + an octave = 16 semitones above the root\n*'''11''' = compound perfect fourth ([[eleventh]]) = 5 semitones + an octave = 17 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|sharp}}11''' = compound augmented fourth  (augmented eleventh) = 6 semitones + an octave = 18 semitones above the root\n*'''{{music|flat}}13''' = compound minor sixth (minor thirteenth) = 8 semitones + an octave = 20 semitones above the root\n*'''13''' = compound major sixth ([[thirteenth]]) = 9 semitones + an octave = 21 semitones above the root\n\n===Extensions===\n\nOptional extensions to the chords are written in parentheses, e.g. ({{music|sharp}}11). These notes are not necessary to define the function of the chord, but are included to add colour or fill out the sound according to the tastes of the performer. Extensions may be written into the chords when a specific colour or texture is warranted, or the chords in a lead sheet or fake book may simply state \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\". This does not mean that the chord-playing performer can only perform four-note [[dominant seventh]] chords. Chord-playing performers can use their ear, their sense of good taste acquired from listening to jazz, and their knowledge of the style of the tune being played (e.g., is it a [[bebop]] tune or a [[jazz fusion]] tune) to help guide her use of extension notes, altered extensions, and added tones. In a band, the [[bandleader]] might request that certain voicings be used (e.g., {{music|b}}9/{{music|#}}11) or request that certain other voicings be avoided (e.g., {{music|b}}13), due to the bandleader's taste.\n\n===Voicings===\n\nChords are described here in terms of intervals relative to the root of the chord, arranged from smaller intervals to larger. This is a standard method used when describing jazz chords as it shows them hierarchically: Lower intervals (third, [[fifth (chord)|fifth]] and seventh) are more important in defining the function of the chord than the upper intervals or extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), which add color. Although it is possible to play the chords as described here literally, it is possible to use different orderings of the same notes, known as a voicings, or even by omitting certain notes.{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=C<sup>13({{music|sharp}}11)</sup>|max-width=}}For instance, the dominant seventh {{music|sharp}}11 or [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] dominant, C<sup>7{{music|sharp}}11</sup>, comprises the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, (5), 7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11, (13).\n\nBasing this chord on the pitch, C, results in the pitches:\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, G, B{{music|flat}}, D, F{{music|sharp}}, A.\n\nThe same chord type may also be voiced:\n\n:C <small>(often omitted)</small>, E, B{{music|flat}}, F{{music|sharp}}, A, D, F{{music|sharp}}.\n\nThis voicing omits both the root and the perfect fifth (G) and raises the major ninth (D) by an octave. The augmented eleventh (F{{music|sharp}}) is also played twice in two different registers. This is known as \"[[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]]\".\n\n===Improvisation===\n\n[[File:Notes bell curve.png|thumb|An arrangement of musical intervals according to how satisfying they may sound.]]\n\nJazz improvisation is partly about selecting intervals within the chord or melody being played at a particular place in a song. While there are no right or wrong choices if notes are played in correct context, the graphic suggests how choices can be anything from boring through interesting to 'wrong' sounding, but of course these judgments are strongly a matter of taste and experience. Notes farther from the chord can often be inserted between other notes that are on the chord, such as E-Eb-Db-C over a C7 chord.\n\n==Chord types==\n===Basic chord types===\n\nThe above chords, despite their differences, share the same harmonic function and can be used interchangeably.\n\n==== Major chords ====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u03947</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root, 3, 5, M7, (9).\nThe symbols '''<sup>M7</sup>''' and '''<sup>\u03947</sup>''' have the same meaning as '''maj<sup>7</sup>''' or just '''<sup>\u0394</sup>'''. Often melody notes or other pitches influence an improviser's choice of chord types. For example, if the melody note is the root of the chord, including a major seventh can cause dissonance.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major sixth chord on C i.e. C<sup>6</sup>|max-width=}}\nA [[major sixth chord]] contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g a d>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Major 6/9 chord on C i.e. C<sup>6/9</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[6/9 chord]] (C<sup>6/9</sup> or C<sup>6add9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, 6, 9.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g b d fis a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Lydian chord on C i.e. C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Lydian chord]] (C<sup>\u0394{{music|sharp}}11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5, M7, (9), {{music|sharp}}11 (13).\nThe Lydian chord has a strange quirk, where if you put the root both above and below the augmented eleventh it creates an unpleasant dissonance of a [[tritone]]. This is not usually a problem in a jazz context, as chord-playing musicians often omit the root.\n\nThe interval of the sixth is used, even though it is described after other compound intervals and perhaps should also be a compound interval (i.e., 13th). However, a convention in jazz dictates that when describing the major sixth, generally use the simple interval, i.e., 6 is often used instead of the compound interval, i.e., 13. This helps avoid confusion with the [[dominant thirteenth chord]].\n\n====Basic dominant chords====\n''Basic'' describes [[Dominant chord|dominant chords]] based on the major scale. In many instances, dominant chords written as a basic chord (e.g., C<sup>13</sup>) can substitute for a more complex chord, as long as it remains part of the same group (i.e., dominant chords) and does not clash with the melody note.\n\nDominant chords are considered to sound unstable in a [[classical music]] harmony context, and so in a classical piece, these chords often resolve down a perfect fifth or up a perfect fourth (e.g. '''C<sup>7</sup>''' tends to resolve onto chords based on '''F''', such as F major or F minor). However, in a jazz context, particularly in music from the 1940s [[bebop]] era and later decades, dominant chords were no longer treated as \"unstable\" chords. Some bebop tunes use a dominant chord as the [[tonic (music)|tonic chord]] and also use dominant chords for the chords that would typically be minor chords in a [[Classical music|Classical]] piece or a [[Swing music|swing]] arrangement. For example, while a Classical piece and a swing arrangement might use the following chord sequence in the key of C major: \"{{nowrap|C \u2013 Am \u2013 Dm \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", a bebop [[bandleader]] might reharmonize the same progression as \"{{nowrap|C<sup>7</sup> \u2013 A<sup>7</sup> \u2013 D<sup>7</sup> \u2013 G<sup>7</sup>}}\", making a sequence of dominant seventh chords, so long as the new dominant chord harmonies were compatible with the tune's melody. For more details, see [[chord progression]].\n\nMany of the chordal alterations used in jazz are derived from minor scale modes, as opposed to the major scale modes. (See [[musical mode]]). If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a {{music|flat}}13th, it can be substituted for a C<sup>13{{music|flat}}9</sup>. Likewise a C<sup>9</sup> can often be substituted for a Cmaj<sup>9{{music|sharp}}5</sup>, as long as the 9th is retained or the {{music|flat}}9th and {{music|sharp}}9th is avoided.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e g bes>1\n   <c e g bes d>1\n   <c e g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Dominant seventh, ninth, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. C<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>9</sup>, and C<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A [[dominant seventh chord]] contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), (13).\n\nA [[dominant ninth chord]] (C<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, 9, (13).\n\nA [[dominant thirteenth chord]] (C<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root <small>(often omitted)</small>, 3, 5 <small>(often omitted)</small>, 7, (9), 13.\n\nThis symbol is often used if the 13th is found in the melody.\n\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c f g>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Sus chord on C i.e. C<sup>sus4</sup>|max-width=}}\n\nA [[Suspended chord|sus, or suspended, chord]] (C<sup>7sus4</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, 4, 5, 7, (9), (13).\n\n====Minor seventh chords====\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c es g bes>1\n   <c es g bes d>1\n   <c es g bes d f>1\n   <c es g bes d f a>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Minor seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords on C i.e. Cm<sup>7</sup>, Cm<sup>9</sup>, Cm<sup>11</sup>, Cm<sup>13</sup>|max-width=}}A minor seventh chord (C\u2212<sup>7</sup>, Cmin<sup>7</sup>, Cmi<sup>7</sup>, or Cm<sup>7</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), (13).\n\nA minor ninth chord (C\u2212<sup>9</sup>, Cmin<sup>9</sup>, Cmi<sup>9</sup>, or Cm<sup>9</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, 9, (11), (13).\n\nA minor eleventh chord (C\u2212<sup>11</sup>, Cmin<sup>11</sup>, Cmi<sup>11</sup>, or Cm<sup>11</sup>) contains the notes:\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), 11, (13).\n\nA minor thirteenth chord (C\u2212<sup>13</sup>, Cmin<sup>13</sup>, Cmi<sup>13</sup>, or Cm<sup>13</sup>) contains the notes:\n\n:root, {{music|flat}}3, 5, 7, (9), (11), 13.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Complex dominant chords===\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n   \\clef treble \n   \\time 4/4\n   \\key c \\major\n   <c e gis bes>1\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=Augmented seventh chord on C i.e. C<sup>7({{music|sharp}}5)</sup>|max-width=}}\nThese chords can be voiced in a great variety of ways, including building the chord on the 7 (minor seventh).

Coincidentally, all altered tones mentioned above are present in the [[melodic minor scale]] whose root is a half-step above the root of the [[altered chord|alt chord]] (i.e., E{{music|flat}} melodic minor for D<sup>7alt</sup>) In the previous dominant chords, it was noted that the perfect fifth is often omitted.

Cavalieri's work was not well respected since his methods could lead to erroneous results, and the infinitesimal quantities he introduced were disreputable at first.\n\nThe formal study of calculus brought together Cavalieri's infinitesimals with the [[calculus of finite differences]] developed in Europe at around the same time.

In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a [[cycloid]], and many other problems discussed in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear that he understood the principles of the [[Taylor series]]. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] was the first to state clearly the rules of calculus.]]\n\nThese ideas were arranged into a true calculus of infinitesimals by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who was originally accused of [[plagiarism]] by Newton.<ref name=leib>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm.

His contribution was to provide a clear set of rules for working with infinitesimal quantities, allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and providing the [[product rule]] and [[chain rule]], in their differential and integral forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz paid a lot of attention to the formalism, often spending days determining appropriate symbols for concepts.\n\nToday, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] are usually both given credit for independently inventing and developing calculus. Newton was the first to apply calculus to general [[physics]] and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. By Newton's time, the fundamental theorem of calculus was known.\n\nWhen Newton and Leibniz first published their results, there was [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|great controversy]] over which mathematician (and therefore which country) deserved credit. Newton derived his results first (later to be published in his ''[[Method of Fluxions]]''), but Leibniz published his \"[[Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis]]\" first. Newton claimed Leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished notes, which Newton had shared with a few members of the [[Royal Society]]. This controversy divided English-speaking mathematicians from continental European mathematicians for many years, to the detriment of English mathematics.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A careful examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton shows that they arrived at their results independently, with Leibniz starting first with integration and Newton with differentiation.  It is Leibniz, however, who gave the new discipline its name. Newton called his calculus \"[[Method of fluxions|the science of fluxions]]\".\n\nSince the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing development of calculus. One of the first and most complete works on both infinitesimal and [[integral calculus]] was written in 1748 by [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Eighteenth-century Woman Mathematician |edition=illustrated |first1=Antonella |last1=Cupillari |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7734-5226-8 |page=iii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urEfAQAAIAAJ&q=most+complete |contributor-last=Allaire|contributor-first=Patricia R.|contribution=Foreword}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/agnesi.htm| title=Maria Gaetana Agnesi| first=Elif| last=Unlu|date=April 1995| publisher   =[[Agnes Scott College]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Maria Gaetana Agnesi.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]]]]\n\n=== Foundations ===\nIn calculus, ''foundations'' refers to the [[Rigorous#Mathematical rigour|rigorous]] development of the subject from [[axiom]]s and definitions.  In early calculus the use of [[infinitesimal]] quantities was thought unrigorous, and was fiercely criticized by a number of authors, most notably [[Michel Rolle]] and [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]]. Berkeley famously described infinitesimals as the [[ghosts of departed quantities]] in his book ''[[The Analyst]]'' in 1734.  Working out a rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians for much of the century following Newton and Leibniz, and is still to some extent an active area of research today.\n\nSeveral mathematicians, including [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]], tried to prove the soundness of using infinitesimals, but it would not be until 150 years later when, due to the work of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], a way was finally found to avoid mere \"notions\" of infinitely small quantities.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Russell |first= Bertrand |authorlink= Bertrand Russell |year= 1946 |title= History of Western Philosophy |location= London |publisher= [[George Allen & Unwin Ltd]] |page= [https://archive.org/stream/westernphilosoph035502mbp#page/n857/mode/2up 857] |quote= The great mathematicians of the seventeenth century were optimistic and anxious for quick results; consequently they left the foundations of analytical geometry and the infinitesimal calculus insecure. Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but although this belief suited his metaphysics it had no sound basis in mathematics. Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, showed how to establish the calculus without infinitesimals, and thus at last made it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of continuity and infinite number. \"Continuity\" had been, until he defined it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics. Cantor gave a precise significance to the word, and showed that continuity, as he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists. By this means a great deal of mysticism, such as that of Bergson, was rendered antiquated. |title-link= A History of Western Philosophy }}</ref> The foundations of differential and integral calculus had been laid. In Cauchy's ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', we find a broad range of foundational approaches, including a definition of [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of infinitesimals, and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]] in the definition of differentiation.<ref>{{cite book |first=Judith V. |last=Grabiner |title=The Origins of Cauchy's Rigorous Calculus |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofcauchys00judi |url-access=registration |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-387-90527-3 }}</ref> In his work Weierstrass formalized the concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]<!--correct link?--> and eliminated infinitesimals (although his definition can actually validate [[nilsquare]] infinitesimals). Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities, though the subject is still occasionally called \"infinitesimal calculus\". [[Bernhard Riemann]] used these ideas to give a precise definition of the integral. It was also during this period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to [[Euclidean space]] and the [[complex plane]].\n\nIn modern mathematics, the foundations of calculus are included in the field of [[real analysis]], which contains full definitions and [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of the theorems of calculus.  The reach of calculus has also been greatly extended. [[Henri Lebesgue]] invented [[measure theory]] and used it to define integrals of all but the most [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] functions.  [[Laurent Schwartz]] introduced [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], which can be used to take the derivative of any function whatsoever.\n\nLimits are not the only rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus. Another way is to use [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]]. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from [[mathematical logic]] to augment the real number system with [[infinitesimal]] and [[Infinity|infinite]] numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called [[hyperreal number]]s, and they can be used to give a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. There is also [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates neglecting higher power infinitesimals during derivations.\n\n=== Significance ===\nWhile many of the ideas of calculus had been developed earlier in [[Greek mathematics|Greece]], [[Chinese mathematics|China]], [[Indian mathematics|India]], [[Islamic mathematics|Iraq, Persia]], and [[Japanese mathematics|Japan]], the use of calculus began in Europe, during the 17th century, when [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] built on the work of earlier mathematicians to introduce its basic principles. The development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion and area underneath curves.\n\nApplications of differential calculus include computations involving [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]], the [[slope]] of a curve, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]. Applications of integral calculus include computations involving area, [[volume]], [[arc length]], [[center of mass]], [[work (physics)|work]], and [[pressure]]. More advanced applications include [[power series]] and [[Fourier series]].\n\nCalculus is also used to gain a more precise understanding of the nature of space, time, and motion. For centuries, mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving [[division by zero]] or sums of infinitely many numbers. These questions arise in the study of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and area. The [[ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] gave several famous examples of such [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Calculus provides tools, especially the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the [[infinite series]], that resolve the paradoxes.\n\n== Principles ==\n\n=== Limits and infinitesimals ===\n{{Main|Limit of a function|Infinitesimal}}\nCalculus is usually developed by working with very small quantities. Historically, the first method of doing so was by [[infinitesimal]]s. These are objects which can be treated like real numbers but which are, in some sense, \"infinitely small\".  For example, an infinitesimal number could be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and thus less than any positive [[real number]]. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals.  The symbols '''<math>dx</math>''' and <math>dy</math> were taken to be infinitesimal, and the derivative <math>dy/dx</math> was simply their ratio.\n\nThe infinitesimal approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. However, the concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of [[non-standard analysis]] and [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.\n\nIn the late 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced within academia by the [[epsilon, delta]] approach to [[Limit of a function|limits]]. Limits describe the value of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby inputs. They capture small-scale behavior in the context of the [[real number|real number system]]. In this treatment, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by very small numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of the function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller numbers. Limits were thought to provide a more rigorous foundation for calculus, and for this reason they became the standard approach during the twentieth century.\n\n=== Differential calculus ===\n{{Main|Differential calculus}}\n[[File:Tangent derivative calculusdia.svg|thumb|300px|Tangent line at {{math|(''x'', ''f''(''x''))}}. The derivative {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'')}} of a curve at a point is the slope (rise over run) of the line tangent to that curve at that point.]]\n\nDifferential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the [[derivative]] of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called ''differentiation''. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the ''derivative function'' or just the ''derivative'' of the original function. In formal terms, the derivative is a [[linear operator]] which takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to produce another function. The function produced by deriving the squaring function turns out to be the doubling function.\n\nIn more explicit terms the \"doubling function\" may be denoted by {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} and the \"squaring function\" by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}. The \"derivative\" now takes the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, defined by the expression \"{{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}}\", as an input, that is all the information\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to output another function, the function {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}, as will turn out.\n\nThe most common symbol for a derivative is an [[apostrophe]]-like mark called [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. Thus, the derivative of a function called {{math|''f''}} is denoted by {{math|''f\u2032''}}, pronounced \"f prime\". For instance, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is the squaring function, then {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} is its derivative (the doubling function {{math|''g''}} from above). This notation is known as [[Lagrange's notation]].\n\nIf the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of {{math|''f''}} is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the [[velocity]] of the ball.\n\nIf a function is [[linear function|linear]] (that is, if the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, where {{math|''x''}} is the independent variable, {{math|''y''}} is the dependent variable, {{math|''b''}} is the ''y''-intercept, and:\n\n:<math>m= \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}= \\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.</math>\n\nThis gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line. If the graph of the function is not a straight line, however, then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies. Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output with respect to change in input. To be concrete, let {{math|''f''}} be a function, and fix a point {{math|''a''}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}}. {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} is a point on the graph of the function. If {{math|''h''}} is a number close to zero, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is a number close to {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}} is close to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}. The slope between these two points is\n\n:<math>m = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{(a+h) - a} = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is called a ''[[difference quotient]]''. A line through two points on a curve is called a ''secant line'', so {{math|''m''}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}. The secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point {{math|''a''}} because it does not account for what happens between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''a'' + ''h''}}. It is not possible to discover the behavior at {{math|''a''}} by setting {{math|''h''}} to zero because this would require [[dividing by zero]], which is undefined. The derivative is defined by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero, meaning that it considers the behavior of {{math|''f''}} for all small values of {{math|''h''}} and extracts a consistent value for the case when {{math|''h''}} equals zero:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0}{f(a+h) - f(a)\\over{h}}.</math>\n\nGeometrically, the derivative is the slope of the [[tangent line]] to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}. The tangent line is a limit of secant lines just as the derivative is a limit of difference quotients. For this reason, the derivative is sometimes called the slope of the function {{math|''f''}}.\n\nHere is a particular example, the derivative of the squaring function at the input 3. Let {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} be the squaring function.\n\n[[File:Sec2tan.gif|thumb|300px|The derivative {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'')}} of a curve at a point is the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. This slope is determined by considering the limiting value of the slopes of secant lines. Here the function involved (drawn in red) is {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x''}}. The tangent line (in green) which passes through the point {{nowrap|(\u22123/2, \u221215/8)}} has a slope of 23/4. Note that the vertical and horizontal scales in this image are different.]]\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}f'(3) &=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{(3+h)^2 - 3^2\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{6h + h^2\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (6 + h) \\\\\n&= 6\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe slope of the tangent line to the squaring function at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six times as fast as it is going to the right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the ''derivative function'' of the squaring function, or just the ''derivative'' of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.\n\n=== Leibniz notation ===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nA common notation, introduced by Leibniz, for the derivative in the example above is\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ny&=x^2 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx}&=2x.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nIn an approach based on limits, the symbol {{math|{{sfrac|''dy''|''dx''}}}} is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above. Leibniz, however, did intend it to represent the quotient of two infinitesimally small numbers, {{math|''dy''}} being the infinitesimally small change in {{math|''y''}} caused by an infinitesimally small change {{math|''dx''}} applied to {{math|''x''}}. We can also think of {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}}}} as a differentiation operator, which takes a function as an input and gives another function, the derivative, as the output. For example:\n:<math>\n\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2)=2x.\n</math>\n\nIn this usage, the {{math|''dx''}} in the denominator is read as \"with respect to {{math|''x''}}\". Another example of correct notation could be:\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\ng(t) = t^2 + 2t + 4 \\\\ \\\\\n{d \\over dt}g(t) = 2t + 2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nEven when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals, it is common to manipulate symbols like {{math|''dx''}} and {{math|''dy''}} as if they were real numbers; although it is possible to avoid such manipulations, they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the [[total derivative]].\n\n=== Integral calculus ===\n{{Main|Integral}}\n\n''Integral calculus'' is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the ''indefinite integral'' and the ''definite integral''. The process of finding the value of an integral is called ''integration''. In technical language, integral calculus studies two related [[linear operator]]s.\n\nThe ''indefinite integral'', also known as the ''[[antiderivative]]'', is the inverse operation to the derivative. {{math|''F''}} is an indefinite integral of {{math|''f''}} when {{math|''f''}} is a derivative of {{math|''F''}}.  (This use of lower- and upper-case letters for a function and its indefinite integral is common in calculus.)\n\nThe ''definite integral'' inputs a function and outputs a number, which gives the algebraic sum of areas between the graph of the input and the [[x-axis]]. The technical definition of the definite integral involves the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a sum of areas of rectangles, called a [[Riemann sum]].\n\nA motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time.\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Distance} = \\mathrm{Speed} \\cdot \\mathrm{Time}</math>\n\nIf the speed is constant, only multiplication is needed, but if the speed changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a [[Riemann sum]]) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.\n\n[[File:Constant velocity.png|left|thumb|Constant velocity]]\n[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|right|thumb|280px|Integration can be thought of as measuring the area under a curve, defined by {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, between two points (here {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}).]]\nWhen velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given time interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time.  For example, travelling a steady 50&nbsp;mph for 3 hours results in a total distance of 150 miles.  In the diagram on the left, when constant velocity and time are graphed, these two values form a rectangle with height equal to the velocity and width equal to the time elapsed.  Therefore, the product of velocity and time also calculates the rectangular area under the (constant) velocity curve.  This connection between the area under a curve and distance traveled can be extended to ''any'' irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating velocity over a given time period. If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} in the diagram on the right represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled (between the times represented by {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}) is the area of the shaded region&nbsp;{{math|''s''}}.\n\nTo approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} into a number of equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol {{math|\u0394''x''}}. For each small segment, we can choose one value of the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. Call that value {{math|''h''}}. Then the area of the rectangle with base {{math|\u0394''x''}} and height {{math|''h''}} gives the distance (time {{math|\u0394''x''}} multiplied by speed {{math|''h''}}) traveled in that segment.   Associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''}}. The sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for {{math|\u0394''x''}} will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact answer we need to take a limit as {{math|\u0394''x''}} approaches zero.\n\nThe symbol of integration is <math>\\int </math>, an [[long s|elongated ''S'']] (the ''S'' stands for \"sum\"). The definite integral is written as:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nand is read \"the integral from ''a'' to ''b'' of ''f''-of-''x'' with respect to ''x''.\"  The Leibniz notation {{math|''dx''}} is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes the infinitesimally small {{math|''dx''}}.  In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b \\cdots\\, dx</math>\n\nis to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an output. The terminating differential, {{math|''dx''}}, is not a number, and is not being multiplied by {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, although, serving as a reminder of the {{math|\u0394''x''}} limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations of the integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which the function is integrated and serves as a closing bracket for the integration operator.\n\nThe indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:\n\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nFunctions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant. Since the derivative of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''C''}}, where {{math|''C''}} is any constant, is {{math|''y\u2032'' {{=}} 2''x''}}, the antiderivative of the latter is given by:\n:<math>\\int 2x\\, dx = x^2 + C.</math>\nThe unspecified constant {{math|''C''}} present in the indefinite integral or antiderivative is known as the [[constant of integration]].\n\n=== Fundamental theorem ===\n{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}\nThe [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. More precisely, it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals. Because it is usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply the definition of a definite integral, the fundamental theorem of calculus provides a practical way of computing definite integrals. It can also be interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that differentiation is the inverse of integration.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus states: If a function {{math|''f''}} is [[continuous function|continuous]] on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and if {{math|''F''}} is a function whose derivative is {{math|''f''}} on the interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, then\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\nFurthermore, for every {{math|''x''}} in the interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}},\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_a^x f(t)\\, dt = f(x).</math>\n\nThis realization, made by both [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], who based their results on earlier work by [[Isaac Barrow]], was key to the proliferation of analytic results after their work became known. The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic method of computing many definite integrals\u2014without performing limit processes\u2014by finding formulas for [[antiderivative]]s. It is also a prototype solution of a [[differential equation]]. Differential equations relate an unknown function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|right|The [[logarithmic spiral]] of the [[Nautilus|Nautilus shell]] is a classical image used to depict the growth and change related to calculus.]]\nCalculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, [[actuarial science]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[business]], [[medicine]], [[demography]], and in other fields wherever a problem can be [[mathematical model|mathematically modeled]] and an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the other.\n\n[[Physics]] makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]] are related through calculus. The [[mass]] of an object of known [[density]], the [[moment of inertia]] of objects, as well as the total energy of an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus. An example of the use of calculus in mechanics is [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]]: historically stated it expressly uses the term \"change of motion\" which implies the derivative saying ''The'' '''change''' ''of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.'' Commonly expressed today as Force&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mass&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;acceleration, it implies differential calculus because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity or second time derivative of trajectory or spatial position. Starting from knowing how an object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.\n\nMaxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] are also expressed in the language of differential calculus. Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and radioactive decay. In biology, population dynamics starts with reproduction and death rates to model population changes.\n\nCalculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines. For example, it can be used with [[linear algebra]] to find the \"best fit\" linear approximation for a set of points in a domain. Or it can be used in [[probability theory]] to determine the probability of a continuous random variable from an assumed density function. In [[analytic geometry]], the study of graphs of functions, calculus is used to find high points and low points (maxima and minima), slope, [[Concave function|concavity]] and [[inflection points]].\n\n[[Green's Theorem]], which gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a [[planimeter]], which is used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing. For example, it can be used to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.\n\n[[Discrete Green's Theorem]], which gives the relationship between a double integral of a function around a simple closed rectangular curve ''C'' and a linear combination of the antiderivative's values at corner points along the edge of the curve, allows fast calculation of sums of values in rectangular domains.  For example, it can be used to efficiently calculate sums of rectangular domains in images, in order to rapidly extract features and detect object; another algorithm that could be used is the [[summed area table]].\n\nIn the realm of medicine, calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow. From the decay laws for a particular drug's elimination from the body, it is used to derive dosing laws. In nuclear medicine, it is used to build models of radiation transport in targeted tumor therapies.\n\nIn economics, calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily calculate both [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal revenue]].\n\nCalculus is also used to find approximate solutions to equations; in practice it is the standard way to solve differential equations and do root finding in most applications. Examples are methods such as [[Newton's method]], [[fixed point iteration]], and [[linear approximation]]. For instance, spacecraft use a variation of the [[Euler method]] to approximate curved courses within zero gravity environments.\n\n==Varieties==\nOver the years, many reformulations of calculus have been investigated for different purposes.\n\n=== Non-standard calculus ===\n{{Main|Non-standard calculus}}\nImprecise calculations with infinitesimals were widely replaced with the rigorous [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]] starting in the 1870s. Meanwhile, calculations with infinitesimals persisted and often led to correct results. This led [[Abraham Robinson]] to investigate if it were possible to develop a number system with infinitesimal quantities over which the theorems of calculus were still valid. In 1960, building upon the work of [[Edwin Hewitt]] and [[Jerzy \u0141o\u015b]], he succeeded in developing [[non-standard analysis]]. The theory of non-standard analysis is rich enough to be applied in many branches of mathematics.  As such, books and articles dedicated solely to the traditional theorems of calculus often go by the title [[non-standard calculus]].\n\n=== Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===\n{{Main|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}\nThis is another reformulation of the calculus in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s. Based on the ideas of [[F. W. Lawvere]] and employing the methods of [[category theory]], it views all functions as being [[continuous function|continuous]] and incapable of being expressed in terms of [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities.  One aspect of this formulation is that the [[law of excluded middle]] does not hold in this formulation.\n\n=== Constructive analysis ===\n{{Main|Constructive analysis}}\n\n[[Constructive mathematics]] is a branch of mathematics that insists that proofs of the existence of a number, function, or other mathematical object should give a construction of the object. As such constructive mathematics also rejects the [[law of excluded middle]]. Reformulations of calculus in a constructive framework are generally part of the subject of [[constructive analysis]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Main|Outline of calculus}}\n\n=== Lists ===\n* [[Glossary of calculus]]\n* [[List of calculus topics]]\n* [[List of derivatives and integrals in alternative calculi]]\n* [[List of differentiation identities]]\n* [[List of publications in mathematics#Calculus|Publications in calculus]]\n* [[Table of integrals]]\n\n=== Other related topics ===\n* [[Calculus of finite differences]]\n* [[Calculus with polynomials]]\n* [[Complex analysis]]\n* [[Differential equation]]\n* [[Differential geometry and topology|Differential geometry]]\n* ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''\n* [[Discrete calculus]]\n* [[Fourier series]]\n* [[Integral equation]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multivariable calculus]]\n* [[Non-classical analysis]]\n* [[Non-standard analysis]]\n* [[Non-standard calculus]]\n* [[Precalculus]] ([[Mathematics education|mathematical education]])\n* [[Product integral]]\n* [[Stochastic calculus]]\n* [[Taylor series]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n=== Books ===\n<!-- Please use APA style; it's a lot easier for it to stay universally readable. -->\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* [[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Boyer, Carl Benjamin]] (1949).

In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a [[cycloid]], and many other problems discussed in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear that he understood the principles of the [[Taylor series]]. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] was the first to state clearly the rules of calculus.]]\n\nThese ideas were arranged into a true calculus of infinitesimals by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who was originally accused of [[plagiarism]] by Newton.<ref name=leib>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm.

His contribution was to provide a clear set of rules for working with infinitesimal quantities, allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and providing the [[product rule]] and [[chain rule]], in their differential and integral forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz paid a lot of attention to the formalism, often spending days determining appropriate symbols for concepts.\n\nToday, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] are usually both given credit for independently inventing and developing calculus. Newton was the first to apply calculus to general [[physics]] and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. By Newton's time, the fundamental theorem of calculus was known.\n\nWhen Newton and Leibniz first published their results, there was [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|great controversy]] over which mathematician (and therefore which country) deserved credit. Newton derived his results first (later to be published in his ''[[Method of Fluxions]]''), but Leibniz published his \"[[Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis]]\" first. Newton claimed Leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished notes, which Newton had shared with a few members of the [[Royal Society]]. This controversy divided English-speaking mathematicians from continental European mathematicians for many years, to the detriment of English mathematics.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A careful examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton shows that they arrived at their results independently, with Leibniz starting first with integration and Newton with differentiation.  It is Leibniz, however, who gave the new discipline its name. Newton called his calculus \"[[Method of fluxions|the science of fluxions]]\".\n\nSince the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing development of calculus. One of the first and most complete works on both infinitesimal and [[integral calculus]] was written in 1748 by [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Eighteenth-century Woman Mathematician |edition=illustrated |first1=Antonella |last1=Cupillari |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7734-5226-8 |page=iii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urEfAQAAIAAJ&q=most+complete |contributor-last=Allaire|contributor-first=Patricia R.|contribution=Foreword}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/agnesi.htm| title=Maria Gaetana Agnesi| first=Elif| last=Unlu|date=April 1995| publisher   =[[Agnes Scott College]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Maria Gaetana Agnesi.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]]]]\n\n=== Foundations ===\nIn calculus, ''foundations'' refers to the [[Rigorous#Mathematical rigour|rigorous]] development of the subject from [[axiom]]s and definitions.  In early calculus the use of [[infinitesimal]] quantities was thought unrigorous, and was fiercely criticized by a number of authors, most notably [[Michel Rolle]] and [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]]. Berkeley famously described infinitesimals as the [[ghosts of departed quantities]] in his book ''[[The Analyst]]'' in 1734.  Working out a rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians for much of the century following Newton and Leibniz, and is still to some extent an active area of research today.\n\nSeveral mathematicians, including [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]], tried to prove the soundness of using infinitesimals, but it would not be until 150 years later when, due to the work of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], a way was finally found to avoid mere \"notions\" of infinitely small quantities.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Russell |first= Bertrand |authorlink= Bertrand Russell |year= 1946 |title= History of Western Philosophy |location= London |publisher= [[George Allen & Unwin Ltd]] |page= [https://archive.org/stream/westernphilosoph035502mbp#page/n857/mode/2up 857] |quote= The great mathematicians of the seventeenth century were optimistic and anxious for quick results; consequently they left the foundations of analytical geometry and the infinitesimal calculus insecure. Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but although this belief suited his metaphysics it had no sound basis in mathematics. Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, showed how to establish the calculus without infinitesimals, and thus at last made it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of continuity and infinite number. \"Continuity\" had been, until he defined it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics. Cantor gave a precise significance to the word, and showed that continuity, as he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists. By this means a great deal of mysticism, such as that of Bergson, was rendered antiquated. |title-link= A History of Western Philosophy }}</ref> The foundations of differential and integral calculus had been laid. In Cauchy's ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', we find a broad range of foundational approaches, including a definition of [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of infinitesimals, and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]] in the definition of differentiation.<ref>{{cite book |first=Judith V. |last=Grabiner |title=The Origins of Cauchy's Rigorous Calculus |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofcauchys00judi |url-access=registration |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-387-90527-3 }}</ref> In his work Weierstrass formalized the concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]<!--correct link?--> and eliminated infinitesimals (although his definition can actually validate [[nilsquare]] infinitesimals). Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities, though the subject is still occasionally called \"infinitesimal calculus\". [[Bernhard Riemann]] used these ideas to give a precise definition of the integral. It was also during this period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to [[Euclidean space]] and the [[complex plane]].\n\nIn modern mathematics, the foundations of calculus are included in the field of [[real analysis]], which contains full definitions and [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of the theorems of calculus.  The reach of calculus has also been greatly extended. [[Henri Lebesgue]] invented [[measure theory]] and used it to define integrals of all but the most [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] functions.  [[Laurent Schwartz]] introduced [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], which can be used to take the derivative of any function whatsoever.\n\nLimits are not the only rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus. Another way is to use [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]]. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from [[mathematical logic]] to augment the real number system with [[infinitesimal]] and [[Infinity|infinite]] numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called [[hyperreal number]]s, and they can be used to give a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. There is also [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates neglecting higher power infinitesimals during derivations.\n\n=== Significance ===\nWhile many of the ideas of calculus had been developed earlier in [[Greek mathematics|Greece]], [[Chinese mathematics|China]], [[Indian mathematics|India]], [[Islamic mathematics|Iraq, Persia]], and [[Japanese mathematics|Japan]], the use of calculus began in Europe, during the 17th century, when [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] built on the work of earlier mathematicians to introduce its basic principles. The development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion and area underneath curves.\n\nApplications of differential calculus include computations involving [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]], the [[slope]] of a curve, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]. Applications of integral calculus include computations involving area, [[volume]], [[arc length]], [[center of mass]], [[work (physics)|work]], and [[pressure]]. More advanced applications include [[power series]] and [[Fourier series]].\n\nCalculus is also used to gain a more precise understanding of the nature of space, time, and motion. For centuries, mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving [[division by zero]] or sums of infinitely many numbers. These questions arise in the study of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and area. The [[ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] gave several famous examples of such [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Calculus provides tools, especially the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the [[infinite series]], that resolve the paradoxes.\n\n== Principles ==\n\n=== Limits and infinitesimals ===\n{{Main|Limit of a function|Infinitesimal}}\nCalculus is usually developed by working with very small quantities. Historically, the first method of doing so was by [[infinitesimal]]s. These are objects which can be treated like real numbers but which are, in some sense, \"infinitely small\".  For example, an infinitesimal number could be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and thus less than any positive [[real number]]. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals.  The symbols '''<math>dx</math>''' and <math>dy</math> were taken to be infinitesimal, and the derivative <math>dy/dx</math> was simply their ratio.\n\nThe infinitesimal approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. However, the concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of [[non-standard analysis]] and [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.\n\nIn the late 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced within academia by the [[epsilon, delta]] approach to [[Limit of a function|limits]]. Limits describe the value of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby inputs. They capture small-scale behavior in the context of the [[real number|real number system]]. In this treatment, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by very small numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of the function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller numbers. Limits were thought to provide a more rigorous foundation for calculus, and for this reason they became the standard approach during the twentieth century.\n\n=== Differential calculus ===\n{{Main|Differential calculus}}\n[[File:Tangent derivative calculusdia.svg|thumb|300px|Tangent line at {{math|(''x'', ''f''(''x''))}}. The derivative {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'')}} of a curve at a point is the slope (rise over run) of the line tangent to that curve at that point.]]\n\nDifferential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the [[derivative]] of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called ''differentiation''. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the ''derivative function'' or just the ''derivative'' of the original function. In formal terms, the derivative is a [[linear operator]] which takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to produce another function. The function produced by deriving the squaring function turns out to be the doubling function.\n\nIn more explicit terms the \"doubling function\" may be denoted by {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} and the \"squaring function\" by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}. The \"derivative\" now takes the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, defined by the expression \"{{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}}\", as an input, that is all the information\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to output another function, the function {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}, as will turn out.\n\nThe most common symbol for a derivative is an [[apostrophe]]-like mark called [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. Thus, the derivative of a function called {{math|''f''}} is denoted by {{math|''f\u2032''}}, pronounced \"f prime\". For instance, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is the squaring function, then {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} is its derivative (the doubling function {{math|''g''}} from above). This notation is known as [[Lagrange's notation]].\n\nIf the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of {{math|''f''}} is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the [[velocity]] of the ball.\n\nIf a function is [[linear function|linear]] (that is, if the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, where {{math|''x''}} is the independent variable, {{math|''y''}} is the dependent variable, {{math|''b''}} is the ''y''-intercept, and:\n\n:<math>m= \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}= \\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.</math>\n\nThis gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line. If the graph of the function is not a straight line, however, then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies. Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output with respect to change in input. To be concrete, let {{math|''f''}} be a function, and fix a point {{math|''a''}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}}. {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} is a point on the graph of the function. If {{math|''h''}} is a number close to zero, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is a number close to {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}} is close to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}. The slope between these two points is\n\n:<math>m = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{(a+h) - a} = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is called a ''[[difference quotient]]''. A line through two points on a curve is called a ''secant line'', so {{math|''m''}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}. The secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point {{math|''a''}} because it does not account for what happens between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''a'' + ''h''}}. It is not possible to discover the behavior at {{math|''a''}} by setting {{math|''h''}} to zero because this would require [[dividing by zero]], which is undefined. The derivative is defined by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero, meaning that it considers the behavior of {{math|''f''}} for all small values of {{math|''h''}} and extracts a consistent value for the case when {{math|''h''}} equals zero:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0}{f(a+h) - f(a)\\over{h}}.</math>\n\nGeometrically, the derivative is the slope of the [[tangent line]] to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}. The tangent line is a limit of secant lines just as the derivative is a limit of difference quotients. For this reason, the derivative is sometimes called the slope of the function {{math|''f''}}.\n\nHere is a particular example, the derivative of the squaring function at the input 3. Let {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} be the squaring function.\n\n[[File:Sec2tan.gif|thumb|300px|The derivative {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'')}} of a curve at a point is the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. This slope is determined by considering the limiting value of the slopes of secant lines. Here the function involved (drawn in red) is {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x''}}. The tangent line (in green) which passes through the point {{nowrap|(\u22123/2, \u221215/8)}} has a slope of 23/4. Note that the vertical and horizontal scales in this image are different.]]\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}f'(3) &=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{(3+h)^2 - 3^2\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{6h + h^2\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (6 + h) \\\\\n&= 6\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe slope of the tangent line to the squaring function at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six times as fast as it is going to the right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the ''derivative function'' of the squaring function, or just the ''derivative'' of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.\n\n=== Leibniz notation ===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nA common notation, introduced by Leibniz, for the derivative in the example above is\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ny&=x^2 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx}&=2x.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nIn an approach based on limits, the symbol {{math|{{sfrac|''dy''|''dx''}}}} is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above. Leibniz, however, did intend it to represent the quotient of two infinitesimally small numbers, {{math|''dy''}} being the infinitesimally small change in {{math|''y''}} caused by an infinitesimally small change {{math|''dx''}} applied to {{math|''x''}}. We can also think of {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}}}} as a differentiation operator, which takes a function as an input and gives another function, the derivative, as the output. For example:\n:<math>\n\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2)=2x.\n</math>\n\nIn this usage, the {{math|''dx''}} in the denominator is read as \"with respect to {{math|''x''}}\". Another example of correct notation could be:\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\ng(t) = t^2 + 2t + 4 \\\\ \\\\\n{d \\over dt}g(t) = 2t + 2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nEven when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals, it is common to manipulate symbols like {{math|''dx''}} and {{math|''dy''}} as if they were real numbers; although it is possible to avoid such manipulations, they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the [[total derivative]].\n\n=== Integral calculus ===\n{{Main|Integral}}\n\n''Integral calculus'' is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the ''indefinite integral'' and the ''definite integral''. The process of finding the value of an integral is called ''integration''. In technical language, integral calculus studies two related [[linear operator]]s.\n\nThe ''indefinite integral'', also known as the ''[[antiderivative]]'', is the inverse operation to the derivative. {{math|''F''}} is an indefinite integral of {{math|''f''}} when {{math|''f''}} is a derivative of {{math|''F''}}.  (This use of lower- and upper-case letters for a function and its indefinite integral is common in calculus.)\n\nThe ''definite integral'' inputs a function and outputs a number, which gives the algebraic sum of areas between the graph of the input and the [[x-axis]]. The technical definition of the definite integral involves the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a sum of areas of rectangles, called a [[Riemann sum]].\n\nA motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time.\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Distance} = \\mathrm{Speed} \\cdot \\mathrm{Time}</math>\n\nIf the speed is constant, only multiplication is needed, but if the speed changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a [[Riemann sum]]) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.\n\n[[File:Constant velocity.png|left|thumb|Constant velocity]]\n[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|right|thumb|280px|Integration can be thought of as measuring the area under a curve, defined by {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, between two points (here {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}).]]\nWhen velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given time interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time.  For example, travelling a steady 50&nbsp;mph for 3 hours results in a total distance of 150 miles.  In the diagram on the left, when constant velocity and time are graphed, these two values form a rectangle with height equal to the velocity and width equal to the time elapsed.  Therefore, the product of velocity and time also calculates the rectangular area under the (constant) velocity curve.  This connection between the area under a curve and distance traveled can be extended to ''any'' irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating velocity over a given time period. If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} in the diagram on the right represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled (between the times represented by {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}) is the area of the shaded region&nbsp;{{math|''s''}}.\n\nTo approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} into a number of equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol {{math|\u0394''x''}}. For each small segment, we can choose one value of the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. Call that value {{math|''h''}}. Then the area of the rectangle with base {{math|\u0394''x''}} and height {{math|''h''}} gives the distance (time {{math|\u0394''x''}} multiplied by speed {{math|''h''}}) traveled in that segment.   Associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''}}. The sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for {{math|\u0394''x''}} will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact answer we need to take a limit as {{math|\u0394''x''}} approaches zero.\n\nThe symbol of integration is <math>\\int </math>, an [[long s|elongated ''S'']] (the ''S'' stands for \"sum\"). The definite integral is written as:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nand is read \"the integral from ''a'' to ''b'' of ''f''-of-''x'' with respect to ''x''.\"  The Leibniz notation {{math|''dx''}} is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes the infinitesimally small {{math|''dx''}}.  In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b \\cdots\\, dx</math>\n\nis to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an output. The terminating differential, {{math|''dx''}}, is not a number, and is not being multiplied by {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, although, serving as a reminder of the {{math|\u0394''x''}} limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations of the integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which the function is integrated and serves as a closing bracket for the integration operator.\n\nThe indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:\n\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nFunctions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant. Since the derivative of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''C''}}, where {{math|''C''}} is any constant, is {{math|''y\u2032'' {{=}} 2''x''}}, the antiderivative of the latter is given by:\n:<math>\\int 2x\\, dx = x^2 + C.</math>\nThe unspecified constant {{math|''C''}} present in the indefinite integral or antiderivative is known as the [[constant of integration]].\n\n=== Fundamental theorem ===\n{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}\nThe [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. More precisely, it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals. Because it is usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply the definition of a definite integral, the fundamental theorem of calculus provides a practical way of computing definite integrals. It can also be interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that differentiation is the inverse of integration.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus states: If a function {{math|''f''}} is [[continuous function|continuous]] on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and if {{math|''F''}} is a function whose derivative is {{math|''f''}} on the interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, then\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\nFurthermore, for every {{math|''x''}} in the interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}},\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_a^x f(t)\\, dt = f(x).</math>\n\nThis realization, made by both [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], who based their results on earlier work by [[Isaac Barrow]], was key to the proliferation of analytic results after their work became known. The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic method of computing many definite integrals\u2014without performing limit processes\u2014by finding formulas for [[antiderivative]]s. It is also a prototype solution of a [[differential equation]]. Differential equations relate an unknown function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|right|The [[logarithmic spiral]] of the [[Nautilus|Nautilus shell]] is a classical image used to depict the growth and change related to calculus.]]\nCalculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, [[actuarial science]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[business]], [[medicine]], [[demography]], and in other fields wherever a problem can be [[mathematical model|mathematically modeled]] and an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the other.\n\n[[Physics]] makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]] are related through calculus. The [[mass]] of an object of known [[density]], the [[moment of inertia]] of objects, as well as the total energy of an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus. An example of the use of calculus in mechanics is [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]]: historically stated it expressly uses the term \"change of motion\" which implies the derivative saying ''The'' '''change''' ''of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.'' Commonly expressed today as Force&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mass&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;acceleration, it implies differential calculus because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity or second time derivative of trajectory or spatial position. Starting from knowing how an object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.\n\nMaxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] are also expressed in the language of differential calculus. Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and radioactive decay. In biology, population dynamics starts with reproduction and death rates to model population changes.\n\nCalculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines. For example, it can be used with [[linear algebra]] to find the \"best fit\" linear approximation for a set of points in a domain. Or it can be used in [[probability theory]] to determine the probability of a continuous random variable from an assumed density function. In [[analytic geometry]], the study of graphs of functions, calculus is used to find high points and low points (maxima and minima), slope, [[Concave function|concavity]] and [[inflection points]].\n\n[[Green's Theorem]], which gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a [[planimeter]], which is used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing. For example, it can be used to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.\n\n[[Discrete Green's Theorem]], which gives the relationship between a double integral of a function around a simple closed rectangular curve ''C'' and a linear combination of the antiderivative's values at corner points along the edge of the curve, allows fast calculation of sums of values in rectangular domains.  For example, it can be used to efficiently calculate sums of rectangular domains in images, in order to rapidly extract features and detect object; another algorithm that could be used is the [[summed area table]].\n\nIn the realm of medicine, calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow. From the decay laws for a particular drug's elimination from the body, it is used to derive dosing laws. In nuclear medicine, it is used to build models of radiation transport in targeted tumor therapies.\n\nIn economics, calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily calculate both [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal revenue]].\n\nCalculus is also used to find approximate solutions to equations; in practice it is the standard way to solve differential equations and do root finding in most applications. Examples are methods such as [[Newton's method]], [[fixed point iteration]], and [[linear approximation]]. For instance, spacecraft use a variation of the [[Euler method]] to approximate curved courses within zero gravity environments.\n\n==Varieties==\nOver the years, many reformulations of calculus have been investigated for different purposes.\n\n=== Non-standard calculus ===\n{{Main|Non-standard calculus}}\nImprecise calculations with infinitesimals were widely replaced with the rigorous [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]] starting in the 1870s. Meanwhile, calculations with infinitesimals persisted and often led to correct results. This led [[Abraham Robinson]] to investigate if it were possible to develop a number system with infinitesimal quantities over which the theorems of calculus were still valid. In 1960, building upon the work of [[Edwin Hewitt]] and [[Jerzy \u0141o\u015b]], he succeeded in developing [[non-standard analysis]]. The theory of non-standard analysis is rich enough to be applied in many branches of mathematics.  As such, books and articles dedicated solely to the traditional theorems of calculus often go by the title [[non-standard calculus]].\n\n=== Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===\n{{Main|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}\nThis is another reformulation of the calculus in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s. Based on the ideas of [[F. W. Lawvere]] and employing the methods of [[category theory]], it views all functions as being [[continuous function|continuous]] and incapable of being expressed in terms of [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities.  One aspect of this formulation is that the [[law of excluded middle]] does not hold in this formulation.\n\n=== Constructive analysis ===\n{{Main|Constructive analysis}}\n\n[[Constructive mathematics]] is a branch of mathematics that insists that proofs of the existence of a number, function, or other mathematical object should give a construction of the object. As such constructive mathematics also rejects the [[law of excluded middle]]. Reformulations of calculus in a constructive framework are generally part of the subject of [[constructive analysis]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Main|Outline of calculus}}\n\n=== Lists ===\n* [[Glossary of calculus]]\n* [[List of calculus topics]]\n* [[List of derivatives and integrals in alternative calculi]]\n* [[List of differentiation identities]]\n* [[List of publications in mathematics#Calculus|Publications in calculus]]\n* [[Table of integrals]]\n\n=== Other related topics ===\n* [[Calculus of finite differences]]\n* [[Calculus with polynomials]]\n* [[Complex analysis]]\n* [[Differential equation]]\n* [[Differential geometry and topology|Differential geometry]]\n* ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''\n* [[Discrete calculus]]\n* [[Fourier series]]\n* [[Integral equation]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multivariable calculus]]\n* [[Non-classical analysis]]\n* [[Non-standard analysis]]\n* [[Non-standard calculus]]\n* [[Precalculus]] ([[Mathematics education|mathematical education]])\n* [[Product integral]]\n* [[Stochastic calculus]]\n* [[Taylor series]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n=== Books ===\n<!-- Please use APA style; it's a lot easier for it to stay universally readable. -->\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* [[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Boyer, Carl Benjamin]] (1949).

Due to the delay, ratings for the October 17 episode were lower than usual. The second hour aired as a separate episode in a special airing on October 23 on Fox in United States. In Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], due to the delay caused by the Championship Series, ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', which was scheduled to air at 10:00pm, aired at 8:00pm EST. in place of ''The X Factor'', while ''The X Factor'' aired in full from 9:00pm to 11:00pm EST.</ref>\n<ref name=\"ScheduleChange\">Due to the [[2012 World Series]], ''The X Factor'' was preempted on October 18, 24 and 25.

Many viewers took to the internet and called Fox to complain about the interruption. Cowell even took to his [[Twitter]] to comment that: \"It's what's known as a total f up.\" The show instead aired the following week in its entirety.\n\n====\"Rejected\" votes of Paige Thomas====\nDuring the fifth live show in November, many voters reported of having their votes \"rejected\" and their calls cut off when attempting to vote for Paige Thomas; Thomas was eliminated the following night. Fox and ''The X Factor'' affiliates have not confirmed or denied whether this had anything to do with Thomas' subsequent elimination the following night.\n\n====Don Philip audition====\nIn the season two premiere, Don Philip, who once collaborated with Britney Spears, auditioned in front of the judges, and received a \"no\" from all judges. He then told ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' that ten minutes of footage from the interview was cut as he says he felt bullied into revealing he was gay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclicker.today.com/_news/2012/09/14/13860430-x-factor-contestant-don-philip-i-was-bullied-into-revealing-that-im-gay|title='X Factor' contestant Don Philip: I was 'bullied' into revealing that I'm gay - The Clicker<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> Spears reportedly replied \"It is fine that you are gay,\" though that was edited out as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2012/09/13/x-factor-edits-don-philips-coming-out-gay-to-britney-spears-on-season-debut.htm|title=X Factor Edits Don Philip's Coming Out Gay To Britney Spears On Season Debut<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|access-date=May 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512194237/http://top40.about.com/b/2012/09/13/x-factor-edits-don-philips-coming-out-gay-to-britney-spears-on-season-debut.htm|archive-date=May 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Those at Fox then released a statement saying \"The judges were not given any information at all about Mr Philip prior to his audition.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/britney-spears-former-duet-parter-don-philip-set-up-x-factor/|title=Britney Spears\u2019 Former Duet Parter Don Philip Says He Was \u2018Set Up\u2019 on \u2018X Factor\u2019|website=PopCrush}}</ref> Later that year, an insider revealed that he was contacted specifically by producers because of his association with Britney Spears, and that according to him \"she already knew he was going to be there, of course, because this is a reality show\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1764-i-was-reality-tv-judge-5-secrets-i-shouldnt-tell-you.html|title=I Was A Reality TV Judge: 5 Secrets I Shouldn't Tell You|last=Maxwell|first=Goldcrest|date=18 August 2015|website=Cracked|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121103234504/http://www.thexfactorusa.com/ Official website]\n\n{{The X Factor U.S.}}\n{{The X Factor (U.S.) contestants}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Factor (American season 2)}}\n[[Category:The X Factor (American TV series)|Season 2]]\n[[Category:2012 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:The X Factor seasons|United States 02]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use American English|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox reality music competition\n|series        = The X Factor (American TV series){{!}}The X Factor\n|season        = 2\n|first_aired   = September 12, 2012\n|last_aired    = December 20, 2012\n|host          = [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]]<br>[[Mario Lopez]]\n|cohost        =\n|judges        = [[Simon Cowell]]<br>[[Demi Lovato]]<br>[[Britney Spears]]<br>[[L.A.

Due to the delay, ratings for the October 17 episode were lower than usual. The second hour aired as a separate episode in a special airing on October 23 on Fox in United States. In Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], due to the delay caused by the Championship Series, ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', which was scheduled to air at 10:00pm, aired at 8:00pm EST. in place of ''The X Factor'', while ''The X Factor'' aired in full from 9:00pm to 11:00pm EST.</ref>\n<ref name=\"ScheduleChange\">Due to the [[2012 World Series]], ''The X Factor'' was preempted on October 18, 24 and 25. It returned on October 31. The first live show was originally scheduled to air on November 1, while the first results show was originally scheduled as a special airing on Sunday November 4.</ref>}}\n\n===Controversy===\n====Broadcast interruption of judges' houses====\nDuring the airing of the judges' houses episode on October 17, the show was stopped abruptly in the middle of Lovato's selection for the top 16 and cut immediately to a game of the [[National League Championship Series]]. This was due to the fact that the game was halted and rescheduled later in the day due to a rain delay, to be played concurrently with ''The X Factor''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=768238|title=NLCS Championship Series delays X Factor Top 16 reveal|work=[[MSN]]|date=October 7, 2012|accessdate=December 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607133744/http://tv.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=768238|archive-date=June 7, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Between the two, Fox decided to air the game instead of the rest of the episode. Many viewers took to the internet and called Fox to complain about the interruption.

Due to the primitive and decidedly uncommercial nature of these pieces, Wilder and the record label decided to release the album inconspicuously, naming it ''[[1 + 2 (album)|1 + 2]]''. It eventually came out in mid-1986, not long after the release of Depeche Mode's well-received ''[[Black Celebration]]''.\n\nIn January 1988, during the middle of Depeche Mode's hugely successful \"Tour for the Masses\", Mute released the second Recoil album \u2014 ''[[Hydrology (album)|Hydrology]]''. This followed in a similar vein to the previous Recoil record, consisting of entirely instrumental, synthesized landscapes. Unfortunately, due to Wilder's busy touring schedule, he was unable to effectively promote the record.\n\nRecoil's first single was from his third album ''[[Bloodline (Recoil album)|Bloodline]]'', a cover of the [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Sensational Alex Harvey Band]]'s \"Faith Healer\", with Douglas McCarthy from [[Nitzer Ebb]] on vocals.  McCarthy would later reappear for two songs on the next album, ''[[Unsound Methods]]'', including the single \"Stalker\".  1997's ''Unsound Methods'' was the first release after Wilder's decision to leave Depeche Mode.  The fifth album, ''[[Liquid (Recoil album)|Liquid]]'' was released in 2000.\n\n===Continuing artwork===\nThe cover of ''1 + 2'' features \"1+2\" in transparent [[UV coating|varnish]], covering the front and back of the [[LP record|LP]] sleeve.

Officials have had trouble obtaining medical equipment, but did successfully order some ventilators and ICU beds.[16] Muslim clerics have worked to dispel myths about the virus.[17]\n\nOn 15 March, the government banned passengers who had been to China, Iran, Italy, or South Korea in the past 14 days from entering Somalia.
