The term has been most commonly applied to the large-scale taking of people indigenous to the numerous islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. These blackbirded people were called [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanakas]] or [[South Sea Islanders]]. The owners, captains and crew of the ships involved in the acquisition of these labourers were termed blackbirders. The demand for this kind of cheap labour principally came from European colonists in [[New South Wales]], [[Peru]], [[Queensland]], [[Samoa]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], [[Tahiti]], [[Hawaii]], [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. Labouring on sugarcane, cotton and coffee plantations in these lands was the main usage of blackbirded labour, but they were also exploited in other industries.\n\nBlackbirding ships began operations in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] from the 1840s and continued into the 1930s. In the 1860s, Peruvian blackbirders sought workers at their [[haciendas]] and to mine the [[guano]] deposits on the [[Chincha Islands]].<ref name=\"Maude1981\">{{cite book |last1=Maude |first1=H.E. |title=Slavers in Paradise |date=1981 |publisher=ANU Press |url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/114682}}</ref> From the late 1860s, the blackbirding trade focused on supplying labourers to [[plantations]], particularly those producing [[sugar-cane]] in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"Willoughby\">{{cite web|url= http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |last= Willoughby |first= Emma |title= Our Federation Journey 1901\u20132001 |publisher= Museum Victoria |accessdate= 14 June 2006 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060625205722/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |archivedate= 25 June 2006 |df= dmy }}</ref><ref>Reid Mortensen, (2009), [http://www.paclii.org/journals/fJSPL/vol04/7.shtml \"Slaving In Australian Courts: Blackbirding Cases, 1869\u20131871\"], ''Journal of South Pacific Law'', 13:1, accessed 7 October 2010</ref>\n\nExamples of blackbirding outside the South Pacific include the early days of the [[Pearling in Western Australia|pearling industry in Western Australia]] at [[Nickol Bay]] and [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], where [[Aboriginal Australians]] were blackbirded from the surrounding areas.<ref name=\"col18\">{{cite news |title=Reconciling the dark history of slavery and murder in Australian pearling, points to a brighter future |first=Ben |last=Collins |date=2018-09-09 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |website=ABC News |url=https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-09/slavery-in-australian-pearling/10217488 |access-date=2020-03-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe practice of blackbirding has continued to the present day.

Therefore, the 1868 legislation on the trade in the form of the Polynesian Labourers Act that was brought in due to the ''Syren'' debacle, requiring every ship to be licensed and carry a government agent to observe the recruitment process, was poor in protections and even more poorly enforced.<ref name=\"Docker\" />  Government agents were often corrupted by bonuses paid for labourers 'recruited,' or blinded by alcohol, and did little or nothing to prevent sea-captains from tricking islanders on-board or otherwise engaging in kidnapping with violence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Act also stipulated that the Kanakas were to be contracted for no more than 3 years and be paid \u00a318 for their work. This was an extremely low wage that was only paid at the end of their three years of work.

In 1869, The [[HMS Rosario (1860)|''Rosario'']] under Captain George Palmer managed to intercept a blackbirding ship loaded with Islanders at [[Fiji]]. This ship, the ''Daphne'' under command of Captain Daggett and licensed in [[Queensland]] to Henry Ross Lewin, was described by Palmer as being fitted out \"like an African slaver\". Even though there was a government agent on board, the Islanders recruited appeared in poor condition and, having no understanding of English and no interpreter, had little idea of why they were being transported. Palmer seized the ship, freed the Kanakas and arrested both Captain Daggett and the ship's owner Thomas Pritchard for slavery. Daggett and Pritchard were taken to [[Sydney]] to be tried but all charges were quickly dismissed and the prisoners discharged. Furthermore, Sir [[Alfred Stephen]], the Chief Justice of the [[New South Wales Supreme Court]] found that Captain Palmer had illegally seized the ''Daphne'' and ordered him to pay reparations to Daggett and Pritchard. No evidence or statements were taken from the Islanders.

The payment was half of that offered in [[Queensland]] and like that colony was only given at the end of the three-year term usually in the form of poor quality goods rather than cash. Most Melanesians were recruited by combination of deceit and violence, and then locked up in the ship's hold to prevent escape.

The planters were allowed to inflict punishment and restrain the Islanders as they saw fit and young girls were openly bartered for and sold into [[sexual slavery]]. Many workers were not paid and those who survived and were able to return to their home islands were regarded as lucky.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63229330 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6556 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 April 1873 |accessdate=31 August 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===After annexation (1875 to 1911)===\nThe British annexed Fiji in October 1874 and the labour trade in Pacific Islanders continued as before.

Beginning in 1879 with the arrival of the vessel [[Leonidas (ship)|''Leonidas'']], the transport of [[Indian indenture system|Indian indentured labourers]] to Fiji commenced. However, this [[coolie]] labour was more expensive and the market for blackbirded Islander workers remained strong for much of the 1880s. In 1882, the search for new sources of Islander labour expanded firstly to the [[Line Islands]] and then to [[New Britain]] and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]]. The very high death rate of Line Islanders taken for the Fiji market quickly forced the prohibition of taking people from there. Although the death rates of recruits from New Britain and New Ireland were also high, the trade in humans from these islands was allowed to continue. The [[CSR Limited|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] made major investments in the Fijian sugar industry around this time with much of the labour being provided by workers from [[New Britain]]. Many of the recruits taken from this island on the labour vessel ''Lord of Isles'' were put to work on the CSR sugar mill at [[Nausori]]. The Fijian labour report for the years 1878 to 1882 revealed that 18 vessels were engaged in the trade, recruiting 7,137 Islanders with 1270 or nearly 20% of these dying while in Fiji.

Initially Stewart used imported Chinese [[coolie]] labour but soon shifted to blackbirded Polynesian labour to work the plantation. [[Bully Hayes]], an [[United States of America|American]] ship-captain who achieved notoriety for his activities in the Pacific from the 1850s to the 1870s, arrived in [[Papeete]], [[Tahiti]] in December 1868 on his ship ''Rona'' with 150 men from [[Niue]]. Hayes offered them for sale as [[indentured labourers]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\nJames A. Michener & A.

These people were unloaded in a \"half-naked and wholly starved\" condition and on arrival at the plantation they were treated as slaves. Captain Blackett of the vessel ''Moaroa'', was also chartered by Stewart to acquire labourers. In 1869, Blackett bought 150 [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert Islanders]] from another blackbirding ship for \u20a45 per head. On transferring them to the ''Moaroa'', the islanders, including another 150 already imprisoned on the vessel, rebelled killing Blackett and some of the crew. The remaining crew managed to isolate the islanders to a part of the ship and then used explosives to blow them up. Close to 200 people were killed in this incident with the ''Moaroa'' still able to offload about 60 surviving labourers at Tahiti.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramsden |first1=Eric |title=William Stewart and the introduction of Chinese labour in Tahiti |journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society |date=1946 |volume=55 |issue=3 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_55_1946/Volume_55%2C_No._3/William_Stewart_and_the_introduction_of_Chinese_labour_in_Tahiti%2C_1864-74%2C_by_Eric_Ramsden%2C_p_187-214/p1 |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107131264 |title=TRAGEDY IN THE SOUTH SEAS |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]] |issue=787 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=8 February 1870 |accessdate=2 July 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nConditions at the Atimaono plantation were appalling with long hours, heavy labour, poor food and inadequate shelter being provided.

This expansion resulted in local labour shortages for the European plantation owners and managers in these areas. William Forsyth, an Englishman with expert knowledge on tropical plantations, promoted a scheme of recruiting people from the [[Gilbert Islands]] to counteract the shortage of workers in Mexico and Guatemala. In 1890, Captain Luttrell of the vessel ''Helen W. Almy'' was chartered and sent out to the Pacific where he recruited 300 Gilbert Islanders. They were offloaded in Mexico and sent to work at a coffee plantation near [[Tapachula]] owned by an American named John Magee. By 1894, despite supposedly having a three-year contract, none had been returned home and only 58 were still living.<ref name=\"McCreery\">{{cite journal |last1=McCreery |first1=David |title=The cargo of the Montserrat: Gilbertese labour in Guatemalan coffee |journal=The Americas |date=1993 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=271\u2013295 |jstor=1007028 |doi=10.2307/1007028 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1891, the barque ''Tahiti'' under command of Captain Ferguson was assigned to bring another load of Gilbert Islanders to Tapachula. This ship acquired around 370 islanders including about 100 children. While bringing its human cargo to the Americas, the ''Tahiti'' suffered storm damage and was forced to anchor in [[Drakes Bay]] north of [[San Francisco]]. Amid accusations of slavery and blackbirding, Ferguson transferred command of the ship to another officer and abandoned the islanders in what amounted to a floating prison. Repairs were delayed for months and in early 1892, the ''Tahiti'' was found capsized with all but a few survivors drowned to death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kroeger |first1=Brooke |title=Undercover Reporting |date=2012 |publisher=Northwestern University Press |pages=35\u201338 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ys61DGpIc9EC|isbn=9780810163515 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article236055803 |title=THE LOSS OF THE TAHITI. |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |issue=3910 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=7 January 1892 |accessdate=3 July 2019 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nDespite this tragedy another ship, the ''Montserrat'', was fitted out to contract more Gilbert Islanders, this time for coffee plantations in [[Guatemala]]. Ferguson was again employed, but this time as recruiter not as captain.

Only 250 survived, most of these being returned to their homeland in two voyages in 1896 and 1908. This represented a mortality rate of 80%.<ref name=\"McCreery\" />\n\n== New Caledonia ==\nBlackbirding and recruitment of [[South Sea Islanders]] as labourers to the French colony of [[New Caledonia]] began in 1865 and lasted until the 1930s. Around 15,000 people were transported during this period, the vast majority coming from the [[New Hebrides]]. In 1865 the French colonial government contracted [[sandalwood]] merchant Andrew Henry to bring 33 people from [[Erromango]]. Henry had previously been involved in sending labourers to [[Queensland]] for the cotton plantations of [[Robert Towns]]. Another recruiter, John Higginson, entered the trade in 1868, and by 1870, around 720 Islanders had been brought to labour in New Caledonia. A mining boom in 1873 saw a large increase in labour demand and many more ships became involved in the blackbirding trade with 900 Islanders being recruited in 1874 alone. Apart from some early government controls in the 1860s, the recruitment of Islanders was highly unregulated and open to abuse. Children as young as six years old could be legally recruited on lengthy contracts of up to twelve years. These children could also be legally paid at only half the rate of adults and given only half the required rations. Somewhere between a quarter and half of all the Islanders transported and forced to labour at New Caledonia were children.<ref name=\"Shineberg\">{{cite book |last1=Shineberg |first1=Dorothy |title=The People Trade |date=1999 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu}}</ref>\n\nThe blackbirded labourers in New Caledonia worked in the plantation, mining, pastoral, domestic servant and sailing industries. Approximately 33% of these workers died while in New Caledonia and around half of those who survived did not receive any payment for their toil. They were often not returned to their islands of origin and of those who were, about a third died in the first year of returning from poor health acquired from working in terrible conditions at New Caledonia. The labourers were subjected to inadequate food, poor shelter and harsh punishments whilst in New Caledonia. They could be imprisoned for not working to their employer's satisfaction, where the colonial government exploited them further as unpaid prison labour. They were also sold-on and transferred to other colonists upon the death or bankruptcy of their original employer. Well-known blackbirding vessels involved in the labour trade to New Caledonia were ''Aoba'', ''Annette'', ''Venus'', ''Aurora'', ''Ika Vuka'', ''Idaho'', ''Ambroua'' and the ''Effie Meikle''. Captains and recruiters notorious for kidnap and blackbirding for the New Caledonia market included James Toutant Proctor, \"Black Tom\", Jean-Louis Villedieu, Martial Briault, Charles Peterson Stuart, Walter Champion, Gabriel Madezo and Captain H. McKenzie. The company Joubert & Carter run by Didier Numa Joubert and Douglas Carter owned many of the blackbirding vessels in the early years of trade. Recruiting to New Caledonia continued well into the 20th Century but at a much lower rate and less violent manner. It was only brought to an end in the 1930s with the approach of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Shineberg\" />\n\n== Peru ==\n[[File:Map OC-Polynesia.PNG|thumb|Geographic definition of Polynesia, surrounded by a pink line]]\n\nFor several months between 1862\u201363, crews on Peruvian and Chilean ships combed the islands of [[Polynesia]], from [[Easter Island]] in the eastern Pacific to the Gilbert Islands (now [[Kiribati]]) in the west, seeking workers to fill an extreme labour shortage in Peru. Joseph Charles Byrne, an Irish speculator, received financial backing to import [[South Sea Islanders]] as [[indentured]] workers. Byrne's ship, ''Adelante'', set forth across the Pacific and at [[Tongareva atoll|Tongareva]] in the northern [[Cook Islands]] he was able to acquire 253 recruits of which more than half were women and children. The ''Adelante'' returned to the Peruvian port of [[Callao]] where the human cargo were sold off and sent to work as plantation labourers and [[domestic worker|domestic servants]]. A considerable profit was made by the scheme's financiers and almost immediately other speculators and ship owners set out to make money on Polynesian labour.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n=== Easter Island mass-kidnapping ===\nEight Peruvian ships organised under Captain Marutani of the ''Rosa y Carmen'' conducted an armed operation at [[Easter Island]] where, over several days, the combined crews systematically surrounded villages and captured as many of the Islanders as possible. In these raids and others like them that occurred at Easter Island during this period, 1407 people were taken for the Peruvian labour trade. This represented a third of the island's population. In the following months, the ''Rosa y Carmen'' together with about 30 other vessels involved in recruiting for Peru, kidnapped or deceptively obtained people throughout Polynesia. Captain Marutani's vessel alone took people from [[Niue]], [[Samoa]] and [[Tokelau]], as well as those that he kidnapped from Easter Island.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n=== 'Ata mass-kidnapping ===\nIn June 1863 about 350 people were living on [['Ata]], an atoll in [[Tonga]]. Captain Thomas James McGrath of the Tasmanian whaler ''Grecian'', having decided that the new [[slave trade]] was more profitable than whaling, went to the atoll and invited the islanders on board for trading. However, once almost half of the population was on board, he ordered the ship's compartments locked, and the ship departed. These 144 people never returned to their homes. The ''Grecian'' met with a Peruvian slave vessel, the ''General Prim'', and the islanders were transferred to this ship which transported them to [[Callao]]. Due to new government regulations in Peru against the blackbirding trade, the islanders were not allowed to disembark and remained aboard for many weeks while their repatriation was organised. Finally on 2 October 1863, by which time many of the imprisoned [['Ata]] people had died or were dying from neglect and disease, a vessel was organised to take them back. However, this ship dumped the Tongans on uninhabited [[Cocos Island]]. A month later the Peruvian warship ''Tumbes'' went to rescue the remaining 38 survivors and took them to the Peruvian port of [[Paita]], where they probably died.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n=== Deception at Tuvalu ===\nThe Rev. A. W. Murray, the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu,<ref>Murray A.W., 1876. ''Forty Years' Mission Work''. London: Nisbet</ref> described the practices of blackbirders in the [[Tuvalu|Ellice Islands]]. He said they promised islanders that they would be taught about God while working in coconut oil production, but the slavers' intended destination was the [[Chincha Islands]] in Peru. Rev. Murray reported that in 1863, about 180 people<ref>the figure of 171 taken from Funafuti is given by Laumua Kofe, Palagi and Pastors, ''Tuvalu: A History'', Ch. 15, Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific and Government of Tuvalu, 1983</ref> were taken from [[Funafuti]] and about 200 were taken from [[Nukulaelae]],<ref>the figure of 250 taken from Nukulaelae is given by Laumua Kofe, Palagi and Pastors, ''Tuvalu: A History'', Ch. 15, U.S.P./Tuvalu (1983)</ref> leaving fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.<ref>W.F.

In this period an estimated 3,634 Polynesians were recruited. Over 2,000 died from disease, starvation or neglect either aboard the blackbirding ships or at the places of labour they were sent to. The Peruvian government shut down the operation in 1863 and ordered the repatriation of those who survived. A [[smallpox]] and [[dysentery]] outbreak in [[Peru]] accompanied this operation resulting in the death of a further 1,030 Polynesian labourers. Some of the islanders survived long enough to bring these [[contagious disease]]s to their home islands causing local epidemics and additional mortality. By 1866, only around 250 of those recruited had survived with about 100 of these remaining in Peru. The death rate was therefore 93%.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n== Samoa ==\nIn the late 1850s, German merchant [[Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy]], established a trading company based at [[Apia]] on the island of [[Upolu]] in [[Samoa]]. His company, J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn, was able to obtain large tracts of land from the indigenous population at times of civil unrest by selling firearms and exacerbating factional conflict. By 1872, the company owned over 100,000 acres on Upolu and greatly expanded their cotton and other agricultural plantations on the island. Cheap labour was required to work these plantations and the blackbirding operations of the Germans expanded at this time. After initially utilising people from [[Niue]], the company sent labour vessels to the [[Gilbert Islands]] and the [[Nomoi Islands]], exploiting food shortages there to recruit numerous people for their plantations in Samoa. Men, women and children of all ages were taken, separated and sent to work in harsh conditions with many succumbing to illness and poor diet.<ref name=\"Samoa\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237132067 |title=THE GERMANS IN SAMOA. |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |issue=1819 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=8 May 1885 |accessdate=5 July 2019 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1880 the company became known as Deutsche Handels und Plantagen Gesellschaft (DHPG) and had further expanded their Samoan plantations.

On one occasion, the government agent aboard the vessel, Henry Freeman, bought a boatload of Gilbert Islanders from another blackbirding vessel named the ''Sea Waif''. By 1880 the labour trade to Hawaii expanded to the [[Vanuatu|New Hebrides]]. Captain Cadigan of the ''Pomare'' took people from these islands via night raids, armed attacks and firing canon at canoes. The death rates of the recruits on board the ''Pomare'' as they were transported to [[Hawaii]] were as high as 20%. Captain Tierney of the labour vessel ''Hazard'' was paid by the Planters' Labour and Supply Company of Hawaii $15 per recruit and consequently used much deception in obtaining a profitable quota of human cargo. Other ships involved were the ''Kaluna'', ''Elsinore'', ''Hawaii'', ''Nickolaus'', ''Mana'' and ''Allie Rowe''. The ''Allie Rowe'' undertook the last recruiting voyage to the Pacific Islands for the Hawaiian plantations in 1887. This vessel, commanded by Captain Phillips, proceeded illegally without a license and Phillips was also later charged and convicted of kidnap in relation to this final voyage.<ref name=\"Bennett\" />\n\nFrom 1868 until the year 1887 when the recruiting of Pacific Islanders to Hawaii was largely replaced with the more cost effective Japanese immigration scheme, some 2,600 Islanders were recruited. From 1880 to 1883 these people were protected by strong government measures which included an appointed Protector of Pacific Islanders, routine checks of worker conditions and the ability of the labourers to take employers to court for maltreatment. These workers, usually on 3 year contracts, were also paid cash wages at the end of each month which amounted from \u00a310 to \u00a316 per annum. In spite of these conditions during these years, the mortality rate of the workers was still over 10% for each year. Outside of these years, where protections were less, the death rate was much higher.<ref name=\"Bennett\" />\n\nWhen recruiting ended in 1887, 650 Pacific Islander workers remained or were left abandoned in Hawaii and by 1895 this number had reduced to less than 400.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61266918 |title=Japanese on the Sugar Plantations. |newspaper=[[Clarence And Richmond Examiner]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=12 January 1895 |accessdate=2 August 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> In 1904, 220 mostly Gilbert Islanders continued to live in poverty at [[Honolulu]] and at [[Maui]].

People of African and mixed ancestry commonly took part in these operations in order to make a living. Some worked under white employers, playing instrumental roles in deceiving fellow African-Americans and luring them into traps, while others pointed slave owners to the location of their escaped slaves to get the bounty on the slave's head. The kidnappers were recorded to have acted against their own family members in addition to other members of their community. Their careers also tended to be long, due to African-Americans, particularly children, being more inclined to trust them than white people. Successful kidnappings mainly relied on the blackbirders developing a connection to their target by using their shared racial and cultural identities. [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] were particularly prominent places for these kidnappers to work, causing fear of being kidnapped by anyone to become prevalent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Richard |title=Counterfeit Kin: Kidnappers of Color, the Reverse Underground Railroad, and the Origins of Practical Abolition |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&sid=da822a84-6674-44f6-a849-ea211241de0a%40sessionmgr4008 |website=EBSCOHost}}</ref>\n\n==Representation in popular culture==\nAmerican author [[Jack London]] recounted in his memoir, ''[[The Cruise of the Snark]]'' (1907), an incident at [[Langa Langa Lagoon]] [[Malaita]], [[Solomon Islands]], when the local islanders attacked a \"recruiting\" ship:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;still bore the tomahawk marks where the [[Malaita]]ns at Langa Langa several months before broke in for the trove of rifles and ammunition locked therein, after bloodily slaughtering Jansen's predecessor, Captain Mackenzie.

The term has been most commonly applied to the large-scale taking of people indigenous to the numerous islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. These blackbirded people were called [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanakas]] or [[South Sea Islanders]]. The owners, captains and crew of the ships involved in the acquisition of these labourers were termed blackbirders. The demand for this kind of cheap labour principally came from European colonists in [[New South Wales]], [[Peru]], [[Queensland]], [[Samoa]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], [[Tahiti]], [[Hawaii]], [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. Labouring on sugarcane, cotton and coffee plantations in these lands was the main usage of blackbirded labour, but they were also exploited in other industries.\n\nBlackbirding ships began operations in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] from the 1840s and continued into the 1930s. In the 1860s, Peruvian blackbirders sought workers at their [[haciendas]] and to mine the [[guano]] deposits on the [[Chincha Islands]].<ref name=\"Maude1981\">{{cite book |last1=Maude |first1=H.E. |title=Slavers in Paradise |date=1981 |publisher=ANU Press |url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/114682}}</ref> From the late 1860s, the blackbirding trade focused on supplying labourers to [[plantations]], particularly those producing [[sugar-cane]] in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"Willoughby\">{{cite web|url= http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |last= Willoughby |first= Emma |title= Our Federation Journey 1901\u20132001 |publisher= Museum Victoria |accessdate= 14 June 2006 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060625205722/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |archivedate= 25 June 2006 |df= dmy }}</ref><ref>Reid Mortensen, (2009), [http://www.paclii.org/journals/fJSPL/vol04/7.shtml \"Slaving In Australian Courts: Blackbirding Cases, 1869\u20131871\"], ''Journal of South Pacific Law'', 13:1, accessed 7 October 2010</ref>\n\nExamples of blackbirding outside the South Pacific include the early days of the [[Pearling in Western Australia|pearling industry in Western Australia]] at [[Nickol Bay]] and [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], where [[Aboriginal Australians]] were blackbirded from the surrounding areas.<ref name=\"col18\">{{cite news |title=Reconciling the dark history of slavery and murder in Australian pearling, points to a brighter future |first=Ben |last=Collins |date=2018-09-09 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |website=ABC News |url=https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-09/slavery-in-australian-pearling/10217488 |access-date=2020-03-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe practice of blackbirding has continued to the present day.

In 1869, The [[HMS Rosario (1860)|''Rosario'']] under Captain George Palmer managed to intercept a blackbirding ship loaded with Islanders at [[Fiji]]. This ship, the ''Daphne'' under command of Captain Daggett and licensed in [[Queensland]] to Henry Ross Lewin, was described by Palmer as being fitted out \"like an African slaver\". Even though there was a government agent on board, the Islanders recruited appeared in poor condition and, having no understanding of English and no interpreter, had little idea of why they were being transported. Palmer seized the ship, freed the Kanakas and arrested both Captain Daggett and the ship's owner Thomas Pritchard for slavery. Daggett and Pritchard were taken to [[Sydney]] to be tried but all charges were quickly dismissed and the prisoners discharged. Furthermore, Sir [[Alfred Stephen]], the Chief Justice of the [[New South Wales Supreme Court]] found that Captain Palmer had illegally seized the ''Daphne'' and ordered him to pay reparations to Daggett and Pritchard. No evidence or statements were taken from the Islanders. This decision, which overrode the obvious humanitarian actions of a senior officer of the [[Royal Navy]], gave further legitimacy to the blackbirding trade out of Queensland and allowed it to flourish.<ref name=\"Palmer\" />\n\n==== The Kanaka trade in the 1870s ====\n[[File:Kanakas early 1870s.png|thumb|left|Adolescent South Sea Islanders on a [[Herbert River]] plantation in the early 1870s]]\nRecruiting of [[South Sea Islanders]] soon became an established industry with labour vessels from across eastern Australia obtaining Kanakas for both the [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]] markets.

The payment was half of that offered in [[Queensland]] and like that colony was only given at the end of the three-year term usually in the form of poor quality goods rather than cash. Most Melanesians were recruited by combination of deceit and violence, and then locked up in the ship's hold to prevent escape.

The planters were allowed to inflict punishment and restrain the Islanders as they saw fit and young girls were openly bartered for and sold into [[sexual slavery]]. Many workers were not paid and those who survived and were able to return to their home islands were regarded as lucky.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63229330 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6556 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 April 1873 |accessdate=31 August 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===After annexation (1875 to 1911)===\nThe British annexed Fiji in October 1874 and the labour trade in Pacific Islanders continued as before.

Beginning in 1879 with the arrival of the vessel [[Leonidas (ship)|''Leonidas'']], the transport of [[Indian indenture system|Indian indentured labourers]] to Fiji commenced. However, this [[coolie]] labour was more expensive and the market for blackbirded Islander workers remained strong for much of the 1880s. In 1882, the search for new sources of Islander labour expanded firstly to the [[Line Islands]] and then to [[New Britain]] and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]]. The very high death rate of Line Islanders taken for the Fiji market quickly forced the prohibition of taking people from there. Although the death rates of recruits from New Britain and New Ireland were also high, the trade in humans from these islands was allowed to continue. The [[CSR Limited|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] made major investments in the Fijian sugar industry around this time with much of the labour being provided by workers from [[New Britain]]. Many of the recruits taken from this island on the labour vessel ''Lord of Isles'' were put to work on the CSR sugar mill at [[Nausori]]. The Fijian labour report for the years 1878 to 1882 revealed that 18 vessels were engaged in the trade, recruiting 7,137 Islanders with 1270 or nearly 20% of these dying while in Fiji.

Initially Stewart used imported Chinese [[coolie]] labour but soon shifted to blackbirded Polynesian labour to work the plantation. [[Bully Hayes]], an [[United States of America|American]] ship-captain who achieved notoriety for his activities in the Pacific from the 1850s to the 1870s, arrived in [[Papeete]], [[Tahiti]] in December 1868 on his ship ''Rona'' with 150 men from [[Niue]]. Hayes offered them for sale as [[indentured labourers]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\nJames A. Michener & A.

These people were unloaded in a \"half-naked and wholly starved\" condition and on arrival at the plantation they were treated as slaves. Captain Blackett of the vessel ''Moaroa'', was also chartered by Stewart to acquire labourers. In 1869, Blackett bought 150 [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert Islanders]] from another blackbirding ship for \u20a45 per head. On transferring them to the ''Moaroa'', the islanders, including another 150 already imprisoned on the vessel, rebelled killing Blackett and some of the crew. The remaining crew managed to isolate the islanders to a part of the ship and then used explosives to blow them up. Close to 200 people were killed in this incident with the ''Moaroa'' still able to offload about 60 surviving labourers at Tahiti.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramsden |first1=Eric |title=William Stewart and the introduction of Chinese labour in Tahiti |journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society |date=1946 |volume=55 |issue=3 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_55_1946/Volume_55%2C_No._3/William_Stewart_and_the_introduction_of_Chinese_labour_in_Tahiti%2C_1864-74%2C_by_Eric_Ramsden%2C_p_187-214/p1 |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107131264 |title=TRAGEDY IN THE SOUTH SEAS |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]] |issue=787 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=8 February 1870 |accessdate=2 July 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nConditions at the Atimaono plantation were appalling with long hours, heavy labour, poor food and inadequate shelter being provided.

This expansion resulted in local labour shortages for the European plantation owners and managers in these areas. William Forsyth, an Englishman with expert knowledge on tropical plantations, promoted a scheme of recruiting people from the [[Gilbert Islands]] to counteract the shortage of workers in Mexico and Guatemala. In 1890, Captain Luttrell of the vessel ''Helen W. Almy'' was chartered and sent out to the Pacific where he recruited 300 Gilbert Islanders. They were offloaded in Mexico and sent to work at a coffee plantation near [[Tapachula]] owned by an American named John Magee. By 1894, despite supposedly having a three-year contract, none had been returned home and only 58 were still living.<ref name=\"McCreery\">{{cite journal |last1=McCreery |first1=David |title=The cargo of the Montserrat: Gilbertese labour in Guatemalan coffee |journal=The Americas |date=1993 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=271\u2013295 |jstor=1007028 |doi=10.2307/1007028 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1891, the barque ''Tahiti'' under command of Captain Ferguson was assigned to bring another load of Gilbert Islanders to Tapachula. This ship acquired around 370 islanders including about 100 children. While bringing its human cargo to the Americas, the ''Tahiti'' suffered storm damage and was forced to anchor in [[Drakes Bay]] north of [[San Francisco]]. Amid accusations of slavery and blackbirding, Ferguson transferred command of the ship to another officer and abandoned the islanders in what amounted to a floating prison. Repairs were delayed for months and in early 1892, the ''Tahiti'' was found capsized with all but a few survivors drowned to death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kroeger |first1=Brooke |title=Undercover Reporting |date=2012 |publisher=Northwestern University Press |pages=35\u201338 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ys61DGpIc9EC|isbn=9780810163515 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article236055803 |title=THE LOSS OF THE TAHITI. |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |issue=3910 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=7 January 1892 |accessdate=3 July 2019 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nDespite this tragedy another ship, the ''Montserrat'', was fitted out to contract more Gilbert Islanders, this time for coffee plantations in [[Guatemala]]. Ferguson was again employed, but this time as recruiter not as captain.

Only 250 survived, most of these being returned to their homeland in two voyages in 1896 and 1908. This represented a mortality rate of 80%.<ref name=\"McCreery\" />\n\n== New Caledonia ==\nBlackbirding and recruitment of [[South Sea Islanders]] as labourers to the French colony of [[New Caledonia]] began in 1865 and lasted until the 1930s. Around 15,000 people were transported during this period, the vast majority coming from the [[New Hebrides]]. In 1865 the French colonial government contracted [[sandalwood]] merchant Andrew Henry to bring 33 people from [[Erromango]]. Henry had previously been involved in sending labourers to [[Queensland]] for the cotton plantations of [[Robert Towns]]. Another recruiter, John Higginson, entered the trade in 1868, and by 1870, around 720 Islanders had been brought to labour in New Caledonia. A mining boom in 1873 saw a large increase in labour demand and many more ships became involved in the blackbirding trade with 900 Islanders being recruited in 1874 alone. Apart from some early government controls in the 1860s, the recruitment of Islanders was highly unregulated and open to abuse. Children as young as six years old could be legally recruited on lengthy contracts of up to twelve years. These children could also be legally paid at only half the rate of adults and given only half the required rations. Somewhere between a quarter and half of all the Islanders transported and forced to labour at New Caledonia were children.<ref name=\"Shineberg\">{{cite book |last1=Shineberg |first1=Dorothy |title=The People Trade |date=1999 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu}}</ref>\n\nThe blackbirded labourers in New Caledonia worked in the plantation, mining, pastoral, domestic servant and sailing industries. Approximately 33% of these workers died while in New Caledonia and around half of those who survived did not receive any payment for their toil. They were often not returned to their islands of origin and of those who were, about a third died in the first year of returning from poor health acquired from working in terrible conditions at New Caledonia. The labourers were subjected to inadequate food, poor shelter and harsh punishments whilst in New Caledonia. They could be imprisoned for not working to their employer's satisfaction, where the colonial government exploited them further as unpaid prison labour. They were also sold-on and transferred to other colonists upon the death or bankruptcy of their original employer. Well-known blackbirding vessels involved in the labour trade to New Caledonia were ''Aoba'', ''Annette'', ''Venus'', ''Aurora'', ''Ika Vuka'', ''Idaho'', ''Ambroua'' and the ''Effie Meikle''. Captains and recruiters notorious for kidnap and blackbirding for the New Caledonia market included James Toutant Proctor, \"Black Tom\", Jean-Louis Villedieu, Martial Briault, Charles Peterson Stuart, Walter Champion, Gabriel Madezo and Captain H. McKenzie. The company Joubert & Carter run by Didier Numa Joubert and Douglas Carter owned many of the blackbirding vessels in the early years of trade. Recruiting to New Caledonia continued well into the 20th Century but at a much lower rate and less violent manner. It was only brought to an end in the 1930s with the approach of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Shineberg\" />\n\n== Peru ==\n[[File:Map OC-Polynesia.PNG|thumb|Geographic definition of Polynesia, surrounded by a pink line]]\n\nFor several months between 1862\u201363, crews on Peruvian and Chilean ships combed the islands of [[Polynesia]], from [[Easter Island]] in the eastern Pacific to the Gilbert Islands (now [[Kiribati]]) in the west, seeking workers to fill an extreme labour shortage in Peru. Joseph Charles Byrne, an Irish speculator, received financial backing to import [[South Sea Islanders]] as [[indentured]] workers. Byrne's ship, ''Adelante'', set forth across the Pacific and at [[Tongareva atoll|Tongareva]] in the northern [[Cook Islands]] he was able to acquire 253 recruits of which more than half were women and children. The ''Adelante'' returned to the Peruvian port of [[Callao]] where the human cargo were sold off and sent to work as plantation labourers and [[domestic worker|domestic servants]]. A considerable profit was made by the scheme's financiers and almost immediately other speculators and ship owners set out to make money on Polynesian labour.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n=== Easter Island mass-kidnapping ===\nEight Peruvian ships organised under Captain Marutani of the ''Rosa y Carmen'' conducted an armed operation at [[Easter Island]] where, over several days, the combined crews systematically surrounded villages and captured as many of the Islanders as possible. In these raids and others like them that occurred at Easter Island during this period, 1407 people were taken for the Peruvian labour trade. This represented a third of the island's population. In the following months, the ''Rosa y Carmen'' together with about 30 other vessels involved in recruiting for Peru, kidnapped or deceptively obtained people throughout Polynesia. Captain Marutani's vessel alone took people from [[Niue]], [[Samoa]] and [[Tokelau]], as well as those that he kidnapped from Easter Island.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n=== 'Ata mass-kidnapping ===\nIn June 1863 about 350 people were living on [['Ata]], an atoll in [[Tonga]]. Captain Thomas James McGrath of the Tasmanian whaler ''Grecian'', having decided that the new [[slave trade]] was more profitable than whaling, went to the atoll and invited the islanders on board for trading. However, once almost half of the population was on board, he ordered the ship's compartments locked, and the ship departed. These 144 people never returned to their homes. The ''Grecian'' met with a Peruvian slave vessel, the ''General Prim'', and the islanders were transferred to this ship which transported them to [[Callao]]. Due to new government regulations in Peru against the blackbirding trade, the islanders were not allowed to disembark and remained aboard for many weeks while their repatriation was organised. Finally on 2 October 1863, by which time many of the imprisoned [['Ata]] people had died or were dying from neglect and disease, a vessel was organised to take them back. However, this ship dumped the Tongans on uninhabited [[Cocos Island]]. A month later the Peruvian warship ''Tumbes'' went to rescue the remaining 38 survivors and took them to the Peruvian port of [[Paita]], where they probably died.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n=== Deception at Tuvalu ===\nThe Rev. A. W. Murray, the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu,<ref>Murray A.W., 1876. ''Forty Years' Mission Work''. London: Nisbet</ref> described the practices of blackbirders in the [[Tuvalu|Ellice Islands]]. He said they promised islanders that they would be taught about God while working in coconut oil production, but the slavers' intended destination was the [[Chincha Islands]] in Peru. Rev. Murray reported that in 1863, about 180 people<ref>the figure of 171 taken from Funafuti is given by Laumua Kofe, Palagi and Pastors, ''Tuvalu: A History'', Ch. 15, Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific and Government of Tuvalu, 1983</ref> were taken from [[Funafuti]] and about 200 were taken from [[Nukulaelae]],<ref>the figure of 250 taken from Nukulaelae is given by Laumua Kofe, Palagi and Pastors, ''Tuvalu: A History'', Ch. 15, U.S.P./Tuvalu (1983)</ref> leaving fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.<ref>W.F.

In this period an estimated 3,634 Polynesians were recruited. Over 2,000 died from disease, starvation or neglect either aboard the blackbirding ships or at the places of labour they were sent to. The Peruvian government shut down the operation in 1863 and ordered the repatriation of those who survived. A [[smallpox]] and [[dysentery]] outbreak in [[Peru]] accompanied this operation resulting in the death of a further 1,030 Polynesian labourers. Some of the islanders survived long enough to bring these [[contagious disease]]s to their home islands causing local epidemics and additional mortality. By 1866, only around 250 of those recruited had survived with about 100 of these remaining in Peru. The death rate was therefore 93%.<ref name=\"Maude1981\"/>\n\n== Samoa ==\nIn the late 1850s, German merchant [[Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy]], established a trading company based at [[Apia]] on the island of [[Upolu]] in [[Samoa]]. His company, J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn, was able to obtain large tracts of land from the indigenous population at times of civil unrest by selling firearms and exacerbating factional conflict. By 1872, the company owned over 100,000 acres on Upolu and greatly expanded their cotton and other agricultural plantations on the island. Cheap labour was required to work these plantations and the blackbirding operations of the Germans expanded at this time. After initially utilising people from [[Niue]], the company sent labour vessels to the [[Gilbert Islands]] and the [[Nomoi Islands]], exploiting food shortages there to recruit numerous people for their plantations in Samoa. Men, women and children of all ages were taken, separated and sent to work in harsh conditions with many succumbing to illness and poor diet.<ref name=\"Samoa\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237132067 |title=THE GERMANS IN SAMOA. |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |issue=1819 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=8 May 1885 |accessdate=5 July 2019 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1880 the company became known as Deutsche Handels und Plantagen Gesellschaft (DHPG) and had further expanded their Samoan plantations.

Jackson called in at [[Pohnpei]] on the way to Hawaii where he chained up a local headman and shot another trying to attempt a rescue.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13425438 |title=CRUISE OF THE STORMBIRD. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |volume=LXXVIII |issue=12,530 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=17 July 1878 |accessdate=2 August 2019 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> During the voyage, Jackson had attempted to kidnap at gunpoint a number of young women from [[Maiana]] but was interrupted by the presence of another ship.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article143312248 |title=ALLEGED KIDNAPPING BY THE STORMBIRD. |newspaper=[[The Australasian]] |volume=XXIV |issue=637 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=15 June 1878 |accessdate=2 August 2019 |page=4 (THE AUSTRALASIAN SUPPLEMENT) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Stormbird'' made around another five recruiting voyages involving further violence and kidnapping, mostly sailing to the [[Gilbert Islands]]. On one occasion, the government agent aboard the vessel, Henry Freeman, bought a boatload of Gilbert Islanders from another blackbirding vessel named the ''Sea Waif''. By 1880 the labour trade to Hawaii expanded to the [[Vanuatu|New Hebrides]]. Captain Cadigan of the ''Pomare'' took people from these islands via night raids, armed attacks and firing canon at canoes. The death rates of the recruits on board the ''Pomare'' as they were transported to [[Hawaii]] were as high as 20%. Captain Tierney of the labour vessel ''Hazard'' was paid by the Planters' Labour and Supply Company of Hawaii $15 per recruit and consequently used much deception in obtaining a profitable quota of human cargo. Other ships involved were the ''Kaluna'', ''Elsinore'', ''Hawaii'', ''Nickolaus'', ''Mana'' and ''Allie Rowe''. The ''Allie Rowe'' undertook the last recruiting voyage to the Pacific Islands for the Hawaiian plantations in 1887. This vessel, commanded by Captain Phillips, proceeded illegally without a license and Phillips was also later charged and convicted of kidnap in relation to this final voyage.<ref name=\"Bennett\" />\n\nFrom 1868 until the year 1887 when the recruiting of Pacific Islanders to Hawaii was largely replaced with the more cost effective Japanese immigration scheme, some 2,600 Islanders were recruited. From 1880 to 1883 these people were protected by strong government measures which included an appointed Protector of Pacific Islanders, routine checks of worker conditions and the ability of the labourers to take employers to court for maltreatment. These workers, usually on 3 year contracts, were also paid cash wages at the end of each month which amounted from \u00a310 to \u00a316 per annum. In spite of these conditions during these years, the mortality rate of the workers was still over 10% for each year. Outside of these years, where protections were less, the death rate was much higher.<ref name=\"Bennett\" />\n\nWhen recruiting ended in 1887, 650 Pacific Islander workers remained or were left abandoned in Hawaii and by 1895 this number had reduced to less than 400.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article61266918 |title=Japanese on the Sugar Plantations. |newspaper=[[Clarence And Richmond Examiner]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=12 January 1895 |accessdate=2 August 2019 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> In 1904, 220 mostly Gilbert Islanders continued to live in poverty at [[Honolulu]] and at [[Maui]].

People of African and mixed ancestry commonly took part in these operations in order to make a living. Some worked under white employers, playing instrumental roles in deceiving fellow African-Americans and luring them into traps, while others pointed slave owners to the location of their escaped slaves to get the bounty on the slave's head. The kidnappers were recorded to have acted against their own family members in addition to other members of their community. Their careers also tended to be long, due to African-Americans, particularly children, being more inclined to trust them than white people. Successful kidnappings mainly relied on the blackbirders developing a connection to their target by using their shared racial and cultural identities. [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] were particularly prominent places for these kidnappers to work, causing fear of being kidnapped by anyone to become prevalent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Richard |title=Counterfeit Kin: Kidnappers of Color, the Reverse Underground Railroad, and the Origins of Practical Abolition |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&sid=da822a84-6674-44f6-a849-ea211241de0a%40sessionmgr4008 |website=EBSCOHost}}</ref>\n\n==Representation in popular culture==\nAmerican author [[Jack London]] recounted in his memoir, ''[[The Cruise of the Snark]]'' (1907), an incident at [[Langa Langa Lagoon]] [[Malaita]], [[Solomon Islands]], when the local islanders attacked a \"recruiting\" ship:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;still bore the tomahawk marks where the [[Malaita]]ns at Langa Langa several months before broke in for the trove of rifles and ammunition locked therein, after bloodily slaughtering Jansen's predecessor, Captain Mackenzie. The burning of the vessel was somehow prevented by the black crew, but this was so unprecedented that the owner feared some complicity between them and the attacking party. However, it could not be proved, and we sailed with the majority of this same crew. The present skipper smilingly warned us that the same tribe still required two more heads from the Minota, to square up for deaths on the Ysabel plantation.

First published in 1919, based on the real lives of three ''m\u00e9tis'' or \u201chalf-castes\u201d of the New Caledonian bush and on the oral histories of author Georges Baudoux's New Hebridean mining employees, themselves former Queensland Kanaka workers, the book describes a time when anglophone, francophone and Pacific peoples interacted, exchanged, and moved in and out of each other's lives perhaps more frequently than today. The major interest of this book for historians is its detailed account of all aspects of blackbirding in the Pacific, a history written on the basis of eye-witness accounts.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Coolie]]\n* [[Coolitude]]\n* [[Reverse Underground Railroad]], sometimes known as \"blackbirding\"\n* [[Roundup (history)]]\n* [[Shanghaiing]]\n\n== References ==\n<!--<nowiki>\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below. \n</nowiki>-->\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Affeldt, Stefanie.

[[Order of Ikhamanga|OIS]] (7 June 1953 \u2013 16 July 2019) was a South African musician and [[anthropologist]], some of whose work was in musicology focused on the music of indigenous South African

It peaked at No. 4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album was reissued by [[Mercury Records]] in June 2010 with additional content. A sequel album, titled ''[[Return to Ommadawn]]'', was released on 20 January 2017.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBy late 1974, Oldfield had become increasingly disappointed with the negative reaction towards his second album ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974). However, the situation sparked a creative period in his effort to deliver a follow-up that was \"worthwhile and successful\" that proved he was not a mere [[one-hit wonder]] following the unexpected commercial and critical success of his first, ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973).<ref name=2010CD>{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Mike-Oldfield-Ommadawn/release/12174252|title=Ommadawn [2010 Reissue]|year=1975|id=532 676-2|publisher=Mercury Records|type=Booklet essay|pages=3\u20135, 7\u20139|first=Mark|last=Powell}}</ref> When he decided to write new material, he wished to avoid working in a professional studio and instead, convinced his label [[Virgin Records]] to install a 24-track studio in his home named The Beacon in [[Kington, Herefordshire]].<ref name=2010CD/> By the time ''Ommadawn'' was released, Oldfield had moved out of Kington and into Througham Slad Manor close to [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]].<ref name=MM74/>\n\nShortly after recording began in January 1975 Oldfield suffered a setback with the death of his mother. He later recalled that his new music was the only thing that provided any form of comfort from the ordeal.<ref name=2010CD/> After several months of recording the entire first side had to be re-recorded because the original was irreparably damaged as the tape had shed its oxide layer.<ref name=MM74>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1975_10/Beyond-the-Ridge-Portrait-of-a-Genius|title=Beyond the Ridge: Portrait of a Genius|work=Melody Maker|first=Karl|last=Dallas |date=25 October 1975|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> The African drums were recorded at [[The Manor Studio]] in [[Shipton-on-Cherwell]], Oxfordshire where Oldfield had recorded his first two albums.<ref name=MM74/>\n\nThe cover photograph was taken by [[David Bailey]].\n\nThe album's title came about at the end of its production. Oldfield had spotted a collection of words that Irish musician [[Clodagh Simonds]] had made up, one of them being ''ommadawn'', and decided to use it. Oldfield rejected a claim that the title comes from the Gaelic word ''amadan'' or ''omadhaun'', meaning \"fool\".<ref name=MM74/>{{Contradict-inline|section=Album title and lyrics\n|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Music==\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\nSimilar to his first two albums, ''Ommadawn'' is a single composition divided into two parts of the vinyl. Oldfield makes economic use of a relatively small number of subjects throughout ''Ommadawn'' and develops them extensively, both with musical variation and by varying the instruments used. Each of the two movements of ''Ommadawn'' utilise their own subjects without sharing them between the two movements. Oldfield sought out the ancient [[Celtic music|Celtic]] influence on English music and composed for traditional instruments such as [[uilleann pipes]] on the original LP version. A set of [[Northumbrian smallpipes]] were also recorded, and credited to \"Herbie\", but this recording was not used on the album.\n\nOldfield recorded each layer of sound and played the bulk of the instruments throughout ''Ommadawn'', with the exception of a few musicians noted for their work in folk music: Clodagh Simonds, [[Paddy Moloney]], and the heavy [[Music of Africa|African drumming]] of [[Jabula]]. \n\nOldfield plays two electric guitars: a red [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Gibson SG Junior|SG Junior]] and a blonde [[Fender Telecaster]]. Oldfield appears to have been using two electric bass guitars at the time; a [[Fender Precision Bass|Fender Precision]] and a [[Gibson EB-3]]. An [[acoustic bass guitar]] built by [[Tony Zemaitis]] and a [[Ram\u00edrez Guitars|Ramirez]] classical guitar appear on the album. The piano on the album is likely to be a [[B\u00f6sendorfer]]. A [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[lap steel guitar]] is also thought to appear on \"On Horseback\", although uncredited. Many of Oldfield's instruments from this period are shown in a photograph which was included in the ''[[Boxed (Mike Oldfield album)|Boxed]]'' 4-LP box set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/discography/OmmadawnInstruments.shtml |title=''Ommadawn'' Instruments |publisher=Tubular.net |accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n== History and versions ==\nAn [[Matrix decoder|SQ system]] [[quadraphonic]] remix version of ''Ommadawn'' was released on ''[[Boxed (Mike Oldfield album)|Boxed]]'' a year later.\n\nOldfield's 1990 album ''[[Amarok (Mike Oldfield album)|Amarok]]'' was conceived as a sequel to ''Ommadawn'', but turned into something quite different; [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] had been pushing Oldfield for a [[Tubular Bells II|sequel to ''Tubular Bells'']].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tubular.net/discography/Amarok.shtml |title=''Amarok'' |publisher=Tubular.net |accessdate=14 September 2008}}</ref> An actual sequel album to ''Ommadawn'', titled ''[[Return to Ommadawn]]'', was released in 2017.\n\nThe topic of ''Ommadawn'' is covered in the final episode of the [[Tony Palmer]] documentary series ''[[All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music|All You Need is Love]]''; episode 17 \"Imagine (New Directions)\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allyouneedislovedvd.com/ |title=''All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music'' |publisher=[[Tony Palmer]] |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref> It includes Oldfield and [[Richard Branson]] discussing the album along with studio footage from the time.\n\nExcerpts from ''Ommadawn'' appeared in the 1979 [[NASA]] film, ''[[The Space Movie]]''. A small portion of ''Ommadawn'' \"Part One\" was used as the theme music for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Jackanory]]'' on occasions when [[John Grant (children's author)|John Grant]] narrated his ''Littlenose'' stories.\n\nIn June 2010 the album was reissued by [[Mercury Records]]; the release included a demo version of the work.\n\n== Album title and lyrics ==\nIn his autobiography, [[Changeling (Mike Oldfield autobiography)|''Changeling'']], Oldfield states that he just wanted \"sounds\" not \"sensible\" lyrics. He asked [[Clodagh Simonds]], an Irish musician with whom he was working, to come up with something in [[Irish language|Irish]]. She wrote down the first words that came into her head:\n\n:Daddy's in bed, The cat's drinking milk, I'm an idiot, And I'm laughing.<ref name=change>{{cite book |last=Oldfield |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Oldfield |title=[[Changeling (Mike Oldfield autobiography)|Changeling \u2013 Autobiography of Mike Oldfield]] |year=2007 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=978-0-7535-1307-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/changelingautobi0000oldf/page/177 177] }}</ref>\n\nOldfield states that Simonds had telephoned a relative or friend to translate these words into [[Irish language|Irish]] for the song. The final lyrics included with the album are:\n<poem>\n''Ab yul ann idyad awt''\n''En yab na log a toc na awd''\n''Taw may on omma dawn ekyowl''\n''Omma dawn ekyowl''\n</poem>\n\nThese lyrics are written in an English-based respelling system, but all four lines are easily recognisable as an Irish translation of the English words, although the first two lines have undergone a process of partial [[scrambling|scrambler]]: combinations of [[vowel]] + [[semivowel]] are kept intact, but otherwise the lines are written backwards (so, e.g., ''idyad awt'' corresponds to ''taw daydi'') and some word spaces have been changed. In standard Irish orthography, the lyrics are (with English translation, since the translation does not match the original exactly):<ref>The translation was seemingly done by a non-native Irish speaker and contains several grammatical errors. In Standard Irish, a corrected version would be: ''T\u00e1 daid(\u00ed) ina leaba / T\u00e1 an cat ag \u00f3l an bhainne / Is m\u00e9 an t-amad\u00e1n ag ceol / Amad\u00e1n ag ceol''.</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 2em;\" | ''T\u00e1 daid\u00ed 'na leaba''<br>''T\u00e1 an cat ag \u00f3l an bainne''<br>''T\u00e1 m\u00e9 an amad\u00e1n ag ceol''<br>''Amad\u00e1n ag ceol'' || Daddy\u2019s in his bed<br>The cat\u2019s drinking the milk<br>I\u2019m the idiot singing (''or'' the singing idiot)<br>Idiot singing (''or'' singing idiot)\n|}\n\nThe word \"idiot\" (''amad\u00e1n'' in Irish) was Anglicised into \"Ommadawn\" and used as the title of the album. Prior to his autobiography, Oldfield had denied this meaning of ''ommadawn'', calling it a [[nonsense word]], apparently as a ruse to enhance the mystery of his music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ommadawn.dk/index.php?sideid=161 |title=The title |publisher=Ommadawn.dk |date=18 August 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/faq/#4.1 |title=Mike Oldfield FAQ |publisher=Tubular.net |date=30 December 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref>{{Contradict-inline|section=Background and recording|date=December 2019}}\n\n== \"On Horseback\" and \"In Dulci Jubilo\" ==\n{{see also|In Dulci Jubilo / On Horseback}}\nThough the actual work ''Ommadawn'' is a two-part piece, there is a third track on the album, a short vocal song by Mike Oldfield and [[William Murray (musician)|William Murray]] called \"On Horseback\".  \"On Horseback\" relates to Oldfield, Murray and [[Leslie Penning]]'s time riding [[pony|ponies]] around the area of Hergest Ridge.<ref name=change/>\n\nIn November 1975, Oldfield released the single \"[[In Dulci Jubilo / On Horseback|In Dulci Jubilo]]\", with \"On Horseback\" as the B-side. It reached number 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1976. In France, \"In Dulci Jubilo\" was coupled to a remix of the end of part 1 of ''Ommadawn''. Some copies of the album also include \"In Dulci Jubilo\" at the end, instead of \"On Horseback\".\n\nThe 2010 reissue includes \"On Horseback\" at the end of \"Ommadawn (Part 2)\" as one long track, as well as \"In Dulce Jubilo\" included as a bonus track. Three other bonus tracks are also included: \"First Excursion\", \"Argiers\" and \"Portsmouth\".\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll words and music written by Mike Oldfield, except where noted.\n\n'''Side one'''\n# \"Ommadawn (Part One)\" \u2013 19:23\n'''Side two'''\n# \"Ommadawn (Part Two)\" \u2013 13:54\n# \"On Horseback\" ''(not titled)'' \u2013 3:23\n\n:* <small>''\"On Horseback\"'' is not listed on the record label, but added to the length of ''\"Ommadawn (Part Two)\"'', giving it a new length of 17:17.

This came as part of a deal in which Oldfield's Virgin albums were transferred to the label. The re-release included a 2010 [[5.1 surround sound|5.1 mix]] of the album and a track titled the 'lost version'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ommadawn-Deluxe-Mike-Oldfield/dp/B003DO13OC |title=''Ommadawn'' Deluxe Edition |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> The album includes \"In Dulci Jubilo\", \"First Excursion\", \"Argiers\" and \"[[Portsmouth (Mike Oldfield instrumental)|Portsmouth]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ommadawn-Deluxe-Mike-Oldfield/dp/B003DO13OC/mikeoldfitubulwe |title=''Ommadawn'' |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe original LP artwork was restored; in previous CD issues the text had been centralised and increased in size.

1975 on [[Virgin Records]]. It peaked at No. 4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album was reissued by [[Mercury Records]] in June 2010 with additional content. A sequel album, titled ''[[Return to Ommadawn]]'', was released on 20 January 2017.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBy late 1974, Oldfield had become increasingly disappointed with the negative reaction towards his second album ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974). However, the situation sparked a creative period in his effort to deliver a follow-up that was \"worthwhile and successful\" that proved he was not a mere [[one-hit wonder]] following the unexpected commercial and critical success of his first, ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973).<ref name=2010CD>{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Mike-Oldfield-Ommadawn/release/12174252|title=Ommadawn [2010 Reissue]|year=1975|id=532 676-2|publisher=Mercury Records|type=Booklet essay|pages=3\u20135, 7\u20139|first=Mark|last=Powell}}</ref> When he decided to write new material, he wished to avoid working in a professional studio and instead, convinced his label [[Virgin Records]] to install a 24-track studio in his home named The Beacon in [[Kington, Herefordshire]].<ref name=2010CD/> By the time ''Ommadawn'' was released, Oldfield had moved out of Kington and into Througham Slad Manor close to [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]].<ref name=MM74/>\n\nShortly after recording began in January 1975 Oldfield suffered a setback with the death of his mother. He later recalled that his new music was the only thing that provided any form of comfort from the ordeal.<ref name=2010CD/> After several months of recording the entire first side had to be re-recorded because the original was irreparably damaged as the tape had shed its oxide layer.<ref name=MM74>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1975_10/Beyond-the-Ridge-Portrait-of-a-Genius|title=Beyond the Ridge: Portrait of a Genius|work=Melody Maker|first=Karl|last=Dallas |date=25 October 1975|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> The African drums were recorded at [[The Manor Studio]] in [[Shipton-on-Cherwell]], Oxfordshire where Oldfield had recorded his first two albums.<ref name=MM74/>\n\nThe cover photograph was taken by [[David Bailey]].\n\nThe album's title came about at the end of its production. Oldfield had spotted a collection of words that Irish musician [[Clodagh Simonds]] had made up, one of them being ''ommadawn'', and decided to use it. Oldfield rejected a claim that the title comes from the Gaelic word ''amadan'' or ''omadhaun'', meaning \"fool\".<ref name=MM74/>{{Contradict-inline|section=Album title and lyrics\n|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Music==\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\nSimilar to his first two albums, ''Ommadawn'' is a single composition divided into two parts of the vinyl. Oldfield makes economic use of a relatively small number of subjects throughout ''Ommadawn'' and develops them extensively, both with musical variation and by varying the instruments used. Each of the two movements of ''Ommadawn'' utilise their own subjects without sharing them between the two movements. Oldfield sought out the ancient [[Celtic music|Celtic]] influence on English music and composed for traditional instruments such as [[uilleann pipes]] on the original LP version. A set of [[Northumbrian smallpipes]] were also recorded, and credited to \"Herbie\", but this recording was not used on the album.\n\nOldfield recorded each layer of sound and played the bulk of the instruments throughout ''Ommadawn'', with the exception of a few musicians noted for their work in folk music: Clodagh Simonds, [[Paddy Moloney]], and the heavy [[Music of Africa|African drumming]] of [[Jabula]]. \n\nOldfield plays two electric guitars: a red [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Gibson SG Junior|SG Junior]] and a blonde [[Fender Telecaster]]. Oldfield appears to have been using two electric bass guitars at the time; a [[Fender Precision Bass|Fender Precision]] and a [[Gibson EB-3]]. An [[acoustic bass guitar]] built by [[Tony Zemaitis]] and a [[Ram\u00edrez Guitars|Ramirez]] classical guitar appear on the album. The piano on the album is likely to be a [[B\u00f6sendorfer]]. A [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[lap steel guitar]] is also thought to appear on \"On Horseback\", although uncredited. Many of Oldfield's instruments from this period are shown in a photograph which was included in the ''[[Boxed (Mike Oldfield album)|Boxed]]'' 4-LP box set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/discography/OmmadawnInstruments.shtml |title=''Ommadawn'' Instruments |publisher=Tubular.net |accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n== History and versions ==\nAn [[Matrix decoder|SQ system]] [[quadraphonic]] remix version of ''Ommadawn'' was released on ''[[Boxed (Mike Oldfield album)|Boxed]]'' a year later.\n\nOldfield's 1990 album ''[[Amarok (Mike Oldfield album)|Amarok]]'' was conceived as a sequel to ''Ommadawn'', but turned into something quite different; [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] had been pushing Oldfield for a [[Tubular Bells II|sequel to ''Tubular Bells'']].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tubular.net/discography/Amarok.shtml |title=''Amarok'' |publisher=Tubular.net |accessdate=14 September 2008}}</ref> An actual sequel album to ''Ommadawn'', titled ''[[Return to Ommadawn]]'', was released in 2017.\n\nThe topic of ''Ommadawn'' is covered in the final episode of the [[Tony Palmer]] documentary series ''[[All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music|All You Need is Love]]''; episode 17 \"Imagine (New Directions)\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allyouneedislovedvd.com/ |title=''All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music'' |publisher=[[Tony Palmer]] |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref> It includes Oldfield and [[Richard Branson]] discussing the album along with studio footage from the time.\n\nExcerpts from ''Ommadawn'' appeared in the 1979 [[NASA]] film, ''[[The Space Movie]]''. A small portion of ''Ommadawn'' \"Part One\" was used as the theme music for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Jackanory]]'' on occasions when [[John Grant (children's author)|John Grant]] narrated his ''Littlenose'' stories.\n\nIn June 2010 the album was reissued by [[Mercury Records]]; the release included a demo version of the work.\n\n== Album title and lyrics ==\nIn his autobiography, [[Changeling (Mike Oldfield autobiography)|''Changeling'']], Oldfield states that he just wanted \"sounds\" not \"sensible\" lyrics. He asked [[Clodagh Simonds]], an Irish musician with whom he was working, to come up with something in [[Irish language|Irish]]. She wrote down the first words that came into her head:\n\n:Daddy's in bed, The cat's drinking milk, I'm an idiot, And I'm laughing.<ref name=change>{{cite book |last=Oldfield |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Oldfield |title=[[Changeling (Mike Oldfield autobiography)|Changeling \u2013 Autobiography of Mike Oldfield]] |year=2007 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=978-0-7535-1307-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/changelingautobi0000oldf/page/177 177] }}</ref>\n\nOldfield states that Simonds had telephoned a relative or friend to translate these words into [[Irish language|Irish]] for the song. The final lyrics included with the album are:\n<poem>\n''Ab yul ann idyad awt''\n''En yab na log a toc na awd''\n''Taw may on omma dawn ekyowl''\n''Omma dawn ekyowl''\n</poem>\n\nThese lyrics are written in an English-based respelling system, but all four lines are easily recognisable as an Irish translation of the English words, although the first two lines have been somewhat scrambled: combinations of [[vowel]] + [[semivowel]] are kept intact, but otherwise the lines are written backwards (so, e.g., ''idyad awt'' corresponds to ''taw daydi'') and some word spaces have been changed. In standard Irish orthography, the lyrics are (with English translation, since the translation does not match the original exactly):<ref>The translation was seemingly done by a non-native Irish speaker and contains several grammatical errors. In Standard Irish, a corrected version would be: ''T\u00e1 daid(\u00ed) ina leaba / T\u00e1 an cat ag \u00f3l an bhainne / Is m\u00e9 an t-amad\u00e1n ag ceol / Amad\u00e1n ag ceol''.</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"padding-right: 2em;\" | ''T\u00e1 daid\u00ed 'na leaba''<br>''T\u00e1 an cat ag \u00f3l an bainne''<br>''T\u00e1 m\u00e9 an amad\u00e1n ag ceol''<br>''Amad\u00e1n ag ceol'' || Daddy\u2019s in his bed<br>The cat\u2019s drinking the milk<br>I\u2019m the idiot singing (''or'' the singing idiot)<br>Idiot singing (''or'' singing idiot)\n|}\n\nThe word \"idiot\" (''amad\u00e1n'' in Irish) was Anglicised into \"Ommadawn\" and used as the title of the album. Prior to his autobiography, Oldfield had denied this meaning of ''ommadawn'', calling it a [[nonsense word]], apparently as a ruse to enhance the mystery of his music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ommadawn.dk/index.php?sideid=161 |title=The title |publisher=Ommadawn.dk |date=18 August 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/faq/#4.1 |title=Mike Oldfield FAQ |publisher=Tubular.net |date=30 December 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref>{{Contradict-inline|section=Background and recording|date=December 2019}}\n\n== \"On Horseback\" and \"In Dulci Jubilo\" ==\n{{see also|In Dulci Jubilo / On Horseback}}\nThough the actual work ''Ommadawn'' is a two-part piece, there is a third track on the album, a short vocal song by Mike Oldfield and [[William Murray (musician)|William Murray]] called \"On Horseback\".  \"On Horseback\" relates to Oldfield, Murray and [[Leslie Penning]]'s time riding [[pony|ponies]] around the area of Hergest Ridge.<ref name=change/>\n\nIn November 1975, Oldfield released the single \"[[In Dulci Jubilo / On Horseback|In Dulci Jubilo]]\", with \"On Horseback\" as the B-side. It reached number 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1976. In France, \"In Dulci Jubilo\" was coupled to a remix of the end of part 1 of ''Ommadawn''. Some copies of the album also include \"In Dulci Jubilo\" at the end, instead of \"On Horseback\".\n\nThe 2010 reissue includes \"On Horseback\" at the end of \"Ommadawn (Part 2)\" as one long track, as well as \"In Dulce Jubilo\" included as a bonus track. Three other bonus tracks are also included: \"First Excursion\", \"Argiers\" and \"Portsmouth\".\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll words and music written by Mike Oldfield, except where noted.\n\n'''Side one'''\n# \"Ommadawn (Part One)\" \u2013 19:23\n'''Side two'''\n# \"Ommadawn (Part Two)\" \u2013 13:54\n# \"On Horseback\" ''(not titled)'' \u2013 3:23\n\n:* <small>''\"On Horseback\"'' is not listed on the record label, but added to the length of ''\"Ommadawn (Part Two)\"'', giving it a new length of 17:17. It is, however, referred to on the inner sleeve where it is noted that \"the words to the horse song on side two by Mike Oldfield and William Murray\". The songsheet for ''\"On Horseback\"'' says \"Music by Mike Oldfield, Words by Mike Oldfield and William Murray\".</small>\n\n== Mercury Records reissue ==\nOn 7 June 2010 the album was re-released by [[Mercury Records]]. This came as part of a deal in which Oldfield's Virgin albums were transferred to the label. The re-release included a 2010 [[5.1 surround sound|5.1 mix]] of the album and a track titled the 'lost version'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ommadawn-Deluxe-Mike-Oldfield/dp/B003DO13OC |title=''Ommadawn'' Deluxe Edition |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref> The album includes \"In Dulci Jubilo\", \"First Excursion\", \"Argiers\" and \"[[Portsmouth (Mike Oldfield instrumental)|Portsmouth]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ommadawn-Deluxe-Mike-Oldfield/dp/B003DO13OC/mikeoldfitubulwe |title=''Ommadawn'' |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe original LP artwork was restored; in previous CD issues the text had been centralised and increased in size.

From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as [[Bilad al-Sham]]. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria, with its capital at [[Antioch]], which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and [[Mesopotamia]] was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as [[Suriyah]], to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the [[Orontes river]], in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in [[Byzantine]] and Western European usage, and also in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] literature of some of the [[Eastern Christian]] churches, from which it occasionally found its way into [[Christians|Christian]] Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of [[Western Europe]]. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage.}}</ref> It includes the cities of Jerusalem and Hebron.<ref name=\"Abu Sway\"/>\n\n=== Jerusalem ===\n{{See also|Islamization of Jerusalem|Muslim Quarter|Religious significance of Jerusalem|Timeline of Jerusalem}}\n\nAccording to mainstream Sunni and Shi'ite traditions, ''[[Al-Masjid Al-Aq\u1e63\u0101]]'' (\"The Farthest Place-of-Prostration\")<ref name=\"Cite quran|17|1|e=7|s=ns\">{{cite quran|17|1|e=7|s=ns}}</ref> is located in Jerusalem.

From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as [[Bilad al-Sham]]. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria, with its capital at [[Antioch]], which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and [[Mesopotamia]] was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as [[Suriyah]], to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the [[Orontes river]], in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in [[Byzantine]] and Western European usage, and also in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] literature of some of the [[Eastern Christian]] churches, from which it occasionally found its way into [[Christians|Christian]] Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of [[Western Europe]]. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage.}}</ref> It includes the cities of Jerusalem and Hebron.<ref name=\"Abu Sway\"/>\n\n=== Jerusalem ===\n{{See also|Islamization of Jerusalem|Muslim Quarter|Religious significance of Jerusalem|Timeline of Jerusalem}}\n\nAccording to mainstream Sunni and Shi'ite traditions, ''[[Al-Masjid Al-Aq\u1e63\u0101]]'' (\"The Farthest Place-of-Prostration\")<ref name=\"Cite quran|17|1|e=7|s=ns\">{{cite quran|17|1|e=7|s=ns}}</ref> is located in Jerusalem.
