(Tex. Occ. Code Ann. \u00a7 2301.476) and \"A motor vehicle shall not be advertised for sale in any manner that creates the impression that it is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor of the vehicle. An advertisement shall not contain terms such as \u201cfactory sale,\u201d \u201cfleet prices,\u201d \u201cwholesale prices,\u201d \u201cfactory approved,\u201d \u201cfactory sponsored,\u201d \u201cmanufacturer sale,\u201d use a manufacturer's name or abbreviation in any manner calculated or likely to create an impression that the vehicle is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor, or use any other similar terms which indicate sales other than retail sales from the dealer\" (43 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 215.261).\n\nThese laws make it illegal to buy a car from Tesla in person, at a Tesla Gallery. Thus, all Texas orders are taken via the internet or over the phone.

If so, please consider writing an article yourself.

Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the deceased \"notable\". If you report the death of a subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, please consider starting one, provided that the deceased is notable. Please include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid overlinking.

The building is equipped with a lighting system that detects natural ambient light sources and automatically dims artificial lighting to save 39% of the power usually required to light an office building. eBay's newest building also reduces demand on local water supplies by incorporating an eco-friendly irrigation system, and low-flow showerheads and faucets.

Separate eBay sites such as eBay US and eBay UK allow the users to trade using the local currency. Software developers can create applications that integrate with eBay through the [[eBay API]] by joining the eBay Developers Program.<ref name=\"eBay Developers Program\"/> In June 2005, there were more than 15,000 members in the eBay Developers Program, comprising a broad range of companies creating software applications to support eBay buyers and sellers as well as eBay Affiliates.\n\nNumerous government and police agencies<ref>{{cite web|title=government Auctions|url=http://governmentauctionsuk.com/page/police-auction|website=Police and Government Auctions|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> around the world now use eBay as well as traditional [[auction]]s to dispose of seized and confiscated goods.\n\nControversy has arisen over certain items put up for bid.

However, as the site grew, it became necessary to restrict or prohibit auctions for various items. Note that some of the restrictions relate to eBay.com (the US site), while other restrictions apply to specific European sites (such as Nazi paraphernalia). Regional laws and regulations may apply to the seller or the buyer. Generally, if the sale or ownership of an item is regulated or prohibited by one or more states, eBay will not permit its listing. Among the hundred or so banned or restricted categories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Tobacco]] (tobacco-related items and collectibles are accepted.)<ref name=\"Tobacco policy\"/>\n* [[alcoholic beverages|Alcohol]] (alcohol-related collectibles, including sealed containers, as well as some wine sales by licensed sellers are allowed, some sites such as ebay.com.au allow licensed liquor sales)<ref name=\"Alcohol policy\"/> (eBay announced September 21, 2012, it will begin removing listings for beer and liquor from its site after a story was aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]''.)<ref>{{cite web|last=McNIFF and GOMSTYN|first=EAMON and ALICE|title=eBay Begins Removing Alcohol Listings After '20/20' Report on Teen Buyer|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/kids-buy-alcohol-ebay/story?id=17280467#.UF1_Y7KPUl8|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=September 22, 2012|date=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Prohibition (drugs)|Drugs]] and drug paraphernalia<ref name=\"Drugs and drug paraphernalia policy\"/>\n* Items that \"promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual, or religious intolerance, or promote organizations with such views\".

However, since the bid increment amounts are relatively insignificant compared to the bid size, they are not considered from a strategic standpoint.<ref name=\"eBay's explanation of bid increments\"/>\n* The highest bidder's bid is sealed, as in a [[Vickrey auction]], but the current winning bid (second highest plus one increment) is displayed throughout the auction to allow [[price discovery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aucx.com/|title=Domain Name Auctions |publisher=AUCX.com}}</ref>\n* Because eBay's auction-style listings are sealed-bid, it is usually to all bidders' advantage that bids are made only at the very end of the auction (except for an initial minimum bid, that cancels out a \"Buy It Now\" option, or prevents the seller from ending the listing early). Early bids will usually not increase the bidder's chance of winning the auction, and will often raise the item's final price (winning bid) for the eventual winner.\n* eBay also allows sellers to offer a \"Buy it Now\" price that will end the auction immediately. The Buy It Now price is available until someone bids on the item, or until the reserve price is met. When the Buy It Now option disappears, the auction-style listing proceeds normally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fixed-price.html|title=Selling using a fixed price|publisher=ebay.com}}</ref>\n\n====Seller ratings====\nIn 2008, eBay implemented a system of seller ratings with four categories. Buyers are asked to rate the seller in each of these categories with a score of one to five, with five being the highest rating. Unlike the overall feedback rating, these ratings are anonymous; neither sellers nor other users learn how individual buyers rated the seller. The listings of sellers with a rating of 4.3 or below in any of the four rating categories appear lower in search results. Power Sellers are required to have scores in each category above 4.5.<ref name=\"February 2008\"/><ref name=\"January 20081\"/><ref name=\"Upcoming Changes to Feedback\"/><ref name=\"Fees 2008 Overview\"/><ref name=\"January 20082\"/>\n\nIn a reversal of roles, on January 24, 2010, Auctionbytes.com held an open survey in which sellers could rate eBay, as well as competing auction and marketplace sites.<ref name=\"survey\"/> In the survey, users were asked to rank 15 sites based on five criteria: profitability, customer service, communication, ease of use, and recommendation.\n\neBay was ranked 13th,<ref name=\"auctionbytes13\"/> after other large sites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[Craigslist]], as well as lesser-known selling sites such as [[Atomic Mall]], [[eCRATER]], and [[Ruby Lane]]. In individual category rankings, eBay was rated the worst of all the 15 sites on customer service and communication, and average on ease of use. Some respondents stated they would have given eBay a rating of 10, three to five years ago. eBay was rated twelfth out of fifteen in the Recommended Selling Venue category.\n\n====Charity auctions====\nUsing [[MissionFish]] as an arbiter, eBay allows sellers to donate a portion of their auction proceeds to a charity of the seller's choice.<ref>[https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/09/ebay-update-adds-a-sell-for-charity-option-for-us-and-uk-markets/ \"eBay update adds a Sell for Charity option for US and UK markets\"].

They aligned themselves with Internet phenomenon [[T\u00eates \u00e0 claques]] to create an eBay auction based on popular T-A-C character Uncle Tom, an infomercial host who pitches absurd products. eBay and CloudRaker reproduced Uncle Tom's imaginary products, The Body Toner Fly Swatter, The Willi Waller Potato Peeler, and the LCD Shovel and sold them online. In six weeks, they raised $15,000 for H\u00f4pital St-Justine with one fly swatter, one potato peeler, and one shovel, a world record. The Body Toner Fly Swatter sold for $8,600, the Willi Waller Potato Peeler sold for $3,550, and the LCD Shovel sold for $2,146.21.\n\n===Shipping===\nDuring auction setup, eBay provides shipping-method choices to sellers: ordinary mail, [[express mail]], and/or courier service. The seller may choose to offer only one shipping method to buyers, or the seller may offer buyers a choice of options.\n\nVery-low-value items shipped directly from China are sometimes shipped by [[surface mail]] (seamail), which is inexpensive but takes one to two months.<ref>{{cite web|title=China Travel Tips \u00bb Postal Service|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/essential/postal-service/|website=Travel China Guide website|publisher=Xian Marco Polo International Travel Service Co., Ltd|accessdate=February 19, 2017|quote=Surface mail takes one to two months. ...

If a seller uses the program, non-domestic buyers pay a fee to [[Pitney Bowes]].

The building is equipped with a lighting system that detects natural ambient light sources and automatically dims artificial lighting to save 39% of the power usually required to light an office building. eBay's newest building also reduces demand on local water supplies by incorporating an eco-friendly irrigation system, and low-flow showerheads and faucets.

Separate eBay sites such as eBay US and eBay UK allow the users to trade using the local currency. Software developers can create applications that integrate with eBay through the [[eBay API]] by joining the eBay Developers Program.<ref name=\"eBay Developers Program\"/> In June 2005, there were more than 15,000 members in the eBay Developers Program, comprising a broad range of companies creating software applications to support eBay buyers and sellers as well as eBay Affiliates.\n\nNumerous government and police agencies<ref>{{cite web|title=government Auctions|url=http://governmentauctionsuk.com/page/police-auction|website=Police and Government Auctions|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> around the world now use eBay as well as traditional [[auction]]s to dispose of seized and confiscated goods.\n\nControversy has arisen over certain items put up for bid.

However, as the site grew, it became necessary to restrict or prohibit auctions for various items. Note that some of the restrictions relate to eBay.com (the US site), while other restrictions apply to specific European sites (such as Nazi paraphernalia). Regional laws and regulations may apply to the seller or the buyer. Generally, if the sale or ownership of an item is regulated or prohibited by one or more states, eBay will not permit its listing. Among the hundred or so banned or restricted categories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Tobacco]] (tobacco-related items and collectibles are accepted.)<ref name=\"Tobacco policy\"/>\n* [[alcoholic beverages|Alcohol]] (alcohol-related collectibles, including sealed containers, as well as some wine sales by licensed sellers are allowed, some sites such as ebay.com.au allow licensed liquor sales)<ref name=\"Alcohol policy\"/> (eBay announced September 21, 2012, it will begin removing listings for beer and liquor from its site after a story was aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]''.)<ref>{{cite web|last=McNIFF and GOMSTYN|first=EAMON and ALICE|title=eBay Begins Removing Alcohol Listings After '20/20' Report on Teen Buyer|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/kids-buy-alcohol-ebay/story?id=17280467#.UF1_Y7KPUl8|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=September 22, 2012|date=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Prohibition (drugs)|Drugs]] and drug paraphernalia<ref name=\"Drugs and drug paraphernalia policy\"/>\n* Items that \"promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual, or religious intolerance, or promote organizations with such views\".

However, since the bid increment amounts are relatively insignificant compared to the bid size, they are not considered from a strategic standpoint.<ref name=\"eBay's explanation of bid increments\"/>\n* The highest bidder's bid is sealed, as in a [[Vickrey auction]], but the current winning bid (second highest plus one increment) is displayed throughout the auction to allow [[price discovery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aucx.com/|title=Domain Name Auctions |publisher=AUCX.com}}</ref>\n* Because eBay's auction-style listings are sealed-bid, it is usually to all bidders' advantage that bids are made only at the very end of the auction (except for an initial minimum bid, that cancels out a \"Buy It Now\" option, or prevents the seller from ending the listing early). Early bids will usually not increase the bidder's chance of winning the auction, and will often raise the item's final price (winning bid) for the eventual winner.\n* eBay also allows sellers to offer a \"Buy it Now\" price that will end the auction immediately. The Buy It Now price is available until someone bids on the item, or until the reserve price is met. When the Buy It Now option disappears, the auction-style listing proceeds normally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fixed-price.html|title=Selling using a fixed price|publisher=ebay.com}}</ref>\n\n====Seller ratings====\nIn 2008, eBay implemented a system of seller ratings with four categories. Buyers are asked to rate the seller in each of these categories with a score of one to five, with five being the highest rating. Unlike the overall feedback rating, these ratings are anonymous; neither sellers nor other users learn how individual buyers rated the seller. The listings of sellers with a rating of 4.3 or below in any of the four rating categories appear lower in search results. Power Sellers are required to have scores in each category above 4.5.<ref name=\"February 2008\"/><ref name=\"January 20081\"/><ref name=\"Upcoming Changes to Feedback\"/><ref name=\"Fees 2008 Overview\"/><ref name=\"January 20082\"/>\n\nIn a reversal of roles, on January 24, 2010, Auctionbytes.com held an open survey in which sellers could rate eBay, as well as competing auction and marketplace sites.<ref name=\"survey\"/> In the survey, users were asked to rank 15 sites based on five criteria: profitability, customer service, communication, ease of use, and recommendation.\n\neBay was ranked 13th,<ref name=\"auctionbytes13\"/> after other large sites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[Craigslist]], as well as lesser-known selling sites such as [[Atomic Mall]], [[eCRATER]], and [[Ruby Lane]]. In individual category rankings, eBay was rated the worst of all the 15 sites on customer service and communication, and average on ease of use. Some respondents stated they would have given eBay a rating of 10, three to five years ago. eBay was rated twelfth out of fifteen in the Recommended Selling Venue category.\n\n====Charity auctions====\nUsing [[MissionFish]] as an arbiter, eBay allows sellers to donate a portion of their auction proceeds to a charity of the seller's choice.<ref>[https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/09/ebay-update-adds-a-sell-for-charity-option-for-us-and-uk-markets/ \"eBay update adds a Sell for Charity option for US and UK markets\"].

They aligned themselves with Internet phenomenon [[T\u00eates \u00e0 claques]] to create an eBay auction based on popular T-A-C character Uncle Tom, an infomercial host who pitches absurd products. eBay and CloudRaker reproduced Uncle Tom's imaginary products, The Body Toner Fly Swatter, The Willi Waller Potato Peeler, and the LCD Shovel and sold them online. In six weeks, they raised $15,000 for H\u00f4pital St-Justine with one fly swatter, one potato peeler, and one shovel, a world record. The Body Toner Fly Swatter sold for $8,600, the Willi Waller Potato Peeler sold for $3,550, and the LCD Shovel sold for $2,146.21.\n\n===Shipping===\nDuring auction setup, eBay provides shipping-method choices to sellers: ordinary mail, [[express mail]], and/or courier service. The seller may choose to offer only one shipping method to buyers, or the seller may offer buyers a choice of options.\n\nVery-low-value items shipped directly from China are sometimes shipped by [[surface mail]] (seamail), which is inexpensive but takes one to two months.<ref>{{cite web|title=China Travel Tips \u00bb Postal Service|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/essential/postal-service/|website=Travel China Guide website|publisher=Xian Marco Polo International Travel Service Co., Ltd|accessdate=February 19, 2017|quote=Surface mail takes one to two months. ...

If a seller uses the program, non-domestic buyers pay a fee to [[Pitney Bowes]].

The [[Syrian Electronic Army]] took responsibility for the attack. The SEA said that even though the hack revealed millions of users' banking details to them, they would not misuse the data. They had replaced the front pages of the websites with their own logo, called \"[[Website defacement|Defacing]]\" in technical terms. The hack caused eBay's share price to crash in intra-day trade as a result of the breach of security.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/21/technology/security/ebay-passwords/index.html | title=EBay customers must reset passwords after major hack | publisher=CNN | accessdate=May 21, 2014| date=May 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/05/21/ebay-breach/9368969/ | title=EBay urging users to change passwords after breach | date=May 21, 2014 | work=USA Today | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/21/us-ebay-password-idUSBREA4K0B420140521 | title=EBay asks 145 million users to change passwords after cyber attack | agency=Reuters | date=May 21, 2014 | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2014/05/21/ebay-suffers-massive-security-breach-all-users-must-their-change-passwords/ | title=eBay Suffers Massive Security Breach, All Users Must Change Their Passwords | work=Forbes | date=May 21, 2014 | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alibaba Group]], Chinese e-commerce company\n* ''[[eBay v.
