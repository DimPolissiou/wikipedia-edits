{"title_page": "Poland in the Early Middle Ages", "text_new": "{{History of Poland}}\n\nThe most important phenomenon that took place within the lands of '''Poland in the Early Middle Ages''', as well as other parts of [[Central Europe]] was the arrival and permanent settlement of the [[West Slavic peoples|West Slavic]] or [[Lechites|Lechitic]] peoples.<ref name=\"KK 337\"/><ref name=\"KK-327\u2013330, 346\"/> The Slavic [[human migrations|migrations]] to the area of contemporary Poland started in the second half of the 5th century AD, about a half century after these territories were vacated by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes fleeing from the [[Huns]].<ref name=\"KK 337\"/><ref name=\"KK-327\u2013330, 346\"/> The first waves of the incoming Slavs settled the vicinity of the upper [[Vistula]] River and elsewhere in the lands of present southeastern [[Poland]] and southern [[Masovia]].

''Y-STR variation among Slavs: evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin'', in ''[[Journal of Human Genetics]]'' ([[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] Japan), May 2007</ref> the immigrants would have had come primarily from the western branch of the early Slavs known as [[Sclaveni]],<ref>[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]], ''[[Getica (Jordanes)|Getica]]''</ref> and since their arrival are classified as [[West Slavs]] and [[Lechites]], who are the closest ancestors of [[Poles]].{{Ref label|a|a|none}}\n\nFrom there the new population dispersed north and west over the course of the 6th century. The Slavs lived from cultivation of crops and were generally farmers, but also engaged in hunting and gathering. The migrations took place when the destabilizing invasions of Eastern and Central Europe by waves of people and armies from the east, such as the [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]], were occurring. This westward movement of Slavic people was facilitated in part by the previous [[migration period|emigration of Germanic peoples]] toward the safer areas of Western and Southern Europe. The immigrating Slavs formed various small tribal organizations beginning in the 8th century, some of which coalesced later into larger, state-like ones.<ref name=\"KK 325\u2013352\"/><ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013167\"/> Beginning in the 7th century, these tribal units built many fortified structures with earth and wood walls and embankments, called [[gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]]s. Some of them were developed and inhabited, others had a very large empty area inside the walls.\n\nBy the 9th century, the West Slavs had settled the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]] in [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|Pomerania]], which subsequently developed into a commercial and military power.<ref name=\"UzP 142\u2013143\"/> Along the coastline, remnants of [[Scandinavia]]n settlements and [[Viking Age|emporia]] were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of [[Truso]],<ref name=\"Jagodzi\u0144ski\"/> located in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians]]. During the same time, the tribe of the [[Vistulans]] (''Wi\u015blanie''), based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.\n\nDuring the 10th century, the Lechitic [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]] (''Polanie'', lit. \"people of the open fields\") turned out to be of decisive historic importance. Initially based in the central Polish lowlands around [[Giecz]], [[Pozna\u0144]] and [[Gniezno]], the Polans went through a period of accelerated building of fortified settlements and territorial expansion beginning in the first half of the 10th century. Under duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] of the [[Piast dynasty]], the expanded Polan territory was converted to Christianity in 966, which is generally regarded the birth of the Polish state. The contemporary names of the realm, \"Mieszko's state\" or \"Gniezno state\", were dropped soon afterwards in favour of \"Poland\", a rendering of the Polans' tribal name. The Piast dynasty would continue to [[Piast Poland|rule Poland until the late 14th century]].<ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013167\"/><ref name=\"UzP 162\u2013163\"/>\n\n== Origin of the Slavic peoples ==\n\n=== Slavic beginnings of Poland ===\n\nThe origins of the [[Slavic peoples]], who arrived on Polish lands at the outset of the [[Middle Ages]] as representatives of the [[Early Slavs|Prague culture]], go back to the [[Kiev culture]], which formed beginning early in the 3rd century AD and is genetically derived from the Post-Zarubintsy [[Archaeological horizon|cultural horizon]] (Rakhny\u2013Ljutez\u2013Pochep material culture sphere)<ref name=\"KK 324\"/> and itself was one of the later post-[[Zarubintsy culture]] groups.<ref name=\"KK 232, 351\"/> Such an ethnogenetic relationship is apparent between the large Kiev culture population and the early (6th\u20137th centuries) Slavic settlements in the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] basins, but lacking between these Slavic settlements and the [[Poland in Antiquity|older local cultures]] within the same region, that ceased to exist beginning in the 400\u2013450 AD period.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/><ref name=\"UzP 125\u2013126\"/>\n\n=== Zarubintsy culture ===\n\n[[File:Rome and the Barbarians in Eastern and Central Europe around 100 AD by Shchukin.png|thumb|right|275px|Central and East European cultures ca. 100 AD. The [[Zarubintsy culture]] is shown expanding into the Post-Zarubintsy [[Archaeological horizon|horizon]] (red), the area where the Proto-Slavic people are thought to have formed.]]\n\nThe [[Zarubintsy culture]] circle, in existence roughly from 200 BC to 150 AD, extended along the middle and upper [[Dnieper]] and its tributary the [[Pripyat River]], but also left traces of settlements in parts of [[Polesie]] and the upper [[Bug River]] basin. The main distinguished local groups were the Polesie group, the Middle Dnieper group and the Upper Dnieper group. The Zarubintsy culture developed from the [[Milograd culture]] in the northern part of its range and from the local [[Scythians|Scythian]] populations in the more southern part. The Polesie group's origin was also influenced by the [[Pomeranian culture|Pomeranian]] and [[Jastorf culture]]s. The Zarubintsy culture and its beginnings were moderately affected by [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] and the [[Black Sea]] area (trade with the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek]] cities provided imported items) centers of civilization in the earlier stages, but not much by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influence later on, and accordingly its economic development was lagging behind that of other early Roman period cultures. Cremation of bodies was practiced, with the human remains and burial gifts including metal decorations, small in number and limited in variety, placed in pits.<ref name=\"KK 191, 212, 228\u2013230, 232, 281\"/>\n\n=== Kiev culture ===\n\nOriginating from the Post-Zarubintsy cultures and often considered the oldest Slavic culture, the [[Kiev culture]] functioned during the later Roman periods (end of 2nd through mid-5th century)<ref name=\"Parczewski\"/> north of the vast [[Chernyakhov culture]] territories, within the basins of the upper and middle Dnieper, [[Desna River|Desna]] and [[Seym River|Seym]] rivers. The [[archaeological culture|archeological cultural]] features of the Kiev sites show this culture to be identical or highly compatible (representing the same cultural model) with that of the 6th-century Slavic societies, including the settlements on the lands of today's Poland.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> The Kiev culture is known mostly from settlement sites; the burial sites, involving pit graves, are few and poorly equipped. Not many metal objects have been found, despite the known native production of iron and processing of other metals, including [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] coating technology. Clay vessels were made without the [[potter's wheel]]. The Kiev culture represented an intermediate level of development, between that of the cultures of the Central European Barbaricum, and the forest zone societies of the eastern part of the continent. The Kiev culture consisted of four local formations: The Middle Dnieper group, the Desna group, the Upper Dnieper group and the Dnieper-Don group. The general model of the Kiev culture is like that of the early Slavic cultures that were to follow and must have originated mainly from the Kiev groups, but evolved probably over a larger territory, stretching west to the base of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Eastern Carpathian Mountains]], and from a broader Post-Zarubintsy foundation. The Kiev culture and related groups expanded considerably after 375 AD, when the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] state,<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 243</ref> and more broadly speaking the Chernyakhov culture, were destroyed by the [[Huns]].<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 277, 303</ref><ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski p. 334</ref>{{Ref label|c|c|none}} This process was facilitated further and gained pace, involving at that time the Kiev's descendant cultures, when the Hun confederation itself broke down in the mid-5th century.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 281, 302, 303, 334, 351</ref><ref name=\"UzP 126\"/>\n\n=== Written sources ===\n\nThe eastern cradle of the Slavs is also directly confirmed by a written source. The anonymous author known as the [[Ravenna Cosmography|Cosmographer of Ravenna]] (c. 700) names [[Scythia]], a geographic region encompassing vast areas of eastern Europe,<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> as the place \"where the generations of the Sclaveni had their beginnings\".<ref name=\"UzP 126\"/> Scythia, \"stretching far and spreading wide\" in the eastern and southern directions, had at the west end, as seen at the time of [[Jordanes]]' writing (first half to mid-6th century) or earlier, \"the Germans and the river Vistula\".<ref name=\"Getica\"/> Jordanes places the Slavs in Scythia as well.<ref name=\"Getica\"/>\n\n=== Alternative point of view ===\n\nAccording to an alternative theory, popular in the earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures in the area of modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of [[Poland in Antiquity|earlier indigenous populations]], who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.<ref name=\"KK 325\u2013352\"/><ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013167\"/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nA 2011 article on the early Western Slavs states that the transitional period (of relative depopulation) is difficult to evaluate archeologically. Some believe that the Late Antique \"Germanic\" populations (in Poland late Przeworsk culture and others) abandoned East Central Europe and were replaced by the Slavs coming from the east, others see the \"Germanic\" groups as staying and becoming, or already being, Slavs. Current archeology, says the author, \"is unable to give a satisfying answer and probably both aspects played a role\". In terms of their origin, territorial and linguistic, \"Germanic\" groups should not be played off against \"Slavs\", as our current understanding of the terms may have limited relevance to the complex realities of the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages. Local languages in the region cannot be identified by archeological studies, and genetic evaluation of cremation burial remains has not been possible.<ref name=\"The Western Slavs of the Seventh to the Eleventh Century \u2013 An Archaeological Perspective\">{{cite news|publisher=[[History Compass]]|author=Sebastian Brather|author-link=Sebastian Brather|title=The Western Slavs of the Seventh to the Eleventh Century \u2013 An Archaeological Perspective|date=2011-06-02|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00779.x}}</ref>\n\n== Slavic differentiation and expansion; Prague culture ==\n\n=== Kolochin culture, Penkovka culture and Prague\u2013Korchak culture ===\n\nThe final process of the differentiation of the cultures recognized as early Slavic, the Kolochin culture] (over the territory of the Kiev culture), the [[Antes (people)|Penkovka culture]] and the [[Prague-Korchak culture]], took place during the end of the 4th and in the 5th century CE. Beyond the Post-Zarubintsy horizon, the expanding early Slavs took over much of the territories of the [[Chernyakhov culture]] and the [[Dacia]]n [[Carpathian Tumuli culture]]. As not all of the previous inhabitants from those cultures had left the area, they probably contributed some elements to the Slavic cultures.<ref name=\"Parczewski\"/>\n\nThe Prague culture developed over the western part of the Slavic expansion within the basins of the middle [[Dnieper River]], [[Pripyat River]] and upper [[Dniester]] up to the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and in southeastern Poland, i.e., the upper and middle [[Vistula]] basin. This culture was responsible for most of the growth in 6th and 7th centuries, by which time it also encompassed the middle [[Danube]] and middle [[Elbe]] basins.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> The Prague culture very likely corresponds to the Sclaveni referred to by [[Jordanes]], whose area he described as extending west to the Vistula sources. The Penkovka culture people inhabited the southeastern part, from [[Seversky Donets]] to the lower [[Danube]] (including the region where the Antes would be), and the Kolochin culture was located north of the more eastern area of the Penkovka culture (the upper [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and [[Desna River|Desna]] basins). The Korchak type designates the eastern part of the Prague-Korchak culture, which was somewhat less directly dependent on the mother Kiev culture than its two sister cultures because of its western expansion. The early 6th-century Slavic settlements covered an area three times the size of the Kiev culture region some hundred years earlier.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/><ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 327, 334, 351</ref>\n\n=== Early settlements, economy and burials in Poland ===\n\n[[File:Slavic archaeological cultures, beginning of 7th century.png|right|thumb|300px|Slavic [[archaeological culture]]s c. 700 AD]]\n\nIn Poland, the earliest archeological sites considered Slavic include a limited number of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area. It is on the basis of the different varieties of these basic clay pots and infrequent decorations that the three cultures are distinguished.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 333, 334</ref> The largest of the earliest Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in Bach\u00f3rz, [[Rzesz\u00f3w]] County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries. It consisted of 12 nearly square, partially dug-out houses, each covering the area of 6.2 to 19.8 (14.0 on the average) square meters. A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner, which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.<ref>The web site of the Institute of Archeology, [[Jagiellonian University]] \u2013 ''Bach\u00f3rz''</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 124, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\nPoorly developed handicraft and limited resources for metal working are characteristic of the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as can be found in 7th-century finds in Ha\u0107ki, [[Bielsk Podlaski]] County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the [[Krak\u00f3w]]-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igo\u0142omia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th\u2013 to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]] in [[Silesia]].<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 334\u2013337</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 123\u2013126, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref><ref name=\"S\u0142owianie nad Bzur\u0105\">''S\u0142owianie nad Bzur\u0105'' by [[Marek Dulinicz]] and [[Felix Biermann]], ''[[Archeologia \u017bywa]]'', issue 1 (16) 2001</ref>\n\nThe Slavic people cremated their dead, typical for the inhabitants of their region for centuries. The burials were usually single, the graves grouped in small cemeteries, with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground indentations. The number of burial sites found is small in relation to the known settlement density. The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation, hunting, fishing, gathering and cattle breeding (swine, sheep and goats bred to a lesser extent).<ref name=\"KK 337\"/>\n\n=== Geographic expansion in Poland and Central Europe ===\n\nThe earliest Slavic settlers from the east reached southeastern Poland in the second half of the 5th century, specifically the [[San River]] basin, then the upper [[Vistula]] regions, including the [[Krak\u00f3w]] area and [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] Valley. Single early sites are also known around [[Sandomierz]] and [[Lublin]] in [[Masovia]] and [[Upper Silesia]]. Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in [[Lower Silesia]]. In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. At the end of this century, or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached [[Western Pomerania]]. According to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Theophylact Simocatta]], the Slavs captured in [[Constantinople]] in 592 named the [[Baltic Sea]] coastal area as the place from which they originated.<ref>Michael and Mary Whitby (trans.), ''The History of Theophylact Simocatta: An English Translation with Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-19-822799-X}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology 20\u201321\"/>\n\nAs of that time and in the following decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of [[Greater Poland]], Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower [[Oder River]] made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin is the subject of debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzie\u0144 group of the [[Przeworsk culture]]. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical for the rest of the Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.<ref name=\"KK 337\"/><ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/>\n\nThis particular pattern of expansion into the lands of Poland and then Germany <ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 327, 337\u2013338</ref> was a part of the great Slavic migration during the 5th-7th centuries from originating lands in the east to various countries of Central and Southeastern Europe.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, pp. 337\u2013338</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 126\u2013127, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref> Another 6th-century route, more southern, took the Prague culture of the Slavs through [[Slovakia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]].  The Slavs also reached the eastern [[Alps]] and populated the [[Elbe]] and the [[Danube]] basins, from where they moved south to occupy the [[Balkans]] as far as [[Peloponnese]].<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/>\n\n=== Ancient and early Medieval written accounts of the Slavs ===\n\nBesides the Baltic [[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]] (see [[Poland in Antiquity]] article), ancient and medieval authors speak of the East European, or Slavic Venethi. It can be inferred from [[Tacitus]]' description in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' that his \"Venethi\" possibly lived around the middle [[Dnieper]] basin,<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 259, 350</ref> which in his times would correspond to the Proto-Slavic [[Zarubintsy culture|Zarubintsy]] cultural sphere. Jordanes, to whom the Venethi meant Slavs, wrote of past fighting between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the Venethi that took place during the third quarter of the 4th century in today's [[Ukraine]].<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 102, [[Tadeusz Makiewicz]]</ref> At that time, the Venethi therefore would have been people of the [[Kiev culture]]. The Venethi, Jordanes reported, \"now rage in war far and wide, in punishment for our sins\",<ref name=\"Getica\"/> and were at that time made obedient to the Gothic king [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]. Jordanes' 6th-century description of the \"populous race of the Venethi\"<ref name=\"Getica\"/> includes indications of their dwelling places in the regions near the northern ridge of the Carpathian Mountains and stretching from there \"almost endlessly\" east, while in the western direction reaching the sources of the Vistula. More specifically, he designates the area between the Vistula and the lower [[Danube]] as the country of the [[Sclaveni (military)|Sclaveni]]. \"They have swamps and forests for their cities\" (''hi paludes silvasque pro civitatibus habent''),<ref name=\"Getica\"/><ref>''[[Getica (Jordanes)|De origine actibusque Getarum]]'', the Latin Library at [[Ad Fontes Academy]] web page</ref> he added sarcastically. The \"bravest of these peoples\",<ref name=\"Getica\"/> the [[Antes (people)|Antes]], settled the lands between the [[Dniester]] and the [[Dnieper]] rivers. The Venethi were the third Slavic branch of an unspecified location (most likely of the Kolochin culture), as well as the overall designation for the totality of the Slavic peoples, who \"though off-shoots from one stock, have now three names\".<ref name=\"Getica\"/>\n\n[[Procopius]] in ''De Bello Gothico'' located the \"countless Antes tribes\" even further east, beyond the Dnieper.<ref name=\"UzP 122\"/> Together with the Sclaveni, they spoke the same language, of an \"unheard of barbarity\".<ref name=\"UzP 122\"/> According to Jordanes, the [[Heruli]] nation traveled in 512 across all of the Sclaveni peoples territories, and then west of there through a large expanse of unpopulated lands, as the Slavs were about to settle the western and northern parts of Poland in the decades to follow.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> All of the above is in good accordance with the findings of today's archeology.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 250, 329, 330, 333, 350, 352</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 122, 123, 126, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\nByzantine writers held the Slavs in low regard for the simple life they led and also for their supposedly limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already a threat to the Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. [[Procopius]], the anonymous author of ''[[Strategicon of Maurice|Strategicon]]'', and [[Theophylact Simocatta]] wrote at some length on how to deal with the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. [[John of Ephesus]] actually goes as far as saying in the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor [[Heraclius]].<ref name=\"Parczewski\"/><ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013127\"/>\n\nThe above-mentioned authors provide various details on the character, living conditions, social structure and economic activities of the early Slavic people, some of which are confirmed by the archeological discoveries in Poland, since the Slavic communities were quite similar all over their range.<ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013127\"/> Their uniform [[Proto-Slavic language|Old Slavic]] language remained in use until the 9th to 12th centuries, depending on the region. The Greek missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] from [[Thessaloniki]], where \"everybody fluently spoke Slavic\", were expected to be able to communicate in distant [[Moravia]] without any difficulty when sent there in 863 by the Byzantine ruler.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 124, 126, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\n===Invasions of the Avars in Europe and their presence in Poland===\n\nIn the 6th century, the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking nomadic [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] moved into the middle Danube area. Twice (in 562 and 566\u2013567), the Avars undertook military expeditions against the [[Franks]], and their routes went through the Polish lands. The Avar envoys bribed Slavic chiefs from the lands they did not control, including [[Pomerania]], to secure their participation in Avar raids, but other than that, the exact nature of their relations with the Slavs in Poland is not known. The Avars had some presence or contacts in Poland also in the 7th and 8th centuries, when they left artifacts in the Krak\u00f3w-Nowa Huta region and elsewhere, including a bronze belt decoration found in the [[Krakus Mound]]. This last item, from the turn of the 8th century, is used to date the mound itself.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 141, [[Zofia Kurnatowska]]</ref><ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, pp. 338\u2013339</ref><ref name=\"UzP 128\u2013129\"/>{{Ref label|d|d|none}}\n\n== Tribal differentiation ==\n{{wide image|Settlement in Strad\u00f3w (IX Century A.D.), Poland.JPG|1066px|Settlement in Strad\u00f3w (9th century AD), the largest stronghold in contemporary Poland|center|dir=ltr}}\n[[File:Pagan cult wall (VIII-IX Century B.C.) in \u0141ysa G\u00f3ra, Poland.JPG|400px|thumb|Pagan cult wall (8-9th century BC) in [[\u0141ysa G\u00f3ra]]]]\n\n=== 8th-century settlements ===\n\nWith the major population shifts of the Slavic migrations completed, the 8th century brought a measure of stability to the Slavic people settled in Poland. About one million people actively utilized no more than 20\u201325% of the land; the rest was mainly forest. Normal settlements, with the exception of a few fortifications and cult venues, were limited to lowland areas below 350 meters above the sea level. Most villages built without artificial defensive structures were located within valley areas of natural bodies of water. The Slavs were very familiar with the water environment and used it as natural defense.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\nThe living and economic activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot. The larger settlements could have had over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents, but more typically there were just several homes with no more than 30 inhabitants. From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses. As the Germanic people before them, the Slavs left vacant regions between developed areas for separation from strangers and to avoid conflicts, especially along the limits of their tribal territories.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\n=== Gord construction ===\n\n[[File:Slavic peoples 9c map.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Slavic peoples]] around the 8th and 9th centuries]]\n\nThe [[Polish tribes]] did build more imposing structures than the simple dwellings in their small communities: fortified settlements and other reinforced enclosures of the [[gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]] (Polish \"gr\u00f3d\") type. Those were established on naturally suitable, defense-enhancing sites beginning in the late 6th or 7th century. Szeligi near [[P\u0142ock]] and Ha\u0107ki are the early examples.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 339</ref> A large-scale building effort took place in the 8th century. The gords were differently designed and of various sizes, from small to impressively massive. Ditches, walls, palisades and embankments were used to strengthen the perimeter, which often involved a  complicated earthwork besides wood and stone construction. Gords of the tribal period were irregularly distributed across the country (there were fewer larger ones in [[Lesser Poland]],but more smaller ones in central and northern Poland),<ref name=\"Chronology 22\"/> and could cover an area from 0.1 to 25 [[hectare]]s. They could have a simple or multi-segment architecture and be protected by fortifications of different types. Some were permanently occupied by a substantial number of people or by a chief and his cohort of armed men, while others were utilized as refuges to protect the local population in case of external danger. Beginning in the 9th century, the gords became the nuclei of future urban developments, attracting tradesmen of all kinds, especially in strategic locations. Gords erected in the 8th century have been researched extensively, for example the ones in [[Mi\u0119dzy\u015bwie\u0107]] ([[Cieszyn County]], Go\u0142\u0119szyce tribe) and Naszacowice ([[Nowy S\u0105cz]] County). The last one was destroyed and rebuilt four times, with the final reconstruction completed after 989.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\nA monumental and technically complex border protection area gord of over 3 hectares in size was built around 770\u2013780 in [[Trzcinica, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Trzcinica]] near [[Jas\u0142o]] on the site of an old [[Bronze and Iron Age Poland|Bronze Age era]] stronghold, probably the seat of a local ruler and his garrison. Thousands of relics were found there, including a silver treasure of 600 pieces. The gord was set afire several times and ultimately destroyed during the first half of the 11th century.<ref>[[Muzeum Podkarpackie]] (Sub-Carpathian Museum) in [[Krosno]] web site, [[Jan Gancarski]]</ref>{{Ref label|e|e|none}}\n\nThis larger scale building activity, from the mid-8th century on, was a manifestation of the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on a new level. They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later [[Vistulans|Vistulan]] gords in [[Lesser Poland]] are a good example. The threat coming from the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] state in [[Pannonia]] could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.<ref>[[Jerzy Wyrozumski]] \u2013 ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'' (VIII w. \u2013 1370) (History of Piast Poland (8th century \u2013 1370)), [[Fogra]], Krak\u00f3w 1999, {{ISBN|83-85719-38-5}}, p. 47</ref>\n\n=== Society organized into larger tribal units ===\n\nFrom the 8th century on, the Slavs in Poland increasingly organized themselves in larger structures known as \"great tribes,\" either through voluntary or forced association. The population was primarily involved in agricultural pursuits. Fields were cultivated as well as gardens within settlements. Plowing was done using oxen and wooden plows reinforced with iron. Forest burning was used to increase the arable area, but also to provide fertilizer, as the ashes lasted in that capacity for several seasons. Rotation of crops was practiced as well as the winter/spring crop system. After several seasons of exploitation, the land was being left idle to regain fertility. Wheat, millet and rye were most important crops; other cultivated plant species included oat, barley, pea, broad bean, lentil, flax and hemp, as well as apple, pear, plum, peach and cherry trees in fruit orchards. Beginning in the 8th century, swine gradually became economically more important than cattle; sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, chickens, geese and ducks were also kept. The agricultural practices of the Slavs are known from archeological research, which documents progressive increases over time in arable area and resulting deforestation,<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 148, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref> and from written reports provided by [[Abraham ben Jacob|Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]], a 10th-century [[Jew]]ish traveler. Ibrahim described also other features of Slavic life, for example the use of steam baths. The existence of bath structures has been confirmed by archeology.<ref>''Nauka w Polsce'' (Science in Poland), internet service of the [[Polish Press Agency]], Sept. 6, 2010 article by Szymon Zdzieb\u0142owski</ref> An anonymous [[Arab]] writer from the turn of the 10th century mentions that the Slavic people made an alcoholic beverage out of honey and their celebrations were accompanied by music played on the lute, tambourines and wind instruments.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n  \nGathering, hunting and fishing were still essential as sources of food and materials such as hide or fur. The forest was also exploited as a source of building materials such as wood. In addition, wild forest bees were kept there, and the forest could be used as a place of refuge.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 49</ref> Until the 9th century, the population was separated from the main centers of civilization and self-sufficient with primitive, local community and household-based manufacturing. Specialized craftsmen existed only in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing, and pottery; the few luxury items used were imports. From the 7th century on, modestly decorated ceramics were made with the [[potter's wheel]]. 7th\u2013 to 9th-century collections of objects have been found in Bonikowo and Bruszczewo, [[Ko\u015bcian]] County (iron spurs, knives, clay containers with some ornamentation) and in the Krak\u00f3w-Nowa Huta region (weapons and utensils in Plesz\u00f3w and Mogi\u0142a), among other places. Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears, bows and wooden shields. Axes were used later, and still swords of the types popular throughout 7th\u2013 to 9th-century Europe were also used. Independent of distant powers, the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life, but at the cost of some backwardness in civilization.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\nA qualitative change took place in the 9th century, when the Polish lands were crossed again by long-distance trade routes. [[Pomerania]] become a part of the Baltic trade zone, while [[Lesser Poland]] participated in trade centered in the Danubian countries. In the Upper Vistula basin, Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins, often cut into pieces, \"grzywna\" iron coin equivalents (of the type used in [[Great Moravia]]) and even linen cloths served as currency.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n \nThe basic social unit was the nuclear family, consisting of parents and their children, which had to fit in a dwelling area of several to 25 square meters. The \"big family,\" a patriarchal, multi-generational group of related families with the meaning of a kin or clan, was of declining importance during this period. A larger group was needed in the past (5th\u20137th centuries) for forest clearing and burning undertakings, when farming communities had to shift from location to location; in the 8th-century phase of agriculture, a family was sufficient to take care of their arable land.<ref>Jerzy Wyrozumski \u2013 ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), Pa\u0144stwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe ([[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN]]), Warszawa 1986, {{ISBN|83-01-03732-6}}, p. 73</ref> A concept of agricultural land ownership was gradually developing, at this point a family, not individual prerogative. Several or more clan territories were grouped into a neighborhood association, or \"opole\", which established a rudimentary self-government. Such a community was the owner of forested land, pastures, bodies of water and within it took place the first organization around common projects and the related development of political power. A big and resourceful opole could become, by extending its possessions, a proto-state entity vaguely referred to as a tribe.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 50, concerning land ownership and evolution of \"opole\"</ref> The tribe was the top level of this structure. It would contain several opoles and control a region of up to about 1500 square kilometers, where internal relationships were arbitrated and external defense organized.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n \nA general assembly of all tribesmen took care of the most pressing of issues. [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] wrote in the early 11th century of the [[Veleti]], a tribe of [[Polabian Slavs]], with a report that their assembly kept deliberating till everybody agreed, but this \"war democracy\" was gradually being replaced by a government system in which the tribal elders and rulers had the upper hand. This development facilitated the coalescing of tribes into \"great tribes,\" some of which under favorable conditions would later become tribal states. The communal and tribal democracy, with self-imposed contributions by the community members, survived in small entities and local territorial subunits the longest. On a larger scale, it was being replaced by the rule of able leaders and then dominant families, ultimately leading inevitably to hereditary transition of supreme power, mandatory taxation, service etc.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 50\u201352</ref> When social and economic evolution reached this level, the concentration of power was facilitated and made possible to sustain by parallel development of a professional military force (called at this stage \"dru\u017cyna\") at the ruler's or chief's disposal.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/><ref>Jerzy Wyrozumski \u2013 ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'', p. 66</ref>\n\n=== Burials and religion ===\n\nBurial customs, at least in southern Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes was placed on the mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to [[Arab]] testimonies (one from the end of the 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by [[Theophylact Simocatta]].<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 125, 133, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Procopius]], the Slavs believed in one god, the creator of lightning and master of the entire universe, to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called [[Svarog]] throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 56</ref> Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and appeased by offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 125, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 134, [[Stanis\u0142aw Rosik]]</ref>\n\nThe Slavs erected sanctuaries, created statues and other sculptures, including the four-faced [[Svetovid]], whose carvings symbolize various aspects of the Slavic cosmology model. One 9th-century specimen from the [[Zbruch River]] in modern Ukraine, found in 1848, is on display at the Archeological Museum in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Many of the sacred locations and objects were identified outside Poland, for example in northeastern Germany or Ukraine. In Poland, religious activity sites have been investigated in northwestern Pomerania, including [[Szczecin]], where a three-headed deity once stood, and the [[Wolin]] island, where 9th\u2013 to 11th-century cult figurines were found.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 134\u2013135, Stanis\u0142aw Rosik</ref> Archeologically confirmed cult places and figures have also been researched at several other locations.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 54\u201359</ref>\n\n== Early Slavic states and other 9th-century developments ==\n\n=== Samo's realm ===\n\nThe first Slavic state-like entity, the realm of King [[Samo]], originally a [[Franks|Frankish]] trader, flourished  close to Poland in [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], parts of [[Pannonia]] and more southern regions between the [[Oder]] and [[Elbe]] rivers. It during the period 623\u2013658.<ref>''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, p. 21, Jacek Poleski</ref> Samo became a Slavic leader by helping the Slavs defend themselves successfully against [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] assailants. What Samo led was probably a loose alliance of tribes, and it fell apart after his death. Slavic [[Carantania]], centered on Krnski Grad (now [[Maria Saal|Karnburg]] in [[Austria]]), was more of a real state, developed possibly from one part of the disintegrating Samo's kingdom, but lasted under a native dynasty throughout the 8th century and became [[Christianity|Christianized]].<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== Great Moravia and the establishment of a written Slavic language ===\n\n[[File:West slavs 9th-10th c..png|thumb|right|325px|The lands of the [[West Slavs]] as specified in a historical map often reproduced in the 20th century]]\nLarger scale state-generating processes developed in Slavic areas in the 9th century. [[Great Moravia]], the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great Moravia included what is now [[Moravia]] and western [[Slovakia]], plus parts of [[Bohemia]], [[Pannonia]] and southern regions of [[Lesser Poland]]. The glory of the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/> Such finds do not extend to the lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia took place during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] at the end of the 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions, it ceased to exist entirely.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\nIn 831, [[Mojmir I of Moravia|Mojmir I]] was baptized, and his Moravian state became a part of the [[Bavaria]]n [[Passau]] diocese. Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well as political independence from [[East Francia|East Frankish]] influence, his successor [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] asked the Byzantine emperor [[Michael III]] for missionaries. As a result, [[Cyril and Methodius]] arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there. To further their goals, the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language: [[Old Church Slavonic]], which employed the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] created by them. They translated the [[Bible]] and other church texts into this language, thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== The Czech state ===\n\nThe fall of Great Moravia made room for the expansion of the [[History of the Czech lands in the Middle Ages|Czech]] or [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]n state, which likewise incorporated some of the Polish lands. The founder of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], Prince [[Bo\u0159ivoj I, Duke of Bohemia|Bo\u0159ivoj]], was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in [[Prague]]. His son and successor [[Spytihn\u011bv I, Duke of Bohemia|Spytihn\u011bv]] was baptized in [[Regensburg]] in the Latin rite, which marks the early stage of [[East Francia|East Frankish]]/German influence in Bohemian affairs, which was destined to be decisive.<ref>''[[Europe: A History]]'' by [[Norman Davies]], p. 324, 1998 New York, HarperPerennial, {{ISBN|0-06-097468-0}}</ref> Borivoj's grandson Prince [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], the future Czech martyr and patron saint, was killed, probably in 935, by his brother [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus]]. Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes and most likely dominated the [[Vistulans|Vistulan]] and [[Lendians|Lendian]] tribes of Lesser Poland and at least parts of [[Silesia]].<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== 9th-century Polish lands ===\n\nIn the 9th century the Polish lands were still on the peripheries of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of progress did take place in levels of civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the [[Carolingian Empire]]; objects crafted there have occasionally been found.<ref name=\"Chronology 22\"/><ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 52\u201354</ref> Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes. The names of some of them, mostly from the western part of the country, are known from written sources, especially a [[Latin]] document written in the mid-9th century by the anonymous [[Bavarian Geographer]]. During this period, smaller tribal structures were disintegrating while larger ones were being established in their place.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski, p. 48\"/>\n\nCharacteristic of the turn of the 10th century in most Polish tribal settlement areas was a particular intensification of [[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]] building activity. The gords were the centers of social and political life. Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them. Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== The Vistulan state ===\n\n[[File:Kopiec Krakusa2.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Krakus Mound]]]]\n\nA major development of the 9th century period concerns the somewhat enigmatic Wi\u015blanie, or [[Vistulans]] (Bavarian Geographer's ''Vuislane'') tribe. The Vistulans of western Lesser Poland, mentioned in several contemporary written sources, were already a large tribal union in the first half of the 9th century.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 66\u201367\"/> In the second half of the century, they were evolving into a super-tribal state until their efforts were terminated by more powerful neighbors from the south. [[Krak\u00f3w]], the main town of the Vistulans, with its [[Wawel]] gord, was located along a major \"international\" trade route. The main Vistulan-related archeological find is a late 9th-century treasure of iron-ax shaped [[Grzywna (currency unit)|grzywna]]s, well known as currency units in Great Moravia. They were discovered in 1979 in a wooden chest below the basement of a medieval house on Kanonicza Street in Krak\u00f3w near the [[Vistula]] River and [[Wawel]] Hill. The total weight of the iron material is 3630 kilograms and the individual bars of various sizes (4212 of them) were bound in bundles, which suggests that the package was being readied for transportation.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 140\u2013141, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref> Other finds include the 8th-century [[Krakus Mound|Krakus]], [[Wanda Mound|Wanda]] and other large burial mounds, and the remnants of several gords)<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 52</ref>\n\nVistulan gords, built from the mid-8th century on, were typically very large, often over 10 hectares in size. About 30 big ones are known. The 9th-century gords in Lesser Poland and in Silesia were likely built as a defense against Great Moravian military expansion.<ref>''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, p. 24, Jacek Poleski</ref> The largest one, in Strad\u00f3w, [[Kazimierza Wielka]] County, had an area of 25 hectares and walls or embankments 18 meters high, but parts of this giant structure were probably built later. The gords were often located along the northern slope of the western Carpathian Mountains, on hills or hillsides. The buildings inside the walls were sparsely located or altogether absent, so for the most part, the role of the gords seems to have been something other than that of settlements or administrative centers.<ref name=\"Roszko\"/>\n\nLarge mounds up to 50 meters in diameter are found not only in Krak\u00f3w, but also in [[Przemy\u015bl]] and [[Sandomierz]]. among other places (about 20 total).<ref name=\"Roszko\"/> They were probably funeral locations of rulers or chiefs, with the actual burial site, on the top of the mound, long lost.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 133, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref> Besides the mounds, the degree of gord development and the grzywna treasure point to Krak\u00f3w as the main center of Vistulan power (instead of [[Wi\u015blica]], as also suspected in the past).<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 66\u201367\"/>\n\nThe most important written references to Vistulans come from ''The Life of [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|Saint Methodius]]'', also known as \"The [[Pannonian Basin|Pannonian]] Legend\", most likely written by disciples of Methodius right after his death in 885.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 66</ref> The fragment speaks of a very powerful pagan prince who resided in the Vistulan country, reviled the Christians and caused them great harm. He was warned by emissaries speaking on behalf of the missionary and advised to reform and voluntarily accept baptism in his own homeland. Otherwise, it was predicted, he would be forced to do so in a foreign land. According to the Pannonian Legend, that is exactly what eventually did happen. This passage is widely interpreted as an indication that the Vistulans were invaded and overrun by the army of [[Great Moravia]] and their pagan prince captured. This would have had to have happened during Methodius' second stay in Moravia, between 873 and 885, during the reign of Svatopluk I.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 66\u201367\"/>\n\n[[File:Wislica grodzisko 20070825 1456.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|A [[Vistulans|Vistulan]] stronghold in [[Wi\u015blica]] once stood here]]\n\nA further elaboration on this story is possibly found in a chronicle of [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]] written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of [[Alexander the Great]]. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia as if it were a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Krak\u00f3w area lands and [[Silesia]], in the process leveling Krak\u00f3w's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.<ref name=\"Roszko\"/>\n\nEast of the Vistulans, eastern Lesser Poland was the territory of the [[Lendians|Lendian]] tribe (L\u0119dzianie, the Bavarian Geographer's \"Lendizi\"). In the mid-10th century [[Constantine VII]] wrote their name as ''Lendzaneoi''.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski, p. 48\"/> The Lendians had to be a very substantial tribe, since the names for Poland in the Lithuanian and Hungarian languages and for the Poles in medieval [[Ruthenia]]n all begin with the letter \"L\" and are derived from the name of this tribe. The Poles historically have also referred to themselves as \"[[Lechitic languages|Lechici]]\". After the fall of Great Moravia, the [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] controlled at least part of the territory of the Lendians.<ref name=\"UzP 147\"/> They were conquered by [[Kievan Rus']] during 930\u2013940. At the end of the 10th century, the Lendian lands became divided; the western part was taken by Poland, the eastern portion retained by Kievan Rus'.<ref>''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, pp. 25\u201326, Jacek Poleski</ref>\n\nThe Vistulans were probably also subjected to Magyar raids as an additional layer of embankments was often added to the gord fortifications in the early part of the 10th century. In the early or mid-10th century, the Vistulan entity, like Silesia, was incorporated by [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia]] into the Czech state.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski, p. 48\"/> This association turned out to be beneficial in terms of economic development, because Krak\u00f3w was an important station on the [[Prague]]\u2014[[Kiev]] trade route. The first known Christian church structures were erected on Wawel Hill. Later in the 10th century, under uncertain circumstances, but in a peaceful way (the gord network suffered no damage on this occasion), the Vistulans became a part of the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] Polish state.\n\n=== The Baltic coast ===\n\nIn terms of economic and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|Pomerania]]. It was also characterized by the most extensive contacts with the external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural richness and diversity. Pomerania was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as [[Wolin]], [[Pyrzyce]] or [[Szczecin]]. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the [[Velunzani]] (\"Uelunzani\") and [[Pyrzyce|Pyritzans]] (\"Prissani\") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite the high level of economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in [[Farther Pomerania]]n societies, except for the [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]] city-state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 136\u2013140, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe Wolin settlement was established on the island of the same name in the late 8th century. Located at the mouth of the [[Oder River]], Wolin from the beginning was involved with long distance [[Baltic Sea]] trade. The settlement, thought to be identical with both [[Vineta]] and [[Jomsborg]], was pagan, multiethnic, and readily kept accepting newcomers, especially craftsmen and other professionals, from all over the world. Being located on a major intercontinental sea route, it soon became a major European industrial and trade power. Writing in the 11th century, [[Adam of Bremen]] recognized Wolin as one of the largest European cities, inhabited by honest, good-natured and hospitable Slavic people, together with other nationalities, from [[Greece|Greeks]] to barbarians, including the [[Saxony|Saxons]], as long as they did not demonstrate their Christianity too openly.<ref name=\"UzP 142\u2013143\"/>\n\nWolin was the major stronghold of the Volinian tribal territory, comprising [[Wolin|the island]] and a broad stretch of the adjacent mainland, with its frontier guarded by a string of gords. The city's peak of prosperity occurred around and after year 900, when a new seaport was built (the municipal complex had now four of them) and the metropolitan area was secured by walls and embankments. The archeological findings there include a great variety of imported goods (even from the [[Far East]]) and locally manufactured products and raw materials; amber and precious metals figure prominently, as jewelry was one of the mainstay economic activities of the Wolinian elite.<ref name=\"UzP 142\u2013143\"/>\n\n[[Truso]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] was another [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaport and trade emporium known from the reworking of [[Orosius]]' [[universal history]] by [[Alfred the Great]]. King Alfred included a description of a voyage undertaken around 890 by [[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] from the [[Denmark|Danish]] port of [[Hedeby]] to Truso, which is located near the mouth of the [[Vistula]]. Wulfstan gave a rather detailed description of the location of Truso, within the land of the [[Aesti]], yet close to the Slavic areas west of the Vistula. Truso's actual site was discovered in 1982 at Jan\u00f3w Pomorski, near [[Elbl\u0105g]].<ref name=\"Jagodzi\u0144ski\">''Truso'' by [[Marek Jagodzi\u0144ski]] of the Archeological-Historical  Museum in Elbl\u0105g, from Pradzieje.pl web site</ref>\n\nEstablished as a seaport by the [[Vikings]] and Danish traders at the end of the 8th century in the [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] border area previously already explored by the [[Scandinavia]]ns, Truso lasted as a major city and commercial center until the early 11th century, when it was destroyed and replaced in that capacity by [[Gda\u0144sk]]. The settlement covered an area of 20 [[hectare]]s and consisted of a two-dock seaport, the craft-trade portion, and the peripheral residential development, all protected by a wood and earth bulwark separating it from the mainland. The port-trade and craftsmen zones were themselves separated by a fire control ditch with water flowing through it. There were several rows of houses, including long Viking hall structures, waterside warehouses, market areas and wooden beam covered streets. Numerous relics were found there, including weights used also as currency units, coins (from [[England|English]] to [[Arab]]) and workshops processing metal, jewelry or large quantities of amber. Remnants of long Viking boats were also found, the whole complex being a testimony to Viking preoccupation with commerce, the mainstay of their activities around the Baltic Sea region. The multi-ethnic Truso had extensive trade contacts not only with distant lands and Scandinavia, but also the Slavic areas located to the south and west of it, from where ceramics and other products were transported along the Vistula in river crafts. Ironically, Truso's sudden destruction by fire and subsequent disappearance was apparently a result of a Viking raid.<ref>''Truso \u2013 zaginiony port'' by [[Andrzej Markert]] from \"Sprawy nauki\" web site</ref><ref>''Truso \u2013 emporium Wiking\u00f3w'' an interview with Marek Jagodzi\u0144ski by Arkadiusz Szaraniec from \"Travel Polska\" web site</ref>{{Ref label|f|f|none}}\n\nThis connection to the Baltic trade zone led to an establishment of inner-Slavic long-distance trade routes. Lesser Poland participated in exchange centered in the Danubian countries. Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins, often cut into pieces, \"grzywna\" iron coin equivalents (of the type used in Great Moravia) in the Upper Vistula basin and even linen cloths served as currency.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\n=== Magyar intrusion ===\n\nThe [[Magyars]] were at first yet another wave of nomadic invaders. Of the [[Uralic languages]] family, coming from northwestern [[Siberia]], they migrated south and west, occupying the [[Pannonian Basin]] from the end of the 9th century. From there, until the second half of the 10th century, when they were forced to settle, they raided and pillaged vast areas of Europe, including Poland. A saber and ornamental elements were found in a Hungarian warrior's grave from the first half of the 10th century in the [[Przemy\u015bl]] area.<ref name=\"UzP 128\u2013129\"/>\n\nGeographically, the Magyar invasions interfered with the previously highly influential contacts between Central Europe and centers of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Christianity|Christianity]]. It may have been the decisive factor that steered Poland toward the Western (Latin) [[Western Christianity|branch of Christianity]] by the time of its adoption in 966.<ref>''A Traveller's History of Poland'', by [[John Radzilowski]], p. 16; Northampton, Mass.: Interlink Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-56656-655-X}}</ref>\n\n== 10th-century developments in Greater Poland; Mieszko's state ==\n\n=== Tribal Greater Poland ===\n\nThe 10th century brought a notable development in the form of settlement stability on Polish lands. Short-lived prehistoric settlements gradually gave way to villages on fixed sites. The number of villages grew with time, but their sites rarely shifted. The population distribution patterns established from that century on are evident on today's landscape.<ref name=\"Investigations\"/>   \n \nSources from the 9th and 10th centuries make no mention of the [[Polans (western)|Polan]] (Polanie) tribe. The closest thing would be the huge (400 gords) ''Glopeani'' tribe of the [[Bavarian Geographer]], whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake [[Gop\u0142o]], but archeological investigations cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gop\u0142o area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle [[Obra River]] basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the [[Warta River]]. There was the [[Gniezno]] area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]] Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the [[Piast]] House, which resulted in the early part of the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 141, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== Mieszko's state and its origins ===\n\nWhat was later to be called the Gniezno state, also known as [[Mieszko I|Mieszko]]'s state, was first expanded at the expense of the subdued tribes in the era of Mieszko's father and grandfather. Writing around 965 or 966 [[Abraham ben Jacob|Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]] described the country of Mieszko, \"the king of the North\",{{Ref label|g|g|none}} as the most wide-ranging of the Slavic lands.<ref name=\"UzP 146\"/> Mieszko, the ruler of the Slavs, was also mentioned as such at that time by [[Widukind of Corvey]] in his ''[[Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres|Res gestae saxonicae]]''. In its mature form, this state included the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] lands between the [[Oder River|Oder]] and [[Bug River|Bug]] rivers and between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the economically crucial mouth areas of the [[Vistula]] and [[Oder River|Oder]] rivers, as well as [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Silesia]].<ref name=\"UzP 146\"/><ref name=\"UzP 144\"/>\n\nThe name of Poles (Polanians, Polyans, Polans) appears in writing for the first time around year 1000, just like the country's name Poland (Latinized as Polonia). \"[[Polans (western)|Polanie]]\" was possibly the name given by later historians to the inhabitants of Greater Poland (a presumed tribe not mentioned in earlier sources). 10th-century inhabitants of Greater Poland would originate from tribes not known by name that were instrumental in bringing about the establishment of the Polish state; one such tribe had to constitute the immediate power base of Mieszko's predecessors, if not Mieszko himself.<ref name=\"UzP 146\"/>\n\n=== The account of Gallus Anonymus vs. archeology ===\n\nIn the early 12th century, the chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]] wrote down or invented a legend about the [[Piast dynasty]]. Amid miraculous details, the story offers the names of the supposed ancestors of the royal family, beginning with a man named [[Cho\u015bcisko]], the father of the central figure [[Piast the Wheelwright]], who was a humble farmer living in Gniezno and married to [[Rzepicha|Rzepka]]. According to Gallus, the male heads of the Piast clan following after him were [[Siemowit]], [[Lestek]], [[Siemomys\u0142]] and [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the first \"Piast\" known with historic certainty. Gallus expressed his own misgivings concerning the trustworthiness of the royal story he passed on, but he did consider the sequence of the last three names of Mieszko's predecessors to be reliable.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nThe results of archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland are at odds with the timing of this story. There was no Gniezno settlement in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only at the turn of the 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would rally the local population around its building and defense.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 146\u2013147, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== The early Piast state and its expansion ===\n[[File:Giecz grodzisko.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Remnants of the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] [[grad (Slavic settlement)|gord]] in [[Giecz]]]]\n\nUnder the old tribal system, the tribal assembly elected a chief in case of an external threat to lead the defense effort, and it was a temporarily granted authority. The Piast clan was able to replace this practice in the Gniezno area with a hereditary ruler, in line with trends in other locations at the time. This allowed the Piast clan to create a state that they could over generations.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 147\u2013148, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe development of the Piast state can be traced to some degree by following the disappearance of the old tribal [[grad (Slavic settlement)|gords]], many of them built in Greater Poland during the later part of the 9th century and soon thereafter, which were destroyed by the advancing Gniezno tribal population. The gords in Sp\u0142awie, [[Wrze\u015bnia]] County and in Daleszyn, [[Gosty\u0144]] County, for example, both built soon after 899, were attacked and taken over by the Piast state forces, the first one burned during the initial period of the armed expansion. The old gords were often rebuilt or replaced beginning in the first decades of the 10th century by new, large and massively reinforced Piast gords. Connected by water communication lines, the powerful gords of the mid-10th century served as the main concentrations of forces of the emerging state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 147\u2013149, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nParallel with the gord building activity of ca. 920-50, the Piasts undertook military expansion by crossing the [[Warta]] River and moving south and west within the [[Oder River]] basin. The entire network of tribal gords between the [[Obra River|Obra]] and [[Barycz (river)|Barycz]] rivers, among other places, was eliminated.<ref name=\"JB\"/><ref>''My nie z Gniezna, ale z Giecza'' by Piotr Bojarski, Gazeta Wyborcza July 2, 2007</ref> The conquered population was often resettled to central Greater Poland, which resulted in partial depopulation of previously well-developed regions. At the end of this stage of the Piast state formation new Piast gords were built in the (north) [[Note\u0107]] River area and other outlying areas of the annexed lands, for example in [[Santok]] and [[\u015arem]] around 970. During the following decade the job of unifying the core of the early Piast state was finished\u2014besides Greater Poland with [[Kujawy]] it included also much of central Poland. [[Masovia]] and parts of [[Pomerania]] found themselves increasingly under the Piast influence, while the southbound expansion was for the time being stalled, because large portions of Lesser Poland and Silesia were controlled by the Czech state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 148\u2013149, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe expanding Piast state developed a professional military force. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Mieszko collected taxes in the form of weights used for trading and spent those taxes as monthly pay for his warriors. He had three thousand heavily armored mounted soldiers alone, whose quality according to Ibrahim was very impressive. Mieszko provided for all their equipment and needs, even military pay for their children regardless of their gender, from the moment they were born. This force was supported by a much greater number of foot fighters.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 193\u2013194, Zofia Kurnatowska, Marek Derwich</ref> Numerous armaments were found in the Piast gords, many of them of foreign, e.g. [[Franks|Frankish]] or [[Scandinavia]]n origin. Mercenaries from these regions, as well as [[Germany|German]] and [[Normans|Norman]] knights, constituted a significant element of Mieszko's elite fighting guard.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 149\u2013150, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== Revenue generating measures and conquests ===\n\nTo sustain this military machine and meet other state expenses, large amounts of revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, [[Prague]] in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities in this part of Europe. From [[Krak\u00f3w]], the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. ''The Life of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]]'', written at the end of the 10th century by [[John Canaparius]], records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time.<ref name=\"UzP 150\"/> Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century [[Gniezno Doors]]. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and Central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.<ref name=\"UzP 150\"/>\n\nMieszko thus strove to subdue [[Pomerania]] at the [[Baltic coast]]. The area was the site of wealthy trade emporia, frequently visited by traders, especially from the east, west and north. Mieszko had every reason to believe that great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as [[Wolin]], [[Szczecin]] and [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]].<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 150\u2013151, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe Piast state reached the mouth of the [[Vistula]] first. Based on the investigations of the gords erected along the middle and lower Vistula, it appears that the lower Vistula waterway was under Piast control from about the mid-10th century. A powerful gord built in [[Gda\u0144sk]], under Mieszko at the latest, solidified Piast rule over [[Pomerelia]]. However, the mouth of the [[Oder River]] was firmly controlled by the [[Jomsvikings]] and the [[Volinians]], who were allied with the [[Veleti]].<ref name=\"Polityka\"/> \"The Veleti are fighting Mieszko\", reported Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, \"and their military might is great\".<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/> [[Widukind of Corvey|Widukind]] wrote about events of 963 that  involved the person of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[count]] [[Wichmann the Younger]], an adventurer exiled from his country. According to Widukind, \"Wichmann went to the barbarians (probably the Veleti or the Wolinians) and leading them (...) defeated Mieszko twice, killed his brother, and acquired a great deal of spoils\".<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/> [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] also reports that Mieszko with his people became subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] in 963, together with other Slavic entities such as the [[Sorbs|Lusatians]] who were forced into subjection by the powerful [[Margrave]] [[Gero]] of the [[Saxon Eastern March]].<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/>\n\n=== Mieszko's relationship with Emperor Otto I ===\n\nSeries of military reverses and detrimental relationships, which involved the Czech [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslids]] allied with the Veleti besides rivals, compelled Mieszko to seek the support of the German Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]]. After the contacts were made, Widukind described Mieszko as \"a friend of the emperor\".<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/> A pact was negotiated and finalized no later than 965. The price Mieszko had to pay for the imperial protection was acceptance of the status of the emperor's [[vassal]]. He paid him tribute from the lands up to the [[Warta River]] and very likely also made a promise to accept Christianity.<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/>\n\n=== Mieszko's acceptance of Christianity ===\n\nIn response to immediate practical concerns, the [[Christianity|Christian]] Church was installed in Poland in its Western [[Latin Rite]],{{Ref label|h|h|none}} an act that brought Mieszko's country into sphere of ancient [[Mediterranean]] culture. Of the issues requiring urgent attention, the preeminent one was the increasing pressure of the eastbound expansion of the German state (between the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder River|Oder]] rivers) and its plans to control the parallel expansion of the Church through the [[Archbishop|archdiocese]] in [[Magdeburg]], the establishment of which was finalized in 968.<ref name=\"UzP 144\"/><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 154, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe so-called [[Baptism of Poland]] and the attendant processes did not take place through Mieszko's German connections. At that time, Mieszko was in the process of fixing an uneasy relationship with the Bohemian state of [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]]. The difficulties were caused mainly by Czech cooperation with the [[Veleti]]. Already in 964, the two parties arrived at an agreement on that and other issues.<ref>[[J.A. Sobiesiak]] \u2013 ''Boles\u0142aw II Przemy\u015blida'' ([[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus II the Pious]]), p. 89, Avalon 2006</ref> In 965, Mieszko married Boleslaus' daughter [[Doubravka of Bohemia|Doubravka]]. Mieszko's chosen Christian princess, a woman possibly in her twenties,<ref>[[Jerzy Strzelczyk]] \u2013 ''Boles\u0142aw Chrobry'' ([[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]])'', p. 15, Pozna\u0144 2003</ref> was a devout Christian and Mieszko's own conversion had to be a part of the deal. This act in fact followed in 966 and initiated the Christianization of Greater Poland, a region that up to that point had not been exposed to Christian influence, unlike Lesser Poland and Silesia. In 968, an independent missionary [[Diocese|bishopric]], reporting directly to the pope, was established, with [[Jordan (bishop of Poland)|Jordan]] installed as the first bishop.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 154\u2013155, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe scope of the Christianization mission in its early phase was quite limited geographically, and the few relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land. Stone churches and [[Baptistery|baptisteries]] were discovered within the [[Ostr\u00f3w Lednicki]] and [[Pozna\u0144]] gords, and a chapel in [[Gniezno]]. Pozna\u0144 was also the site of the first [[cathedral]], the bishopric seat of Jordan and Bishop [[Unger (bishop of Poland)|Unger]], who followed him.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 156, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== The early expansion of the Piasts, Great Moravian and Norman contributions ===\n\nNewer research points out some other intriguing possibilities regarding the early origins of the Polish state in Greater Poland. There are indications that the processes that led to the establishment of the Piast state began during the period ca. 890-910. During these years, a tremendous civilizational advancement took place in central Greater Poland, as the unearthed products of all kinds that have been discovered are better made and more elaborate. The timing coincides with the breakdown of the [[Great Moravia]]n state caused by the [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions. Before and after its fall in 905-07, many Great Moravian people, fearing for their lives, had to escape. According to the notes made by [[Constantine VII]], they found refuge in neighboring countries. Decorations found in So\u0142acz graves in [[Pozna\u0144]] have their counterparts in burial sites around [[Nitra]] in [[Slovakia]]. In the Nitra area, there was also in medieval times a well-known clan named Poznan. The above indicates that the Pozna\u0144 town was established by Nitran refugees, and more generally, the immigrants from Great Moravia contributed to the sudden awakening of the otherwise remote and isolated Piast lands.<ref name=\"JB\"/>\n\nThe early expansion of the Gniezno Land tribe very likely began under Mieszko's grandfather Lestek, the probable real founder of the Piast state.<ref name=\"JB\"/> Widukind's chronicle speaks of Mieszko ruling a Slavic nation called \"Licicaviki\", which was what Widukind made out of \"Lestkowicy\": the people of Lestko, or Lestek. Lestek was also reflected in the [[saga]]s of the [[Normans]], who may have played a role in Poland's origins (an accumulation of treasures from the period 930-1000 is attributed to them). Siemomys\u0142 and then Mieszko continued after Lestek, whose tradition was alive within the Piast court when [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]] named one of his sons after him and [[Gallus Anonymous]] wrote his chronicle.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The term \"Lechici\", popular later as a synonym  for \"Poles\", may also have been inspired by Mieszko's grandfather.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 75</ref>\n\n=== Early capitals, large scale gord construction ===\n\nThere is some disagreement as to the early seat of the ruling clan. Modern archeology has shown that the gord in [[Gniezno]] did not even exist before about 940. This fact eliminates the possibility of Gniezno's early central role, which is what had long been believed, based on the account given by Gallus Anonymus. The relics found in [[Giecz]] (including a great concentration of silver treasures), where the original gord was built some 80 years earlier, point to that location. Other likely early capitals include the old gords of [[Grzybowo, Wrze\u015bnia County|Grzybowo]], [[Kalisz]] or [[Pozna\u0144]]. Pozna\u0144, which is older than Gniezno, was probably the original site of Mieszko's court in the earlier years of his reign. The first cathedral church, a monumental structure, was erected there. The events of 974\u201378, when Mieszko, like his brother-in-law [[Boleslaus II of Bohemia]], supported [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria]], in his rebellion against [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]], created a threat of the emperor's retribution. The situation probably motivated Mieszko to move the government to Gniezno, which was safer due to its more eastern location.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The emperor's response turned out to be ineffective, but this geographical advantage continued in the years to come. The growing importance of Gniezno was reflected in the addition around 980 of a new southern part to the original two segments of the gord. In the existing summary of the ''[[Dagome iudex]]'' document written in 991-92 before Mieszko's death, Mieszko's state is referred to as ''Civitas Gnesnensis'', or the Gniezno State.<ref name=\"JB\"/>\n\nThe enormous effort of the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region who were involved in building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father [[Siemomys\u0142]], the Czechs conquered [[Silesia]] and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community.<ref name=\"JB\"/> A [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian Slav]] uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians).<ref name=\"JB\"/> When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomys\u0142.<ref name=\"JB\"/>\n\n=== Alliance with Germany and conquest of Pomerania ===\n\nFighting the [[Veleti]] from the beginning of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The alliance was natural at this point, because the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when [[Wichmann the Younger|Wichmann]], this time leading forces of the [[Velunzani|Volinians]], was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus]], had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his [[Italy|Italian]] policies.<ref name=\"JB\"/> This new status allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent [[diocese|bishopric]]. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with [[Margrave]] [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Hodo]] that followed in the [[Battle of Cedynia]] of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of [[Pomerania]].

The Slavs lived from cultivation of crops and were generally farmers, but also engaged in hunting and gathering. The migrations took place when the destabilizing invasions of Eastern and Central Europe by waves of people and armies from the east, such as the [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]], were occurring. This westward movement of Slavic people was facilitated in part by the previous [[migration period|emigration of Germanic peoples]] toward the safer areas of Western and Southern Europe. The immigrating Slavs formed various small tribal organizations beginning in the 8th century, some of which coalesced later into larger, state-like ones.<ref name=\"KK 325\u2013352\"/><ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013167\"/> Beginning in the 7th century, these tribal units built many fortified structures with earth and wood walls and embankments, called [[gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]]s. Some of them were developed and inhabited, others had a very large empty area inside the walls.\n\nBy the 9th century, the West Slavs had settled the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]] in [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|Pomerania]], which subsequently developed into a commercial and military power.<ref name=\"UzP 142\u2013143\"/> Along the coastline, remnants of [[Scandinavia]]n settlements and [[Viking Age|emporia]] were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of [[Truso]],<ref name=\"Jagodzi\u0144ski\"/> located in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians]]. During the same time, the tribe of the [[Vistulans]] (''Wi\u015blanie''), based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.\n\nDuring the 10th century, the Lechitic [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]] (''Polanie'', lit. \"people of the open fields\") turned out to be of decisive historic importance. Initially based in the central Polish lowlands around [[Giecz]], [[Pozna\u0144]] and [[Gniezno]], the Polans went through a period of accelerated building of fortified settlements and territorial expansion beginning in the first half of the 10th century. Under duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] of the [[Piast dynasty]], the expanded Polan territory was converted to Christianity in 966, which is generally regarded the birth of the Polish state. The contemporary names of the realm, \"Mieszko's state\" or \"Gniezno state\", were dropped soon afterwards in favour of \"Poland\", a rendering of the Polans' tribal name. The Piast dynasty would continue to [[Piast Poland|rule Poland until the late 14th century]].<ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013167\"/><ref name=\"UzP 162\u2013163\"/>\n\n== Origin of the Slavic peoples ==\n\n=== Slavic beginnings of Poland ===\n\nThe origins of the [[Slavic peoples]], who arrived on Polish lands at the outset of the [[Middle Ages]] as representatives of the [[Early Slavs|Prague culture]], go back to the [[Kiev culture]], which formed beginning early in the 3rd century AD and is genetically derived from the Post-Zarubintsy [[Archaeological horizon|cultural horizon]] (Rakhny\u2013Ljutez\u2013Pochep material culture sphere)<ref name=\"KK 324\"/> and itself was one of the later post-[[Zarubintsy culture]] groups.<ref name=\"KK 232, 351\"/> Such an ethnogenetic relationship is apparent between the large Kiev culture population and the early (6th\u20137th centuries) Slavic settlements in the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] basins, but lacking between these Slavic settlements and the [[Poland in Antiquity|older local cultures]] within the same region, that ceased to exist beginning in the 400\u2013450 AD period.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/><ref name=\"UzP 125\u2013126\"/>\n\n=== Zarubintsy culture ===\n\n[[File:Rome and the Barbarians in Eastern and Central Europe around 100 AD by Shchukin.png|thumb|right|275px|Central and East European cultures ca. 100 AD. The [[Zarubintsy culture]] is shown expanding into the Post-Zarubintsy [[Archaeological horizon|horizon]] (red), the area where the Proto-Slavic people are thought to have formed.]]\n\nThe [[Zarubintsy culture]] circle, in existence roughly from 200 BC to 150 AD, extended along the middle and upper [[Dnieper]] and its tributary the [[Pripyat River]], but also left traces of settlements in parts of [[Polesie]] and the upper [[Bug River]] basin. The main distinguished local groups were the Polesie group, the Middle Dnieper group and the Upper Dnieper group. The Zarubintsy culture developed from the [[Milograd culture]] in the northern part of its range and from the local [[Scythians|Scythian]] populations in the more southern part. The Polesie group's origin was also influenced by the [[Pomeranian culture|Pomeranian]] and [[Jastorf culture]]s. The Zarubintsy culture and its beginnings were moderately affected by [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] and the [[Black Sea]] area (trade with the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek]] cities provided imported items) centers of civilization in the earlier stages, but not much by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influence later on, and accordingly its economic development was lagging behind that of other early Roman period cultures. Cremation of bodies was practiced, with the human remains and burial gifts including metal decorations, small in number and limited in variety, placed in pits.<ref name=\"KK 191, 212, 228\u2013230, 232, 281\"/>\n\n=== Kiev culture ===\n\nOriginating from the Post-Zarubintsy cultures and often considered the oldest Slavic culture, the [[Kiev culture]] functioned during the later Roman periods (end of 2nd through mid-5th century)<ref name=\"Parczewski\"/> north of the vast [[Chernyakhov culture]] territories, within the basins of the upper and middle Dnieper, [[Desna River|Desna]] and [[Seym River|Seym]] rivers. The [[archaeological culture|archeological cultural]] features of the Kiev sites show this culture to be identical or highly compatible (representing the same cultural model) with that of the 6th-century Slavic societies, including the settlements on the lands of today's Poland.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> The Kiev culture is known mostly from settlement sites; the burial sites, involving pit graves, are few and poorly equipped. Not many metal objects have been found, despite the known native production of iron and processing of other metals, including [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] coating technology. Clay vessels were made without the [[potter's wheel]]. The Kiev culture represented an intermediate level of development, between that of the cultures of the Central European Barbaricum, and the forest zone societies of the eastern part of the continent. The Kiev culture consisted of four local formations: The Middle Dnieper group, the Desna group, the Upper Dnieper group and the Dnieper-Don group. The general model of the Kiev culture is like that of the early Slavic cultures that were to follow and must have originated mainly from the Kiev groups, but evolved probably over a larger territory, stretching west to the base of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Eastern Carpathian Mountains]], and from a broader Post-Zarubintsy foundation. The Kiev culture and related groups expanded considerably after 375 AD, when the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] state,<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 243</ref> and more broadly speaking the Chernyakhov culture, were destroyed by the [[Huns]].<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 277, 303</ref><ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski p. 334</ref>{{Ref label|c|c|none}} This process was facilitated further and gained pace, involving at that time the Kiev's descendant cultures, when the Hun confederation itself broke down in the mid-5th century.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 281, 302, 303, 334, 351</ref><ref name=\"UzP 126\"/>\n\n=== Written sources ===\n\nThe eastern cradle of the Slavs is also directly confirmed by a written source. The anonymous author known as the [[Ravenna Cosmography|Cosmographer of Ravenna]] (c. 700) names [[Scythia]], a geographic region encompassing vast areas of eastern Europe,<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> as the place \"where the generations of the Sclaveni had their beginnings\".<ref name=\"UzP 126\"/> Scythia, \"stretching far and spreading wide\" in the eastern and southern directions, had at the west end, as seen at the time of [[Jordanes]]' writing (first half to mid-6th century) or earlier, \"the Germans and the river Vistula\".<ref name=\"Getica\"/> Jordanes places the Slavs in Scythia as well.<ref name=\"Getica\"/>\n\n=== Alternative point of view ===\n\nAccording to an alternative theory, popular in the earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures in the area of modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of [[Poland in Antiquity|earlier indigenous populations]], who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.<ref name=\"KK 325\u2013352\"/><ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013167\"/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}}\n\nA 2011 article on the early Western Slavs states that the transitional period (of relative depopulation) is difficult to evaluate archeologically. Some believe that the Late Antique \"Germanic\" populations (in Poland late Przeworsk culture and others) abandoned East Central Europe and were replaced by the Slavs coming from the east, others see the \"Germanic\" groups as staying and becoming, or already being, Slavs. Current archeology, says the author, \"is unable to give a satisfying answer and probably both aspects played a role\". In terms of their origin, territorial and linguistic, \"Germanic\" groups should not be played off against \"Slavs\", as our current understanding of the terms may have limited relevance to the complex realities of the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages. Local languages in the region cannot be identified by archeological studies, and genetic evaluation of cremation burial remains has not been possible.<ref name=\"The Western Slavs of the Seventh to the Eleventh Century \u2013 An Archaeological Perspective\">{{cite news|publisher=[[History Compass]]|author=Sebastian Brather|author-link=Sebastian Brather|title=The Western Slavs of the Seventh to the Eleventh Century \u2013 An Archaeological Perspective|date=2011-06-02|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00779.x}}</ref>\n\n== Slavic differentiation and expansion; Prague culture ==\n\n=== Kolochin culture, Penkovka culture and Prague\u2013Korchak culture ===\n\nThe final process of the differentiation of the cultures recognized as early Slavic, the Kolochin culture] (over the territory of the Kiev culture), the [[Antes (people)|Penkovka culture]] and the [[Prague-Korchak culture]], took place during the end of the 4th and in the 5th century CE. Beyond the Post-Zarubintsy horizon, the expanding early Slavs took over much of the territories of the [[Chernyakhov culture]] and the [[Dacia]]n [[Carpathian Tumuli culture]]. As not all of the previous inhabitants from those cultures had left the area, they probably contributed some elements to the Slavic cultures.<ref name=\"Parczewski\"/>\n\nThe Prague culture developed over the western part of the Slavic expansion within the basins of the middle [[Dnieper River]], [[Pripyat River]] and upper [[Dniester]] up to the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and in southeastern Poland, i.e., the upper and middle [[Vistula]] basin. This culture was responsible for most of the growth in 6th and 7th centuries, by which time it also encompassed the middle [[Danube]] and middle [[Elbe]] basins.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> The Prague culture very likely corresponds to the Sclaveni referred to by [[Jordanes]], whose area he described as extending west to the Vistula sources. The Penkovka culture people inhabited the southeastern part, from [[Seversky Donets]] to the lower [[Danube]] (including the region where the Antes would be), and the Kolochin culture was located north of the more eastern area of the Penkovka culture (the upper [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and [[Desna River|Desna]] basins). The Korchak type designates the eastern part of the Prague-Korchak culture, which was somewhat less directly dependent on the mother Kiev culture than its two sister cultures because of its western expansion. The early 6th-century Slavic settlements covered an area three times the size of the Kiev culture region some hundred years earlier.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/><ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 327, 334, 351</ref>\n\n=== Early settlements, economy and burials in Poland ===\n\n[[File:Slavic archaeological cultures, beginning of 7th century.png|right|thumb|300px|Slavic [[archaeological culture]]s c. 700 AD]]\n\nIn Poland, the earliest archeological sites considered Slavic include a limited number of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area. It is on the basis of the different varieties of these basic clay pots and infrequent decorations that the three cultures are distinguished.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 333, 334</ref> The largest of the earliest Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in Bach\u00f3rz, [[Rzesz\u00f3w]] County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries. It consisted of 12 nearly square, partially dug-out houses, each covering the area of 6.2 to 19.8 (14.0 on the average) square meters. A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner, which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.<ref>The web site of the Institute of Archeology, [[Jagiellonian University]] \u2013 ''Bach\u00f3rz''</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 124, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\nPoorly developed handicraft and limited resources for metal working are characteristic of the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as can be found in 7th-century finds in Ha\u0107ki, [[Bielsk Podlaski]] County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the [[Krak\u00f3w]]-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igo\u0142omia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th\u2013 to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]] in [[Silesia]].<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 334\u2013337</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 123\u2013126, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref><ref name=\"S\u0142owianie nad Bzur\u0105\">''S\u0142owianie nad Bzur\u0105'' by [[Marek Dulinicz]] and [[Felix Biermann]], ''[[Archeologia \u017bywa]]'', issue 1 (16) 2001</ref>\n\nThe Slavic people cremated their dead, typical for the inhabitants of their region for centuries. The burials were usually single, the graves grouped in small cemeteries, with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground indentations. The number of burial sites found is small in relation to the known settlement density. The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation, hunting, fishing, gathering and cattle breeding (swine, sheep and goats bred to a lesser extent).<ref name=\"KK 337\"/>\n\n=== Geographic expansion in Poland and central Europe ===\n\nThe earliest Slavic settlers from the east reached southeastern Poland in the second half of the 5th century, specifically the [[San River]] basin, then the upper [[Vistula]] regions, including the [[Krak\u00f3w]] area and [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] Valley. Single early sites are also known around [[Sandomierz]] and [[Lublin]] in [[Masovia]] and [[Upper Silesia]]. Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in [[Lower Silesia]]. In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. At the end of this century, or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached [[Western Pomerania]]. According to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Theophylact Simocatta]], the Slavs captured in [[Constantinople]] in 592 named the [[Baltic Sea]] coastal area as the place from which they originated.<ref>Michael and Mary Whitby (trans.), ''The History of Theophylact Simocatta: An English Translation with Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-19-822799-X}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology 20\u201321\"/>\n\nAs of that time and in the following decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of [[Greater Poland]], Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower [[Oder River]] made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin is the subject of debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzie\u0144 group of the [[Przeworsk culture]]. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical for the rest of the Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.<ref name=\"KK 337\"/><ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/>\n\nThis particular pattern of expansion into the lands of Poland and then Germany <ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 327, 337\u2013338</ref> was a part of the great Slavic migration during the 5th-7th centuries from originating lands in the east to various countries of central and southeastern Europe.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, pp. 337\u2013338</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 126\u2013127, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref> Another 6th-century route, more southern, took the Prague culture of the Slavs through [[Slovakia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]].  The Slavs also reached the eastern [[Alps]] and populated the [[Elbe]] and the [[Danube]] basins, from where they moved south to occupy the [[Balkans]] as far as [[Peloponnese]].<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/>\n\n=== Ancient and early Medieval written accounts of the Slavs ===\n\nBesides the Baltic [[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]] (see [[Poland in Antiquity]] article), ancient and medieval authors speak of the East European, or Slavic Venethi. It can be inferred from [[Tacitus]]' description in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' that his \"Venethi\" possibly lived around the middle [[Dnieper]] basin,<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 259, 350</ref> which in his times would correspond to the Proto-Slavic [[Zarubintsy culture|Zarubintsy]] cultural sphere. Jordanes, to whom the Venethi meant Slavs, wrote of past fighting between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the Venethi that took place during the third quarter of the 4th century in today's [[Ukraine]].<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 102, [[Tadeusz Makiewicz]]</ref> At that time, the Venethi therefore would have been people of the [[Kiev culture]]. The Venethi, Jordanes reported, \"now rage in war far and wide, in punishment for our sins\",<ref name=\"Getica\"/> and were at that time made obedient to the Gothic king [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]. Jordanes' 6th-century description of the \"populous race of the Venethi\"<ref name=\"Getica\"/> includes indications of their dwelling places in the regions near the northern ridge of the Carpathian Mountains and stretching from there \"almost endlessly\" east, while in the western direction reaching the sources of the Vistula. More specifically, he designates the area between the Vistula and the lower [[Danube]] as the country of the [[Sclaveni (military)|Sclaveni]]. \"They have swamps and forests for their cities\" (''hi paludes silvasque pro civitatibus habent''),<ref name=\"Getica\"/><ref>''[[Getica (Jordanes)|De origine actibusque Getarum]]'', the Latin Library at [[Ad Fontes Academy]] web page</ref> he added sarcastically. The \"bravest of these peoples\",<ref name=\"Getica\"/> the [[Antes (people)|Antes]], settled the lands between the [[Dniester]] and the [[Dnieper]] rivers. The Venethi were the third Slavic branch of an unspecified location (most likely of the Kolochin culture), as well as the overall designation for the totality of the Slavic peoples, who \"though off-shoots from one stock, have now three names\".<ref name=\"Getica\"/>\n\n[[Procopius]] in ''De Bello Gothico'' located the \"countless Antes tribes\" even further east, beyond the Dnieper.<ref name=\"UzP 122\"/> Together with the Sclaveni, they spoke the same language, of an \"unheard of barbarity\".<ref name=\"UzP 122\"/> According to Jordanes, the [[Heruli]] nation traveled in 512 across all of the Sclaveni peoples territories, and then west of there through a large expanse of unpopulated lands, as the Slavs were about to settle the western and northern parts of Poland in the decades to follow.<ref name=\"Parczewski2\"/> All of the above is in good accordance with the findings of today's archeology.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 250, 329, 330, 333, 350, 352</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 122, 123, 126, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\nByzantine writers held the Slavs in low regard for the simple life they led and also for their supposedly limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already a threat to the Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. [[Procopius]], the anonymous author of ''[[Strategicon of Maurice|Strategicon]]'', and [[Theophylact Simocatta]] wrote at some length on how to deal with the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. [[John of Ephesus]] actually goes as far as saying in the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor [[Heraclius]].<ref name=\"Parczewski\"/><ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013127\"/>\n\nThe above-mentioned authors provide various details on the character, living conditions, social structure and economic activities of the early Slavic people, some of which are confirmed by the archeological discoveries in Poland, since the Slavic communities were quite similar all over their range.<ref name=\"UzP 122\u2013127\"/> Their uniform [[Proto-Slavic language|Old Slavic]] language remained in use until the 9th to 12th centuries, depending on the region. The Greek missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] from [[Thessaloniki]], where \"everybody fluently spoke Slavic\", were expected to be able to communicate in distant [[Moravia]] without any difficulty when sent there in 863 by the Byzantine ruler.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 124, 126, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\n===Invasions of the Avars in Europe and their presence in Poland===\n\nIn the 6th century, the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking nomadic [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] moved into the middle Danube area. Twice (in 562 and 566\u2013567), the Avars undertook military expeditions against the [[Franks]], and their routes went through the Polish lands. The Avar envoys bribed Slavic chiefs from the lands they did not control, including [[Pomerania]], to secure their participation in Avar raids, but other than that, the exact nature of their relations with the Slavs in Poland is not known. The Avars had some presence or contacts in Poland also in the 7th and 8th centuries, when they left artifacts in the Krak\u00f3w-Nowa Huta region and elsewhere, including a bronze belt decoration found in the [[Krakus Mound]]. This last item, from the turn of the 8th century, is used to date the mound itself.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 141, [[Zofia Kurnatowska]]</ref><ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, pp. 338\u2013339</ref><ref name=\"UzP 128\u2013129\"/>{{Ref label|d|d|none}}\n\n== Tribal differentiation ==\n{{wide image|Settlement in Strad\u00f3w (IX Century A.D.), Poland.JPG|1066px|Settlement in Strad\u00f3w (9th century AD), the largest stronghold in contemporary Poland|center|dir=ltr}}\n[[File:Pagan cult wall (VIII-IX Century B.C.) in \u0141ysa G\u00f3ra, Poland.JPG|400px|thumb|Pagan cult wall (8-9th century BC) in [[\u0141ysa G\u00f3ra]]]]\n\n=== 8th-century settlements ===\n\nWith the major population shifts of the Slavic migrations completed, the 8th century brought a measure of stability to the Slavic people settled in Poland. About one million people actively utilized no more than 20\u201325% of the land; the rest was mainly forest. Normal settlements, with the exception of a few fortifications and cult venues, were limited to lowland areas below 350 meters above the sea level. Most villages built without artificial defensive structures were located within valley areas of natural bodies of water. The Slavs were very familiar with the water environment and used it as natural defense.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\nThe living and economic activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot. The larger settlements could have had over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents, but more typically there were just several homes with no more than 30 inhabitants. From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses. As the Germanic people before them, the Slavs left vacant regions between developed areas for separation from strangers and to avoid conflicts, especially along the limits of their tribal territories.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\n=== Gord construction ===\n\n[[File:Slavic peoples 9c map.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Slavic peoples]] around the 8th and 9th centuries]]\n\nThe [[Polish tribes]] did build more imposing structures than the simple dwellings in their small communities: fortified settlements and other reinforced enclosures of the [[gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]] (Polish \"gr\u00f3d\") type. Those were established on naturally suitable, defense-enhancing sites beginning in the late 6th or 7th century. Szeligi near [[P\u0142ock]] and Ha\u0107ki are the early examples.<ref>Kaczanowski, Koz\u0142owski, p. 339</ref> A large-scale building effort took place in the 8th century. The gords were differently designed and of various sizes, from small to impressively massive. Ditches, walls, palisades and embankments were used to strengthen the perimeter, which often involved a  complicated earthwork besides wood and stone construction. Gords of the tribal period were irregularly distributed across the country (there were fewer larger ones in [[Lesser Poland]],but more smaller ones in central and northern Poland),<ref name=\"Chronology 22\"/> and could cover an area from 0.1 to 25 [[hectare]]s. They could have a simple or multi-segment architecture and be protected by fortifications of different types. Some were permanently occupied by a substantial number of people or by a chief and his cohort of armed men, while others were utilized as refuges to protect the local population in case of external danger. Beginning in the 9th century, the gords became the nuclei of future urban developments, attracting tradesmen of all kinds, especially in strategic locations. Gords erected in the 8th century have been researched extensively, for example the ones in [[Mi\u0119dzy\u015bwie\u0107]] ([[Cieszyn County]], Go\u0142\u0119szyce tribe) and Naszacowice ([[Nowy S\u0105cz]] County). The last one was destroyed and rebuilt four times, with the final reconstruction completed after 989.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\nA monumental and technically complex border protection area gord of over 3 hectares in size was built around 770\u2013780 in [[Trzcinica, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Trzcinica]] near [[Jas\u0142o]] on the site of an old [[Bronze and Iron Age Poland|Bronze Age era]] stronghold, probably the seat of a local ruler and his garrison. Thousands of relics were found there, including a silver treasure of 600 pieces. The gord was set afire several times and ultimately destroyed during the first half of the 11th century.<ref>[[Muzeum Podkarpackie]] (Sub-Carpathian Museum) in [[Krosno]] web site, [[Jan Gancarski]]</ref>{{Ref label|e|e|none}}\n\nThis larger scale building activity, from the mid-8th century on, was a manifestation of the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on a new level. They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later [[Vistulans|Vistulan]] gords in [[Lesser Poland]] are a good example. The threat coming from the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] state in [[Pannonia]] could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.<ref>[[Jerzy Wyrozumski]] \u2013 ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'' (VIII w. \u2013 1370) (History of Piast Poland (8th century \u2013 1370)), [[Fogra]], Krak\u00f3w 1999, {{ISBN|83-85719-38-5}}, p. 47</ref>\n\n=== Society organized into larger tribal units ===\n\nFrom the 8th century on, the Slavs in Poland increasingly organized themselves in larger structures known as \"great tribes,\" either through voluntary or forced association. The population was primarily involved in agricultural pursuits. Fields were cultivated as well as gardens within settlements. Plowing was done using oxen and wooden plows reinforced with iron. Forest burning was used to increase the arable area, but also to provide fertilizer, as the ashes lasted in that capacity for several seasons. Rotation of crops was practiced as well as the winter/spring crop system. After several seasons of exploitation, the land was being left idle to regain fertility. Wheat, millet and rye were most important crops; other cultivated plant species included oat, barley, pea, broad bean, lentil, flax and hemp, as well as apple, pear, plum, peach and cherry trees in fruit orchards. Beginning in the 8th century, swine gradually became economically more important than cattle; sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, chickens, geese and ducks were also kept. The agricultural practices of the Slavs are known from archeological research, which documents progressive increases over time in arable area and resulting deforestation,<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 148, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref> and from written reports provided by [[Abraham ben Jacob|Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]], a 10th-century [[Jew]]ish traveler. Ibrahim described also other features of Slavic life, for example the use of steam baths. The existence of bath structures has been confirmed by archeology.<ref>''Nauka w Polsce'' (Science in Poland), internet service of the [[Polish Press Agency]], Sept. 6, 2010 article by Szymon Zdzieb\u0142owski</ref> An anonymous [[Arab]] writer from the turn of the 10th century mentions that the Slavic people made an alcoholic beverage out of honey and their celebrations were accompanied by music played on the lute, tambourines and wind instruments.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n  \nGathering, hunting and fishing were still essential as sources of food and materials such as hide or fur. The forest was also exploited as a source of building materials such as wood. In addition, wild forest bees were kept there, and the forest could be used as a place of refuge.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 49</ref> Until the 9th century, the population was separated from the main centers of civilization and self-sufficient with primitive, local community and household-based manufacturing. Specialized craftsmen existed only in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing, and pottery; the few luxury items used were imports. From the 7th century on, modestly decorated ceramics were made with the [[potter's wheel]]. 7th\u2013 to 9th-century collections of objects have been found in Bonikowo and Bruszczewo, [[Ko\u015bcian]] County (iron spurs, knives, clay containers with some ornamentation) and in the Krak\u00f3w-Nowa Huta region (weapons and utensils in Plesz\u00f3w and Mogi\u0142a), among other places. Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears, bows and wooden shields. Axes were used later, and still swords of the types popular throughout 7th\u2013 to 9th-century Europe were also used. Independent of distant powers, the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life, but at the cost of some backwardness in civilization.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\nA qualitative change took place in the 9th century, when the Polish lands were crossed again by long-distance trade routes. [[Pomerania]] become a part of the Baltic trade zone, while [[Lesser Poland]] participated in trade centered in the Danubian countries. In the Upper Vistula basin, Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins, often cut into pieces, \"grzywna\" iron coin equivalents (of the type used in [[Great Moravia]]) and even linen cloths served as currency.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n \nThe basic social unit was the nuclear family, consisting of parents and their children, which had to fit in a dwelling area of several to 25 square meters. The \"big family,\" a patriarchal, multi-generational group of related families with the meaning of a kin or clan, was of declining importance during this period. A larger group was needed in the past (5th\u20137th centuries) for forest clearing and burning undertakings, when farming communities had to shift from location to location; in the 8th-century phase of agriculture, a family was sufficient to take care of their arable land.<ref>Jerzy Wyrozumski \u2013 ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'' (History of Poland until 1505), Pa\u0144stwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe ([[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN]]), Warszawa 1986, {{ISBN|83-01-03732-6}}, p. 73</ref> A concept of agricultural land ownership was gradually developing, at this point a family, not individual prerogative. Several or more clan territories were grouped into a neighborhood association, or \"opole\", which established a rudimentary self-government. Such a community was the owner of forested land, pastures, bodies of water and within it took place the first organization around common projects and the related development of political power. A big and resourceful opole could become, by extending its possessions, a proto-state entity vaguely referred to as a tribe.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 50, concerning land ownership and evolution of \"opole\"</ref> The tribe was the top level of this structure. It would contain several opoles and control a region of up to about 1500 square kilometers, where internal relationships were arbitrated and external defense organized.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n \nA general assembly of all tribesmen took care of the most pressing of issues. [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] wrote in the early 11th century of the [[Veleti]], a tribe of [[Polabian Slavs]], with a report that their assembly kept deliberating till everybody agreed, but this \"war democracy\" was gradually being replaced by a government system in which the tribal elders and rulers had the upper hand. This development facilitated the coalescing of tribes into \"great tribes,\" some of which under favorable conditions would later become tribal states. The communal and tribal democracy, with self-imposed contributions by the community members, survived in small entities and local territorial subunits the longest. On a larger scale, it was being replaced by the rule of able leaders and then dominant families, ultimately leading inevitably to hereditary transition of supreme power, mandatory taxation, service etc.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 50\u201352</ref> When social and economic evolution reached this level, the concentration of power was facilitated and made possible to sustain by parallel development of a professional military force (called at this stage \"dru\u017cyna\") at the ruler's or chief's disposal.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/><ref>Jerzy Wyrozumski \u2013 ''Historia Polski do roku 1505'', p. 66</ref>\n\n=== Burials and religion ===\n\nBurial customs, at least in southern Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes was placed on the mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to [[Arab]] testimonies (one from the end of the 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by [[Theophylact Simocatta]].<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 125, 133, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Procopius]], the Slavs believed in one god, the creator of lightning and master of the entire universe, to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called [[Svarog]] throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 56</ref> Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and appeased by offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 125, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 134, [[Stanis\u0142aw Rosik]]</ref>\n\nThe Slavs erected sanctuaries, created statues and other sculptures, including the four-faced [[Svetovid]], whose carvings symbolize various aspects of the Slavic cosmology model. One 9th-century specimen from the [[Zbruch River]] in modern Ukraine, found in 1848, is on display at the Archeological Museum in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Many of the sacred locations and objects were identified outside Poland, for example in northeastern Germany or Ukraine. In Poland, religious activity sites have been investigated in northwestern Pomerania, including [[Szczecin]], where a three-headed deity once stood, and the [[Wolin]] island, where 9th\u2013 to 11th-century cult figurines were found.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 134\u2013135, Stanis\u0142aw Rosik</ref> Archeologically confirmed cult places and figures have also been researched at several other locations.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 54\u201359</ref>\n\n== Early Slavic states and other 9th-century developments ==\n\n=== Samo's realm ===\n\nThe first Slavic state-like entity, the realm of King [[Samo]], originally a [[Franks|Frankish]] trader, flourished  close to Poland in [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], parts of [[Pannonia]] and more southern regions between the [[Oder]] and [[Elbe]] rivers. It during the period 623\u2013658.<ref>''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, p. 21, Jacek Poleski</ref> Samo became a Slavic leader by helping the Slavs defend themselves successfully against [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] assailants. What Samo led was probably a loose alliance of tribes, and it fell apart after his death. Slavic [[Carantania]], centered on Krnski Grad (now [[Maria Saal|Karnburg]] in [[Austria]]), was more of a real state, developed possibly from one part of the disintegrating Samo's kingdom, but lasted under a native dynasty throughout the 8th century and became [[Christianity|Christianized]].<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== Great Moravia and the establishment of a written Slavic language ===\n\n[[File:West slavs 9th-10th c..png|thumb|right|325px|The lands of the [[West Slavs]] as specified in a historical map often reproduced in the 20th century]]\nLarger scale state-generating processes developed in Slavic areas in the 9th century. [[Great Moravia]], the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great Moravia included what is now [[Moravia]] and western [[Slovakia]], plus parts of [[Bohemia]], [[Pannonia]] and southern regions of [[Lesser Poland]]. The glory of the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/> Such finds do not extend to the lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia took place during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] at the end of the 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions, it ceased to exist entirely.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\nIn 831, [[Mojmir I of Moravia|Mojmir I]] was baptized, and his Moravian state became a part of the [[Bavaria]]n [[Passau]] diocese. Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well as political independence from [[East Francia|East Frankish]] influence, his successor [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] asked the Byzantine emperor [[Michael III]] for missionaries. As a result, [[Cyril and Methodius]] arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there. To further their goals, the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language: [[Old Church Slavonic]], which employed the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] created by them. They translated the [[Bible]] and other church texts into this language, thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== The Czech state ===\n\nThe fall of Great Moravia made room for the expansion of the [[History of the Czech lands in the Middle Ages|Czech]] or [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]n state, which likewise incorporated some of the Polish lands. The founder of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], Prince [[Bo\u0159ivoj I, Duke of Bohemia|Bo\u0159ivoj]], was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in [[Prague]]. His son and successor [[Spytihn\u011bv I, Duke of Bohemia|Spytihn\u011bv]] was baptized in [[Regensburg]] in the Latin rite, which marks the early stage of [[East Francia|East Frankish]]/German influence in Bohemian affairs, which was destined to be decisive.<ref>''[[Europe: A History]]'' by [[Norman Davies]], p. 324, 1998 New York, HarperPerennial, {{ISBN|0-06-097468-0}}</ref> Borivoj's grandson Prince [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], the future Czech martyr and patron saint, was killed, probably in 935, by his brother [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus]]. Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes and most likely dominated the [[Vistulans|Vistulan]] and [[Lendians|Lendian]] tribes of Lesser Poland and at least parts of [[Silesia]].<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== 9th-century Polish lands ===\n\nIn the 9th century the Polish lands were still on the peripheries of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of progress did take place in levels of civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the [[Carolingian Empire]]; objects crafted there have occasionally been found.<ref name=\"Chronology 22\"/><ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 52\u201354</ref> Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes. The names of some of them, mostly from the western part of the country, are known from written sources, especially a [[Latin]] document written in the mid-9th century by the anonymous [[Bavarian Geographer]]. During this period, smaller tribal structures were disintegrating while larger ones were being established in their place.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski, p. 48\"/>\n\nCharacteristic of the turn of the 10th century in most Polish tribal settlement areas was a particular intensification of [[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gord]] building activity. The gords were the centers of social and political life. Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them. Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans.<ref name=\"UzP 136\u2013141\"/>\n\n=== The Vistulan state ===\n\n[[File:Kopiec Krakusa2.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Krakus Mound]]]]\n\nA major development of the 9th century period concerns the somewhat enigmatic Wi\u015blanie, or [[Vistulans]] (Bavarian Geographer's ''Vuislane'') tribe. The Vistulans of western Lesser Poland, mentioned in several contemporary written sources, were already a large tribal union in the first half of the 9th century.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 66\u201367\"/> In the second half of the century, they were evolving into a super-tribal state until their efforts were terminated by more powerful neighbors from the south. [[Krak\u00f3w]], the main town of the Vistulans, with its [[Wawel]] gord, was located along a major \"international\" trade route. The main Vistulan-related archeological find is a late 9th-century treasure of iron-ax shaped [[Grzywna (currency unit)|grzywna]]s, well known as currency units in Great Moravia. They were discovered in 1979 in a wooden chest below the basement of a medieval house on Kanonicza Street in Krak\u00f3w near the [[Vistula]] River and [[Wawel]] Hill. The total weight of the iron material is 3630 kilograms and the individual bars of various sizes (4212 of them) were bound in bundles, which suggests that the package was being readied for transportation.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 140\u2013141, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref> Other finds include the 8th-century [[Krakus Mound|Krakus]], [[Wanda Mound|Wanda]] and other large burial mounds, and the remnants of several gords)<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 52</ref>\n\nVistulan gords, built from the mid-8th century on, were typically very large, often over 10 hectares in size. About 30 big ones are known. The 9th-century gords in Lesser Poland and in Silesia were likely built as a defense against Great Moravian military expansion.<ref>''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, p. 24, Jacek Poleski</ref> The largest one, in Strad\u00f3w, [[Kazimierza Wielka]] County, had an area of 25 hectares and walls or embankments 18 meters high, but parts of this giant structure were probably built later. The gords were often located along the northern slope of the western Carpathian Mountains, on hills or hillsides. The buildings inside the walls were sparsely located or altogether absent, so for the most part, the role of the gords seems to have been something other than that of settlements or administrative centers.<ref name=\"Roszko\"/>\n\nLarge mounds up to 50 meters in diameter are found not only in Krak\u00f3w, but also in [[Przemy\u015bl]] and [[Sandomierz]]. among other places (about 20 total).<ref name=\"Roszko\"/> They were probably funeral locations of rulers or chiefs, with the actual burial site, on the top of the mound, long lost.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 133, Micha\u0142 Parczewski</ref> Besides the mounds, the degree of gord development and the grzywna treasure point to Krak\u00f3w as the main center of Vistulan power (instead of [[Wi\u015blica]], as also suspected in the past).<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 66\u201367\"/>\n\nThe most important written references to Vistulans come from ''The Life of [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|Saint Methodius]]'', also known as \"The [[Pannonian Basin|Pannonian]] Legend\", most likely written by disciples of Methodius right after his death in 885.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 66</ref> The fragment speaks of a very powerful pagan prince who resided in the Vistulan country, reviled the Christians and caused them great harm. He was warned by emissaries speaking on behalf of the missionary and advised to reform and voluntarily accept baptism in his own homeland. Otherwise, it was predicted, he would be forced to do so in a foreign land. According to the Pannonian Legend, that is exactly what eventually did happen. This passage is widely interpreted as an indication that the Vistulans were invaded and overrun by the army of [[Great Moravia]] and their pagan prince captured. This would have had to have happened during Methodius' second stay in Moravia, between 873 and 885, during the reign of Svatopluk I.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski 66\u201367\"/>\n\n[[File:Wislica grodzisko 20070825 1456.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|A [[Vistulans|Vistulan]] stronghold in [[Wi\u015blica]] once stood here]]\n\nA further elaboration on this story is possibly found in a chronicle of [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]] written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of [[Alexander the Great]]. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia as if it were a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Krak\u00f3w area lands and [[Silesia]], in the process leveling Krak\u00f3w's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.<ref name=\"Roszko\"/>\n\nEast of the Vistulans, eastern Lesser Poland was the territory of the [[Lendians|Lendian]] tribe (L\u0119dzianie, the Bavarian Geographer's \"Lendizi\"). In the mid-10th century [[Constantine VII]] wrote their name as ''Lendzaneoi''.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski, p. 48\"/> The Lendians had to be a very substantial tribe, since the names for Poland in the Lithuanian and Hungarian languages and for the Poles in medieval [[Ruthenia]]n all begin with the letter \"L\" and are derived from the name of this tribe. The Poles historically have also referred to themselves as \"[[Lechitic languages|Lechici]]\". After the fall of Great Moravia, the [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] controlled at least part of the territory of the Lendians.<ref name=\"UzP 147\"/> They were conquered by [[Kievan Rus']] during 930\u2013940. At the end of the 10th century, the Lendian lands became divided; the western part was taken by Poland, the eastern portion retained by Kievan Rus'.<ref>''Kalendarium dziej\u00f3w Polski'' (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, pp. 25\u201326, Jacek Poleski</ref>\n\nThe Vistulans were probably also subjected to Magyar raids as an additional layer of embankments was often added to the gord fortifications in the early part of the 10th century. In the early or mid-10th century, the Vistulan entity, like Silesia, was incorporated by [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia]] into the Czech state.<ref name=\"Wyrozumski, p. 48\"/> This association turned out to be beneficial in terms of economic development, because Krak\u00f3w was an important station on the [[Prague]]\u2014[[Kiev]] trade route. The first known Christian church structures were erected on Wawel Hill. Later in the 10th century, under uncertain circumstances, but in a peaceful way (the gord network suffered no damage on this occasion), the Vistulans became a part of the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] Polish state.\n\n=== The Baltic coast ===\n\nIn terms of economic and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|Pomerania]]. It was also characterized by the most extensive contacts with the external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural richness and diversity. Pomerania was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as [[Wolin]], [[Pyrzyce]] or [[Szczecin]]. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the [[Velunzani]] (\"Uelunzani\") and [[Pyrzyce|Pyritzans]] (\"Prissani\") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite the high level of economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in [[Farther Pomerania]]n societies, except for the [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]] city-state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 136\u2013140, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe Wolin settlement was established on the island of the same name in the late 8th century. Located at the mouth of the [[Oder River]], Wolin from the beginning was involved with long distance [[Baltic Sea]] trade. The settlement, thought to be identical with both [[Vineta]] and [[Jomsborg]], was pagan, multiethnic, and readily kept accepting newcomers, especially craftsmen and other professionals, from all over the world. Being located on a major intercontinental sea route, it soon became a major European industrial and trade power. Writing in the 11th century, [[Adam of Bremen]] recognized Wolin as one of the largest European cities, inhabited by honest, good-natured and hospitable Slavic people, together with other nationalities, from [[Greece|Greeks]] to barbarians, including the [[Saxony|Saxons]], as long as they did not demonstrate their Christianity too openly.<ref name=\"UzP 142\u2013143\"/>\n\nWolin was the major stronghold of the Volinian tribal territory, comprising [[Wolin|the island]] and a broad stretch of the adjacent mainland, with its frontier guarded by a string of gords. The city's peak of prosperity occurred around and after year 900, when a new seaport was built (the municipal complex had now four of them) and the metropolitan area was secured by walls and embankments. The archeological findings there include a great variety of imported goods (even from the [[Far East]]) and locally manufactured products and raw materials; amber and precious metals figure prominently, as jewelry was one of the mainstay economic activities of the Wolinian elite.<ref name=\"UzP 142\u2013143\"/>\n\n[[Truso]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] was another [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaport and trade emporium known from the reworking of [[Orosius]]' [[universal history]] by [[Alfred the Great]]. King Alfred included a description of a voyage undertaken around 890 by [[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] from the [[Denmark|Danish]] port of [[Hedeby]] to Truso, which is located near the mouth of the [[Vistula]]. Wulfstan gave a rather detailed description of the location of Truso, within the land of the [[Aesti]], yet close to the Slavic areas west of the Vistula. Truso's actual site was discovered in 1982 at Jan\u00f3w Pomorski, near [[Elbl\u0105g]].<ref name=\"Jagodzi\u0144ski\">''Truso'' by [[Marek Jagodzi\u0144ski]] of the Archeological-Historical  Museum in Elbl\u0105g, from Pradzieje.pl web site</ref>\n\nEstablished as a seaport by the [[Vikings]] and Danish traders at the end of the 8th century in the [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] border area previously already explored by the [[Scandinavia]]ns, Truso lasted as a major city and commercial center until the early 11th century, when it was destroyed and replaced in that capacity by [[Gda\u0144sk]]. The settlement covered an area of 20 [[hectare]]s and consisted of a two-dock seaport, the craft-trade portion, and the peripheral residential development, all protected by a wood and earth bulwark separating it from the mainland. The port-trade and craftsmen zones were themselves separated by a fire control ditch with water flowing through it. There were several rows of houses, including long Viking hall structures, waterside warehouses, market areas and wooden beam covered streets. Numerous relics were found there, including weights used also as currency units, coins (from [[England|English]] to [[Arab]]) and workshops processing metal, jewelry or large quantities of amber. Remnants of long Viking boats were also found, the whole complex being a testimony to Viking preoccupation with commerce, the mainstay of their activities around the Baltic Sea region. The multi-ethnic Truso had extensive trade contacts not only with distant lands and Scandinavia, but also the Slavic areas located to the south and west of it, from where ceramics and other products were transported along the Vistula in river crafts. Ironically, Truso's sudden destruction by fire and subsequent disappearance was apparently a result of a Viking raid.<ref>''Truso \u2013 zaginiony port'' by [[Andrzej Markert]] from \"Sprawy nauki\" web site</ref><ref>''Truso \u2013 emporium Wiking\u00f3w'' an interview with Marek Jagodzi\u0144ski by Arkadiusz Szaraniec from \"Travel Polska\" web site</ref>{{Ref label|f|f|none}}\n\nThis connection to the Baltic trade zone led to an establishment of inner-Slavic long-distance trade routes. Lesser Poland participated in exchange centered in the Danubian countries. Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins, often cut into pieces, \"grzywna\" iron coin equivalents (of the type used in Great Moravia) in the Upper Vistula basin and even linen cloths served as currency.<ref name=\"UzP 130\u2013133\"/>\n\n=== Magyar intrusion ===\n\nThe [[Magyars]] were at first yet another wave of nomadic invaders. Of the [[Uralic languages]] family, coming from northwestern [[Siberia]], they migrated south and west, occupying the [[Pannonian Basin]] from the end of the 9th century. From there, until the second half of the 10th century, when they were forced to settle, they raided and pillaged vast areas of Europe, including Poland. A saber and ornamental elements were found in a Hungarian warrior's grave from the first half of the 10th century in the [[Przemy\u015bl]] area.<ref name=\"UzP 128\u2013129\"/>\n\nGeographically, the Magyar invasions interfered with the previously highly influential contacts between Central Europe and centers of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Christianity|Christianity]]. It may have been the decisive factor that steered Poland toward the Western (Latin) [[Western Christianity|branch of Christianity]] by the time of its adoption in 966.<ref>''A Traveller's History of Poland'', by [[John Radzilowski]], p. 16; Northampton, Mass.: Interlink Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-56656-655-X}}</ref>\n\n== 10th-century developments in Greater Poland; Mieszko's state ==\n\n=== Tribal Greater Poland ===\n\nThe 10th century brought a notable development in the form of settlement stability on Polish lands. Short-lived prehistoric settlements gradually gave way to villages on fixed sites. The number of villages grew with time, but their sites rarely shifted. The population distribution patterns established from that century on are evident on today's landscape.<ref name=\"Investigations\"/>   \n \nSources from the 9th and 10th centuries make no mention of the [[Polans (western)|Polan]] (Polanie) tribe. The closest thing would be the huge (400 gords) ''Glopeani'' tribe of the [[Bavarian Geographer]], whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake [[Gop\u0142o]], but archeological investigations cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gop\u0142o area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle [[Obra River]] basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the [[Warta River]]. There was the [[Gniezno]] area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]] Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the [[Piast]] House, which resulted in the early part of the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 141, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== Mieszko's state and its origins ===\n\nWhat was later to be called the Gniezno state, also known as [[Mieszko I|Mieszko]]'s state, was first expanded at the expense of the subdued tribes in the era of Mieszko's father and grandfather. Writing around 965 or 966 [[Abraham ben Jacob|Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]] described the country of Mieszko, \"the king of the North\",{{Ref label|g|g|none}} as the most wide-ranging of the Slavic lands.<ref name=\"UzP 146\"/> Mieszko, the ruler of the Slavs, was also mentioned as such at that time by [[Widukind of Corvey]] in his ''[[Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres|Res gestae saxonicae]]''. In its mature form, this state included the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] lands between the [[Oder River|Oder]] and [[Bug River|Bug]] rivers and between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the economically crucial mouth areas of the [[Vistula]] and [[Oder River|Oder]] rivers, as well as [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Silesia]].<ref name=\"UzP 146\"/><ref name=\"UzP 144\"/>\n\nThe name of Poles (Polanians, Polyans, Polans) appears in writing for the first time around year 1000, just like the country's name Poland (Latinized as Polonia). \"[[Polans (western)|Polanie]]\" was possibly the name given by later historians to the inhabitants of Greater Poland (a presumed tribe not mentioned in earlier sources). 10th-century inhabitants of Greater Poland would originate from tribes not known by name that were instrumental in bringing about the establishment of the Polish state; one such tribe had to constitute the immediate power base of Mieszko's predecessors, if not Mieszko himself.<ref name=\"UzP 146\"/>\n\n=== The account of Gallus Anonymus vs. archeology ===\n\nIn the early 12th century, the chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]] wrote down or invented a legend about the [[Piast dynasty]]. Amid miraculous details, the story offers the names of the supposed ancestors of the royal family, beginning with a man named [[Cho\u015bcisko]], the father of the central figure [[Piast the Wheelwright]], who was a humble farmer living in Gniezno and married to [[Rzepicha|Rzepka]]. According to Gallus, the male heads of the Piast clan following after him were [[Siemowit]], [[Lestek]], [[Siemomys\u0142]] and [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the first \"Piast\" known with historic certainty. Gallus expressed his own misgivings concerning the trustworthiness of the royal story he passed on, but he did consider the sequence of the last three names of Mieszko's predecessors to be reliable.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nThe results of archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland are at odds with the timing of this story. There was no Gniezno settlement in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only at the turn of the 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would rally the local population around its building and defense.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 146\u2013147, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== The early Piast state and its expansion ===\n[[File:Giecz grodzisko.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Remnants of the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] [[grad (Slavic settlement)|gord]] in [[Giecz]]]]\n\nUnder the old tribal system, the tribal assembly elected a chief in case of an external threat to lead the defense effort, and it was a temporarily granted authority. The Piast clan was able to replace this practice in the Gniezno area with a hereditary ruler, in line with trends in other locations at the time. This allowed the Piast clan to create a state that they could over generations.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 147\u2013148, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe development of the Piast state can be traced to some degree by following the disappearance of the old tribal [[grad (Slavic settlement)|gords]], many of them built in Greater Poland during the later part of the 9th century and soon thereafter, which were destroyed by the advancing Gniezno tribal population. The gords in Sp\u0142awie, [[Wrze\u015bnia]] County and in Daleszyn, [[Gosty\u0144]] County, for example, both built soon after 899, were attacked and taken over by the Piast state forces, the first one burned during the initial period of the armed expansion. The old gords were often rebuilt or replaced beginning in the first decades of the 10th century by new, large and massively reinforced Piast gords. Connected by water communication lines, the powerful gords of the mid-10th century served as the main concentrations of forces of the emerging state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 147\u2013149, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nParallel with the gord building activity of ca. 920-50, the Piasts undertook military expansion by crossing the [[Warta]] River and moving south and west within the [[Oder River]] basin. The entire network of tribal gords between the [[Obra River|Obra]] and [[Barycz (river)|Barycz]] rivers, among other places, was eliminated.<ref name=\"JB\"/><ref>''My nie z Gniezna, ale z Giecza'' by Piotr Bojarski, Gazeta Wyborcza July 2, 2007</ref> The conquered population was often resettled to central Greater Poland, which resulted in partial depopulation of previously well-developed regions. At the end of this stage of the Piast state formation new Piast gords were built in the (north) [[Note\u0107]] River area and other outlying areas of the annexed lands, for example in [[Santok]] and [[\u015arem]] around 970. During the following decade the job of unifying the core of the early Piast state was finished\u2014besides Greater Poland with [[Kujawy]] it included also much of central Poland. [[Masovia]] and parts of [[Pomerania]] found themselves increasingly under the Piast influence, while the southbound expansion was for the time being stalled, because large portions of Lesser Poland and Silesia were controlled by the Czech state.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 148\u2013149, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe expanding Piast state developed a professional military force. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Mieszko collected taxes in the form of weights used for trading and spent those taxes as monthly pay for his warriors. He had three thousand heavily armored mounted soldiers alone, whose quality according to Ibrahim was very impressive. Mieszko provided for all their equipment and needs, even military pay for their children regardless of their gender, from the moment they were born. This force was supported by a much greater number of foot fighters.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 193\u2013194, Zofia Kurnatowska, Marek Derwich</ref> Numerous armaments were found in the Piast gords, many of them of foreign, e.g. [[Franks|Frankish]] or [[Scandinavia]]n origin. Mercenaries from these regions, as well as [[Germany|German]] and [[Normans|Norman]] knights, constituted a significant element of Mieszko's elite fighting guard.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 149\u2013150, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== Revenue generating measures and conquests ===\n\nTo sustain this military machine and meet other state expenses, large amounts of revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, [[Prague]] in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities in this part of Europe. From [[Krak\u00f3w]], the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. ''The Life of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]]'', written at the end of the 10th century by [[John Canaparius]], records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time.<ref name=\"UzP 150\"/> Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century [[Gniezno Doors]]. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.<ref name=\"UzP 150\"/>\n\nMieszko thus strove to subdue [[Pomerania]] at the [[Baltic coast]]. The area was the site of wealthy trade emporia, frequently visited by traders, especially from the east, west and north. Mieszko had every reason to believe that great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as [[Wolin]], [[Szczecin]] and [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]].<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 150\u2013151, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe Piast state reached the mouth of the [[Vistula]] first. Based on the investigations of the gords erected along the middle and lower Vistula, it appears that the lower Vistula waterway was under Piast control from about the mid-10th century. A powerful gord built in [[Gda\u0144sk]], under Mieszko at the latest, solidified Piast rule over [[Pomerelia]]. However, the mouth of the [[Oder River]] was firmly controlled by the [[Jomsvikings]] and the [[Volinians]], who were allied with the [[Veleti]].<ref name=\"Polityka\"/> \"The Veleti are fighting Mieszko\", reported Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, \"and their military might is great\".<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/> [[Widukind of Corvey|Widukind]] wrote about events of 963 that  involved the person of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[count]] [[Wichmann the Younger]], an adventurer exiled from his country. According to Widukind, \"Wichmann went to the barbarians (probably the Veleti or the Wolinians) and leading them (...) defeated Mieszko twice, killed his brother, and acquired a great deal of spoils\".<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/> [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] also reports that Mieszko with his people became subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] in 963, together with other Slavic entities such as the [[Sorbs|Lusatians]] who were forced into subjection by the powerful [[Margrave]] [[Gero]] of the [[Saxon Eastern March]].<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/>\n\n=== Mieszko's relationship with Emperor Otto I ===\n\nSeries of military reverses and detrimental relationships, which involved the Czech [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslids]] allied with the Veleti besides rivals, compelled Mieszko to seek the support of the German Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]]. After the contacts were made, Widukind described Mieszko as \"a friend of the emperor\".<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/> A pact was negotiated and finalized no later than 965. The price Mieszko had to pay for the imperial protection was acceptance of the status of the emperor's [[vassal]]. He paid him tribute from the lands up to the [[Warta River]] and very likely also made a promise to accept Christianity.<ref name=\"UzP 151\"/>\n\n=== Mieszko's acceptance of Christianity ===\n\nIn response to immediate practical concerns, the [[Christianity|Christian]] Church was installed in Poland in its Western [[Latin Rite]],{{Ref label|h|h|none}} an act that brought Mieszko's country into sphere of ancient [[Mediterranean]] culture. Of the issues requiring urgent attention, the preeminent one was the increasing pressure of the eastbound expansion of the German state (between the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder River|Oder]] rivers) and its plans to control the parallel expansion of the Church through the [[Archbishop|archdiocese]] in [[Magdeburg]], the establishment of which was finalized in 968.<ref name=\"UzP 144\"/><ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 154, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe so-called [[Baptism of Poland]] and the attendant processes did not take place through Mieszko's German connections. At that time, Mieszko was in the process of fixing an uneasy relationship with the Bohemian state of [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]]. The difficulties were caused mainly by Czech cooperation with the [[Veleti]]. Already in 964, the two parties arrived at an agreement on that and other issues.<ref>[[J.A. Sobiesiak]] \u2013 ''Boles\u0142aw II Przemy\u015blida'' ([[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus II the Pious]]), p. 89, Avalon 2006</ref> In 965, Mieszko married Boleslaus' daughter [[Doubravka of Bohemia|Doubravka]]. Mieszko's chosen Christian princess, a woman possibly in her twenties,<ref>[[Jerzy Strzelczyk]] \u2013 ''Boles\u0142aw Chrobry'' ([[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]])'', p. 15, Pozna\u0144 2003</ref> was a devout Christian and Mieszko's own conversion had to be a part of the deal. This act in fact followed in 966 and initiated the Christianization of Greater Poland, a region that up to that point had not been exposed to Christian influence, unlike Lesser Poland and Silesia. In 968, an independent missionary [[Diocese|bishopric]], reporting directly to the pope, was established, with [[Jordan (bishop of Poland)|Jordan]] installed as the first bishop.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', pp. 154\u2013155, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\nThe scope of the Christianization mission in its early phase was quite limited geographically, and the few relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land. Stone churches and [[Baptistery|baptisteries]] were discovered within the [[Ostr\u00f3w Lednicki]] and [[Pozna\u0144]] gords, and a chapel in [[Gniezno]]. Pozna\u0144 was also the site of the first [[cathedral]], the bishopric seat of Jordan and Bishop [[Unger (bishop of Poland)|Unger]], who followed him.<ref>''U \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 Polski'', p. 156, Zofia Kurnatowska</ref>\n\n=== The early expansion of the Piasts, Great Moravian and Norman contributions ===\n\nNewer research points out some other intriguing possibilities regarding the early origins of the Polish state in Greater Poland. There are indications that the processes that led to the establishment of the Piast state began during the period ca. 890-910. During these years, a tremendous civilizational advancement took place in central Greater Poland, as the unearthed products of all kinds that have been discovered are better made and more elaborate. The timing coincides with the breakdown of the [[Great Moravia]]n state caused by the [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions. Before and after its fall in 905-07, many Great Moravian people, fearing for their lives, had to escape. According to the notes made by [[Constantine VII]], they found refuge in neighboring countries. Decorations found in So\u0142acz graves in [[Pozna\u0144]] have their counterparts in burial sites around [[Nitra]] in [[Slovakia]]. In the Nitra area, there was also in medieval times a well-known clan named Poznan. The above indicates that the Pozna\u0144 town was established by Nitran refugees, and more generally, the immigrants from Great Moravia contributed to the sudden awakening of the otherwise remote and isolated Piast lands.<ref name=\"JB\"/>\n\nThe early expansion of the Gniezno Land tribe very likely began under Mieszko's grandfather Lestek, the probable real founder of the Piast state.<ref name=\"JB\"/> Widukind's chronicle speaks of Mieszko ruling a Slavic nation called \"Licicaviki\", which was what Widukind made out of \"Lestkowicy\": the people of Lestko, or Lestek. Lestek was also reflected in the [[saga]]s of the [[Normans]], who may have played a role in Poland's origins (an accumulation of treasures from the period 930-1000 is attributed to them). Siemomys\u0142 and then Mieszko continued after Lestek, whose tradition was alive within the Piast court when [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]] named one of his sons after him and [[Gallus Anonymous]] wrote his chronicle.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The term \"Lechici\", popular later as a synonym  for \"Poles\", may also have been inspired by Mieszko's grandfather.<ref>Wyrozumski, ''Dzieje Polski piastowskiej'', p. 75</ref>\n\n=== Early capitals, large scale gord construction ===\n\nThere is some disagreement as to the early seat of the ruling clan. Modern archeology has shown that the gord in [[Gniezno]] did not even exist before about 940. This fact eliminates the possibility of Gniezno's early central role, which is what had long been believed, based on the account given by Gallus Anonymus. The relics found in [[Giecz]] (including a great concentration of silver treasures), where the original gord was built some 80 years earlier, point to that location. Other likely early capitals include the old gords of [[Grzybowo, Wrze\u015bnia County|Grzybowo]], [[Kalisz]] or [[Pozna\u0144]]. Pozna\u0144, which is older than Gniezno, was probably the original site of Mieszko's court in the earlier years of his reign. The first cathedral church, a monumental structure, was erected there. The events of 974\u201378, when Mieszko, like his brother-in-law [[Boleslaus II of Bohemia]], supported [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria]], in his rebellion against [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]], created a threat of the emperor's retribution. The situation probably motivated Mieszko to move the government to Gniezno, which was safer due to its more eastern location.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The emperor's response turned out to be ineffective, but this geographical advantage continued in the years to come. The growing importance of Gniezno was reflected in the addition around 980 of a new southern part to the original two segments of the gord. In the existing summary of the ''[[Dagome iudex]]'' document written in 991-92 before Mieszko's death, Mieszko's state is referred to as ''Civitas Gnesnensis'', or the Gniezno State.<ref name=\"JB\"/>\n\nThe enormous effort of the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region who were involved in building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father [[Siemomys\u0142]], the Czechs conquered [[Silesia]] and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community.<ref name=\"JB\"/> A [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian Slav]] uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians).<ref name=\"JB\"/> When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomys\u0142.<ref name=\"JB\"/>\n\n=== Alliance with Germany and conquest of Pomerania ===\n\nFighting the [[Veleti]] from the beginning of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The alliance was natural at this point, because the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when [[Wichmann the Younger|Wichmann]], this time leading forces of the [[Velunzani|Volinians]], was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus]], had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his [[Italy|Italian]] policies.<ref name=\"JB\"/> This new status allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent [[diocese|bishopric]]. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older.<ref name=\"JB\"/> The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with [[Margrave]] [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Hodo]] that followed in the [[Battle of Cedynia]] of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of [[Pomerania]]. [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]] however remained autonomous and pagan. [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], where a strong gord was built around 985, was probably the actual center of Piast power in [[Pomerania]].<ref name=\"UzP 157, 161\u2013162\"/> Before, a Scandinavian colony in [[Bardy-\u015awielubie]] near Ko\u0142obrzeg functioned as the center of this area.<ref name=\"Polityka\"/> The western part of Mieszko controlled Pomerania (the region referred to by Polish historians as [[Farther Pomerania|Western Pomerania]], roughly within the current Polish borders, as opposed to [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania]] or [[Pomerelia]]), which became independent of Poland [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005]], when Poland was ruled by Mieszko's son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave|Boles\u0142aw]].<ref>Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, 1999, p.32, {{ISBN|83-906184-8-6}} {{OCLC|43087092}}:pagan reaction of 1005</ref><ref>Werner Buchholz, ''Pommern'', Siedler, 1999, p.25, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}: pagan uprising that also ended the Polish suzerainty in 1005</ref><ref>J\u00fcrgen Petersohn, ''Der s\u00fcdliche Ostseeraum im kirchlich-politischen Kr\u00e4ftespiel des Reichs, Polens und D\u00e4nemarks vom 10. bis 13.

[[Masovia]] was still more loosely associated with the Piast state, while the [[Sandomierz]] region was for a while their southern outpost.<ref name=\"UzP 157, 161\u2013162\"/>\n\nThe construction of powerful Piast gords in western [[Silesia]] region along the [[Oder River]] ([[G\u0142og\u00f3w]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[Opole]]) took place by 985 at the latest. The alliance with the Czechs was by that time over; Queen  Doubravka, a member of the Czech royal family, died in 977. Mieszko, allied with Germany, then fought the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslids]] and took over part of Silesia and then also eastern [[Lesser Poland]] (the [[Lendians|Lendian]] lands). In 989, [[Krak\u00f3w]] with the rest of Lesser Poland was taken over. That region, autonomous under the Czech rule, also enjoyed a special status within the Piast state.<ref name=\"Polski p. 164\"/> In 990, eastern Silesia was added, which completed the Piast takeover of southern Poland. By the end of Mieszko's life, his state included the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] lands in geographic proximity and connected by natural features to the Piast territorial nucleus of Greater Poland. Those lands have sometimes been regarded by historians as \"[[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]]\", or ethnically Polish, even though in the 10th century, all the western Slavic tribes, including the Czechs, were quite similar linguistically.<ref name=\"UzP 162\u2013163\"/>\n\nSilver treasures, common in the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, are found also in Slavic areas including Poland, especially northern Poland. Silver objects, coins and decorations, often cut into pieces, are believed to have served as currency units, brought in by Jewish and Arab traders, but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige. The process of hiding or depositing them, besides protecting them from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual.<ref name=\"UzP 152\u2013153\"/>\n\nA treasure located in G\u00f3ra Str\u0119kowa, [[Bia\u0142ystok]] County, hidden after 901, includes [[dirham|dirhem]] coins  minted between 764 and 901 and Slavic decorations made in southern [[Ruthenia]] that show Byzantine influence. This find is a manifestation of a 10th-century trade route running all the way from [[Central Asia]] through [[Byzantium]], [[Kiev]], the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] rivers basins and [[Masovia]] to the [[Baltic Sea]] shores.
