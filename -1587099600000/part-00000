[[Josephus]] testifies to the presence of a Jewish population in the city. A decree of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius I]] from 379 regarding the persecution of Jews and destruction of [[synagogue]]s in [[Illyria]] and [[Thrace]] is also proof of early Jewish settlement in Bulgaria.\n\n==Bulgarian Empire==\nAfter the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and its recognition in 681, a number of Jews suffering persecution in the [[Byzantine Empire]] may have settled in Bulgaria. Jews also settled in [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] in 967. Some arrived from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and [[Italy]], when merchants from these lands were allowed to trade in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Ivan Asen II]]. Later, Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] married a Jewish woman, [[Sarah (Theodora)|Sarah (renamed Theodora)]], who had converted to Christianity and had considerable influence in the court. She influenced her spouse to create the [[Tsardom of Vidin]] for her son [[Ivan Shishman]], who was also a Jew according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], which determines religion [[Matrilineality in Judaism|according to the mother]]. Despite her Jewish past, she was fiercely pro-Church, which in those times was accompanied with anti-semitism. For example, in 1352, the church council ordered the expulsion of Jews Bulgaria for \"heretical activity\", (though this decree was not rigorously implemented).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zzci446GLakC&pg=PA28&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb-J30_qjRAhVCaRQKHdVVCqUQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false|title=The Bulgarian Jews and the Final Solution, 1940\u20131944 |last=Chary |first=Frederick B. |date=1972-11-15 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=|isbn=9780822976011|location=|pages=28|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> Physical attacks on Jews followed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xNYmFwyCdkC&pg=PA109&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false |title=At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities |last=R\u0103dvan |first=Lauren\u021biu |date=2010-01-01 |publisher=Brill |year= |isbn=9004180109 |location= |pages=109 |language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In one case, three Jews who had been sentenced to death were killed by a mob despite the sentences having been repealed by the tsar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/BG |title=World Jewish Congress|last=Congress|first=World Jewish|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe medieval Jewish population of Bulgaria was [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] until the 14th to 15th centuries, when [[Ashkenazim]] from [[Hungary]] (1376) and other parts of Europe began to arrive.\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}\nBy the completion of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Bulgarian Empire (1396), there were sizable Jewish communities in [[Vidin]], Nikopol, [[Silistra]], [[Pleven]], [[Sofia]], [[Yambol]], [[Plovdiv]] (Philippopolis) and [[Stara Zagora]].\n\nIn 1470, Ashkenazim banished from [[Bavaria]] arrived, and contemporary travellers remarked that [[Yiddish]] could often be heard in Sofia. An Ashkenazi prayer book was printed in [[Thessaloniki|Saloniki]] by the rabbi of Sofia in the middle of the 16th century. Beginning in 1494, [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] exiles from Spain migrated to Bulgaria via Salonika, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], Italy, Ragusa, and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. They settled in pre-existing Jewish population-centres, which were also the major trade centres of Ottoman-ruled Bulgaria. At this point, Sofia was host to three separate Jewish communities: Romaniotes, Ashkenazim and Sephardim. This would continue until 1640, when a single rabbi was appointed for all three groups.\n\nIn the 17th century, the ideas of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] became popular in Bulgaria, and supporters of his movement, such as [[Nathan of Gaza]] and Samuel Primo, were active in Sofia. Jews continued to settle in various parts of the country (including in new trade centres such as [[Pazardzhik]]), and were able to expand their economic activities due to the privileges they were given and due to the banishment of many [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchants who had taken part in the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] of 1688.\n\n==Modern Bulgaria==\nA [[Liberation of Bulgaria|modern nation-state of Bulgaria]] was formed under the terms of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]. Under the terms of that treaty, Bulgarian Jews of the new country were granted equal rights. In 1909, the massive and grand new [[Sofia Synagogue]] was consecrated in the presence of [[Tsar]] [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] as well as ministers and other important guests, an important event for Bulgarian Jewry.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Sofia |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/sofia |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> Jews were drafted into the [[Bulgarian army]] and fought in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885), in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912-13), and in the [[First World War]]. 211 Jewish soldiers of the Bulgarian army were recorded as having died during World War I.{{r|stefanov2002}} The [[Treaty of Neuilly]] after [[World War I]] emphasized Jews' equality with other Bulgarian citizens.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1936, the nationalist and anti-semitic organization [[Ratniks|Ratnik]] was established.\n\nIn the years preceding [[World War II]], the population growth rate of the Jewish community lagged behind that of other ethnic groups. In 1920, there were 16,000 Jews, amounting to 0.9% of Bulgarians. By 1934, although the size of the Jewish community had grown to 48,565, with more than half living in Sofia, that only amounted to 0.8% of the general population. [[Ladino language|Ladino]] was the dominant language in most communities, but the young often preferred speaking [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

On the eve of the planned deportations, the Bulgarian government made inquiries regarding the destination of the deportees and asked to be reimbursed for the costs of deportation. German representatives indicated that the deportees would be used as labour in agricultural and military projects.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} As recorded in the [[German Archives]], Nazi Germany paid 7,144.317&nbsp;[[leva]] for the deportation of 3,545 adults and 592 children destined for the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].{{r|maconline}} 4,500 [[History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia|Jews]] from Greek [[Thrace and Eastern Macedonia]] were deported to occupied Poland, and 7,144 from [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Pomoravlje District|Pomoravlje]] were sent to Treblinka.

News of the deportations in the occupied territories incited protest among opposition politicians, members of the clergy and intellectuals in Bulgaria. While [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Tsar Boris III]] was initially inclined to continue with the planned deportations, deputy speaker of parliament and prominent member of the ruling party [[Dimitar Peshev]] persuaded him to delay. On March 19, 1943, Peshev introduced a parliamentary resolution to halt the deportations; the resolution was rejected by the ruling party, which forced his resignation by the end of the month. Peshev's resignation was followed by further protests, notably from [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Metropolitan Stefan I]], which persuaded the tsar to suspend the deportations indefinitely in May 1943. Shortly thereafter, the Bulgarian government expelled 20,000 Jews from Sofia to the provinces. Special trains were arranged and the Jews were assigned specific departures, separating family members.

Jews have had a continuous presence in historic [[Bulgarian lands across the Danube|Bulgarian lands]] since before the 2nd century CE, and have often played an important part in the [[history of Bulgaria]].\n\nToday, the majority of [[Bulgarian Jews in Israel|Bulgarian Jews live in Israel]], while modern-day Bulgaria continues to host a modest Jewish population.\n\n==Roman era==\nJews are believed to have settled in the region after the Roman conquest in 46 CE.{{when|date=October 2015}} Ruins of \"sumptuous\"{{r|stefanov2002}} second-century synagogues have been unearthed in [[Philippopolis (Thrace)|Philipopolis]]<ref name=Kesiakova/> (modern [[Plovdiv]]),  [[Nicopolis]] ([[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]]), [[Oescus|Ulpia Oescus]]{{r|kochev}} ([[Gigen]], [[Pleven Province]]), and [[Stobi]]<ref name=kraabel/> (now in [[North Macedonia]]).{{r|stefanov2002}} The earliest written artifact attesting to the presence of a [[Jewish community]] in the Roman province of [[Moesia Inferior]] is a late 2nd-century CE [[Latin]] inscription found at Ulpia Oescus bearing a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] and mentioning ''archisynagogos''. [[Josephus]] testifies to the presence of a Jewish population in the city. A decree of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius I]] from 379 regarding the persecution of Jews and destruction of [[synagogue]]s in [[Illyria]] and [[Thrace]] is also proof of early Jewish settlement in Bulgaria.\n\n==Bulgarian Empire==\nAfter the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and its recognition in 681, a number of Jews suffering persecution in the [[Byzantine Empire]] may have settled in Bulgaria. Jews also settled in [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] in 967. Some arrived from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and [[Italy]], when merchants from these lands were allowed to trade in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Ivan Asen II]]. Later, Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] married a Jewish woman, [[Sarah (Theodora)|Sarah (renamed Theodora)]], who had converted to Christianity and had considerable influence in the court. She influenced her spouse to create the [[Tsardom of Vidin]] for her son [[Ivan Shishman]], who was also a Jew according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], which determines religion [[Matrilineality in Judaism|according to the mother]]. Despite her Jewish past, she was fiercely pro-Church, which in those times was accompanied with anti-semitism. For example, in 1352, the church council ordered the expulsion of Jews Bulgaria for \"heretical activity\", (though this decree was not rigorously implemented).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zzci446GLakC&pg=PA28&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb-J30_qjRAhVCaRQKHdVVCqUQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false|title=The Bulgarian Jews and the Final Solution, 1940\u20131944 |last=Chary |first=Frederick B. |date=1972-11-15 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=|isbn=9780822976011|location=|pages=28|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> Physical attacks on Jews followed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xNYmFwyCdkC&pg=PA109&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false |title=At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities |last=R\u0103dvan |first=Lauren\u021biu |date=2010-01-01 |publisher=Brill |year= |isbn=9004180109 |location= |pages=109 |language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In one case, three Jews who had been sentenced to death were killed by a mob despite the sentences having been repealed by the tsar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/BG |title=World Jewish Congress|last=Congress|first=World Jewish|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe medieval Jewish population of Bulgaria was [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] until the 14th to 15th centuries, when [[Ashkenazim]] from [[Hungary]] (1376) and other parts of Europe began to arrive.\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}\nBy the completion of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Bulgarian Empire (1396), there were sizable Jewish communities in [[Vidin]], Nikopol, [[Silistra]], [[Pleven]], [[Sofia]], [[Yambol]], [[Plovdiv]] (Philippopolis) and [[Stara Zagora]].\n\nIn 1470, Ashkenazim banished from [[Bavaria]] arrived, and contemporary travellers remarked that [[Yiddish]] could often be heard in Sofia. An Ashkenazi prayer book was printed in [[Thessaloniki|Saloniki]] by the rabbi of Sofia in the middle of the 16th century. Beginning in 1494, [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] exiles from Spain migrated to Bulgaria via Salonika, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], Italy, Ragusa, and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. They settled in pre-existing Jewish population-centres, which were also the major trade centres of Ottoman-ruled Bulgaria. At this point, Sofia was host to three separate Jewish communities: Romaniotes, Ashkenazim and Sephardim. This would continue until 1640, when a single rabbi was appointed for all three groups.\n\nIn the 17th century, the ideas of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] became popular in Bulgaria, and supporters of his movement, such as [[Nathan of Gaza]] and Samuel Primo, were active in Sofia. Jews continued to settle in various parts of the country (including in new trade centres such as [[Pazardzhik]]), and were able to expand their economic activities due to the privileges they were given and due to the banishment of many [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchants who had taken part in the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] of 1688.\n\n==Modern Bulgaria==\nA [[Liberation of Bulgaria|modern nation-state of Bulgaria]] was formed under the terms of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]. Under the terms of that treaty, Bulgarian Jews of the new country were granted equal rights. In 1909, the massive and grand new [[Sofia Synagogue]] was consecrated in the presence of [[Tsar]] [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] as well as ministers and other important guests, an important event for Bulgarian Jewry.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Sofia |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/sofia |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> Jews were drafted into the [[Bulgarian army]] and fought in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885), in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912-13), and in the [[First World War]]. 211 Jewish soldiers of the Bulgarian army were recorded as having died during World War I.{{r|stefanov2002}} The [[Treaty of Neuilly]] after [[World War I]] emphasized Jews' equality with other Bulgarian citizens.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1936, the nationalist and anti-semitic organization [[Ratniks|Ratnik]] was established.\n\nIn the years preceding [[World War II]], the population growth rate of the Jewish community lagged behind that of other ethnic groups. In 1920, there were 16,000 Jews, amounting to 0.9% of Bulgarians. By 1934, although the size of the Jewish community had grown to 48,565, with more than half living in Sofia, that only amounted to 0.8% of the general population.

It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a ''sushi'' or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a [[hangiri]], which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle ([[shamoji]]).\n\nSushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from [[glutinous rice]]. Freshly harvested rice (''shinmai'') typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some [[fusion cuisine]] restaurants, short-grain [[brown rice]] and [[wild rice]] are also used.\n\nThere are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the [[Kant\u014d region]] (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in [[Kansai region]] (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.\n\n===''Nori''===\n[[File:Nori.jpg|thumb|Sheets of [[nori]].]]\n{{Main|Nori}}The black seaweed wrappers used in ''makimono'' are called ''[[nori]]'' (\u6d77\u82d4). ''Nori'' is a type of [[algae]], traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making [[rice paper]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VWLTngEACAAJ&dq|title=The Japanese Kitchen: 250 Recipes in a Traditional Spirit|last=Shimbo|first=Hiroko|date=2000-11-08|publisher=Harvard Common Press|isbn=9781558321779|location=|pages=128|language=en|quote=Unlike wakame, kombu, and hijiki, which are sold in the form of individual leaves, nori is sold as a sheet made from small, soft, dark brown algae, which have been cultivated in bays and lagoons since the middle of the Edo Era (1600 to 1868). The technique of drying the collected algae on wooden frames was borrowed from famous Japanese paper-making industry.}}</ref> Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.\n\nThe size of a ''nori'' sheet influences the size of ''makimono''. A full-size sheet produces ''futomaki'', and a half produces ''hosomaki'' and ''temaki''. To produce ''gunkan'' and some other ''makimono'', an appropriately-sized piece of ''nori'' is cut from a whole sheet.\n\n''Nori'' by itself is an edible snack and is available with [[salt]] or flavored with [[teriyaki]] sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.\n\nWhen making ''fukusazushi'', a paper-thin [[omelette]] may replace a sheet of ''nori'' as the wrapping. The [[omelette]] is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan, known as a ''[[makiyakinabe]]'', and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E93DajzW57cC&q=fukusazushi&dq=fukusazushi|title=Simply sushi|last=Pallett|first=Steven|date=2004|publisher=Hinkler Books|isbn=9781741219722|location=|pages=289|language=en|quote=}}</ref>\n\n===''Gu''===\n[[File:Wagyu sushi 01.jpg|thumb|''Sushi'' made of meats other than fish (whether raw or cooked) is a variation often seen in Japan.]]\n[[File:Whole-eel.jpg|thumb|right|''Yaki anago-ippon-nigiri'' ({{nihongo2|\u713c\u304d\u30a2\u30ca\u30b4\u4e00\u672c\u63e1\u308a}})&nbsp;\u2013 a roasted and sweet-sauced whole conger]]\n[[File:Fried-shrimp.jpg|thumb|right|''Ebifurai-maki'' ({{nihongo2|\u30a8\u30d3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u5dfb\u304d}})&nbsp;\u2013 fried-shrimp roll]]\n[[File:Datemaki.JPG|thumb|right|''Date-Maki'' ({{nihongo2|\u4f0a\u9054\u5dfb}})&nbsp;\u2013 ''futomaki'' wrapped with sweet [[tamagoyaki]]]]\n{{Main|List of sushi and sashimi ingredients}}The ingredients used inside sushi are called ''gu'', and are, typically, varieties of fish.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wIOcYVPYfkAC&pg=PP56&dq=neta+sushi#v=onepage&q=neta%20sushi&f=false|title=The Connoisseur's Guide to Sushi: Everything You Need to Know about Sushi Varieties and Accompaniments, Etiquette and Dining Tips, and More|last=Lowry|first=Dave|date=2005|publisher=Harvard Common Press|isbn=9781558323070|language=en}}</ref> For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked.

Commonly used fish are [[tuna]] (''maguro, shiro-maguro''), [[Japanese amberjack]], yellowtail (''hamachi''), [[Eastern nannygai|snapper]] (''kurodai''), [[Mackerel (food)|mackerel]] (''saba''), and [[Salmon (food)|salmon]] (''sake''). The most valued sushi ingredient is ''toro,'' the fatty cut of the fish.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AR_Zq_GIHtAC&pg=PA95|title=American Tuna: The Rise and Fall of an Improbable Food|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|date=2012-08-08|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520261846|location=|pages=95|language=en}}</ref> This comes in a variety of ''\u014dtoro'' (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and ''[[ch\u016btoro]]'', meaning \"middle toro\", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between ''toro'' and the regular cut.

In Japan, [[green tea]] (''ocha'') is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as ''[[mecha tea|mecha]]''. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as ''agari''.\n\nSushi may be garnished with [[Arctium#Food and drink|gobo]], grated [[daikon]], thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.\n\nWhen closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called ''baran'' or ''kiri-zasa'' (\u5207\u308a\u7b39). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the ''[[Aspidistra elatior]]'' (\u8449\u862d ''haran'') and ''Sasa veitchii'' (\u718a\u7b39 ''kuma-zasa'') plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial [[phytoncide]]s when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Bento grass|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/01/15/reference/bento-grass/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2008-01-15|access-date = 2015-12-08|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US|first = Alice|last = Gordenker}}</ref> Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and ''wasabi'' included with the dish.<ref>{{cite web |date=June 21, 2010 |title=Culinary Curiosities: That plastic leaf in sushi |url=http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2010/06/21/plastic-sushi-lea/ |publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\n==Nutrition==\n[[File:Sushi Bento in Aeon Mall BSD City Indonesia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Sushi in shops are usually sold in plastic trays.]]\nThe main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in [[protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s (the rice only), [[vitamin]]s, and minerals, as are ''gari'' and ''nori''.

''The Sushi Economy''. Gotham Books: 2007</ref> Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a ''[[bento]]'', a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.\n\nSoy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish, or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping, not the rice, and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/603883 |title=Are you sushi savvy? |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2009-11-09 | first=Kim | last=Honey | date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down, one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using ''[[Gari (ginger)|gari]]'' (sliced ginger) as a brush. Toppings that have their own sauce (such as eel) should not be eaten with soy sauce.\n\nTraditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of ''wasabi'' to the ''sushi'' while preparing it, and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is, since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of ''wasabi'' to use. However, today ''wasabi'' is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve ''wasabi'' on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is ''wasabi'' already in the dish.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Lowry\n| first = Dave\n| title = The Connoisseur's Guide to Sushi\n| publisher = [[Harvard Common Press]]\n| year = 2005\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/connoisseursguid00lowr/page/273 273]\n| isbn = 978-1-55832-307-0\n| url = https://archive.org/details/connoisseursguid00lowr\n| url-access = registration\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Preparation utensils\n!Utensil\n!Definition\n|-\n|''Fukin''\n|Kitchen cloth\n|-\n|''[[Hangiri]]''\n|Rice barrel\n|-\n|''[[Japanese cutlery|Hocho]]''\n|Kitchen knives\n|-\n|''[[Makisu]]''\n|Bamboo rolling mat\n|-\n|''[[Ryoribashi]]'' or ''[[Saibashi]]''\n|Cooking chopsticks\n|-\n|''[[Shamoji]]''\n|Wooden rice paddle\n|-\n|''[[Makiyakinabe]]''\n|Rectangular omelette pan\n|-\n|''[[Oshizushihako]]''\n|a mold used to make ''oshizushi''\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Tuna Sushi.jpg|''Toro nigiri'' (fatty tuna belly) ({{nihongo2|\u9baa\u3068\u308d\u63e1\u308a}})\nFile:Salmon sushi.jpg|Salmon roll ({{nihongo2|\u5dfb\u304d\u9bad}})\nFile:Kakinohazusi.jpg|''Kakinoha'' ([[persimmon]] leaf) sushi ({{nihongo2|\u67ff\u306e\u8449\u5bff\u53f8}})\nFile:Chakin-sushi2.JPG|''Chakin-sushi'', wrapped in thin omelette.

The filling is in the center surrounded by ''nori'', then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as [[roe]] or toasted [[Sesame|sesame seeds]]. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots.\n\nExamples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced ''maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake'' and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).\n\nIn Japan, ''uramaki'' is an uncommon type of ''makimono''; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.<ref name=\"sushimasters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.calrice.org/Cuisine/History+of+Sushi/Sushi+Pioneers.htm |title=Sushi Pioneers |work=SushiMasters |access-date=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411172107/http://www.calrice.org/Cuisine/History+of+Sushi/Sushi+Pioneers.htm |archive-date=2013-04-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===American-style ''makizushi''===\n[[File:Golden Maki Rainbow Roll sushi.jpg|thumb|Rainbow roll, ''uramaki'' with multiple fillings including shrimp tempura, salmon, avocado, mango, with rice mixed with ''tobiko'']]\n''[[#Makizushi|Futomaki]]'' is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States, and comes in variations that take their names from their places of origin.

It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a ''sushi'' or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a [[hangiri]], which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle ([[shamoji]]).\n\nSushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from [[glutinous rice]]. Freshly harvested rice (''shinmai'') typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some [[fusion cuisine]] restaurants, short-grain [[brown rice]] and [[wild rice]] are also used.\n\nThere are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the [[Kant\u014d region]] (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in [[Kansai region]] (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.\n\n===''Nori''===\n[[File:Nori.jpg|thumb|Sheets of [[nori]].]]\n{{Main|Nori}}The black seaweed wrappers used in ''makimono'' are called ''[[nori]]'' (\u6d77\u82d4). ''Nori'' is a type of [[algae]], traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making [[rice paper]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VWLTngEACAAJ&dq|title=The Japanese Kitchen: 250 Recipes in a Traditional Spirit|last=Shimbo|first=Hiroko|date=2000-11-08|publisher=Harvard Common Press|isbn=9781558321779|location=|pages=128|language=en|quote=Unlike wakame, kombu, and hijiki, which are sold in the form of individual leaves, nori is sold as a sheet made from small, soft, dark brown algae, which have been cultivated in bays and lagoons since the middle of the Edo Era (1600 to 1868). The technique of drying the collected algae on wooden frames was borrowed from famous Japanese paper-making industry.}}</ref> Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.\n\nThe size of a ''nori'' sheet influences the size of ''makimono''. A full-size sheet produces ''futomaki'', and a half produces ''hosomaki'' and ''temaki''. To produce ''gunkan'' and some other ''makimono'', an appropriately-sized piece of ''nori'' is cut from a whole sheet.\n\n''Nori'' by itself is an edible snack and is available with [[salt]] or flavored with [[teriyaki]] sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.\n\nWhen making ''fukusazushi'', a paper-thin [[omelette]] may replace a sheet of ''nori'' as the wrapping.

In Japan, [[green tea]] (''ocha'') is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as ''[[mecha tea|mecha]]''. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as ''agari''.\n\nSushi may be garnished with [[Arctium#Food and drink|gobo]], grated [[daikon]], thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.\n\nWhen closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called ''baran'' or ''kiri-zasa'' (\u5207\u308a\u7b39). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the ''[[Aspidistra elatior]]'' (\u8449\u862d ''haran'') and ''Sasa veitchii'' (\u718a\u7b39 ''kuma-zasa'') plants, respectively.

As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and ''wasabi'' included with the dish.<ref>{{cite web |date=June 21, 2010 |title=Culinary Curiosities: That plastic leaf in sushi |url=http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2010/06/21/plastic-sushi-lea/ |publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\n==Nutrition==\n[[File:Sushi Bento in Aeon Mall BSD City Indonesia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Sushi in shops are usually sold in plastic trays.]]\nThe main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in [[protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s (the rice only), [[vitamin]]s, and minerals, as are ''gari'' and ''nori''.

''The Sushi Economy''. Gotham Books: 2007</ref> Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a ''[[bento]]'', a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.\n\nSoy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish, or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping, not the rice, and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/603883 |title=Are you sushi savvy? |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2009-11-09 | first=Kim | last=Honey | date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down, one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using ''[[Gari (ginger)|gari]]'' (sliced ginger) as a brush. Toppings that have their own sauce (such as eel) should not be eaten with soy sauce.\n\nTraditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of ''wasabi'' to the ''sushi'' while preparing it, and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is, since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of ''wasabi'' to use. However, today ''wasabi'' is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve ''wasabi'' on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is ''wasabi'' already in the dish.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Lowry\n| first = Dave\n| title = The Connoisseur's Guide to Sushi\n| publisher = [[Harvard Common Press]]\n| year = 2005\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/connoisseursguid00lowr/page/273 273]\n| isbn = 978-1-55832-307-0\n| url = https://archive.org/details/connoisseursguid00lowr\n| url-access = registration\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Preparation utensils\n!Utensil\n!Definition\n|-\n|''Fukin''\n|Kitchen cloth\n|-\n|''[[Hangiri]]''\n|Rice barrel\n|-\n|''[[Japanese cutlery|Hocho]]''\n|Kitchen knives\n|-\n|''[[Makisu]]''\n|Bamboo rolling mat\n|-\n|''[[Ryoribashi]]'' or ''[[Saibashi]]''\n|Cooking chopsticks\n|-\n|''[[Shamoji]]''\n|Wooden rice paddle\n|-\n|''[[Makiyakinabe]]''\n|Rectangular omelette pan\n|-\n|''[[Oshizushihako]]''\n|a mold used to make ''oshizushi''\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Tuna Sushi.jpg|''Toro nigiri'' (fatty tuna belly) ({{nihongo2|\u9baa\u3068\u308d\u63e1\u308a}})\nFile:Salmon sushi.jpg|Salmon roll ({{nihongo2|\u5dfb\u304d\u9bad}})\nFile:Kakinohazusi.jpg|''Kakinoha'' ([[persimmon]] leaf) sushi ({{nihongo2|\u67ff\u306e\u8449\u5bff\u53f8}})\nFile:Chakin-sushi2.JPG|''Chakin-sushi'', wrapped in thin omelette.

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use).\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nEnglish ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''\u0121\u0113ar'' ({{IPA|/j\u025bar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''\u0121\u0113r'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*j\u01e3ran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#\u0113\u2081 and \u0113\u2082|\u0113\u2081]]<nowiki>ran</nowiki>'').\nCognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''j\u0101r'', [[Old Norse]] ''\u00e1r'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:\ud800\udf3e\ud800\udf34\ud800\udf42|jer]]'',<!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--> from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh\u2081-|*yeh\u2081r-om]]}}'' \"year, season\". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

Vatican City: Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Specolo Vaticano, p.  223</ref> Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years,   the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is {{gaps|365.242|5}} days; with a relative error below one [[Parts per million|ppm]] (8\u00b710<sup>\u22127</sup>)  relative to the current length of the mean tropical year ({{gaps|365.242|19}} days) and even closer to the current ''March equinox year'' of {{gaps|365.242|374}} days that it aims to match.   It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#y\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = M18 (Glossary)\n}}</ref> (= 365.24219 days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 5, 07:48 UT in 2020), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 11:35 UT in 2020). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is 365.259636 days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]] and the [[UK Hydrographic Office]]\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |pages = A1, C2\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Draconic year {{anchor|Draconitic year}} ===\n{{further|Draconic period}}\nThe draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).\n\n=== Besselian year === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] -->\nThe [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280\u00b0. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010\n |year=2008\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = B3\n|title-link=Astronomical Almanac\n }}</ref>\n: B = 1900.0 + (Julian date<sub>TT</sub> \u2212 {{val|2415020.31352}}) / {{val|365.242198781}}\n\nThe TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].<!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' -->\n\n=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nThe exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.\n* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.\n}}</ref> They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English \"[[:wikt:year|year]]\", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g).

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''

Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#y\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = M18 (Glossary)\n}}</ref> (= 365.24219 days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 5, 07:48 UT in 2020), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 11:35 UT in 2020). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is 365.259636 days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]] and the [[UK Hydrographic Office]]\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |pages = A1, C2\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Draconic year {{anchor|Draconitic year}} ===\n{{further|Draconic period}}\nThe draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).\n\n=== Besselian year === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] -->\nThe [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280\u00b0. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010\n |year=2008\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = B3\n|title-link=Astronomical Almanac\n }}</ref>\n: B = 1900.0 + (Julian date<sub>TT</sub> \u2212 {{val|2415020.31352}}) / {{val|365.242198781}}\n\nThe TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].<!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' -->\n\n=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nThe exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.\n* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

For example, the [[dinosaur]] species ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was abundant approximately 66 Ma (66 million years) ago. The duration term \"ago\" may not always be indicated: if the quantity of a duration is specified while not explicitly mentioning a duration term, one can assume that \"ago\" is implied; the alternative unit \"mya\" does include \"ago\" explicitly.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.\n}}</ref> They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English \"[[:wikt:year|year]]\", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. \"22,000 years ago\" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a [[Before Present]] (\"BP\") date.\n\nThese abbreviations include:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{Anchor|mya}}Non-SI abbreviation\n!
