This was made by a [[Tin-glazing|tin-glaze process]] (dip, dry, paint, fire), resulting in an opaque white glazed surface decorated with brush-painting in metal oxide enamel colour(s).\n\nDuring the 17th century, the English added the letter ''j'' to their alphabet<ref>Charles Butler, ''English Grammer, 1633, London'',  \"The first English language book to make a clear distinction between ''i'' and ''j'' was published in 1633.\"</ref>. ''Maiolica'' was commonly anglicized to ''majolica'' thereafter.\n\n<em>Secondly</em>, there is the Victorian mid to late 19th century type of pottery also known as ''majolica'' made by a more simple process (paint, fire) whereby coloured lead glazes were applied direct to an unfired clay mould, typically relief-moulded, resulting in brightly coloured, hard-wearing, inexpensive wares both useful and decorative, typically in naturalistic style.  This type of majolica was introduced to the public at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, later widely copied and mass-produced. Minton & Co., who developed the coloured lead glazes product, also developed and exhibited at the 1851 Exhibition a tin-glazed product in imitation of Italian maiolica which they called also ''majolica''.\n\n==Caution needed with meanings==\nThe Notes in this article append ''tin-glazed'' to the word meaning \"opaque white tin-glaze, painted in enamels\", and ''coloured glazes'' to the word meaning \"coloured lead glazes, applied direct to the biscuit\".\n\n===We understand by ''majolica''===\nLeon Arnoux, the artistic and technical director of [[Mintons]], wrote in 1852 \"We understand by majolica a pottery formed of a calcareous clay gently [[wikt:fire|fired]], and covered with an opaque enamel composed of sand, lead, and tin...\"<ref>Arnoux, Leon, 1853, Lecture 23 ''Lectures on the Results of the Great Exhibition of 1851'', David Bogue, 86 Fleet Street, London. p. 396</ref>.\n<gallery>\nFile:P. 396, Ceramic Manufacturers, Lecture 23, 1852, Leon Arnoux, Mintons.jpg|Leon Arnoux, 1853, describing Minton's tin-glazed product.\n</gallery>\nHe was describing the [[Mintons|Minton & Co.]] [[tin-glazed pottery|tin-glazed]] product made in imitation of Italian [[maiolica]] both in process and in styles.

Much like his previous series ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' on [[Comedy Central]] and later [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''Real Time'' features a [[Panel discussion|panel]] of guests who discuss current events in [[politics]] and the media. Unlike the previous show, guests are usually better versed in the subject matter: more experts such as journalists, professors, and politicians participate in the panel, and fewer actors and celebrities are included.\n\n''Real Time'' is a weekly hour-long program with a studio audience, airing live on Friday nights at 10:00{{nbsp}}pm ET. It originates from Studio 33 (\"The [[Bob Barker]] Studio\") at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]]. In addition, a 10- to 15-minute \"Overtime\" segment quickly follows the show on YouTube (Live Streams), which answers questions posted by viewers through HBO's online website for the show.\n\nThe show's eighteenth season premiered on January 19, 2020.\n\n==Format==\nThe format of the show usually features an opening current events or political [[sketch comedy|skit]], followed by the credits and a comedy monologue. Maher then interviews an important figure via satellite or in-studio before sitting down with the panel guests for an extensive debate. Halfway through the panel session, Maher does a comedy skit that usually satirizes current news items. Following the comedy bit, Maher interviews another figure via satellite or in-studio. The format varies, with two or three people on the panel. Maher explains that the format is not rigid and that they prefer live interviews to satellite interviews.<ref name=\"Wrap\">{{cite web | url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/bill-maher-grilled-8427?page=1 | title=Bill Maher: Grilled | author=Sharon Waxman | accessdate=2009-10-10 | date=2009-10-08}}</ref> Near the end of every episode, Maher has a segment called \"New Rules\" which serves as a humorous editorial on popular culture and [[American politics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/new_rules/index.html |title=Real Time with Bill Maher: Seasons: Episodes |publisher=HBO |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> The final \"New Rule\" segues into Maher's closing editorial monologue.\n\nSince the show airs on HBO, the participants do not have to restrict their language to conform to the broadcast standards that existed on ''Politically Incorrect''. Also, pictures shown on New Rules sometimes have nudity or uncensored images.\n\nIn the first season, [[Paul F. Tompkins]] was featured as a correspondent. Also, every episode would end with a performance by a [[stand-up comedian]], none of which were [[political satire|political satirists]]. The segments featuring Tompkins and comedians were dropped after the tenth episode. Viewers were also able to call into the live show in the first season and ask questions over the air, but this was also dropped.\n\nStarting with episode 67 in February 2006, audio-only episodes were made available as a free [[podcast]] via the [[iTunes Store]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=98746009 |title=Real Time with Bill Maher&nbsp;\u2013 Download free podcast episodes by HBO Podcasts on iTunes |publisher=Phobos.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> and as a raw [[RSS]] feed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/podcasts/billmaher/podcast.xml |title=Real Time with Bill Maher |publisher=Hbo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> The podcasts also feature material cut from the show but taped during the studio rehearsal, including New Rules not aired in the final version.\n\nDuring the fall of 2006, Maher began hosting a live chat (now called \"Overtime\") on HBO's website following each broadcast, usually including some of the show guests. Viewers are invited to submit questions prior to and during the original telecast for Maher and the guests to answer and discuss afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.hbo.com/topic/Maher-Overtime/Submit-Questions-Overtime/2000006408|title=HBO Talk Moving To Social Platforms|first=HBO|last=Online|publisher=}}</ref> It is also available on the show's [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{YouTube|u=RealTime|title=Real Time with Bill Maher}}</ref>\n\nThe opening sequence begins with a spoken phrase from the (now defunct) Los Angeles [[Time and temperature|speaking clock]], featuring an (uncredited) [[Joanne Daniels]] as the [[Speaking clock|time lady]] saying \"Good Afternoon\". The theme song is composed by [[Christopher \"Kid\" Reid]] and his voice is heard saying \"Start the clock\", \"Real Time\" and \"Bill Maher\". A montage of historical events from the beginning of time to election night on November 4, 2008 accompanies the music along with a crawl at the bottom listing the guests for that night's show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6vzg2Oowto |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> According to HBO the show received an average of 4{{nbsp}}million viewers per week in 2014 and 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Connell|first=Michael |title=John Oliver's Talk Show Ratings Edging Out HBO Colleague Bill Maher|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-olivers-talk-show-ratings-735187|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>  2019 ratings posted below were more in the 1.5 million viewer range. \n\n===Politics and current events===\n[[File:Bill Maher by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bill Maher]] in 2007]]\nMaher has been a critic of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]],<ref name=\"Wrap\"/> the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]. His panel attempts to present a diverse set of views. Frequently, it consists of a [[liberal politics|liberal]] commentator or political figure, a [[conservative politics|conservative]] commentator or political figure, and a third individual who does not have as clear an ideological label, or someone with [[moderate]] beliefs. This third individual is often an actor, comedian, musician or other entertainment figure, though many times the commentator is openly conservative or liberal.\n\nOn his previous TV series, ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', he used the word \"[[libertarian]]\" to describe his political leanings. Regarding religion, he considers himself a \"rationalist\", as someone \"preaching the gospel of 'I don't know'\".<ref>Religulous</ref> Maher identifies himself as politically unaffiliated and disagrees with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party on many issues, and with the Democratic Party on many of their party platform's planks. He endorsed the candidacy of [[Ralph Nader]] of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] in the US presidential campaign of 2000. After the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]], Maher was among those who felt that votes cast by progressives for Nader possibly cost Democratic candidate Al Gore the election, and put George W. Bush in the White House. During an episode on which Nader and Michael Moore were guests, both Maher and Moore begged Nader not to run again in 2004 (season 2, episode 11).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RysZy331YK0 |title=Maher and Moore beg Nader not to run in '04 |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> He endorsed Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] leading up to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. In 2008, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] and harshly criticized Republican candidate [[John McCain]]'s political campaign. He also heavily criticized McCain's vice presidential pick, [[Sarah Palin]], on her qualifications and intelligence. Maher interviewed then-presidential-candidate, Republican [[Ron Paul]], giving him some positive air time. He often cites Paul's views in order to demonstrate the diversity of views on the right.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMaher has strong opinions on US drug policy, advocating for the [[legalization of marijuana]]. He is against censorship, often citing his own dismissal from ABC and the backlash against the [[Dixie Chicks]] for their comments on the Iraq War. He is also against conservative attitudes towards sex and sexuality, mocking outrages over the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s \"[[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|wardrobe malfunction]]\". He is also not shy about his lack of religious beliefs and he frequently criticizes religion. He is widely known for his support of animal rights groups such as [[PETA]]. Hot-button political issues such as health care, corporate influence in government, illegal immigration, the environment, entitlement programs, and human service regulations are frequently discussed on the show.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Christine O'Donnell====\nOn September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware Republican Senatorial candidate [[Christine O'Donnell]] from the October 29, 1999, episode of his prior TV series ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'',<ref name=\"McGreal2010-09-20\">{{cite news| last = McGreal| first = Chris| title = Christine O'Donnell: I dabbled in witchcraft| date = 2010-09-20| work = The Guardian| publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited| location = London| url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/20/christine-o-donnell-dabbled-witchcraft| accessdate = 2010-09-20}}</ref> where she discussed that she had \"dabbled in witchcraft\".

On the September 7, 2012, episode of ''Real Time with Bill Maher'', O'Donnell appeared on the show for the first time and resolved the issue with Maher, who apologized for the amount of publicity that the clip garnered. Maher said that he would not have aired the clip if he knew that it would have taken away from the message of her campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80941.html?hp=l7 |title=Bill Maher says sorry to \u2018witch\u2019 Christine O\u2019Donnell - Kevin Cirilli |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in 2008===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nThe show returned on January 11, 2008, and began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high definition]], with updates to the set for HD display.\n\nAs a result of the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the opening skit, the \"New Rules\" segment, and the closing monologue were eliminated for five episodes at the beginning of the year. The ice breaker used in the middle of the show (normally a fake products sketch tying into a current event) was also eliminated due to the strike. The announcement that ''Real Time'' would return without writers indicated that the opening monologue would also be cut, but every episode included a full monologue.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nDuring the strike, the \"Overtime\" concept became part of the live show itself, through a new segment called \"Blogga, Please!\". Using HBO's website, viewers were able to leave comments or questions during the live show. Maher and the panel then responded to selected postings at the end of the show. The \"Blogga, Please!\" segment was discontinued, and \"New Rules\" brought back, on February 15 following the resolution of the strike. Additionally, during the strike, Maher aired pre-recorded interviews by himself with everyday people about the election and other issues after the opening monologue.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nEstablished early on, the final \"New Rule\" served as a segue into the closing monologue. On the March 7 episode, the closing monologue returned to the format of the show. The opening skits have not reappeared, except for April 4 and 11, 2008.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nInstead of doing a second satellite interview near the forty-minute mark, the January 11 episode also featured the debut of the \"Real Time Real Reporter\", a [[blog]]ger or political [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] who is brought on midway through the show as an extra panelist to offer opinions on the latest election campaign happenings. Such correspondents have included [[Matt Taibbi]], [[Frank Luntz]], [[Amy Holmes]], [[P.&nbsp;J. O'Rourke]], and [[Dan Savage]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Changes in 2009===\nThe 2009 premiere was on February 20 at the earlier time of 10:00{{nbsp}}pm EST. The opening sequence was also slightly changed to include then President-elect Barack Obama and his family waving to a crowd of supporters on election night in November 2008.\n\nAlso, the show aired one continuous season as opposed to airing episodes in the spring and fall with a summer break in between.\n\nFor a short time the ''Real Time'' panel was reduced from three panelists to two for the new season. Maher jokingly attributed the new panel line-up to the economic crisis, stating that it was a means of reining in spending for the HBO show; Maher later stated that there is no connection between the failing economy and the producers' decision to remove the third guest. During his show on March 13, 2009, Maher reacted to the confusion sparked by his remarks from his previous show regarding the panel stating, \"I said as a joke that we had cut down the panel to two people because of economic times, and people took me seriously. No. It's just because I'm tired of talking to three people sometimes.\" The panel was once again at three panelists for the show one week later, on March 20. In addition to the panel reconfiguration, Maher has instituted a one-on-one in-studio interview segment in lieu of the past seasons' satellite interviews. The interview with [[James Carville]] on the May 8 show, however, was conducted via satellite.\n\n===Changes in 2012===\nHBO renewed the show on April 24, 2012, for two more seasons through 2013\u201314.<ref name=renewal>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/04/24/hbo-renews-real-time-with-bill-maher-for-its-11th-and-12th-seasons-991502/20120424hbo02/ |title=Breaking News - HBO Renews \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" for Its 11th and 12th Seasons |publisher=TheFutonCritic.com |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> The first episode of Season 11 aired on January 18, 2013,<ref name=season11>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2520788/ |title=\"Real Time with Bill Maher\" Episode #11.1 (TV episode 2013) - IMDb: |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=27 Apr 2013}}</ref> retaining its format of an initial monologue from Maher, a one-on-one interview with a guest, then turning to a discussion panel of three guests, and ending with \"New Rules\".\n\nA new addition to the format is that of a fourth or \"mid-guest\", who comes in at approximately the halfway point of the show, bringing their own issue to the table and discussing it with the entire panel.<ref name=midguest>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/bill-maher/hbo-real-time-guests-friday-feb-1-2013/10151461181918875 |title=HBO Real Time Guests: Friday Feb. 1, 2013 |publisher=Facebook |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=27 Apr 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in 2017===\nIn 2017, ''Real Time'' debuted a new theme song and a new set. The new theme song continues in the path of its predecessor by showcasing important political events including the [[2016 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[President of the United States]]. The new season retained the basic format of the show \u2013 a top-of-the-show guest, a table discussion and a mid-show guest. The biggest change in terms of set design has been that the main table where Bill Maher and two\u2013three guests discuss current political events is moved closer to the audience after the top of the show interview is completed. In addition to this, some mid-show guests including [[Leah Remini]], [[Jake Tapper]], [[Ralph Reed]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] have been interviewed on a separate side table. Though mid-show guests like Remini and Tapper have not taken part in any discussion on the main show after their interview or appeared on Overtime, the segment which is broadcast on YouTube, other guests like Reed have.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO\u2019s \u2018Real Time\u2019 returns for new season with overhaul|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/2017/01/26/hbos-real-time-returns-new-season-overhaul/}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Real Time with Bill Maher episodes}}\n{{:List of Real Time with Bill Maher episodes}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Reviews===\n[[Larry King]] calls ''Real Time'' \"one of the best shows on television\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0411/23/lkl.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=2004-11-23 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> Maher was a regular guest on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' as well as co-host at various times, and co-emcee of the final show, along with [[Ryan Seacrest]].<ref name=king-goodbye>{{Cite news| url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-helps-larry-king-say-goodbye/ | work=Mediaite | title=Bill Maher helps Larry King say goodbye | access-date=August 9, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100706044557/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-helps-larry-king-say-goodbye/| archive-date= July 6, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=TVguide>{{cite web|last=Rowe |first=Douglas J. |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Larry-King-Ends-1026885.aspx |title=Surrounded by Famous Fans, Larry King Ends His 25-Year Run on CNN |publisher=TV Guide |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Common Sense Media]]'s website says, \"Comedian Bill Maher is very funny, very well-informed, and very insightful, but he's also very crass.\"  It later says, \"Maher also expects his audience to have plenty of tolerance for blue humor.

Much like his previous series ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' on [[Comedy Central]] and later [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''Real Time'' features a [[Panel discussion|panel]] of guests who discuss current events in [[politics]] and the media. Unlike the previous show, guests are usually better versed in the subject matter: more experts such as journalists, professors, and politicians participate in the panel, and fewer actors and celebrities are included.\n\n''Real Time'' is a weekly hour-long program with a studio audience, airing live on Friday nights at 10:00{{nbsp}}pm ET. It originates from Studio 33 (\"The [[Bob Barker]] Studio\") at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]]. In addition, a 10- to 15-minute \"Overtime\" segment quickly follows the show on YouTube (Live Streams), which answers questions posted by viewers through HBO's online website for the show.\n\nThe show's eighteenth season premiered on January 19, 2020.\n\n==Format==\nThe format of the show usually features an opening current events or political [[sketch comedy|skit]], followed by the credits and a comedy monologue. Maher then interviews an important figure via satellite or in-studio before sitting down with the panel guests for an extensive debate. Halfway through the panel session, Maher does a comedy skit that usually satirizes current news items. Following the comedy bit, Maher interviews another figure via satellite or in-studio. The format varies, with two or three people on the panel. Maher explains that the format is not rigid and that they prefer live interviews to satellite interviews.<ref name=\"Wrap\">{{cite web | url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/bill-maher-grilled-8427?page=1 | title=Bill Maher: Grilled | author=Sharon Waxman | accessdate=2009-10-10 | date=2009-10-08}}</ref> Near the end of every episode, Maher has a segment called \"New Rules\" which serves as a humorous editorial on popular culture and [[American politics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/new_rules/index.html |title=Real Time with Bill Maher: Seasons: Episodes |publisher=HBO |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> The final \"New Rule\" segues into Maher's closing editorial monologue.\n\nSince the show airs on HBO, the participants do not have to restrict their language to conform to the broadcast standards that existed on ''Politically Incorrect''. Also, pictures shown on New Rules sometimes have nudity or uncensored images.\n\nIn the first season, [[Paul F. Tompkins]] was featured as a correspondent. Also, every episode would end with a performance by a [[stand-up comedian]], none of which were [[political satire|political satirists]]. The segments featuring Tompkins and comedians were dropped after the tenth episode. Viewers were also able to call into the live show in the first season and ask questions over the air, but this was also dropped.\n\nStarting with episode 67 in February 2006, audio-only episodes were made available as a free [[podcast]] via the [[iTunes Store]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=98746009 |title=Real Time with Bill Maher&nbsp;\u2013 Download free podcast episodes by HBO Podcasts on iTunes |publisher=Phobos.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> and as a raw [[RSS]] feed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/podcasts/billmaher/podcast.xml |title=Real Time with Bill Maher |publisher=Hbo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> The podcasts also feature material cut from the show but taped during the studio rehearsal, including New Rules not aired in the final version.\n\nDuring the fall of 2006, Maher began hosting a live chat (now called \"Overtime\") on HBO's website following each broadcast, usually including some of the show guests. Viewers are invited to submit questions prior to and during the original telecast for Maher and the guests to answer and discuss afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.hbo.com/topic/Maher-Overtime/Submit-Questions-Overtime/2000006408|title=HBO Talk Moving To Social Platforms|first=HBO|last=Online|publisher=}}</ref> It is also available on the show's [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{YouTube|u=RealTime|title=Real Time with Bill Maher}}</ref>\n\nThe opening sequence begins with a spoken phrase from the (now defunct) Los Angeles [[Time and temperature|speaking clock]], featuring an (uncredited) [[Joanne Daniels]] as the [[Speaking clock|time lady]] saying \"Good Afternoon\". The theme song is composed by [[Christopher \"Kid\" Reid]] and his voice is heard saying \"Start the clock\", \"Real Time\" and \"Bill Maher\".

Bush|Bush administration]] and the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]. His panel attempts to present a diverse set of views. Frequently, it consists of a [[liberal politics|liberal]] commentator or political figure, a [[conservative politics|conservative]] commentator or political figure, and a third individual who does not have as clear an ideological label, or someone with [[moderate]] beliefs. This third individual is often an actor, comedian, musician or other entertainment figure, though many times the commentator is openly conservative or liberal.\n\nOn his previous TV series, ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', he used the word \"[[libertarian]]\" to describe his political leanings. Regarding religion, he considers himself a \"rationalist\", as someone \"preaching the gospel of 'I don't know'\".<ref>Religulous</ref> Maher identifies himself as politically unaffiliated and disagrees with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party on many issues, and with the Democratic Party on many of their party platform's planks. He endorsed the candidacy of [[Ralph Nader]] of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] in the US presidential campaign of 2000. After the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]], Maher was among those who felt that votes cast by progressives for Nader possibly cost Democratic candidate Al Gore the election, and put George W. Bush in the White House. During an episode on which Nader and Michael Moore were guests, both Maher and Moore begged Nader not to run again in 2004 (season 2, episode 11).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RysZy331YK0 |title=Maher and Moore beg Nader not to run in '04 |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> He endorsed Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] leading up to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. In 2008, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] and harshly criticized Republican candidate [[John McCain]]'s political campaign. He also heavily criticized McCain's vice presidential pick, [[Sarah Palin]], on her qualifications and intelligence. Maher interviewed then-presidential-candidate, Republican [[Ron Paul]], giving him some positive air time. He often cites Paul's views in order to demonstrate the diversity of views on the right.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMaher has strong opinions on US drug policy, advocating for the [[legalization of marijuana]]. He is against censorship, often citing his own dismissal from ABC and the backlash against the [[Dixie Chicks]] for their comments on the Iraq War. He is also against conservative attitudes towards sex and sexuality, mocking outrages over the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s \"[[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|wardrobe malfunction]]\". He is also not shy about his lack of religious beliefs and he frequently criticizes religion. He is widely known for his support of animal rights groups such as [[PETA]]. Hot-button political issues such as health care, corporate influence in government, illegal immigration, the environment, entitlement programs, and human service regulations are frequently discussed on the show.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Christine O'Donnell====\nOn September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware Republican Senatorial candidate [[Christine O'Donnell]] from the October 29, 1999, episode of his prior TV series ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'',<ref name=\"McGreal2010-09-20\">{{cite news| last = McGreal| first = Chris| title = Christine O'Donnell: I dabbled in witchcraft| date = 2010-09-20| work = The Guardian| publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited| location = London| url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/20/christine-o-donnell-dabbled-witchcraft| accessdate = 2010-09-20}}</ref> where she discussed that she had \"dabbled in witchcraft\".

On the September 7, 2012, episode of ''Real Time with Bill Maher'', O'Donnell appeared on the show for the first time and resolved the issue with Maher, who apologized for the amount of publicity that the clip garnered. Maher said that he would not have aired the clip if he knew that it would have taken away from the message of her campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80941.html?hp=l7 |title=Bill Maher says sorry to \u2018witch\u2019 Christine O\u2019Donnell - Kevin Cirilli |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in 2008===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nThe show returned on January 11, 2008, and began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high definition]], with updates to the set for HD display.\n\nAs a result of the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the opening skit, the \"New Rules\" segment, and the closing monologue were eliminated for five episodes at the beginning of the year. The ice breaker used in the middle of the show (normally a fake products sketch tying into a current event) was also eliminated due to the strike. The announcement that ''Real Time'' would return without writers indicated that the opening monologue would also be cut, but every episode included a full monologue.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nDuring the strike, the \"Overtime\" concept became part of the live show itself, through a new segment called \"Blogga, Please!\". Using HBO's website, viewers were able to leave comments or questions during the live show. Maher and the panel then responded to selected postings at the end of the show. The \"Blogga, Please!\" segment was discontinued, and \"New Rules\" brought back, on February 15 following the resolution of the strike. Additionally, during the strike, Maher aired pre-recorded interviews by himself with everyday people about the election and other issues after the opening monologue.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nEstablished early on, the final \"New Rule\" served as a segue into the closing monologue. On the March 7 episode, the closing monologue returned to the format of the show. The opening skits have not reappeared, except for April 4 and 11, 2008.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nInstead of doing a second satellite interview near the forty-minute mark, the January 11 episode also featured the debut of the \"Real Time Real Reporter\", a [[blog]]ger or political [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] who is brought on midway through the show as an extra panelist to offer opinions on the latest election campaign happenings. Such correspondents have included [[Matt Taibbi]], [[Frank Luntz]], [[Amy Holmes]], [[P.&nbsp;J. O'Rourke]], and [[Dan Savage]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Changes in 2009===\nThe 2009 premiere was on February 20 at the earlier time of 10:00{{nbsp}}pm EST. The opening sequence was also slightly changed to include then President-elect Barack Obama and his family waving to a crowd of supporters on election night in November 2008.\n\nAlso, the show aired one continuous season as opposed to airing episodes in the spring and fall with a summer break in between.\n\nFor a short time the ''Real Time'' panel was reduced from three panelists to two for the new season. Maher jokingly attributed the new panel line-up to the economic crisis, stating that it was a means of reining in spending for the HBO show; Maher later stated that there is no connection between the failing economy and the producers' decision to remove the third guest. During his show on March 13, 2009, Maher reacted to the confusion sparked by his remarks from his previous show regarding the panel stating, \"I said as a joke that we had cut down the panel to two people because of economic times, and people took me seriously. No. It's just because I'm tired of talking to three people sometimes.\" The panel was once again at three panelists for the show one week later, on March 20. In addition to the panel reconfiguration, Maher has instituted a one-on-one in-studio interview segment in lieu of the past seasons' satellite interviews. The interview with [[James Carville]] on the May 8 show, however, was conducted via satellite.\n\n===Changes in 2012===\nHBO renewed the show on April 24, 2012, for two more seasons through 2013\u201314.<ref name=renewal>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/04/24/hbo-renews-real-time-with-bill-maher-for-its-11th-and-12th-seasons-991502/20120424hbo02/ |title=Breaking News - HBO Renews \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" for Its 11th and 12th Seasons |publisher=TheFutonCritic.com |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> The first episode of Season 11 aired on January 18, 2013,<ref name=season11>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2520788/ |title=\"Real Time with Bill Maher\" Episode #11.1 (TV episode 2013) - IMDb: |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=27 Apr 2013}}</ref> retaining its format of an initial monologue from Maher, a one-on-one interview with a guest, then turning to a discussion panel of three guests, and ending with \"New Rules\".\n\nA new addition to the format is that of a fourth or \"mid-guest\", who comes in at approximately the halfway point of the show, bringing their own issue to the table and discussing it with the entire panel.<ref name=midguest>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/bill-maher/hbo-real-time-guests-friday-feb-1-2013/10151461181918875 |title=HBO Real Time Guests: Friday Feb. 1, 2013 |publisher=Facebook |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=27 Apr 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in 2017===\nIn 2017, ''Real Time'' debuted a new theme song and a new set. The new theme song continues in the path of its predecessor by showcasing important political events including the [[2016 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[President of the United States]]. The new season retained the basic format of the show \u2013 a top-of-the-show guest, a table discussion and a mid-show guest. The biggest change in terms of set design has been that the main table where Bill Maher and two\u2013three guests discuss current political events is moved closer to the audience after the top of the show interview is completed. In addition to this, some mid-show guests including [[Leah Remini]], [[Jake Tapper]], [[Ralph Reed]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] have been interviewed on a separate side table. Though mid-show guests like Remini and Tapper have not taken part in any discussion on the main show after their interview or appeared on Overtime, the segment which is broadcast on YouTube, other guests like Reed have.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO\u2019s \u2018Real Time\u2019 returns for new season with overhaul|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/2017/01/26/hbos-real-time-returns-new-season-overhaul/}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Real Time with Bill Maher episodes}}\n{{:List of Real Time with Bill Maher episodes}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Reviews===\n[[Larry King]] calls ''Real Time'' \"one of the best shows on television\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0411/23/lkl.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=2004-11-23 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> Maher was a regular guest on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' as well as co-host at various times, and co-emcee of the final show, along with [[Ryan Seacrest]].<ref name=king-goodbye>{{Cite news| url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-helps-larry-king-say-goodbye/ | work=Mediaite | title=Bill Maher helps Larry King say goodbye | access-date=August 9, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100706044557/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-helps-larry-king-say-goodbye/| archive-date= July 6, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=TVguide>{{cite web|last=Rowe |first=Douglas J. |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Larry-King-Ends-1026885.aspx |title=Surrounded by Famous Fans, Larry King Ends His 25-Year Run on CNN |publisher=TV Guide |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Common Sense Media]]'s website says, \"Comedian Bill Maher is very funny, very well-informed, and very insightful, but he's also very crass.\"  It later says, \"Maher also expects his audience to have plenty of tolerance for blue humor.

These catalogues remain available, ranging in price from $5 for average quality used copy to $900 for numbered, limited edition catalogues signed by the artist(s). This practice reflected the Lejwas' loyalty to their artists and desire to see their artists' reputations and art established and available beyond the gallery's walls.  From a business perspective, this attention to the \"secondary\" art marketn(the resale of art following its original acquisition from the artist), contributed to their increased stature as a gallery throughout the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/35961037/The_loyal_underdog._Observations_on_Hans_Arp_and_Galerie_Chalette Hartog, Aria ''The loyal underdog.

These catalogues remain available, ranging in price from $5 for average quality used copy to $900 for numbered, limited edition catalogues signed by the artist(s). This practice reflected the Lejwas' loyalty to their artists and desire to see their artists' reputations and art established and available beyond the gallery's walls.  From a business perspective, this attention to the \"secondary\" art marketn(the resale of art following its original acquisition from the artist), contributed to their increased stature as a gallery throughout the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/35961037/The_loyal_underdog._Observations_on_Hans_Arp_and_Galerie_Chalette Hartog, Aria ''The loyal underdog.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The events of the series take place after the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], with Spellman serving as [[head writer]] and [[Kari Skogland]] directing.\n\n[[Anthony Mackie]] and [[Sebastian Stan]] reprise their roles as Falcon and Winter Soldier, respectively, from the film series. [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]], [[Emily VanCamp]], and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. As of September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+, centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, with Spellman hired to write one on Falcon and Winter Soldier in October. The series was officially confirmed in April 2019 along with Mackie and Stan's involvement. Skogland was hired the next month. Filming began in October 2019 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to premiere in August 2020, and will consist of six episodes.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter being handed the mantle of [[Captain America]] at the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] teams up with [[Bucky Barnes]] in a worldwide adventure that puts their abilities to the test.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"Synopsis\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]]: <br />An [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] and a former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescueman]] who was trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> Wilson was handed the mantle of [[Captain America]] by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] at the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> but continues to use the Falcon moniker.<ref name=\"NotCalledCap\" /> The series explores Wilson's actions after receiving [[Captain America's shield]].<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" />\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]]: <br />An enhanced soldier and Rogers' best friend who reemerged as a brainwashed assassin after being thought [[killed in action]] during World War II.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]:<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> <br />A Sokovian terrorist who was responsible for the Avengers' breakup in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /><ref name=\"ZemoReturnImages\" /> Zemo wears his traditional purple mask from the comics in the series, which he was not depicted with in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"ZemoReturnImages\" />\n* [[Emily VanCamp]] as [[Sharon Carter]]: <br />A former agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Peggy Carter]]'s niece.<ref name=\"D232019\" /> VanCamp said that Carter has been on the run since she was last seen in ''Civil War'', and the series would show what she has been doing in that time.<ref name=\"VanCampExplain\" />\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]]<!--Do NOT add \"U.S. Agent\" as he has not been called such by Marvel Studios-->: A militaristic successor to Captain America created by the U.S. government.<ref name=\"D232019\" /><ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Adepero Oduye]],<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> [[Desmond Chiam]], [[Miki Ishikawa]],<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]],<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and [[Carl Lumbly]] have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#814140 |overall= |title= |director= |directorR=<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> |writer= |airdate= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = [[Kari Skogland]]\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|8}}<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" />\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBy September 2018, [[Marvel Studios]] was developing several limited series for its parent company [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s streaming service, [[Disney+]], to be centered on supporting characters from the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]] who had not starred in their own films. The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than [[Marvel Television]], who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" />\n\nMalcolm Spellman was hired to write a limited series that would focus on [[Anthony Mackie]]'s [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] and [[Sebastian Stan]]'s [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]] at the end of October 2018.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier\" /><ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Mackie and Stan had both previously expressed interest in starring in an MCU spin-off film together, with Stan comparing the potential idea to [[Buddy film|buddy comedy films]] like ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988) and ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"ScarletWitchVision\" /> Marvel and Disney officially announced the series in April 2019, with the title ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, the miniseries was confirmed to consist of six episodes, and [[Kari Skogland]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Budgets\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe series picks up following the ending of the film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), which depicts [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] bequeathing his [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and the mantle of [[Captain America]] to Wilson.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> [[Derek Kolstad]] joined the series' writing team in July 2019,<ref name=\"Kolstad\" /> and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise ''[[John Wick]]''.<ref name=\"KolstadJohnWick\" /> Kolstad added that the series would explore reactions to a black man becoming Captain America.<ref name=\"KolstadBlackCap\" /> Spellman wanted to \"go home\" with the characters and let the actors show their skills rather than simply focus on action in the series.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Sebastian Stan & Anthony Mackie (48469219356).jpg|thumb|Stan and Mackie at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] promoting the series]]\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] and [[Emily VanCamp]] entered negotiations to reprise their film roles of [[Helmut Zemo]] and [[Sharon Carter]], respectively.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Br\u00fchl was confirmed for the series in July 2019,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when [[Wyatt Russell]] was announced to be cast in the series as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> Set photos in November 2019 revealed [[Adepero Oduye]] would appear in the series,<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> while [[Desmond Chiam]] and [[Miki Ishikawa]] joined the cast a month later.<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]] was cast in January 2020,<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and the following month, [[Carl Lumbly]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 31, 2019,<ref name=\"SpellmanFilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],<ref name=\"F&WSFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MackieMensHealth\" /> with Skogland directing.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> The series is filmed under the working title ''Tag Team''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4.<ref name=\"FilmingStartOfficial\" /> Location shooting took place in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] from November through February 2020.<ref name=\"AtlantaNov2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaDec2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaJan2020\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFeb2020\" />\n\nIn mid-January 2020, filming was expected to take place in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]] for two weeks.

Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] described these as more grounded than fellow Disney+ series ''[[WandaVision]]'', which was also promoted at the event, with a \"standard spy thriller\" look similar to the ''Captain America'' films that the title characters were introduced in.<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> A commercial for the series, ''WandaVision'', and ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref

about\".<ref name=\"ColliderSuperBowlSpot\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to debut in August 2020 on [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" /> and will consist

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The events of the series take place after the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], with Spellman serving as [[head writer]] and [[Kari Skogland]] directing.\n\n[[Anthony Mackie]] and [[Sebastian Stan]] reprise their roles as Falcon and Winter Soldier, respectively, from the film series. [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]], [[Emily VanCamp]], and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. As of September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+, centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, with Spellman hired to write one on Falcon and Winter Soldier in October. The series was officially confirmed in April 2019 along with Mackie and Stan's involvement. Skogland was hired the next month. Filming began in October 2019 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to premiere in August 2020, and will consist of six episodes.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter being handed the mantle of [[Captain America]] at the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] teams up with [[Bucky Barnes]] in a worldwide adventure that puts their abilities to the test.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"Synopsis\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]]: <br />An [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] and a former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescueman]] who was trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> Wilson was handed the mantle of [[Captain America]] by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] at the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> but continues to use the Falcon moniker.<ref name=\"NotCalledCap\" /> The series explores Wilson's actions after receiving [[Captain America's shield]].<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" />\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]]: <br />An enhanced soldier and Rogers' best friend who reemerged as a brainwashed assassin after being thought [[killed in action]] during World War II.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]:<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> <br />A Sokovian terrorist who was responsible for the Avengers' breakup in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /><ref name=\"ZemoReturnImages\" /> Zemo wears his traditional purple mask from the comics in the series, which he was not depicted with in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"ZemoReturnImages\" />\n* [[Emily VanCamp]] as [[Sharon Carter]]: <br />A former agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Peggy Carter]]'s niece.<ref name=\"D232019\" /> VanCamp said that Carter has been on the run since she was last seen in ''Civil War'', and the series would show what she has been doing in that time.<ref name=\"VanCampExplain\" />\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]]<!--Do NOT add \"U.S. Agent\" as he has not been called such by Marvel Studios-->: A militaristic successor to Captain America created by the U.S. government.<ref name=\"D232019\" /><ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Adepero Oduye]],<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> [[Desmond Chiam]], [[Miki Ishikawa]],<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]],<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and [[Carl Lumbly]] have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#814140 |overall= |title= |director= |directorR=<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> |writer= |airdate= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = [[Kari Skogland]]\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|8}}<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" />\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBy September 2018, [[Marvel Studios]] was developing several limited series for its parent company [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s streaming service, [[Disney+]], to be centered on supporting characters from the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]] who had not starred in their own films. The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than [[Marvel Television]], who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" />\n\nMalcolm Spellman was hired to write a limited series that would focus on [[Anthony Mackie]]'s [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] and [[Sebastian Stan]]'s [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]] at the end of October 2018.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier\" /><ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Mackie and Stan had both previously expressed interest in starring in an MCU spin-off film together, with Stan comparing the potential idea to [[Buddy film|buddy comedy films]] like ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988) and ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"ScarletWitchVision\" /> Marvel and Disney officially announced the series in April 2019, with the title ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, the miniseries was confirmed to consist of six episodes, and [[Kari Skogland]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Budgets\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe series picks up following the ending of the film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), which depicts [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] bequeathing his [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and the mantle of [[Captain America]] to Wilson.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> [[Derek Kolstad]] joined the series' writing team in July 2019,<ref name=\"Kolstad\" /> and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise ''[[John Wick]]''.<ref name=\"KolstadJohnWick\" /> Kolstad added that the series would explore reactions to a black man becoming Captain America.<ref name=\"KolstadBlackCap\" /> Spellman wanted to \"go home\" with the characters and let the actors show their skills rather than simply focus on action in the series.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Sebastian Stan & Anthony Mackie (48469219356).jpg|thumb|Stan and Mackie at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] promoting the series]]\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] and [[Emily VanCamp]] entered negotiations to reprise their film roles of [[Helmut Zemo]] and [[Sharon Carter]], respectively.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Br\u00fchl was confirmed for the series in July 2019,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when [[Wyatt Russell]] was announced to be cast in the series as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> Set photos in November 2019 revealed [[Adepero Oduye]] would appear in the series,<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> while [[Desmond Chiam]] and [[Miki Ishikawa]] joined the cast a month later.<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]] was cast in January 2020,<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and the following month, [[Carl Lumbly]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 31, 2019,<ref name=\"SpellmanFilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],<ref name=\"F&WSFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MackieMensHealth\" /> with Skogland directing.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> The series is filmed under the working title ''Tag Team''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4.<ref name=\"FilmingStartOfficial\" /> Location shooting took place in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] from November through February 2020.<ref name=\"AtlantaNov2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaDec2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaJan2020\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFeb2020\" />\n\nIn mid-January 2020, filming was expected to take place in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]] for two weeks.

Reporting on this news, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' stated that it was unclear if the location would still be used for filming.<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> On March 3, the production was revealed to be moving to [[Prague, Czech Republic]] for three weeks until March 25,<ref name=\"Prague\" /> with filming in the city starting on March 6 and expected to continue until the week of March 16. However, filming stopped on March 10 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] and members of the production returned to Atlanta.

Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] described these as more grounded than fellow Disney+ series ''[[WandaVision]]'', which was also promoted at the event, with a \"standard spy thriller\" look similar to the ''Captain America'' films that the title characters were introduced in.<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> A commercial for the series, ''WandaVision'', and ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref

about\".<ref name=\"ColliderSuperBowlSpot\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to debut in August 2020 on [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" /> and will consist of six episodes to be released weekly rather than all at once.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"EpisodeRelease\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\">{{Cite

The Etna Iron Works in New York should not be confused with two similarly named prominent businesses of the period, the Etna Iron Works of Ohio or the Etna Iron Works of Pennsylvania. The name \"Etna\" (and its alternative spellings \"Aetna\" and \"\u00c6tna\") derives from the nymph ''[[Aetna (nymph)|Aetna]]'' in [[Greek mythology]], after whom the volcano [[Mount Etna]] in modern-day [[Sicily]] is said to be named.}} was a 19th-century [[ironworks]] and manufacturing plant for [[steam engine|marine steam engine]]s located in [[New York City]]. The Etna Works was a failing small business when purchased by [[sand casting|ironmolder]] [[John Roach (shipbuilder)|John Roach]] and three partners in 1852. Roach soon gained full ownership of the business and quickly transformed it into a successful general-purpose ironworks.\n\nRoach took advantage of the [[American Civil War]] to transform the Etna Works into one of New York's leading manufacturers of [[marine steam engine]]s. By the end of the war, he was in a position to acquire the businesses of most of his major New York competitors, which had run into financial difficulties. Roach subsequently consolidated his operations at the [[Morgan Iron Works]], and some time afterward rented the Etna Works to the inventor [[Thomas Edison]], who turned it into a [[dynamo]] factory. The Roach family sold the former Etna Works property in 1887. The Etna Works buildings, along with the street on which they were located, were later liquidated in a city redevelopment.\n\nNotable achievements of the Etna Iron Works include the building of the steam-operated [[Third Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Third Avenue Harlem Bridge]] in the 1860s, and the manufacture in the 1860s of the engines for the giant ironclad {{USS|Dunderberg}} and for the passenger steamers [[Bristol (1866)|''Bristol'']] and [[Providence (1866)|''Providence'']], the latter two of which were the largest marine engines built in the [[United States]] to that date.\n\n==Background==\n[[ File:John Roach.jpg | thumb| upright | [[John Roach]] ]] \nJohn Roach emigrated from [[Ireland]] to the United States in 1832 at the age of sixteen, eventually obtaining employment as a common laborer at the [[Howell Works]] of [[James P. Allaire]] at an initial wage of 25c a day. After securing an apprenticeship as an ironmolder at Howell Works, Roach later transferred to Allaire's other plant, the [[Allaire Iron Works]] in New York, where he learned the manufacturing method for [[marine steam engine]]s. Roach would remain an employee of Allaire's for twenty years.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 4&ndash;7, 14.</ref>\n\nBy the 1850s, Roach, concerned about the needs of a growing family and anxious to obtain a more secure financial future, began to consider starting his own business. He had been unable to save much money of his own&mdash;only $1,000&mdash;but was able to persuade three of his co-workers at Allaire, including his brother-in-law Joseph Johnstone who had savings of $8,000, to join him. The four partners mustered between them a total of $10,000.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn April 1852, Roach and his three partners purchased for the sum of $4,700 a small New York ironworks known as the Etna Iron Works, which had recently fallen into receivership. The ironworks, located at 102 Goerck Street, occupied a {{convert|40|x|100|ft|m|adj=on}}  property and consisted of a small foundry and some raw materials.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 14&ndash;15.</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[ File:Etna Iron Works (New York) advertisement, 1861.jpg | thumb | upright | 1861 advertisement for the Etna Iron Works ]] \nFollowing their purchase, Roach was given the task of promoting the business while his three partners attended to management of the shop floor. Roach began by touting for custom piecework, his first sale being for cast grate bars for a Brooklyn distillery.<ref name=swann15-16>Swann 1965. pp. 15&ndash;16.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the first year of operations, the partners had made a modest profit of $1,000, but now a dispute broke out over how to employ the money. Roach wanted to use it to expand the business, but his three partners voted to divide it into dividends of $250 each. Realizing that they had reached the limit of their ambition, Roach took out a mortgage on the property and used the loan to buy his partners out, thus becoming sole proprietor.<ref name=swann15-16/>\n\nRoach thereafter began canvassing the local shipyards for business. Although New York's shipbuilders were still at this time constructing mostly wooden sailing ships, each ship needed about forty pounds of iron fastenings and cables, in addition to a number of anchors. In one ninety-day period, Roach made a profit from such sales of $8,000, giving his business a solid foundation.<ref name=swann16>Swann 1965. p. 16.</ref>\n\nRoach was able to continue expanding the business through the sale of a variety of products, including [[Franklin stove]]s, firebacks, slats for iron shutters and other items. In 1856 he added a new steam [[boiler]] to the ironworks for driving a blower which forced a draft into the melting furnace, thus obtaining a higher temperature and melting the iron faster, which saved valuable man-hours. He also purchased the adjoining property at 104\u2013106 Goerck St., upon which stood a small three-storey building. Roach used the third floor as a pattern shop, while renting out the first and second floors to an iron shutter manufacturer.<ref name=swann16/>\n\nBy 1859, Roach was employing forty men and his property was valued at $15,000. A contemporary evaluator noted that Roach was \"getting along well\" and deemed him \"safe for a fair amount of credit\".<ref>The Mercantile Agency, Vol. CCCXVII, p. 229, cited in Swann 1965. p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Foundry explosion===\n\nOn September 2, 1859, the forced-draft boiler for the Etna Works' furnace exploded after accidentally being allowed to run dry, killing one man and seriously injuring two others, and gutting the building in which it stood. The $5,000 damage was covered by insurance, but the foundry would be forced to close without steam power.<ref name=swann17/>\n\nUndeterred, Roach negotiated the use of a boiler in a neighbouring factory, ran 200 feet of pipe from their boiler to his workshop, and was back in production within 48 hours.<ref name=swann17/>\n\n===Windfall capital injection===\n\nIn 1859, one of Roach's closest friends, a lawyer named John Baker, died and left Roach the trustee of his estate. The estate, worth $70,000, was entrusted to Roach for investment until Baker's four children came of age. Since the money could not be claimed until 1881, it was as good as a long-term interest-free loan to Roach, who was soon to take advantage of it to expand his business.<ref name=swann17>Swann 1965. p. 17.</ref>\n[[File:Third Avenue Harlem Bridge 1864.jpg|thumb|Third Avenue Harlem Bridge, completed in 1868]]\n===Third Avenue Harlem Bridge===\n\nOne of the largest projects undertaken by the Etna Iron Works was for construction of the [[Third Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Third Avenue Harlem Bridge]] over the [[Harlem River]], New York. The project was submitted to public tender by the City of New York in 1860 and Roach secured the contract with the lowest bid. The contract called for a bridge with a pivoting center section which could be rotated to allow large ships to pass through one of two channels beneath.<ref name=swann1718>Swann 1965. pp. 17&ndash;18.</ref>\n\nRoach had no prior experience of bridge building, so he hired an engineer with appropriate experience to design and oversee the project, and subcontracted out the masonry work.<ref name=swann1718/> The bridge that was eventually constructed was {{convert|526|ft}} long, with masonry foundations, a cast-and-wrought iron superstructure, and a {{convert|216|ft|m|adj=mid}} steam-powered pivoting center section spanning two {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ship channels.<ref name=nycroads/> The bridge opened for traffic in 1868,<ref name=nycroads/><ref>Swann 1965. p. 18.</ref> and operated reliably for about thirty years until increasing maintenance costs and traffic persuaded the city fathers to construct a new bridge with faster operation and higher and wider dimensions.<ref name=nycroads>{{cite web |url= http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/third-avenue/ |title= Third Avenue Bridge |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= NYCRoads.com |publisher= Eastern Roads |access-date= 2020-04-06 }}</ref>{{efn|<ref>Stoddard 1893. pp. [https://archive.org/details/menofbusiness00stod/page/82/mode/2up 83\u201386].</ref> The source erroneously states that the bridge opened in 1864.}}\n\n==American Civil War==\n[[File:USS Dunderberg cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Engines for the mammoth ironclad {{USS|Dunderberg}} were supplied by the Etna Iron Works]]\nRoach had long nurtured a desire to become a builder of marine steam engines like his mentor James Allaire. Competition in the industry was fierce, and entry difficult due to high capital costs, but Roach believed that by utilization of the best tools, labor-saving devices and practices, he could compete successfully. Accordingly, through the late 1850s he sent engineers to the [[United Kingdom]] to study the latest in marine engine technology, and was not above hiring himself out as a mechanic to New York's leading engine builders of the day to spy on their organization, technology and practices.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 18.</ref>\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Roach was thus already well prepared to take advantage of the huge demand for marine engines generated by the conflict. He began by contacting the shipbuilder [[William H. Webb]], who had just secured a contract for the huge new [[ironclad]] {{USS|Dunderberg}}. Webb's usual engine suppliers, the [[Morgan Iron Works]] and [[Novelty Iron Works]], were heavily inundated with orders and unable to meet his needs. Webb was so relieved to find an alternative source of supply, he not only awarded the ''Dunderberg''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine contract to Roach, but also became guarantor for the higher line of credit Roach would need to re-equip his works for completing the job.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 18&ndash;19.</ref>\n\nRoach next travelled to Washington to meet the U.S. Navy's Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering, [[Benjamin Franklin Isherwood]]. On October 24, 1862, Isherwood awarded Roach a contract to supply the machinery for the Navy's new gunboat {{USS|Peoria|1863|2}}\u2014the first of a number of such contracts Roach would fulfill for the Navy in coming years. Roach also secured contracts for the engines for two new Neptune Steamship Company vessels, ''Electra'' and ''Galatea''.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 19.</ref>\n\nHaving secured these contracts, Roach set about equipping the Etna Iron Works for its new role. He began by hiring Thomas Main, a leading engineer with experience in a number of the world's most advanced engine works, as the plant's superintendent. Roach then began reorganizing the Works, adding a boilershop, machine shop, coppersmith shop and blacksmith, and equipping the plant with a host of new machines including traveling and swing cranes and the steam engines to power them, along with planers, lathes, boring mills, punches, shears and rollers. Amongst the new equipment was a planer capable of finishing 100-ton iron plates, and a lathe capable of boring a {{convert|112|in|cm|adj=mid|-diameter}} cylinder\u2014the two largest machine tools in the entire country.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 19&ndash;20.</ref>\n\nOver the next two years, Roach's plant produced the engines for at least fifteen vessels, including return orders from the U.S. Navy and a dozen engines for the Van Deusen Brothers. At its wartime peak, the Etna Iron Works employed almost 2,000 workers and was valued at $150,000, putting it in the front rank of New York's engine builders.<ref name=swann23>Swann 1965. p. 23.</ref>\n\n==Postwar consolidation==\n[[ File:Casting a marine engine cylinder at the Etna Iron Works, 1866.jpg | thumb | Casting an engine cylinder for either the steamboat {{ship||Bristol|1866|2}} or {{ship||Providence|1866|2}} at the Etna Iron Works, 1866. These were the largest-bore marine engines built in the United States at the time. ]] \nShortly after the war, the U.S. Navy auctioned off hundreds of ships it had requisitioned for the war effort, flooding the market and seriously depressing prices. The resulting slump in the U.S. shipping industry sent many long-established American shipyards and marine engineers to the wall, and New York was one of the worst affected locations, with its maritime industry all but wiped out by the slump. By 1867, most of Roach's marine engine competitors had gone bankrupt.<ref name=swann23/>\n\nRoach himself, however, was able to prosper during this time by securing a diversity of machinery contracts. The Navy through Benjamin Isherwood ordered three engines and six large boilers for the ''Guerriere'' class vessels, while shipbuilder William Webb contracted with Roach for the machinery for two large new [[sidewheel steamer]]s, {{ship||Bristol|1866|2}} and {{ship||Providence|1866|2}}. The engines for the latter two ships, with their massive {{convert|110|in|cm|adj=mid}} cylinders, were the largest-[[bore (engine)|bore]] ship engines ever produced in the United States up to that time. More importantly for Roach however, he realized that the government was planning to modernize its own shipyards, and he made a timely shift into the manufacture of [[machine tool]]s in 1866. He was rewarded by the securing of almost a million dollars in government machine tool contracts between 1866 and 1868.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 24.</ref>\n\nAt this point, Roach decided that his business had outgrown its original location. He was keen to establish a plant with direct water frontage, which would both save him the cost of transporting his engines to the docks, and also enable him to move into the potentially lucrative business of ship repair. The obvious target for acquisition was the Morgan Iron Works, a leading ironworks with frontage on the East River, and which like most other marine engineering plants had lain mostly idle since the Civil War. Fortuitously for Roach, the proprietor, shipping magnate [[Charles Morgan (businessman)|Charles Morgan]], had recently experienced a setback in his own business dealings, as a result of which he was short of capital. Morgan quickly agreed to sell the premises along with all of its equipment for the sum of $450,000.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 24&ndash;25.</ref>\n\nAt around the same time, two of Roach's former competitors, the [[Allaire Iron Works]] and the Franklin Forge, went bankrupt, and Roach purchased the best of their equipment at firesale prices and also hired their best workers. To these he added the best workers and equipment from the Etna and Morgan establishments, and consolidated his operations at the latter, vacating his former premises at Goerck Street. Roach profited further at this time from the sale of his surplus equipment to the U.S. Navy, but on this occasion some rival business interests raised a protest and the deal became the subject of an acrimonious government inquiry (see the [[John Roach (shipbuilder)|John Roach]] article for details).<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 26&ndash;27.</ref>\n\n==Later developments==\n\nFollowing the consolidation of his business at the Morgan Iron Works, Roach rented out his old Etna Iron Works property to various tenants. The Etna Works continued to operate as a general ironworks under new management until about 1881, when inventor [[Thomas Edison]] relocated production for his electrical illumination utility there.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 228.</ref> Edison renamed the plant the [[Edison Machine Works]], using it to build DC dynamos until 1887. In that year, the Roach family business sold the premises, the Edison having moved their expanding Machine Works to a much larger site in [[Schenectady, NY]]. The property, along with the street in which it was situated, was later liquidated in a 1940s redevelopment.\n\nRoach himself went on to establish his own shipyard in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], the [[Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works]], which became America's largest and most productive shipyard from its establishment in 1871 until the mid-1880s.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 51, 56.</ref>\n\n== Marine engine production tables ==\n\nAt least 27 marine steam engines for 19 ships were produced by the Etna Iron Works.

The name \"Etna\" (and its alternative spellings \"Aetna\" and \"\u00c6tna\") derives from the nymph ''[[Aetna (nymph)|Aetna]]'' in [[Greek mythology]], after whom the volcano [[Mount Etna]] in modern-day [[Sicily]] is said to be named.}} was a 19th-century [[ironworks]] and manufacturing plant for [[steam engine|marine steam engine]]s located in [[New York City]]. The Etna Works was a failing small business when purchased by [[sand casting|ironmolder]] [[John Roach (shipbuilder)|John Roach]] and three partners in 1852. Roach soon gained full ownership of the business and quickly transformed it into a successful general-purpose ironworks.\n\nRoach took advantage of the [[American Civil War]] to transform the Etna Works into one of New York's leading manufacturers of [[marine steam engine]]s. By the end of the war, he was in a position to acquire the businesses of most of his major New York competitors, which had run into financial difficulties. Roach subsequently consolidated his operations at the [[Morgan Iron Works]], and some time afterward rented the Etna Works to the inventor [[Thomas Edison]], who turned it into a [[dynamo]] factory. The Roach family sold the former Etna Works property in 1887. The Etna Works buildings, along with the street on which they were located, were later liquidated in a city redevelopment.\n\nNotable achievements of the Etna Iron Works include the building of the steam-operated [[Third Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Third Avenue Harlem Bridge]] in the 1860s, and the manufacture in the 1860s of the engines for the giant ironclad {{USS|Dunderberg}} and for the passenger steamers [[Bristol (1866)|''Bristol'']] and [[Providence (1866)|''Providence'']], the latter two of which were the largest marine engines built in the [[United States]] to that date.\n\n==Background==\n[[ File:John Roach.jpg | thumb| upright | [[John Roach]] ]] \nJohn Roach emigrated from [[Ireland]] to the United States in 1832 at the age of sixteen, eventually obtaining employment as a common laborer at the [[Howell Works]] of [[James P. Allaire]] at an initial wage of 25c a day. After securing an apprenticeship as an ironmolder at Howell Works, Roach later transferred to Allaire's other plant, the [[Allaire Iron Works]] in New York, where he learned the manufacturing method for [[marine steam engine]]s. Roach would remain an employee of Allaire's for twenty years.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 4&ndash;7, 14.</ref>\n\nBy the 1850s, Roach, concerned about the needs of a growing family and anxious to obtain a more secure financial future, began to consider starting his own business. He had been unable to save much money of his own&mdash;only $1,000&mdash;but was able to persuade three of his co-workers at Allaire, including his brother-in-law Joseph Johnstone who had savings of $8,000, to join him. The four partners mustered between them a total of $10,000.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn April 1852, Roach and his three partners purchased for the sum of $4,700 a small New York ironworks known as the Etna Iron Works, which had recently fallen into receivership. The ironworks, located at 102 Goerck Street, occupied a {{convert|40|x|100|ft|m|adj=on}}  property and consisted of a small foundry and some raw materials.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 14&ndash;15.</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[ File:Etna Iron Works (New York) advertisement, 1861.jpg | thumb | upright | 1861 advertisement for the Etna Iron Works ]] \nFollowing their purchase, Roach was given the task of promoting the business while his three partners attended to management of the shop floor. Roach began by touting for custom piecework, his first sale being for cast grate bars for a Brooklyn distillery.<ref name=swann15-16>Swann 1965. pp. 15&ndash;16.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the first year of operations, the partners had made a modest profit of $1,000, but now a dispute broke out over how to employ the money. Roach wanted to use it to expand the business, but his three partners voted to divide it into dividends of $250 each. Realizing that they had reached the limit of their ambition, Roach took out a mortgage on the property and used the loan to buy his partners out, thus becoming sole proprietor.<ref name=swann15-16/>\n\nRoach thereafter began canvassing the local shipyards for business. Although New York's shipbuilders were still at this time constructing mostly wooden sailing ships, each ship needed about forty pounds of iron fastenings and cables, in addition to a number of anchors. In one ninety-day period, Roach made a profit from such sales of $8,000, giving his business a solid foundation.<ref name=swann16>Swann 1965. p. 16.</ref>\n\nRoach was able to continue expanding the business through the sale of a variety of products, including [[Franklin stove]]s, firebacks, slats for iron shutters and other items. In 1856 he added a new steam [[boiler]] to the ironworks for driving a blower which forced a draft into the melting furnace, thus obtaining a higher temperature and melting the iron faster, which saved valuable man-hours. He also purchased the adjoining property at 104\u2013106 Goerck St., upon which stood a small three-storey building. Roach used the third floor as a pattern shop, while renting out the first and second floors to an iron shutter manufacturer.<ref name=swann16/>\n\nBy 1859, Roach was employing forty men and his property was valued at $15,000. A contemporary evaluator noted that Roach was \"getting along well\" and deemed him \"safe for a fair amount of credit\".<ref>The Mercantile Agency, Vol. CCCXVII, p. 229, cited in Swann 1965. p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Foundry explosion===\n\nOn September 2, 1859, the forced-draft boiler for the Etna Works' furnace exploded after accidentally being allowed to run dry, killing one man and seriously injuring two others, and gutting the building in which it stood. The $5,000 damage was covered by insurance, but the foundry would be forced to close without steam power.<ref name=swann17/>\n\nUndeterred, Roach negotiated the use of a boiler in a neighbouring factory, ran 200 feet of pipe from their boiler to his workshop, and was back in production within 48 hours.<ref name=swann17/>\n\n===Windfall capital injection===\n\nIn 1859, one of Roach's closest friends, a lawyer named John Baker, died and left Roach the trustee of his estate. The estate, worth $70,000, was entrusted to Roach for investment until Baker's four children came of age. Since the money could not be claimed until 1881, it was as good as a long-term interest-free loan to Roach, who was soon to take advantage of it to expand his business.<ref name=swann17>Swann 1965. p. 17.</ref>\n[[File:Third Avenue Harlem Bridge 1864.jpg|thumb|Third Avenue Harlem Bridge, completed in 1868]]\n===Third Avenue Harlem Bridge===\n\nOne of the largest projects undertaken by the Etna Iron Works was for construction of the [[Third Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Third Avenue Harlem Bridge]] over the [[Harlem River]], New York. The project was submitted to public tender by the City of New York in 1860 and Roach secured the contract with the lowest bid. The contract called for a bridge with a pivoting center section which could be rotated to allow large ships to pass through one of two channels beneath.<ref name=swann1718>Swann 1965. pp. 17&ndash;18.</ref>\n\nRoach had no prior experience of bridge building, so he hired an engineer with appropriate experience to design and oversee the project, and subcontracted out the masonry work.<ref name=swann1718/> The bridge that was eventually constructed was {{convert|526|ft}} long, with masonry foundations, a cast-and-wrought iron superstructure, and a {{convert|216|ft|m|adj=mid}} steam-powered pivoting center section spanning two {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ship channels.<ref name=nycroads/> The bridge opened for traffic in 1868,<ref name=nycroads/><ref>Swann 1965. p. 18.</ref> and operated reliably for about thirty years until increasing maintenance costs and traffic persuaded the city fathers to construct a new bridge with faster operation and higher and wider dimensions.<ref name=nycroads>{{cite web |url= http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/third-avenue/ |title= Third Avenue Bridge |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= NYCRoads.com |publisher= Eastern Roads |access-date= 2020-04-06 }}</ref>{{efn|<ref>Stoddard 1893. pp. [https://archive.org/details/menofbusiness00stod/page/82/mode/2up 83\u201386].</ref> The source erroneously states that the bridge opened in 1864.}}\n\n==American Civil War==\n[[File:USS Dunderberg cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Engines for the mammoth ironclad {{USS|Dunderberg}} were supplied by the Etna Iron Works]]\nRoach had long nurtured a desire to become a builder of marine steam engines like his mentor James Allaire. Competition in the industry was fierce, and entry difficult due to high capital costs, but Roach believed that by utilization of the best tools, labor-saving devices and practices, he could compete successfully. Accordingly, through the late 1850s he sent engineers to the [[United Kingdom]] to study the latest in marine engine technology, and was not above hiring himself out as a mechanic to New York's leading engine builders of the day to spy on their organization, technology and practices.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 18.</ref>\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Roach was thus already well prepared to take advantage of the huge demand for marine engines generated by the conflict. He began by contacting the shipbuilder [[William H. Webb]], who had just secured a contract for the huge new [[ironclad]] {{USS|Dunderberg}}. Webb's usual engine suppliers, the [[Morgan Iron Works]] and [[Novelty Iron Works]], were heavily inundated with orders and unable to meet his needs. Webb was so relieved to find an alternative source of supply, he not only awarded the ''Dunderberg''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine contract to Roach, but also became guarantor for the higher line of credit Roach would need to re-equip his works for completing the job.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 18&ndash;19.</ref>\n\nRoach next travelled to Washington to meet the U.S. Navy's Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering, [[Benjamin Franklin Isherwood]]. On October 24, 1862, Isherwood awarded Roach a contract to supply the machinery for the Navy's new gunboat {{USS|Peoria|1863|2}}\u2014the first of a number of such contracts Roach would fulfill for the Navy in coming years. Roach also secured contracts for the engines for two new Neptune Steamship Company vessels, ''Electra'' and ''Galatea''.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 19.</ref>\n\nHaving secured these contracts, Roach set about equipping the Etna Iron Works for its new role. He began by hiring Thomas Main, a leading engineer with experience in a number of the world's most advanced engine works, as the plant's superintendent. Roach then began reorganizing the Works, adding a boilershop, machine shop, coppersmith shop and blacksmith, and equipping the plant with a host of new machines including traveling and swing cranes and the steam engines to power them, along with planers, lathes, boring mills, punches, shears and rollers. Amongst the new equipment was a planer capable of finishing 100-ton iron plates, and a lathe capable of boring a {{convert|112|in|cm|adj=mid|-diameter}} cylinder\u2014the two largest machine tools in the entire country.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 19&ndash;20.</ref>\n\nOver the next two years, Roach's plant produced the engines for at least fifteen vessels, including return orders from the U.S. Navy and a dozen engines for the Van Deusen Brothers. At its wartime peak, the Etna Iron Works employed almost 2,000 workers and was valued at $150,000, putting it in the front rank of New York's engine builders.<ref name=swann23>Swann 1965. p. 23.</ref>\n\n==Postwar consolidation==\n[[ File:Casting a marine engine cylinder at the Etna Iron Works, 1866.jpg | thumb | Casting an engine cylinder for either the steamboat {{ship||Bristol|1866|2}} or {{ship||Providence|1866|2}} at the Etna Iron Works, 1866. These were the largest-bore marine engines built in the United States at the time. ]] \nShortly after the war, the U.S. Navy auctioned off hundreds of ships it had requisitioned for the war effort, flooding the market and seriously depressing prices. The resulting slump in the U.S. shipping industry sent many long-established American shipyards and marine engineers to the wall, and New York was one of the worst affected locations, with its maritime industry all but wiped out by the slump. By 1867, most of Roach's marine engine competitors had gone bankrupt.<ref name=swann23/>\n\nRoach himself, however, was able to prosper during this time by securing a diversity of machinery contracts. The Navy through Benjamin Isherwood ordered three engines and six large boilers for the ''Guerriere'' class vessels, while shipbuilder William Webb contracted with Roach for the machinery for two large new [[sidewheel steamer]]s, {{ship||Bristol|1866|2}} and {{ship||Providence|1866|2}}. The engines for the latter two ships, with their massive {{convert|110|in|cm|adj=mid}} cylinders, were the largest-[[bore (engine)|bore]] ship engines ever produced in the United States up to that time. More importantly for Roach however, he realized that the government was planning to modernize its own shipyards, and he made a timely shift into the manufacture of [[machine tool]]s in 1866. He was rewarded by the securing of almost a million dollars in government machine tool contracts between 1866 and 1868.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 24.</ref>\n\nAt this point, Roach decided that his business had outgrown its original location. He was keen to establish a plant with direct water frontage, which would both save him the cost of transporting his engines to the docks, and also enable him to move into the potentially lucrative business of ship repair. The obvious target for acquisition was the Morgan Iron Works, a leading ironworks with frontage on the East River, and which like most other marine engineering plants had lain mostly idle since the Civil War. Fortuitously for Roach, the proprietor, shipping magnate [[Charles Morgan (businessman)|Charles Morgan]], had recently experienced a setback in his own business dealings, as a result of which he was short of capital. Morgan quickly agreed to sell the premises along with all of its equipment for the sum of $450,000.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 24&ndash;25.</ref>\n\nAt around the same time, two of Roach's former competitors, the [[Allaire Iron Works]] and the Franklin Forge, went bankrupt, and Roach purchased the best of their equipment at firesale prices and also hired their best workers. To these he added the best workers and equipment from the Etna and Morgan establishments, and consolidated his operations at the latter, vacating his former premises at Goerck Street. Roach profited further at this time from the sale of his surplus equipment to the U.S. Navy, but on this occasion some rival business interests raised a protest and the deal became the subject of an acrimonious government inquiry (see the [[John Roach (shipbuilder)|John Roach]] article for details).<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 26&ndash;27.</ref>\n\n==Later developments==\n\nFollowing the consolidation of his business at the Morgan Iron Works, Roach rented out his old Etna Iron Works property to various tenants. The Etna Works continued to operate as a general ironworks under new management until about 1881, when inventor [[Thomas Edison]] relocated production for his electrical illumination utility there.<ref>Swann 1965. p. 228.</ref> Edison renamed the plant the [[Edison Machine Works]], using it to build DC dynamos until 1887. In that year, the Roach family business sold the premises, the Edison having moved their expanding Machine Works to a much larger site in [[Schenectady, NY]]. The property, along with the street in which it was situated, was later liquidated in a 1940s redevelopment.\n\nRoach himself went on to establish his own shipyard in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], the [[Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works]], which became America's largest and most productive shipyard from its establishment in 1871 until the mid-1880s.<ref>Swann 1965. pp. 51, 56.</ref>\n\n== Marine engine production tables ==\n\nAt least 27 marine steam engines for 19 ships were produced by the Etna Iron Works.
