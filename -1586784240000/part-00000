The flowers can range in color from white, to pale pink or lavender.  The leaves of the plant are [[leaf shape|lanceolate]] to ovate in shape, ranging from 6\u201310&nbsp;cm long and 2&nbsp;cm wide, with three parallel veins.  The leaves are larger and more numerous near the base of the stem. (Patrick, Krakow, 1995)\n\nThe plant typically flowers from mid-May through June, with fruit being produced in July and August.  (Tsao, Van Lonkhuyzen, 2000)  The fruit is a 5-angled, 10-ribbed [[achene]], about 4&nbsp;mm long, with a hairy, resin-dotted surface. The fruit is topped by a crown ([[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]]) of five, narrowly triangular, sharply pointed scales, which are 1\u20133&nbsp;mm long. The fruits are found among the sharply pointed [[bract]]s ([[chaff]]), which persist on the flower head. (Patrick, Krakow, 1995)\n\n==Habitat==\n\nThe Mohr's Barbara's buttons, ''Marshallia mohrii'', requires wet, sandy clay soils, with [[Alkali soils|alkaline pH]], and high organic matter.  Most currently known populations occur on soils of the Conasauga-Firestone Association. (Alabama Power Company, 2007)  This is typically found along shale-bedded streams, especially in seasonally moist forest gaps, and in low [[swale (geographic feature)|swales]] extending onto roadside rights-of-way.  Mohr's Barbara Button can survive in full sun or partial shade, often in association with grass-sedge communities.  Two other endangered species have the same habitat requirements as the Mohr's Barbara Button: The Alabama Leather-Flower and the [[Green Pitcher Plant]] are both listed as endangered, and occupy the same limited habitat. (Alabama Power Company, 2007)\n\n==Conservation==\n\n===Threats===\nMohr's Barbara's buttons suffers primarily from habitat loss due to residential development, road maintenance and enlargement, trash disposal, and to a small extent, agricultural development. Because the environments in which Mohr's Barbara's buttons exists are typically alkaline, sandy soils, crop production is not typically favorable in these environments.\n\nAlthough direct human destruction of habitat can be blamed for population declines, too much human influence in protecting it can be problematic as well. [[Wildfire suppression|Fire suppression]] in the pine and oak forests of the southeast United States has also taken its toll on the Mohr's Barbara's buttons. Although the species requires mature pine and oak forests to survive, without occasional fires, the glades and openings required by the species become overgrown with forest vegetation. Therefore, the trees and habitat needed by the Mohr's Barbara's buttons, and protected through fire suppression can become a major problem as well for the species.  (Matthews, 1994)\n\nAnother risk many species face, especially plant species, is [[habitat fragmentation]].  As habitat gets destroyed, it is common that individual populations get isolated from each other.  As populations get isolated from each other, and members of differing populations cannot interact, the [[genetic variation]] within populations starts to decrease.  If populations are not able to interact for many generations, a loss of genetic diversity with populations, and the species as a whole become a very real problem. Luckily, habitat fragmentation and a lack of genetic variation is not a problem for Mohr's Barbara Button, as the species has more variation than most others in its environment.  Also, the genetic variation within populations is greater than amongst populations.  (Jolls)\n\n===Protection methods===\n\nThere are many stakeholders involved in protecting the Mohr's Barbara's buttons.  The [[Calcareous grassland|calcareous glades]] necessary for the survival of Mohr's Barbara's buttons used to be fairly common and widespread.  Currently, the remaining areas predominantly exist on private land, with none on federally protected land.  Therefore, landowners are one of the most important stakeholders involved.  But, government and private organizations in charge of protecting plant species need to educate and work with private landowners to ensure the protection and survival of the habitat required for Mohr's Barbara's buttons.\n\nGovernment organizations are also necessary to protect habitat, as road construction and urban development is a major cause of [[habitat destruction]].  Therefore, an adequate examination of the land should occur prior to zoning, construction and/or development.  Also, even if the land is safe from construction or development, it has to be protected from the effects of human population.  Garbage and waste disposal can pollute and destroy critical habitat, as well as over-use by grazing livestock.\n\nPresently, the [[Nature Conservancy]] has purchased several areas with calcareous glades and marly prairies, to ensure the survival of the Mohr's Barbara's buttons and those endangered species that occupy the same habitat.  They are also working with landowners to protect those areas that are found on private land.  (Schotz, 2001)  Through habitat protection by private and public sectors, the Mohr's Barbara's buttons and other endangered species can survive and flourish for future generations.\n\nBecause some populations have become established in road right-of-ways and ditches, it is important to check road ditches before mowing or construction.  This ensures no populations that have established in road right-of-ways are destroyed.  Simply not mowing an area of roadside will not detract from the aesthetics of an area, and will protect valuable individuals/populations.\n\n====Reasons to protect====\n\nThe Mohr's Barbara's buttons is a wildflower endemic to the United States.  Protecting habitat does not require setting aside large tracts of valuable land.  The land its habitat primarily occupies is low in value, and not highly desired for agricultural production.\n\nSince the Mohr's Barbara's buttons is a plant, it cannot migrate to another area that is more suitable, or safer.  For this reason, Mohr's Barbara's buttons, as with most plants, is susceptible to major population loss due to habitat degradation or destruction.  Therefore, humans need to protect the environments these plants require to survive.  Since Mohr's Barbara's buttons has a very distinct and limited habitat, it is vital to protect these habitats as a whole, as they are important to several other threatened and endangered species as well.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Tsao, C.

The minbar was destroyed by fire in 1969 following an arson attack by an evangelical Christian. King Hussein of Jordan launched a 30-year search, including international competitions, to find a sufficiently qualified person to re-design the intricate patterns of the minbar. The competition was finally won by Dr Minwer Al-Meheid<ref>{{Cite book|last=Meehan|first=Mark W.|title=Islam, Modernity, and the Liminal Space Between|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Newcastle Upon Tyne|pages=96-97}}</ref> who was inspired to make his submission after spending a year studying Critchlow's work:<blockquote>\"Seemingly, the ancient knowledge of how to map the structure geometrically had been lost. Until, that is, Minwer al-Meheid, an engineer from Jordan, walked into a bookshop in Damascus and fell upon a work that contained the answers.

I  got fascinated by the book [''Islamic Patterns''] and fascinated by the man who wrote it. So I wanted to meet Keith since that time because I thought this man knows a lot more than what is in that book. Keith is fascinating, he's dynamic.

One of his last major architectural projects was supporting Marks Barfield Architects in designing the [[Cambridge Central Mosque]], Europe's first eco-friendly mosque<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cambridgecentralmosque.org/|title=Cambridge Central Mosque|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 Apr 2020}}</ref>.

Bristow played [[college basketball]] at  [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech]], and was selected by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the second round of the [[1973 NBA draft]]. A 6&nbsp;ft 7 in, {{convert|210|lb|abbr=on}} [[forward (basketball)|forward]], he had a 10-year career in both the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]], playing for the Sixers, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] (in both leagues), the [[Utah Jazz]], and finishing his playing career with the [[Dallas Mavericks]]. His nickname was \"Disco\".\n\nIn 1991, Bristow was hired to be the third head coach for the recently created [[Charlotte Hornets]] franchise, a position he held for five years. Led by players such as [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]], the Hornets were the first of the late-1980s expansion teams to be successful, reaching the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in 1993 and 1995. Bristow resigned in 1996.\n\nBristow became the [[New Orleans Hornets]]' general manager in 2004, a position he relinquished in 2005.\n\nIn 1997, Bristow was inducted into the [[Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|Virginia Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Virginia Tech career==\nAllan Bristow paced the [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech]] basketball team to the [[1973 National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) championship, and became the fourth Tech basketball player to have his jersey retired by the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Virginia Tech 2018-19 Men's Basketball Media Guide |url=https://hokiesports.com/documents/2019/1/24//vt_2018_19_mbb_media_guide_1_24_19.pdf?id=2415 |pages=46}}</ref> Bristow still holds the Hokies\u2019 single game marks of 52 points and 22 field goals which he accomplished in a 117\u201389 win against [[George Washington University]].

Bristow averaged 27.3 points and 17.1 rebounds per game as a freshman on the JV/Freshmen. (At the time he began his career, freshmen could not play on the varsity team). Bristow averaged 20.4 points and 13.1 rebounds per game for the 1970\u201371 Hokies that finished 14\u201311. He was second on the team in scoring that season to [[Loyd King]] (21.3 ppg), marking the only time that two Hokies ever averaged over 20 points in a single season.<ref>{{cite web |title=1970-71 Virginia Tech Hokies Roster and Stats |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/allan-bristow-1.html |website=Sports Reference College Basketball}}</ref> \n\n[[Don DeVoe]] took over as coach of the Hokies for the 1971\u201372 season, and Bristow led the team with 25.0 points and 13.4 rebounds in a 16\u201310 effort.<ref>{{cite web |title=1971-72 Virginia Tech Hokies Roster and Stats |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/allan-bristow-1.html |website=Sports Reference College Basketball}}</ref> \n\nIn 1972\u201373, the Hokies raced to an 18\u20135 regular season mark, and a berth in the NIT.

Tech forced overtime against the heavily favored Fighting Irish, and then found themselves down by one as they took the ball in bounds with 12 seconds to play.

He made his NBA debut on October 13, 1973. Bristow played in 55 games in his rookie year averaging 11.7 minutes per game with 4.7 points per game and 3.0 rebounds per game with Philadelphia. After his second season, Bristow was waived by the 76ers. Bristow moved to the ABA's [[San Antonio Spurs]] for one season before the Spurs joined the NBA the following year in 1976. He spent four years total with San Antonio before signing as a free agent with the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]] in 1979. Bristow and [[Wayne Cooper (basketball)|Wayne Cooper]] were traded by the Jazz to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in 1981 for [[Bill Robinzine]]. After two seasons with Dallas, Bristow retired from the NBA in 1983. Bristow had averages of 7.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 3.2 assists in 648 games.\n\n==Executive and coaching career==\nBristow began his professional coaching career as an assistant coach for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the 1983\u201384 season. He then moved to the [[Denver Nuggets]] as an assistant to coach [[Doug Moe]] for six seasons from 1984 to 1990. In 1990 the [[Charlotte Hornets]] named Bristow as Vice President of Basketball Operations, in charge of scouting, draft picks and trades. Bristow replaced [[Gene Littles]] as coach of the Charlotte Hornets in summer 1991, becoming the Hornets' third head coach. He was the first Hornets coach to bring major success to the franchise. He guided Charlotte to its first ever playoff appearance and first ever playoff series victory in the same year. His best season as head coach was in the 1994\u201395 season when the Hornets recorded a franchise-record 50 victories. He coached the Hornets team to a record of 207\u2013203, but his teams were just 5\u20138 in the playoffs. In the 1996 off-season the Hornets ended his five-year run as their head coach by buying out the final year of Bristow's contract after the Hornets finished their season short of the playoffs with a 41\u201341 record.

Bristow played [[college basketball]] at  [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech]], and was selected by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the second round of the [[1973 NBA draft]]. A 6&nbsp;ft 7 in, {{convert|210|lb|abbr=on}} [[forward (basketball)|forward]], he had a 10-year career in both the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]], playing for the Sixers, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] (in both leagues), the [[Utah Jazz]], and finishing his playing career with the [[Dallas Mavericks]]. His nickname was \"Disco\".\n\nIn 1991, Bristow was hired to be the third head coach for the recently created [[Charlotte Hornets]] franchise, a position he held for five years. Led by players such as [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]], the Hornets were the first of the late-1980s expansion teams to be successful, reaching the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] in 1993 and 1995. Bristow resigned in 1996.\n\nBristow became the [[New Orleans Hornets]]' general manager in 2004, a position he relinquished in 2005.\n\nIn 1997, Bristow was inducted into the [[Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|Virginia Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Virginia Tech career==\nAllan Bristow paced the [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech]] basketball team to the [[1973 National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) championship, and became the fourth Tech basketball player to have his jersey retired by the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Virginia Tech 2018-19 Men's Basketball Media Guide |url=https://hokiesports.com/documents/2019/1/24//vt_2018_19_mbb_media_guide_1_24_19.pdf?id=2415 |pages=46}}</ref> Bristow still holds the Hokies\u2019 single game marks of 52 points and 22 field goals which he accomplished in a 117\u201389 win against [[George Washington University]].

Bristow averaged 27.3 points and 17.1 rebounds per game as a freshman on the JV/Freshmen. (At the time he began his career, freshmen could not play on the varsity team). Bristow averaged 20.4 points and 13.1 rebounds per game for the 1970\u201371 Hokies that finished 14\u201311. He was second on the team in scoring that season to [[Loyd King]] (21.3 ppg), marking the only time that two Hokies ever averaged over 20 points in a single season.<ref>{{cite web |title=1970-71 Virginia Tech Hokies Roster and Stats |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/allan-bristow-1.html |website=Sports Reference College Basketball}}</ref> \n\n[[Don DeVoe]] took over as coach of the Hokies for the 1971\u201372 season, and Bristow led the team with 25.0 points and 13.4 rebounds in a 16\u201310 effort.<ref>{{cite web |title=1971-72 Virginia Tech Hokies Roster and Stats |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/allan-bristow-1.html |website=Sports Reference College Basketball}}</ref> \n\nIn 1972\u201373, the Hokies raced to an 18\u20135 regular season mark, and a berth in the NIT. (At the time, only 32 teams made the NCAA tournament). Tech beat three teams by four points in the preliminary rounds before facing Notre Dame under legendary coach [[Digger Phelps]] in the finals. Tech forced overtime against the heavily favored Fighting Irish, and then found themselves down by one as they took the ball in bounds with 12 seconds to play. Bobby Stevens took a shot from just above the foul-line with about six seconds left, and chased his own rebound down on the right corner where he turned and beat the buzzer for a 92\u201391 win.<ref>{{cite web |title=1973 NIT Championship Game |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMxjTWf78Wc}}</ref>  Bristow scored a total of 91 points in the four NIT games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sports Reference College Baskeball |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/virginia-tech/1973-schedule.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sports Reference College Basketball |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/virginia-tech/1973-schedule.html}}</ref> Including the NIT, Bristow led the team with a 23.9 points per game average and also pulled down 11.6 rebounds per contest.<ref>{{cite web |title=1972-73 Virginia Tech Hokies Roster and Stats |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/allan-bristow-1.html |website=Sports Reference College Basketball}}</ref> \n\nBristow was named to the [[Virginia Tech Sports Hall]] of Fame in 1984 and his jersey was retired by the university in 1998.\n\n==NBA playing career==\nBristow was selected in the second round of the [[1973 NBA draft]] (21st overall pick) by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. He made his NBA debut on October 13, 1973. Bristow played in 55 games in his rookie year averaging 11.7 minutes per game with 4.7 points per game and 3.0 rebounds per game with Philadelphia. After his second season, Bristow was waived by the 76ers. Bristow moved to the ABA's [[San Antonio Spurs]] for one season before the Spurs joined the NBA the following year in 1976. He spent four years total with San Antonio before signing as a free agent with the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]] in 1979. Bristow and [[Wayne Cooper (basketball)|Wayne Cooper]] were traded by the Jazz to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in 1981 for [[Bill Robinzine]]. After two seasons with Dallas, Bristow retired from the NBA in 1983. Bristow had averages of 7.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 3.2 assists in 648 games.\n\n==Executive and coaching career==\nBristow began his professional coaching career as an assistant coach for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the 1983\u201384 season. He then moved to the [[Denver Nuggets]] as an assistant to coach [[Doug Moe]] for six seasons from 1984 to 1990. In 1990 the [[Charlotte Hornets]] named Bristow as Vice President of Basketball Operations, in charge of scouting, draft picks and trades. Bristow replaced [[Gene Littles]] as coach of the Charlotte Hornets in summer 1991, becoming the Hornets' third head coach. He was the first Hornets coach to bring major success to the franchise. He guided Charlotte to its first ever playoff appearance and first ever playoff series victory in the same year. His best season as head coach was in the 1994\u201395 season when the Hornets recorded a franchise-record 50 victories. He coached the Hornets team to a record of 207\u2013203, but his teams were just 5\u20138 in the playoffs. In the 1996 off-season the Hornets ended his five-year run as their head coach by buying out the final year of Bristow's contract after the Hornets finished their season short of the playoffs with a 41\u201341 record. Bristow is still the Hornets all-time leader in wins with 207 regular season victories. Bristow later served as Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Nuggets from 1997 to 1998.\n\n===Head coaching record===\n{{NBA coach statistics legend}}\n{{NBA coach statistics start}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[1991\u201392 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{nbay|1991}}\n| 82 || 31 || 51 || {{Winning percentage|31|51}} ||align=\"center\"|6th in Central|| \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013 || {{Winning percentage|0|0}}\n|align=\"center\"|Missed Playoffs\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte]]\n|align=\"left\"|{{nbay|1992}}\n| 82 || 44 || 38 || {{Winning percentage|44|38}} ||align=\"center\"|3rd in Central|| 9 || 4 || 5 || {{Winning percentage|4|5}}\n|align=\"center\"|Lost in [[1993 NBA Playoffs|Conf.

On February 17, an e-mail from one participant indicated that the type of social gathering on the ''Diamond Princess'' cruise ship wasn't that different from a mall, school, or work environment. Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\"  For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective. Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools. Governors began to implement NPI's thereafter, \"largely without federal leadership.\"<ref name=\"NYT_Red_Dawn1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.html?|title=The \u2018Red Dawn\u2019 Emails: 8 Key Exchanges on the Faltering Response to the Coronavirus|date=April 11, 2020|work=nytimes.com|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 20 and 21, two more cases of people who had returned from China are confirmed in California.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 \"California's coronavirus cases now at 15, with new diagnoses in Humboldt, Sacramento areas\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222020122/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 |date=February 22, 2020 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'', February 21, 2020</ref> The first case of [[community transmission]], because it had no known origin, is confirmed in Solano County, California, on February 26.<ref>[https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx \"CDC Confirms Possible First Instance of COVID-19 Community Transmission in California\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228203724/https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx |date=February 28, 2020 }}, ''Calif.

On February 17, an e-mail from one participant indicated that the type of social gathering on the ''Diamond Princess'' cruise ship wasn't that different from a mall, school, or work environment. Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\"  For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective. Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools. Governors began to implement NPI's thereafter, \"largely without federal leadership.\"<ref name=\"NYT_Red_Dawn1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.html?|title=The \u2018Red Dawn\u2019 Emails: 8 Key Exchanges on the Faltering Response to the Coronavirus|date=April 11, 2020|work=nytimes.com|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 20 and 21, two more cases of people who had returned from China are confirmed in California.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 \"California's coronavirus cases now at 15, with new diagnoses in Humboldt, Sacramento areas\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222020122/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 |date=February 22, 2020 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'', February 21, 2020</ref> The first case of [[community transmission]], because it had no known origin, is confirmed in Solano County, California, on February 26.<ref>[https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx \"CDC Confirms Possible First Instance of COVID-19 Community Transmission in California\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228203724/https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx |date=February 28, 2020 }}, ''Calif.
