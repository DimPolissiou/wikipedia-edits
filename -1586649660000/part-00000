Development in [[assembly language]] on the [[RISC OS]] started in 1986 after they left school, and continued while they were at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities, respectively. Both were music students, and said they wrote the program because they did not like the laborious process of writing music by hand.<ref>[http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/technology/sibelius-1993 'Sibelius'].  ''Music Printing History''.</ref>\n\nThe program was released to the public in April 1993 on 3.5-inch floppy disk. It required considerably less than 1 MB of memory (Sibelius 7 needed only 548 kB for a 33-page symphonic score, for example), and the combination of assembly language and the Archimedes' ARM processor meant that it ran very quickly. No matter how long the score, changes were displayed almost instantly. A unique feature of the Sibelius [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] at that time was the ability it gave the user to drag the entire score around with the mouse, offering a bird's eye of the score, as distinct from having to use the [[QWERTY]] input keyboard arrow keys, or equivalent, to scroll the page.\n\nThe first ever user of Sibelius was the composer and engraver [[Richard Emsley]], who provided advice on [[music engraving]] prior to the start of development, and [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta tested]] the software before its release. The first concert performance from a Sibelius score was of an orchestral work by [[David Robert Coleman]], copied by Emsley. The first score published using Sibelius was ''Antara'' by [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]], also copied by Emsley, and published by [[Faber Music]]. Other [[early adopters]] included composer [[John Rutter]], conductor [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], and publisher [[Music Sales]].\n\nAs a [[killer application]] for the niche [[Acorn Computers|Acorn]] platform, Sibelius rapidly dominated the UK market.<ref name=\"Guardian_2001-11-01\">\n{{cite news\n| first = Derek\n| last = Bourgeois\n| title = Score yourself an orchestra\n| date = 1 November 2001\n| publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]]\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/nov/01/onlinesupplement3\n| work = The Guardian\n| accessdate =10 May 2011\n| quote = Many composers bought an Archimedes simply to have access to the program.\n}}\n</ref> It also sold in smaller numbers in a few other countries, restricted by the availability of Acorn computers.

It supports virtually all music notations, enabling even the most complex of modern orchestral, choral, jazz, pop, folk, rock and chamber music scores to be engraved to publication quality. Further, it allows scores to be played back or turned into MIDI or audio files, e.g. to create a CD. A built-in sample player and a large range of sampled sounds are included.<ref>[http://www.sibelius.com/products/sibelius/7/professional_sound_library.html 'Professional sound library\u2014only in Sibelius']</ref> Sibelius supports any MIDI device, and allows [[Virtual Studio Technology]] (VST) and [[Audio Units]] plug-ins to be used as playback instruments, giving users access to [[Sibelius (scorewriter)#Add-ons|third-party sample libraries]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Sibelius Software|title=VST play back in Sibelius 5|url=http://www.sibelius.com/products/sibelius/5/vst.html|accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref> Score playback can also be synchronised to video, or to [[Digital audio workstation|DAW]] software via the [[ReWire]] standard.\n\nBy default, Sibelius plays a brief passage from a [[Jean Sibelius]] symphony as it launches, a feature that can be disabled in the application's Preferences if desired. Each version has used a different excerpt; e.g. Sibelius 7 appropriately uses the main theme from [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Sibelius' 7th Symphony]].\n\nIn Version 7.0, [[Avid (company)|Avid]] rebuilt Sibelius as a [[64-bit computing|64 bit application]], replacing the [[Menu (computing)|menu navigation system]] of previous versions with a [[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon interface]] in the process.

Development in [[assembly language]] on the [[RISC OS]] started in 1986 after they left school, and continued while they were at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities, respectively. Both were music students, and said they wrote the program because they did not like the laborious process of writing music by hand.<ref>[http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/technology/sibelius-1993 'Sibelius'].  ''Music Printing History''.</ref>\n\nThe program was released to the public in April 1993 on 3.5-inch floppy disk. It required considerably less than 1 MB of memory (Sibelius 7 needed only 548 kB for a 33-page symphonic score, for example), and the combination of assembly language and the Archimedes' ARM processor meant that it ran very quickly. No matter how long the score, changes were displayed almost instantly. A unique feature of the Sibelius [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] at that time was the ability it gave the user to drag the entire score around with the mouse, offering a bird's eye of the score, as distinct from having to use the [[QWERTY]] input keyboard arrow keys, or equivalent, to scroll the page.\n\nThe first ever user of Sibelius was the composer and engraver [[Richard Emsley]], who provided advice on [[music engraving]] prior to the start of development, and [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta tested]] the software before its release.

It supports virtually all music notations, enabling even the most complex of modern orchestral, choral, jazz, pop, folk, rock and chamber music scores to be engraved to publication quality. Further, it allows scores to be played back or turned into MIDI or audio files, e.g. to create a CD. A built-in sample player and a large range of sampled sounds are included.<ref>[http://www.sibelius.com/products/sibelius/7/professional_sound_library.html 'Professional sound library\u2014only in Sibelius']</ref> Sibelius supports any MIDI device, and allows [[Virtual Studio Technology]] (VST) and [[Audio Units]] plug-ins to be used as playback instruments, giving users access to [[Sibelius (scorewriter)#Add-ons|third-party sample libraries]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Sibelius Software|title=VST play back in Sibelius 5|url=http://www.sibelius.com/products/sibelius/5/vst.html|accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref> Score playback can also be synchronised to video, or to [[Digital audio workstation|DAW]] software via the [[ReWire]] standard.\n\nBy default, Sibelius plays a brief passage from a [[Jean Sibelius]] symphony as it launches, a feature that can be disabled in the application's Preferences if desired.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=McGillBeginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]], a former student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the Macdonald Engineering Building, prior to its burning down in 1903. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder.<ref name=McGillBeginning />}} and Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, while Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=McGillBeginning />\n\nIn 1903, Capper returned to England to establish the School of Architecture at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which was the fourth university architecture school to be established in the British Commonwealth, after [[University of Toronto]] (1890), [[University of Liverpool]] (l894) and McGill (1896).<ref name=McGillBeginning /> The second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students: H.&nbsp;E. Shorey and Gordon H. Blackader, for whom the [[McGill School of Architecture#Libaries and collections|Blackader-Lauterman Library]] is named. Nobbs divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J.

The film won three [[32nd Goya Awards|Goya Awards]], including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the late 1950s, the film opens with an explanatory voice-over narration. Florence Green, a widow, has decided to open a bookshop in the small coastal town of Hardborough, Suffolk, acquiring as her premises the Old House, a damp and abandoned property that has been standing empty for many years. After refurbishing it and moving in, she learns that Violet Gamart, an influential and ambitious local resident, had privately earmarked the Old House for her own pet project, a local arts centre - a project that she has no intention of dropping even though the property is no longer empty. Aided by several of the townspeople Mrs Gamart attempts to get Florence evicted, and the shop closed.\n\nFlorence's business does well enough for her to need help in the shop from Christine, the young daughter of a neighbour. Christine is very effective, even though she says that she does not much like reading. Their best customer is the wealthy bookish recluse Edmund Brundish, who begins to have feelings for Florence as she introduces him to new authors. Learning of the threats to Florence's business, he volunteers to emerge from his seclusion, to visit Mrs Gamart and tell her to desist. The effort involved in doing so is too much for him, and he collapses and dies.\n\nMrs Gamart's nephew, a member of Parliament, sponsors a bill that empowers local councils to buy any historic building that has been left unused for five years. The bill is passed, the Old House is compulsorily purchased, and Florence is evicted. Florence departs from the town by ferry, and is waved off from the quayside by Christine. As the boat draws away she realises that Christine has set the Old House alight.\n\nThe scene switches to the present day and it becomes clear that the narrator is the adult Christine, who now runs her own bookshop.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n{{div col}}\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Florence Green\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Violet Gamart\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Edmund Brundish\n* [[Honor Kneafsey]] as Christine\n* [[Julie Christie]] as voice of older Christine\n* [[James Lance]] as Milo North\n* Harvey Bennett as Wally\n* Reg Wilson as General Gamart\n* Michael Fitzgerald as Mr Raven\n* Conor Smith as School Boy\n* Jorge Suquet as Mr Thornton\n* Hunter Tremayne as Mr Keble\n* [[Frances Barber]] as Jessie\n* [[Gary Piquer]] as Mr Gill\n* Lucy Tillett as Mrs Gipping\n* Lana O'Kell as Ivy Welford\n* Nigel O'Neill as Mr Deben\n* Toby Gibson as Peter Gipping\n* [[Charlotte Vega]] as Kattie\n* Mary O'Driscoll as Mrs Keble\n* Karen Ardiff as Mrs Deben\n* Rachel Gadd as Female Inspector\n* [[Richard Felix]] as William\n* Barry Barnes as Inspector Sheppard\n* Nick Devlin as Harold\n{{div col end}}\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''La librer\u00eda (''the Spanish version of ''The Bookshop''), premiered at the inauguration gala of the 2017 edition of [[SEMINCI]], [[Valladolid]], with excellent reviews.<ref name=\"Foto\">{{Cite web|last1 =Torreiro|first1 =Mirito|url=http://www.fotogramas.es/Cinefilia/La-libreria-Isabel-Coixet|title = La librer\u00eda: de Isabel Coixet: La vida secreta de las palabras |website=Fotogramas|publisher=Hearst Magazines Spain|date = 20 October 2017|access-date=10 November 2017 |language=es}}</ref> The Spanish release took place on 10 November, with unanimous positive reviews<ref name=\"Pais1\">{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2017/10/27/actualidad/1509108510_403105.html|title =As\u00ed es \u2018La librer\u00eda\u2019 de Isabel Coixet|website=[[El Pa\u00eds]]|date = 10 November 2017|access-date=10 November 2017|author=El Pa\u00eds|publisher=[[PRISA]] |language=es}}</ref><ref name=\"Pais2\">{{Cite web|last1 =Boyero|first1 =Carlos |language=es|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2017/11/09/actualidad/1510251475_822351.html|title = La librer\u00eda: de libros y soledades|website=[[El Pa\u00eds]]|date = 10 November 2017|access-date=10 November 2017|publisher=[[PRISA]]}}</ref> and grossed close to 3.5 million USD during its run of more than fifteen weeks in Spanish theatres.<ref name=\"BO\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&country=ES&id=_fTHEBOOKSHOP01|title = The Bookshop: Spain Weekend Box Office|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|date = 28 February 2017|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 December 2017 [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] announced a Berlinale Special Gala with ''The Bookshop'' in February 2018, during the [[68th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/berlin-film-festival-gus-van-sant-dont-worry-competition-titles-1202643615/ |title=Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Worry\u2019 Among First Berlinale Competition Titles to Be Unveiled |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |first=Stewart |last=Clarke |date= 18 December 2017|access-date=18 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Berlinale2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2018/08_pressemitteilungen_2018/08_pressemitteilungen_2018detail_39572.html|title=Berlinale 2018: Benoit Jacquot, Gus Van Sant, Alexey German Jr., Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska, Philip Gr\u00f6ning, Thomas Stuber, and Laura Bispuri in the Competition / Isabel Coixet and Lars Kraume in the Berlinale Special|publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]] |date= 18 December 2017|access-date=18 December 2017|work=Annual Archives: 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 72 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.2/10.

The film won three [[32nd Goya Awards|Goya Awards]], including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the late 1950s, the film opens with an explanatory voice-over narration. Florence Green, a widow, has decided to open a bookshop in the small coastal town of Hardborough, Suffolk, acquiring as her premises the Old House, a damp and abandoned property that has been standing empty for many years. After refurbishing it and moving in, she learns that Violet Gamart, an influential and ambitious local resident, had privately earmarked the Old House for her own pet project, a local arts centre - a project that she has no intention of dropping even though the property is no longer empty. Aided by several of the townspeople Mrs Gamart attempts to get Florence evicted, and the shop closed.\n\nFlorence's business does well enough for her to need help in the shop from Christine, the young daughter of a neighbour. Christine is very effective, even though she says that she does not much like reading. Their best customer is the wealthy bookish recluse Edmund Brundish, who begins to have feelings for Florence as she introduces him to new authors. Learning of the threats to Florence's business, he volunteers to emerge from his seclusion, to visit Mrs Gamart and tell her to desist. The effort involved in doing so is too much for him, and he collapses and dies.\n\nMrs Gamart's nephew, a member of Parliament, sponsors a bill that empowers local councils to buy any historic building that has been left unused for five years. The bill is passed, the Old House is compulsorily purchased, and Florence is evicted. Florence departs from the town by ferry, and is waved off from the quayside by Christine. As the boat draws away she realises that Christine has set the Old House alight.\n\nThe scene switches to the present day and it becomes clear that the narrator is the adult Christine, who now runs her own bookshop.\n\n==Differences from the book==\n\nAlthough the film is in general quite faithful to Penelope Fitzgerald' s book, there are a few differences. \n\nIn the book, the Old House appears to be haunted; the supernatural is entirely absent from the film. \n\nIn the film, there is the implication that Mr Brundish would have been attracted to Florence; this implication is absent from the book. \n\nChristine's educational struggles in school are absent from the film. \n\nMost significantly, Florence does not achieve even the semblance of victory in the book, as she leaves town by bus and the bookshop is converted to an arts centre.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n{{div col}}\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Florence Green\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Violet Gamart\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Edmund Brundish\n* [[Honor Kneafsey]] as Christine\n* [[Julie Christie]] as voice of older Christine\n* [[James Lance]] as Milo North\n* Harvey Bennett as Wally\n* Reg Wilson as General Gamart\n* Michael Fitzgerald as Mr Raven\n* Conor Smith as School Boy\n* Jorge Suquet as Mr Thornton\n* Hunter Tremayne as Mr Keble\n* [[Frances Barber]] as Jessie\n* [[Gary Piquer]] as Mr Gill\n* Lucy Tillett as Mrs Gipping\n* Lana O'Kell as Ivy Welford\n* Nigel O'Neill as Mr Deben\n* Toby Gibson as Peter Gipping\n* [[Charlotte Vega]] as Kattie\n* Mary O'Driscoll as Mrs Keble\n* Karen Ardiff as Mrs Deben\n* Rachel Gadd as Female Inspector\n* [[Richard Felix]] as William\n* Barry Barnes as Inspector Sheppard\n* Nick Devlin as Harold\n{{div col end}}\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''La librer\u00eda (''the Spanish version of ''The Bookshop''), premiered at the inauguration gala of the 2017 edition of [[SEMINCI]], [[Valladolid]], with excellent reviews.<ref name=\"Foto\">{{Cite web|last1 =Torreiro|first1 =Mirito|url=http://www.fotogramas.es/Cinefilia/La-libreria-Isabel-Coixet|title = La librer\u00eda: de Isabel Coixet: La vida secreta de las palabras |website=Fotogramas|publisher=Hearst Magazines Spain|date = 20 October 2017|access-date=10 November 2017 |language=es}}</ref> The Spanish release took place on 10 November, with unanimous positive reviews<ref name=\"Pais1\">{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2017/10/27/actualidad/1509108510_403105.html|title =As\u00ed es \u2018La librer\u00eda\u2019 de Isabel Coixet|website=[[El Pa\u00eds]]|date = 10 November 2017|access-date=10 November 2017|author=El Pa\u00eds|publisher=[[PRISA]] |language=es}}</ref><ref name=\"Pais2\">{{Cite web|last1 =Boyero|first1 =Carlos |language=es|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2017/11/09/actualidad/1510251475_822351.html|title = La librer\u00eda: de libros y soledades|website=[[El Pa\u00eds]]|date = 10 November 2017|access-date=10 November 2017|publisher=[[PRISA]]}}</ref> and grossed close to 3.5 million USD during its run of more than fifteen weeks in Spanish theatres.<ref name=\"BO\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&country=ES&id=_fTHEBOOKSHOP01|title = The Bookshop: Spain Weekend Box Office|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|date = 28 February 2017|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 December 2017 [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] announced a Berlinale Special Gala with ''The Bookshop'' in February 2018, during the [[68th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/berlin-film-festival-gus-van-sant-dont-worry-competition-titles-1202643615/ |title=Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Worry\u2019 Among First Berlinale Competition Titles to Be Unveiled |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |first=Stewart |last=Clarke |date= 18 December 2017|access-date=18 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Berlinale2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2018/08_pressemitteilungen_2018/08_pressemitteilungen_2018detail_39572.html|title=Berlinale 2018: Benoit Jacquot, Gus Van Sant, Alexey German Jr., Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska, Philip Gr\u00f6ning, Thomas Stuber, and Laura Bispuri in the Competition / Isabel Coixet and Lars Kraume in the Berlinale Special|publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]] |date= 18 December 2017|access-date=18 December 2017|work=Annual Archives: 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 72 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.2/10.
