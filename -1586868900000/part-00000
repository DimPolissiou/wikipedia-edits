His political career spanned over half a century, from 1917 to 1973; he served several terms as [[head of government]] and [[head of state]]. He also led the introduction of the [[Constitution of Ireland]].<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Eamon-de-Valera.D.1919-01-21/|title=\u00c9amon de Valera|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nPrior to de Valera's political career, he was a [[commandant]] at [[Boland's Mill]] during the [[Easter Rising|1916 Easter Rising]]. He was arrested, sentenced to death but released for a variety of reasons, including the public response to the British execution of Rising leaders. He returned to Ireland after being jailed in England and became one of the leading political figures of the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]]. After the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], de Valera served as the political leader of [[Anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in]] until 1926, when he, along with many supporters, left the party to set up [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], a new political party which abandoned the policy of [[abstentionism]] from [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].\n\nFrom there, de Valera went on to be at the forefront of Irish politics until the turn of the 1960s. He took over as [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] from [[W. T. Cosgrave]] and later [[Taoiseach]], with the passing of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937. He served as Taoiseach on three different occasions; from 1937 to 1948, from 1951 to 1954 and finally from 1957 to 1959. He remains the [[Records of Irish heads of government since 1922#Cumulative days served|longest serving Taoiseach]] by total days served in the post. He resigned in 1959 upon his election as [[President of Ireland]]. By then, he had been [[Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il]] for 33 years, and he, along with older founding members, began to take a less prominent role relative to newer ministers such as [[Jack Lynch]], [[Charles Haughey]] and [[Neil Blaney]]. He would serve as President of Ireland from 1959 to 1973, two full terms in office.\n\nDe Valera's political beliefs evolved from militant [[Irish republicanism]] to strong [[Social conservatism|social]], [[Cultural conservatism|cultural]] and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal]] conservatism.<ref name=\"Ferriter, 2007\">Ferriter, ''Judging Dev: A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of Eamon De Valera'' (2007), {{ISBN|1-904890-28-8}}.</ref> He has been characterised by a stern, unbending, devious demeanour. His roles in the Civil War have also portrayed him as a divisive figure in Irish history. Biographer [[Tim Pat Coogan]] sees his time in power as being characterised by economic and cultural stagnation, while [[Diarmaid Ferriter]] argues that the stereotype of de Valera as an austere, cold and even backward figure was largely manufactured in the 1960s and is misguided.<ref name=\"Ferriter, 2007\" />\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9amon de Valera was born on 14 October 1882 in New York City, the son of [[Catherine Coll]], who was originally from [[Bruree]], County Limerick, and Juan Vivion de Valera, described on the birth certificate as a Spanish artist born in 1853 in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country, Spain]].<ref>{{cite book| title = A Will To Power: Eamon De Valera | page = 3 |url = https://books.google.ie/books?id=Foz2CwAAQBAJ&q=juan#v=snippet&q=juan&f=false | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 2016 | author = Ronan Fanning | quote = ''De Valera was born on 14 October 1882 in the Nursery and Child's Hospital, Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, New York; the only child of Juan Vivion de Valera and Catherine ('Kate') Coll [..] Vivion de Valera had been born in 1853 in Spain's Basque Country'' | isbn = 9780674970557}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/others/mystery-of-1916-leader-and-new-yorker-eamon-de-valera-s-birth | publisher =\n IrishCentral.com | title = Mystery of 1916 leader and New Yorker Eamon de Valera's birth | date = 14 October 2016 }}</ref> He was born at the Nursery and Child's Hospital, [[Lexington Avenue]], a home for destitute orphans and abandoned children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/de-valera-s-begrudging-attitude-to-the-big-fellow-1.410958|work=[[The Irish Times]]|author=[[Tim Pat Coogan]]|title=De Valera's begrudging attitude to 'The Big Fellow'|date=31 January 2005|access-date=19 January 2019}}</ref> His parents were reportedly married on 18 September 1881 at St Patrick's Church in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], but archivists have not located any marriage certificate or any birth, baptismal, or death certificate information for anyone called Juan Vivion de Valera (nor for \"de Valeros\", an alternative spelling).

His biographer, [[Tim Pat Coogan]], speculated that questions surrounding de Valera's legitimacy may have been a deciding factor in his not entering religious life.

In 1908, he joined the \u00c1rdchraobh of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] (the Gaelic League), where he met [[Sin\u00e9ad de Valera|Sin\u00e9ad Flanagan]], a teacher by profession and four years his senior.

The organisation was formed to oppose the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and ensure the enactment of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]'s [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Act]] won by its leader [[John Redmond]]. After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, de Valera rose through the ranks and it was not long before he was elected captain of the [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]] branch. Preparations were pushed ahead for an armed revolt, and he was made commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade. He took part in the [[Howth gun-running]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dwane|first=David T.|title=Early Life of Eamonn De Valera|publisher=The Talbott Press Limited|year=1922|location=Dublin|page=43|url=https://archive.org/stream/earlylifeofeamon00dwan/earlylifeofeamon00dwan_djvu.txt}}</ref> He was sworn by [[Thomas MacDonagh]] into the oath-bound [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], which secretly controlled the central executive of the Volunteers.

Forces commanded by de Valera occupied [[Boland's Mill]]{{r|gunther1940}} on Grand Canal Street in Dublin. His chief task was to cover the southeastern approaches to the city. After a week of fighting, the order came from [[P\u00e1draig Pearse]] to surrender. De Valera was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to [[penal servitude]] for life.\n\nDe Valera was among the few republican leaders the British did not execute.<ref name=\"gunther1940\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n393/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=371}}</ref> It has been argued that his life was saved by four facts. First, he was one of the last to surrender and he was held in a different prison from other leaders, thus his execution was delayed by practicalities. Second, the US Consulate in Dublin made representations before his trial (i.e., was he actually a United States citizen and if so, how would the United States react to the execution of one of its citizens?) while the full legal situation was clarified. The UK was trying to bring the US into the war in Europe at the time, and the Irish American vote was important in US politics.{{r|gunther1940}} Third, when Lt-Gen [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Sir John Maxwell]] reviewed his case he said, \"Who is he? I haven't heard of him before. I wonder would he be likely to make trouble in the future?\" On being told that de Valera was unimportant, he commuted the court-martial's death sentence to life imprisonment.<ref>Barton, Brian. ''From Behind a Closed Door, Secret Court Martial Records of 1916'', The History Press p. 93.</ref> De Valera had no [[Fenian]] family or personal background and his [[MI5]] file in 1916 was very slim, detailing only his open membership in the [[Irish Volunteers]].<ref>Barton, ibid., p. 92.</ref> Fourth, by the time de Valera was court-martialled on 8 May, political pressure was being brought to bear on Maxwell to halt the executions; Maxwell had already told [[British Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]] that only two more were to be executed, [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada]] and [[James Connolly]], although they were court-martialled the day after de Valera. His late trial, representations made by the American Consulate, his lack of Fenian background and political pressure all combined to save his life, though had he been tried a week earlier he would probably have been shot.<ref>Barton, ibid., pp. 91\u201394.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eamon de Valera's cell in Kilmainham Gaol.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Kilmainham Gaol]] cell of \u00c9amon de Valera]]\n\nDe Valera's supporters and detractors argue about his bravery during the Easter Rising. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and a capacity for meticulous planning. His detractors claim he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916, de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to sit beside him and wake him if he was needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes \"wild\", screaming, \"Set fire to the railway!

They won 73 out of 105 Irish seats, with about 47% of votes cast. 25 seats were uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 Sinn F\u00e9in MPs (the rest were imprisoned or impaired), calling themselves [[Teachta D\u00e1la|Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] (TDs), assembled in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in Dublin and formed an Irish parliament, known as [[First D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (translatable into English as the ''Assembly of Ireland''). The [[Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] was formed, under the leadership of the [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|Pr\u00edomh Aire]] ''(also called [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]])'' [[Cathal Brugha]]. De Valera had been re-arrested in May 1918 and imprisoned and so could not attend the January session of the D\u00e1il. He escaped from [[HM Prison Lincoln|Lincoln Gaol]], England in February 1919. As a result, he replaced Brugha as Pr\u00edomh Aire in the April session of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\nIn the hope of securing international recognition, [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] was sent as envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] convened by the great powers at the end of World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the [[Irish Republic]], to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]]), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic.

He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as [[John Devoy]] and Judge [[Daniel F.

De Valera left day-to-day government, during his eighteen-month absence in the United States, to [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], his 29-year-old [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]]. De Valera and Collins would later become opponents during the Irish Civil War.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' pp. 120\u2013122, {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref>\n\n===President of the Republic===\n[[File:De Valera LCCN2016822004 (crop).jpg|thumb|right|upright|De Valera c. 1918\u20131921]]\nIn January 1921, in his first appearance in the [[D\u00e1il]], after his return to a country gripped by the War of Independence, de Valera introduced a motion calling on the IRA to desist from ambushes and other tactics that were allowing the British to successfully portray it as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group,<ref>[[D. G. Boyce]], ''Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy, 1918\u20131922'' (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1972), pp. 92\u201393.</ref> and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. This they strongly opposed, and de Valera relented, issuing a statement expressing support for the IRA, and claimed it was fully under the control of the D\u00e1il. He then, along with [[Cathal Brugha]] and [[Austin Stack]], brought pressure to bear on [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] to undertake a journey to the United States himself, on the pretext that only he could take up where de Valera had left off. Collins successfully resisted this move and stayed in Ireland. In the [[1921 Irish elections|elections of May 1921]], all candidates in [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] were returned unopposed, and Sinn F\u00e9in secured some seats in [[Northern Ireland]]. Following the [[Truce of July 1921]] that ended the war, de Valera went to see Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] in London on 14 July. No agreement was reached, and by then the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] had already met. It became clear that neither a republic, nor independence for all 32 counties, was going to be offered; Lloyd George told de Valera he could \"put a soldier in Ireland for every man, woman and child in it\" if the IRA did not immediately agree to stop fighting.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' p. 234.</ref> In August 1921, de Valera secured D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann approval to change the 1919 [[D\u00e1il Constitution]] to upgrade his office from prime minister or chairman of the cabinet to a full [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|President of the Republic]]. Declaring himself now the Irish equivalent of King [[George V]], he argued that as Irish head of state, in the absence of the British head of state from the negotiations, he too should not attend the peace conference called the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty Negotiations]] (October\u2013December 1921) at which British and Irish government leaders agreed to the effective independence of twenty-six of Ireland's [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] as the [[Irish Free State]], with Northern Ireland choosing to remain under British sovereignty. It is generally agreed by historians that whatever his motives, it was a mistake for de Valera not to have travelled to London.<ref>Jordan, Anthony J. ''Eamon de Valera 1882\u20131975'', p. 91.</ref>\n\nHaving effected these changes, a [[Irish Boundary Commission|boundary commission]] came into place to redraw the Irish border. [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] expected its report to recommend that largely nationalist areas become part of the Free State, and many hoped this would make Northern Ireland so small it would not be economically viable. A [[Council of Ireland]] was also provided in the Treaty as a model for an eventual all-Irish parliament. Hence neither the pro- nor anti-Treaty sides made many complaints about [[Partition of Ireland|partition]] in the [[Treaty Debates]].\n\n===Anglo-Irish Treaty===\nThe Republic's delegates to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty Negotiations]] were accredited by President de Valera and his cabinet as [[plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] (that is, negotiators with the legal authority to sign a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty.<ref>P. S. O'Hegarty, ''A History of Ireland Under the Union: 1801 to 1922'' (New York: Kraus Reprint Co., 1969), 751.</ref> The Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a [[dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] with the King represented by a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]]. The Irish delegates [[Arthur Griffith]], [[Robert Barton]], and Michael Collins supported by [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] as Secretary-General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]]. It was there, at 11.15&nbsp;am on 5 December 1921, that the decision was made to recommend the Treaty to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]; the Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:20 on 6 December 1921.\n\nDe Valera baulked at the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the negotiations because he knew what the outcome would be and did not wish to receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over the fact that they had not consulted ''him'', their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the D\u00e1il during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the ''Treaty Ports'', the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt was to be paid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.P.A.170001.html |title=De Valera's Treaty proposals |work=Houses of the Oireachtas |accessdate=6 December 2008 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218222359/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.P.A.170001.html |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter the Treaty was narrowly ratified by 64 to 57, de Valera and a large minority of Sinn F\u00e9in TDs left D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He then resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] in his place, though respectfully still calling him 'The President'. On a speaking tour of the more republican province of [[Munster]], starting on 17 March 1922, de Valera made controversial speeches at [[Carrick on Suir]], [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], [[Dungarvan]] and [[Waterford]], saying that: \"''If the Treaty were accepted,'' [by the electorate] ''the fight for freedom would still go on, and the Irish people, instead of fighting foreign soldiers, will have to fight the Irish soldiers of an Irish government set up by Irishmen.''\" At [[Thurles]], several days later, he repeated this imagery and added that the IRA: \"''..would have to wade through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish Government, and perhaps through that of some members of the Irish Government to get their freedom.''\" In a letter to the [[Irish Independent]] on 23 March de Valera accepted the accuracy of their report of his comment about \"wading\" through blood, but deplored that the newspaper had published it.<ref>J.J. O'Kelly ([[Sceilg]]) ''A Trinity of Martyrs'', Irish Book Bureau, Dublin; pp. 66\u201368. \"Sceilg\" was a supporter of de Valera in 1922.</ref>\n\nDe Valera objected to the statement of fidelity that the treaty required Irish parliamentarians to take an oath of allegiance to the King. He also was concerned that Ireland could not have an independent foreign policy as part of the British Commonwealth when the British retained several naval ports (see [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]]) around Ireland's coast. As a compromise, de Valera proposed \"[[external association]]\" with the [[British Empire]], which would leave Ireland's foreign policy in her own hands and a republican constitution with no mention of the British monarch (he proposed this as early as April, well before the negotiations began, under the title \"Document No. 2\"). Michael Collins was prepared to accept this formula and the two wings (pro- and anti-Treaty) of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] formed a pact to fight the [[1922 Irish general election]] together and form a coalition government afterwards. Collins later called off the pact on the eve of the election. De Valera's opponents won the election and civil war broke out shortly afterwards in late June 1922.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' p. 299, {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|Irish Civil War}}\nRelations between the new Irish government, which was backed by most of the D\u00e1il and the electorate, and the anti-Treatyites under the nominal leadership of de Valera, now descended into the Irish Civil War (June 1922 to May 1923), in which the pro-treaty Free State forces defeated the anti-Treaty IRA. Both sides had wanted to avoid civil war, but fighting broke out over the takeover of the [[Four Courts]] in Dublin, by anti-Treaty members of the IRA. These men were not loyal to de Valera and initially were not even supported by the executive of the anti-Treaty IRA. However, Michael Collins was forced to act against them when [[Winston Churchill]] threatened to re-occupy the country with British troops unless action was taken. When fighting broke out in Dublin between the Four Courts garrison and the new [[Free State Army]], republicans backed the IRA men in the Four Courts and civil war broke out. De Valera, though he held no military position, backed the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|anti-Treaty IRA]] or \"Irregulars\" and said that he was re-enlisting in the IRA as an ordinary volunteer. On 8 September 1922, he met in secret with [[Richard Mulcahy]] in Dublin, to try to halt the fighting. However, according to de Valera, they \"could not find a basis\" for agreement.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' p. 338, {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref>\n\nThough nominally head of the anti-Treatyites, de Valera had little influence. He does not seem to have been involved in any fighting and had little or no influence with the military republican leadership \u2013 headed by [[Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army|IRA Chief of Staff]], [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]]. De Valera and the anti-Treaty [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] formed a \"[[Irish republican legitimatism|republican government]]\" on 25 October 1922 from anti-Treaty TDs to \"be temporarily the Supreme Executive of the Republic and the State, until such time as the elected Parliament of the Republic can freely assemble, or the people being rid of external aggression are at liberty to decide freely how they are to be governed\". However, it had no real authority and was a pale shadow of the republican D\u00e1il government of 1919\u201321, which had provided an alternative government to the British administration.\n\nIn March 1923, de Valera attended the meeting of the IRA Army Executive to decide on the future of the war. He was known to be in favour of a truce but he had no voting rights and it was narrowly decided to continue hostilities.<ref>Jordan, Anthony J. ''Eamon de Valera 1882\u20131975'', p. 131.</ref> The leader of the Free State, [[W. T. Cosgrave]], insisted that there could be no acceptance of a surrender without disarming.<ref>Jordan, Anthony J. ''W. T. Cosgrave: Founder Of Modern Ireland''. Westport Books, 2006, p. 89.</ref>\n\nOn 30 May 1923, the IRA's new Chief of Staff [[Frank Aiken]] (Lynch had been killed) called a ceasefire and ordered volunteers to \"dump arms\". De Valera, who had wanted an end to the internecine fighting for some time, backed the ceasefire order with a message in which he called the anti-Treaty fighters \"the Legion of the Rearguard\", saying that \"The Republic can no longer be successfully defended by your arms. Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest and prejudicial to the future of our cause. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic. Other means must be sought to safeguard the nation's right.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Bowyer Bell | first = J. | authorlink = J.

De Valera remained in hiding for several months after the ceasefire was declared; however, he emerged in August to stand for election in [[County Clare]]. Making a campaign appearance in [[Ennis]] on 15 August, de Valera was arrested on the platform and [[internment|interned]] at [[Arbour Hill]] prison until 1924.\n\n==Founding of Fianna F\u00e1il==\nAfter the IRA dumped their arms rather than surrender them or continue a now fruitless war, de Valera returned to political methods. In 1924, he was arrested in [[Newry]] for \"illegally entering Northern Ireland\" and held in [[solitary confinement]] for a month in [[Crumlin Road Gaol]], [[Belfast]].\n\nDuring this time, de Valera came to believe that abstentionism was not a workable tactic in the long term. He now believed that a better course would be to try to gain power and turn the Free State from a constitutional monarchy into a republic. He tried to convince [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] to accept this new line. However, a vote to accept the Free State Constitution (contingent on the abolition of the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]) narrowly failed. Soon afterwards, de Valera resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in and seriously considered leaving politics.\n\nHowever, one of his colleagues, [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]], convinced de Valera to found a new republican party.<ref name=examnotes>[http://test.scoilnet.ie/Res/maryodubhain100899224214_2.html Exam notes] about Se\u00e1n Lemass</ref> In March 1926, with Lemass, [[Constance Markievicz]] and others, de Valera formed a new party, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] (''The Warriors of Destiny''), a party that was to dominate 20th-century Irish politics.<ref name=\"BBC - History - Eamon de Valera\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/de_valera_eamon.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 History \u2013 Eamon de Valera|access-date=4 September 2017}}</ref> While Sinn F\u00e9in still held to an abstentionist line, Fianna F\u00e1il was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within if it gained power.\n\nHaving attracted most of Sinn F\u00e9in's branches due to Lemass' organisational skill,<ref name=examnotes/> the new party made swift electoral gains in the [[June 1927 Irish general election|general election on 9 June 1927]].

Subsequently, a 1916 veteran, [[Domhnall Ua Buachalla]], was appointed Governor-General. To strengthen his position against the opposition in the D\u00e1il and Seanad, de Valera directed the Governor-General to call a [[1933 Irish general election|snap election in January 1933]] and de Valera's party won 77 seats, giving Fianna F\u00e1il an overall majority. Under de Valera's leadership, Fianna F\u00e1il won further general elections in [[1937 Irish general election|1937]], [[1938 Irish general election|1938]], [[1943 Irish general election|1943]], and [[1944 Irish general election|1944]].\n\nDe Valera took charge of Ireland's foreign policy as well by also acting as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for External Affairs]]. In that capacity, he attended meetings of the [[League of Nations]]. He was president of the Council of the League on his first appearance at the league in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], in 1932 and, in a speech that made a worldwide impression, appealed for genuine adherence by its members to the principles of the covenant of the league. In 1934, he supported the admission of the [[Soviet Union]] into the league. In September 1938, he was elected nineteenth president of the Assembly of the League,<ref>[http://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Ireland-Eamon-de-Valera-the-eternal-revolutionary_a1308.html Eamon de Valera, the eternal revolutionary], Fabien Aufrechter, Le Journal International, 22 October 2013.</ref> a tribute to the international recognition he had won by his independent stance on world questions.<ref>The Earl of Longford and [[Thomas P. O'Neill (historian)|Thomas P. O'Neill]] (1970), pp. 335\u2013339.</ref>\n\nDe Valera's government followed the policy of unilaterally dismantling the treaty of 1921. In this way he would be pursuing republican policies and lessening the popularity of republican violence and the IRA. De Valera encouraged IRA members to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] and the [[Garda\u00ed]]. He also refused to dismiss from office those [[Cumann na nGaedheal]], Cosgrave supporters, who had previously opposed him during the Civil War. He did, however, dismiss [[Eoin O'Duffy]] from his position as [[Garda Commissioner]] after a year. Eoin O'Duffy was then invited to be head of the [[Army Comrades Association]] (ACA) formed to protect and promote the welfare of its members, previously led by J.F. O'Higgins, Kevin O'Higgins's brother. This organisation was an obstacle to de Valera's power as it supported Cumann na nGaedheal and provided stewards for their meetings. Cumann na nGaedheal meetings were frequently disrupted by Fianna F\u00e1il supporters following the publication of the article: ''No Free Speech for Traitors'' by [[Peadar O'Donnell]], an IRA member.\n\nThe ACA changed its name to the ''National Guard'' under O'Duffy and adopted the uniform of black berets and blue shirts, using the straight-armed salute, and were nicknamed the [[Blueshirts]]. They were outwardly fascist and planned a march in August 1933 through Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Kevin O'Higgins, and Arthur Griffith. This march struck parallels with [[March on Rome|Mussolini's march on Rome]] (1922), in which he had created the image of having toppled the democratic government in Rome. De Valera revived a military tribunal, which had been set up by the previous administration, to deal with the matter. O'Duffy backed down when the National Guard was declared an illegal organisation and the march was banned. Within a few weeks, O'Duffy's followers merged with Cumann na nGaedhael and the Centre Party to form ''United Ireland'', or [[Fine Gael]], and O'Duffy became its leader. Smaller local marches were scheduled for the following weeks, under different names. Internal dissension set in when the party's TDs distanced themselves from O'Duffy's extreme views, and his movement fell asunder.<ref>The Earl of Longford and Thomas P. O'Neill (1970), p. 301.</ref>\n\n==Taoiseach (1937\u20131948)==\nFianna F\u00e1il having won the [[1937 Irish general election|1937 election]] held the same day as the plebiscite that ratified the constitution, de Valera continued as President of the Executive Council until 29 December 1937, when the new constitution was enacted. On that date, de Valera's post automatically became that of [[Taoiseach]]. which was a considerably more powerful office. Notably, he could advise the [[President of Ireland|President]] to dismiss Ministers individually\u2013advice that the President was bound to follow by convention. The old Executive Council had to be dissolved and reformed {{lang|fr|en bloc}} if its President wanted to remove a Minister. Additionally, he could request a parliamentary dissolution on his own authority. Previously, the right to seek a dissolution was vested with the Council as a whole.\n\nIn social policy, de Valera's first period as Taoiseach saw the introduction (in 1947) of means-tested allowances for people suffering from infectious diseases.<ref name=\"Growth to Limits\">{{cite book |last=Flora, (editor) |first=Peter |title=Growth to Limits: Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |year=1986 |location=Berlin |page=248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GaWtd5zJfB8C&pg=PA248 |isbn= 9783110111316 }}</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement===\nWith the new constitution in place, de Valera determined that the changed circumstances made swift resolution to Ireland's ongoing [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|trade war]] with the UK more desirable for both sides\u2014as did the growing probability of the outbreak of war across Europe. In April 1938, de Valera and British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] signed the [[Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement]], lifting all duties imposed during the previous five years and ending British use of the [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] it had retained in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The return of the ports was of particular significance, since it ensured [[Irish neutrality]] during the coming Second World War.\n\n=== Constitution of Ireland ===\nDuring the 1930s, de Valera systematically stripped the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish Free State constitution]] \u2013 a constitution originally drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] \u2013 of features tying Ireland to the United Kingdom, limiting its independence and the republican character of its state. De Valera was able to carry out this program of constitutional change by taking advantage of three earlier modifications of constitutional arrangements. First, though the 1922 constitution originally required a public [[plebiscite]] for any [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] enacted more than eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a ''Constitutional Amendment Act'' through the [[Oireachtas]]. Secondly, while the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny [[Royal Assent]] to any legislation, from 1927, the power to advise the Governor-General to do so no longer rested with the British government in London but with His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, which meant that, in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the governor-general to block the enactment of one of its own bills. Thirdly, though in its original theory, the constitution ''had'' to be in keeping with the provisions of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] as the fundamental law of the state, that requirement had been abrogated a short time before de Valera gained power.\n\nThe Oath of Allegiance was abolished, as were appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The opposition-controlled [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]], when it protested and slowed down these measures, was also abolished. In 1931, the [[British Parliament]] passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which established the legislative equal status of the self-governing [[Dominion]]s of the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], including the Irish Free State, to one another and the United Kingdom. Though a few constitutional links between the Dominions and the United Kingdom remained, this is often seen as the moment at which the Dominions became fully sovereign states.\n\nDe Valera, in his capacity as Prime Minister of His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, wrote in July 1936 to King [[Edward VIII]] in London indicating that he planned to introduce a new constitution, the central part of which was to be the creation of an office de Valera provisionally intended to call ''President of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' ({{lang-ga|Uachtar\u00e1n Shaorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann}}), which would replace the Governor-General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume4/1936/1709.htm|title=Letter from Joseph P. Walshe to Michael McDunphy (Dublin) enclosing a memorandum on the draft Irish constitution (Secret)|ref=harv|postscript=.}}</ref> De Valera used the sudden [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication of Edward VIII]] as King to pass two bills: [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|one]] amended the constitution to remove all mention of the monarch and Governor-General, while [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|the second]] brought the monarch back, this time through statute law, for use in representing the Irish Free State at a diplomatic level. With the implementation of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] ({{lang-ga|Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann}}), the title ultimately given to the president was ''President of Ireland'' ({{lang-ga|Uachtar\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann}}).\n\nThe constitution contained reforms and symbols intended to assert Irish sovereignty. These included:\n\n* a new name for the state, ''\"[[\u00c9ire]]\"'' (in Irish) and ''\"Ireland\"'' (in English);\n* a claim that the national territory was the entire island of Ireland, thereby challenging Britain's [[Partition of Ireland|partition settlement]] of 1921;\n* the removal of references to the [[Monarchy of Ireland|King of Ireland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.generalmichaelcollins.com/life-times/the-struggle/saorstat-eireann/|title=The Irish Free State (1922\u20131937): Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann|publisher=Collins 22 Society|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zn22MvnyW2QC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Irish Civil War 1922\u201323|last=Cottrell|first=Peter|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84603-270-7|location=Oxford|page=85}}</ref> and the replacement of the monarch's representative, the governor-general, with a popularly elected [[President of Ireland]], who takes \"precedence over all other persons in the State and who shall exercise and perform the powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution and by law\";<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4z5Qj-7HZ68C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Diplomacy With a Difference: The Commonwealth Office of High Commissioner, 1880\u20132006|last=Lloyd|first=Lorna|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=2007|isbn=978-90-04-15497-1|location=Lieden|page=72}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Constitution of Ireland|1937|loc=12.1}}</ref>\n* recognition of the \"special position\" of the Catholic Church;\n* a recognition of the Catholic concept of marriage which excluded civil divorce, even though civil marriage was retained;\n* the declaration that the Irish language was the \"national language\" and the first official language of the nation although English was also included as \"a\" second official language;\n* the use of Irish language terms to stress Irish cultural and historical identity (e.g., Uachtar\u00e1n, Taoiseach, T\u00e1naiste, etc.)\n\nCriticisms of some of the above constitutional reforms include that:\n* the anti-partition articles needlessly antagonised Unionists in [[Northern Ireland]], while simultaneously attracting criticism from hardline republicans by recognising the {{lang|la|de facto}} situation.\n* similarly, the recognition of the \"special position\" of the Catholic Church was inconsistent with the identity and aspirations of northern Protestants (leading to its [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|repeal in the 1970s]]), while simultaneously falling short of the demands of hardline Catholics for Catholicism to be explicitly made the state religion.\n* the affirmation of Irish as the national and primary official language neither reflected contemporary realities nor led to the language's revival\n* though the King was removed from the text of the constitution, he retained a leading role in the state's foreign affairs, and the legal position of the President of Ireland was accordingly [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|uncertain]]; there was also concern that the presidency would evolve into a dictatorial position\n* elements of Catholic social teaching incorporated into the text, such as the articles on the role of women, the family and divorce, were inconsistent both with the practice of the Protestant minority and with contemporary liberal opinion\n\nAs Bew concludes, in the constitution of 1937, de Valera was \"trying to placate left-wing Republicans with national phrases and pious people with expressly Catholic bits [and] patriarchal Catholicism.\"<ref>Paul Bew, ''Ireland: the politics of enmity, 1789\u20132006'' (2007), p. 455.</ref>\n\nThe Constitution was [[Adoption of the Constitution of Ireland|approved in a plebiscite]] on 1 July 1937 and came into force on 29 December 1937.\n\n===The Emergency (World War II)===\n{{Main|The Emergency (Ireland)|Irish neutrality during World War II}}\nBy September 1939, a general European war was imminent.

In [[1948 Irish general election|the 1948 election]], de Valera lost the outright majority he had enjoyed since 1933. It initially looked as if the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] would give Fianna F\u00e1il enough support to stay in office as a minority government, but National Labour insisted on a formal coalition agreement, something de Valera was unwilling to concede. However, while Fianna F\u00e1il was six seats short of a majority, it was still by far the largest party in the D\u00e1il, with 37 more TDs than the next largest party and rival, [[Fine Gael]] (the successor to Cumann na nGaedheal). Conventional wisdom held that de Valera would remain Taoiseach with the support of independent deputies.\n\nThis belief came to nought when (after the final votes were counted) the other parties realised that if they banded together, they would have only one seat fewer than Fianna F\u00e1il, and would be able to form a government with the support of at least seven independents.

That stance helped return de Valera to power in the [[1951 Irish general election|1951 general election]], but without an overall majority. His and Fianna F\u00e1il's popularity was short-lived, however; his government introduced severe, deflationary budgetary and economic policies in 1952, causing a political backlash that cost Fianna F\u00e1il several seats in the D\u00e1il in [[by-elections]] of 1953 and early 1954. Faced with a likely loss of confidence in the D\u00e1il, de Valera instead called an [[1954 Irish general election|election in May 1954]], in which Fianna F\u00e1il was defeated and a [[Second Inter-Party Government]] was formed with John A.

(The two men had seen each other at a party in 1949, but without speaking). He surprised the UK Prime Minister by claiming that if he had been in office in 1948 Ireland would not have left the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/833--winston-churchill-a-eamon-de-valera-a-thirty-year-relationship |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703212616/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/833--winston-churchill-a-eamon-de-valera-a-thirty-year-relationship |url-status = dead|archive-date=3 July 2010 |title=Winston Churchill & Eamon De Valera: A Thirty Year \"Relationship\" |publisher=Winstonchurchill.org |date= |accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that de Valera's eyesight began to deteriorate and he was forced to spend several months in the [[Netherlands]], where he had six operations.

At the [[1957 Irish general election|general election of 1957]], de Valera, then in his seventy-fifth year, won an absolute majority of nine seats, the greatest number he had ever secured. This was the beginning of another sixteen-year period in office for Fianna F\u00e1il. A new economic policy emerged with the First Programme for Economic Expansion. In July 1957, in response to the [[Border Campaign (IRA)]], Part II of the Offences Against the State Act was re-activated and he ordered the [[internment]] without trial of Republican suspects, an action which did much to end the IRA's campaign.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' p. 669, {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref>\n\nDe Valera's final term as Taoiseach also saw the passage of numerous reforms in health and welfare. In 1952, unemployment insurance was extended to male agricultural employees, child allowances were extended to the second child, and a maternity allowance for insured women was introduced. A year later, eligibility for maternity and child services and public hospital services was extended to approximately 85% of the population.<ref name=\"Growth to Limits\"/>\n\n==Presidency==\n[[File:\u00c9amon de Valera, President of Ireland, in 1960s (43915959314).jpg|thumb|upright|De Valera in the 1960s while President of Ireland]]\nWhile Fianna F\u00e1il remained popular among the electorate, 75-year-old de Valera had begun to be seen by the electorate as too old and out of touch to remain as head of government.<ref name=uachtaraindevalera>{{cite video |people=Diarmaid Ferriter |year=2007 |title=Uachtar\u00e1in \u2013 Eamon de Valera |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2771350061367001609# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610084624/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2771350061367001609 |url-status = dead|archive-date=10 June 2011 |medium=Television production |language=Irish |publisher=TG4 |location=Dublin, Ireland |accessdate=7 February 2011 }}</ref> At the urging of party officials, de Valera decided to retire from government and the D\u00e1il and instead seek the [[President of Ireland|presidency of Ireland]].

His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify what he saw as the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/ProcCI/2001/PC01/PDF/101C02.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=30 April 2003|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030430180512/http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/ProcCI/2001/PC01/PDF/101C02.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2003|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn recent decades, his role in Irish history has no longer been unequivocally seen by historians as a positive one, and a biography by Tim Pat Coogan alleges<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'', {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref> that his failures outweigh his achievements, with de Valera's reputation declining while that of his great rival in the 1920s, Michael Collins, is rising.The most recent work on de Valera by historian [[Diarmaid Ferriter]] presents a more positive picture of de Valera's legacy.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/new-book-tries-to-reclaim-devs-legacy-1166836.html|title=New book tries to reclaim Dev's legacy|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=15 October 2007}}</ref>\n[[Bertie Ahern]], at a book launch for Diarmaid Ferriter's biography of de Valera,<ref name=\"Ferriter, 2007\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=558&docID=3552|title=Speech by the Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, TD, at the Launch of ''Judging Dev, A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of \u00c9amon De Valera'' by Diarmaid Ferriter|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach|date=14 October 2007}}</ref> described de Valera's achievements in political leadership during the formative years of the state:\n<blockquote>One of de Valera's finest hours was his regrouping of the Republican side after defeat in the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service of those who had served his predecessors, but made best use of the talent available.</blockquote>\n\nA notable failure was his attempt to reverse the provision of the 1937 Constitution in relation to the electoral system. On retiring as Taoiseach in 1959, he proposed that the [[Proportional Representation]] system enshrined in that constitution should be replaced. De Valera argued that Proportional Representation had been responsible for the instability that had characterised much of the post war period. A constitutional referendum to ratify this was defeated by the people. One aspect of de Valera's legacy is that since the foundation of the state, a de Valera has nearly always served in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. \u00c9amon de Valera served until 1959, his son, [[Vivion de Valera]], was also a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD). [[\u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv]], his grandson, is currently a member of the D\u00e1il while his granddaughter, [[S\u00edle de Valera]] is a former TD. Both have served in ministries in the Irish Government.\n\nCritics complain that de Valera's duplicity and betrayal of the Treaty process and his rejection of agreed upon democratic procedures led to civil war and nearly destroyed Ireland at birth. Liberals decry his conservative social policies and his close relationship with the Catholic bishops.\n\nFor his devout Catholicism, his rejection of material ostentation, his determination to revive the Irish language, and his inability to comprehend Protestant Ulster's fears of Catholic domination, historian Bill Kissane portrays de Valera as representative of his generation in southern Ireland.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Kissane|first1=Bill|year=2007|title=Eamon De Valera and the Survival of Democracy in Inter-war Ireland|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=42|issue=2|pages=213\u2013226|doi=10.1177/0022009407075554}}</ref>\n\n===Catholic social policy===\n\u00c9amon de Valera led his party Fianna F\u00e1il to adopt conservative social policies, since he believed devoutly that the Catholic church and the family were central to Irish identity. He added clauses to the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] (1937) to \"guard with special care the institution of marriage\" and prohibit divorce. His constitution also recognised \"the special position\" of the Catholic Church and recognised other denominations including the [[Church of Ireland]] and Jewish congregations, while guaranteeing the religious freedom of all citizens. However, he resisted an attempt to make Roman Catholicism the [[state religion]] and his constitution forbids the establishment of a [[state religion]]. His policies were welcomed by a largely devout, conservative and rural electorate.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The unenforceable articles in the constitution which reinforced the traditional view that a woman's place was in the home further illustrate the direction in which Ireland was moving. An act of 1935 prohibited the importation or sale of contraceptives. The most rigorous censorship laws in western Europe complete the picture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Louise|year=1998|title=Constructing 'Irishwoman': Modern Girls and Comely Maidens|journal=Irish Studies Review|volume=6|issue=3|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1080/09670889808455611}}</ref>\n\nThe specific recognition of Roman Catholicism was deleted by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] (1973) and the prohibition of divorce was removed by the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] (1996).

His political career spanned over half a century, from 1917 to 1973; he served several terms as [[head of government]] and [[head of state]]. He also led the introduction of the [[Constitution of Ireland]].<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Eamon-de-Valera.D.1919-01-21/|title=\u00c9amon de Valera|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nPrior to de Valera's political career, he was a [[commandant]] at [[Boland's Mill]] during the [[Easter Rising|1916 Easter Rising]]. He was arrested, sentenced to death but released for a variety of reasons, including the public response to the British execution of Rising leaders. He returned to Ireland after being jailed in England and became one of the leading political figures of the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]]. After the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], de Valera served as the political leader of [[Anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in]] until 1926, when he, along with many supporters, left the party to set up [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], a new political party which abandoned the policy of [[abstentionism]] from [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].\n\nFrom there, de Valera went on to be at the forefront of Irish politics until the turn of the 1960s. He took over as [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] from [[W. T. Cosgrave]] and later [[Taoiseach]], with the passing of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937. He served as Taoiseach on three different occasions; from 1937 to 1948, from 1951 to 1954 and finally from 1957 to 1959. He remains the [[Records of Irish heads of government since 1922#Cumulative days served|longest serving Taoiseach]] by total days served in the post. He resigned in 1959 upon his election as [[President of Ireland]]. By then, he had been [[Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il]] for 33 years, and he, along with older founding members, began to take a less prominent role relative to newer ministers such as [[Jack Lynch]], [[Charles Haughey]] and [[Neil Blaney]]. He would serve as President of Ireland from 1959 to 1973, two full terms in office.\n\nDe Valera's political beliefs evolved from militant [[Irish republicanism]] to strong [[Social conservatism|social]], [[Cultural conservatism|cultural]] and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal]] conservatism.<ref name=\"Ferriter, 2007\">Ferriter, ''Judging Dev: A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of Eamon De Valera'' (2007), {{ISBN|1-904890-28-8}}.</ref> He has been characterised by a stern, unbending, devious demeanour.

The organisation was formed to oppose the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and ensure the enactment of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]'s [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Act]] won by its leader [[John Redmond]]. After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, de Valera rose through the ranks and it was not long before he was elected captain of the [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]] branch. Preparations were pushed ahead for an armed revolt, and he was made commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade.

After a week of fighting, the order came from [[P\u00e1draig Pearse]] to surrender.

First, he was one of the last to surrender and he was held in a different prison from other leaders, thus his execution was delayed by practicalities. Second, the US Consulate in Dublin made representations before his trial (i.e., was he actually a United States citizen and if so, how would the United States react to the execution of one of its citizens?) while the full legal situation was clarified. The UK was trying to bring the US into the war in Europe at the time, and the Irish American vote was important in US politics.{{r|gunther1940}} Third, when Lt-Gen [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Sir John Maxwell]] reviewed his case he said, \"Who is he? I haven't heard of him before. I wonder would he be likely to make trouble in the future?\" On being told that de Valera was unimportant, he commuted the court-martial's death sentence to life imprisonment.<ref>Barton, Brian. ''From Behind a Closed Door, Secret Court Martial Records of 1916'', The History Press p. 93.</ref> De Valera had no [[Fenian]] family or personal background and his [[MI5]] file in 1916 was very slim, detailing only his open membership in the [[Irish Volunteers]].<ref>Barton, ibid., p. 92.</ref> Fourth, by the time de Valera was court-martialled on 8 May, political pressure was being brought to bear on Maxwell to halt the executions; Maxwell had already told [[British Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]] that only two more were to be executed, [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada]] and [[James Connolly]], although they were court-martialled the day after de Valera. His late trial, representations made by the American Consulate, his lack of Fenian background and political pressure all combined to save his life, though had he been tried a week earlier he would probably have been shot.<ref>Barton, ibid., pp. 91\u201394.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eamon de Valera's cell in Kilmainham Gaol.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Kilmainham Gaol]] cell of \u00c9amon de Valera]]\n\nDe Valera's supporters and detractors argue about his bravery during the Easter Rising. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and a capacity for meticulous planning. His detractors claim he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916, de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to sit beside him and wake him if he was needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes \"wild\", screaming, \"Set fire to the railway! Set fire to the railway!\" Later in the Ballykinlar [[internment]] Camp, one de Valera loyalist approached another internee, a medical doctor, recounted the story, and asked for a medical opinion as to de Valera's condition. He also threatened to sue the doctor, future [[Fine Gael]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] and Minister, [[Thomas F. O'Higgins|Dr. Tom O'Higgins]], if he ever repeated the story.<ref>Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993). pp. 69\u201372. {{ISBN|0-09-175030-X}}.</ref> The British reportedly, however, considered de Valera's forces the best-trained and best-led among the rebels.{{r|gunther1940}} De Valera's latest biographer, [[Anthony J.

On 10 July 1917, he was elected a member of parliament (MP) for [[East Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|East Clare]] (the constituency which he represented until 1959) in a by-election caused by the death of the previous incumbent [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|Willie Redmond]], brother of the Irish Party leader John Redmond who had died fighting in World War I.

They won 73 out of 105 Irish seats, with about 47% of votes cast. 25 seats were uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 Sinn F\u00e9in MPs (the rest were imprisoned or impaired), calling themselves [[Teachta D\u00e1la|Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] (TDs), assembled in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in Dublin and formed an Irish parliament, known as [[First D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (translatable into English as the ''Assembly of Ireland''). The [[Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] was formed, under the leadership of the [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|Pr\u00edomh Aire]] ''(also called [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]])'' [[Cathal Brugha]]. De Valera had been re-arrested in May 1918 and imprisoned and so could not attend the January session of the D\u00e1il. He escaped from [[HM Prison Lincoln|Lincoln Gaol]], England in February 1919. As a result, he replaced Brugha as Pr\u00edomh Aire in the April session of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\nIn the hope of securing international recognition, [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] was sent as envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] convened by the great powers at the end of World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the [[Irish Republic]], to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]]), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success, including a visit to [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]] in front of 50,000 supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/1919/06/30/eamon-valera-pleads-irish-cause-fenway-park/mgvbvIyHAyWwG6Gbx4e96K/story.html|title=Eamon De Valera pleads Irish cause at Fenway Park \u2013 The Boston Globe|website=Boston Globe|access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref> One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions.<ref>Jordan, Anthony J.

He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as [[John Devoy]] and Judge [[Daniel F. Cohalan]], who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ireland, the conflict between the [[British government|British authorities]] and the D\u00e1il (which the British declared illegal in September 1919), escalated into the [[Irish War of Independence]]. De Valera left day-to-day government, during his eighteen-month absence in the United States, to [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], his 29-year-old [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]]. De Valera and Collins would later become opponents during the Irish Civil War.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' pp. 120\u2013122, {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref>\n\n===President of the Republic===\n[[File:De Valera LCCN2016822004 (crop).jpg|thumb|right|upright|De Valera c. 1918\u20131921]]\nIn January 1921, in his first appearance in the [[D\u00e1il]], after his return to a country gripped by the War of Independence, de Valera introduced a motion calling on the IRA to desist from ambushes and other tactics that were allowing the British to successfully portray it as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group,<ref>[[D. G. Boyce]], ''Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy, 1918\u20131922'' (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1972), pp. 92\u201393.</ref> and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. This they strongly opposed, and de Valera relented, issuing a statement expressing support for the IRA, and claimed it was fully under the control of the D\u00e1il. He then, along with [[Cathal Brugha]] and [[Austin Stack]], brought pressure to bear on [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] to undertake a journey to the United States himself, on the pretext that only he could take up where de Valera had left off. Collins successfully resisted this move and stayed in Ireland. In the [[1921 Irish elections|elections of May 1921]], all candidates in [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] were returned unopposed, and Sinn F\u00e9in secured some seats in [[Northern Ireland]]. Following the [[Truce of July 1921]] that ended the war, de Valera went to see Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] in London on 14 July. No agreement was reached, and by then the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] had already met. It became clear that neither a republic, nor independence for all 32 counties, was going to be offered; Lloyd George told de Valera he could \"put a soldier in Ireland for every man, woman and child in it\" if the IRA did not immediately agree to stop fighting.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' p. 234.</ref> In August 1921, de Valera secured D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann approval to change the 1919 [[D\u00e1il Constitution]] to upgrade his office from prime minister or chairman of the cabinet to a full [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|President of the Republic]]. Declaring himself now the Irish equivalent of King [[George V]], he argued that as Irish head of state, in the absence of the British head of state from the negotiations, he too should not attend the peace conference called the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty Negotiations]] (October\u2013December 1921) at which British and Irish government leaders agreed to the effective independence of twenty-six of Ireland's [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] as the [[Irish Free State]], with Northern Ireland choosing to remain under British sovereignty. It is generally agreed by historians that whatever his motives, it was a mistake for de Valera not to have travelled to London.<ref>Jordan, Anthony J. ''Eamon de Valera 1882\u20131975'', p. 91.</ref>\n\nHaving effected these changes, a [[Irish Boundary Commission|boundary commission]] came into place to redraw the Irish border. [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] expected its report to recommend that largely nationalist areas become part of the Free State, and many hoped this would make Northern Ireland so small it would not be economically viable. A [[Council of Ireland]] was also provided in the Treaty as a model for an eventual all-Irish parliament. Hence neither the pro- nor anti-Treaty sides made many complaints about [[Partition of Ireland|partition]] in the [[Treaty Debates]].\n\n===Anglo-Irish Treaty===\nThe Republic's delegates to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty Negotiations]] were accredited by President de Valera and his cabinet as [[plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] (that is, negotiators with the legal authority to sign a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty.<ref>P. S. O'Hegarty, ''A History of Ireland Under the Union: 1801 to 1922'' (New York: Kraus Reprint Co., 1969), 751.</ref> The Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a [[dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] with the King represented by a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]]. The Irish delegates [[Arthur Griffith]], [[Robert Barton]], and Michael Collins supported by [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] as Secretary-General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]]. It was there, at 11.15&nbsp;am on 5 December 1921, that the decision was made to recommend the Treaty to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]; the Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:20 on 6 December 1921.\n\nDe Valera baulked at the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the negotiations because he knew what the outcome would be and did not wish to receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over the fact that they had not consulted ''him'', their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the D\u00e1il during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the ''Treaty Ports'', the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt was to be paid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.P.A.170001.html |title=De Valera's Treaty proposals |work=Houses of the Oireachtas |accessdate=6 December 2008 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218222359/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.P.A.170001.html |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter the Treaty was narrowly ratified by 64 to 57, de Valera and a large minority of Sinn F\u00e9in TDs left D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He then resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] in his place, though respectfully still calling him 'The President'. On a speaking tour of the more republican province of [[Munster]], starting on 17 March 1922, de Valera made controversial speeches at [[Carrick on Suir]], [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], [[Dungarvan]] and [[Waterford]], saying that: \"''If the Treaty were accepted,'' [by the electorate] ''the fight for freedom would still go on, and the Irish people, instead of fighting foreign soldiers, will have to fight the Irish soldiers of an Irish government set up by Irishmen.''\" At [[Thurles]], several days later, he repeated this imagery and added that the IRA: \"''..would have to wade through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish Government, and perhaps through that of some members of the Irish Government to get their freedom.''\" In a letter to the [[Irish Independent]] on 23 March de Valera accepted the accuracy of their report of his comment about \"wading\" through blood, but deplored that the newspaper had published it.<ref>J.J. O'Kelly ([[Sceilg]]) ''A Trinity of Martyrs'', Irish Book Bureau, Dublin; pp. 66\u201368. \"Sceilg\" was a supporter of de Valera in 1922.</ref>\n\nDe Valera objected to the statement of fidelity that the treaty required Irish parliamentarians to take an oath of allegiance to the King. He also was concerned that Ireland could not have an independent foreign policy as part of the British Commonwealth when the British retained several naval ports (see [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]]) around Ireland's coast. As a compromise, de Valera proposed \"[[external association]]\" with the [[British Empire]], which would leave Ireland's foreign policy in her own hands and a republican constitution with no mention of the British monarch (he proposed this as early as April, well before the negotiations began, under the title \"Document No. 2\"). Michael Collins was prepared to accept this formula and the two wings (pro- and anti-Treaty) of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] formed a pact to fight the [[1922 Irish general election]] together and form a coalition government afterwards. Collins later called off the pact on the eve of the election. De Valera's opponents won the election and civil war broke out shortly afterwards in late June 1922.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' p. 299, {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|Irish Civil War}}\nRelations between the new Irish government, which was backed by most of the D\u00e1il and the electorate, and the anti-Treatyites under the nominal leadership of de Valera, now descended into the Irish Civil War (June 1922 to May 1923), in which the pro-treaty Free State forces defeated the anti-Treaty IRA. Both sides had wanted to avoid civil war, but fighting broke out over the takeover of the [[Four Courts]] in Dublin, by anti-Treaty members of the IRA. These men were not loyal to de Valera and initially were not even supported by the executive of the anti-Treaty IRA. However, Michael Collins was forced to act against them when [[Winston Churchill]] threatened to re-occupy the country with British troops unless action was taken. When fighting broke out in Dublin between the Four Courts garrison and the new [[Free State Army]], republicans backed the IRA men in the Four Courts and civil war broke out. De Valera, though he held no military position, backed the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|anti-Treaty IRA]] or \"Irregulars\" and said that he was re-enlisting in the IRA as an ordinary volunteer. On 8 September 1922, he met in secret with [[Richard Mulcahy]] in Dublin, to try to halt the fighting. However, according to de Valera, they \"could not find a basis\" for agreement.<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' p. 338, {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref>\n\nThough nominally head of the anti-Treatyites, de Valera had little influence. He does not seem to have been involved in any fighting and had little or no influence with the military republican leadership \u2013 headed by [[Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army|IRA Chief of Staff]], [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]]. De Valera and the anti-Treaty [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] formed a \"[[Irish republican legitimatism|republican government]]\" on 25 October 1922 from anti-Treaty TDs to \"be temporarily the Supreme Executive of the Republic and the State, until such time as the elected Parliament of the Republic can freely assemble, or the people being rid of external aggression are at liberty to decide freely how they are to be governed\". However, it had no real authority and was a pale shadow of the republican D\u00e1il government of 1919\u201321, which had provided an alternative government to the British administration.\n\nIn March 1923, de Valera attended the meeting of the IRA Army Executive to decide on the future of the war. He was known to be in favour of a truce but he had no voting rights and it was narrowly decided to continue hostilities.<ref>Jordan, Anthony J. ''Eamon de Valera 1882\u20131975'', p. 131.</ref> The leader of the Free State, [[W. T. Cosgrave]], insisted that there could be no acceptance of a surrender without disarming.<ref>Jordan, Anthony J. ''W. T. Cosgrave: Founder Of Modern Ireland''. Westport Books, 2006, p. 89.</ref>\n\nOn 30 May 1923, the IRA's new Chief of Staff [[Frank Aiken]] (Lynch had been killed) called a ceasefire and ordered volunteers to \"dump arms\". De Valera, who had wanted an end to the internecine fighting for some time, backed the ceasefire order with a message in which he called the anti-Treaty fighters \"the Legion of the Rearguard\", saying that \"The Republic can no longer be successfully defended by your arms. Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest and prejudicial to the future of our cause. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic. Other means must be sought to safeguard the nation's right.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Bowyer Bell | first = J. | authorlink = J.

De Valera remained in hiding for several months after the ceasefire was declared; however, he emerged in August to stand for election in [[County Clare]]. Making a campaign appearance in [[Ennis]] on 15 August, de Valera was arrested on the platform and [[internment|interned]] at [[Arbour Hill]] prison until 1924.\n\n==Founding of Fianna F\u00e1il==\nAfter the IRA dumped their arms rather than surrender them or continue a now fruitless war, de Valera returned to political methods. In 1924, he was arrested in [[Newry]] for \"illegally entering Northern Ireland\" and held in [[solitary confinement]] for a month in [[Crumlin Road Gaol]], [[Belfast]].\n\nDuring this time, de Valera came to believe that abstentionism was not a workable tactic in the long term. He now believed that a better course would be to try to gain power and turn the Free State from a constitutional monarchy into a republic. He tried to convince [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] to accept this new line. However, a vote to accept the Free State Constitution (contingent on the abolition of the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]) narrowly failed. Soon afterwards, de Valera resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in and seriously considered leaving politics.\n\nHowever, one of his colleagues, [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]], convinced de Valera to found a new republican party.<ref name=examnotes>[http://test.scoilnet.ie/Res/maryodubhain100899224214_2.html Exam notes] about Se\u00e1n Lemass</ref> In March 1926, with Lemass, [[Constance Markievicz]] and others, de Valera formed a new party, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] (''The Warriors of Destiny''), a party that was to dominate 20th-century Irish politics.<ref name=\"BBC - History - Eamon de Valera\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/de_valera_eamon.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 History \u2013 Eamon de Valera|access-date=4 September 2017}}</ref> While Sinn F\u00e9in still held to an abstentionist line, Fianna F\u00e1il was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within if it gained power.\n\nHaving attracted most of Sinn F\u00e9in's branches due to Lemass' organisational skill,<ref name=examnotes/> the new party made swift electoral gains in the [[June 1927 Irish general election|general election on 9 June 1927]].

Subsequently, a 1916 veteran, [[Domhnall Ua Buachalla]], was appointed Governor-General. To strengthen his position against the opposition in the D\u00e1il and Seanad, de Valera directed the Governor-General to call a [[1933 Irish general election|snap election in January 1933]] and de Valera's party won 77 seats, giving Fianna F\u00e1il an overall majority.

In this way he would be pursuing republican policies and lessening the popularity of republican violence and the IRA. De Valera encouraged IRA members to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] and the [[Garda\u00ed]]. He also refused to dismiss from office those [[Cumann na nGaedheal]], Cosgrave supporters, who had previously opposed him during the Civil War. He did, however, dismiss [[Eoin O'Duffy]] from his position as [[Garda Commissioner]] after a year. Eoin O'Duffy was then invited to be head of the [[Army Comrades Association]] (ACA) formed to protect and promote the welfare of its members, previously led by J.F. O'Higgins, Kevin O'Higgins's brother. This organisation was an obstacle to de Valera's power as it supported Cumann na nGaedheal and provided stewards for their meetings. Cumann na nGaedheal meetings were frequently disrupted by Fianna F\u00e1il supporters following the publication of the article: ''No Free Speech for Traitors'' by [[Peadar O'Donnell]], an IRA member.\n\nThe ACA changed its name to the ''National Guard'' under O'Duffy and adopted the uniform of black berets and blue shirts, using the straight-armed salute, and were nicknamed the [[Blueshirts]]. They were outwardly fascist and planned a march in August 1933 through Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Kevin O'Higgins, and Arthur Griffith. This march struck parallels with [[March on Rome|Mussolini's march on Rome]] (1922), in which he had created the image of having toppled the democratic government in Rome. De Valera revived a military tribunal, which had been set up by the previous administration, to deal with the matter. O'Duffy backed down when the National Guard was declared an illegal organisation and the march was banned. Within a few weeks, O'Duffy's followers merged with Cumann na nGaedhael and the Centre Party to form ''United Ireland'', or [[Fine Gael]], and O'Duffy became its leader. Smaller local marches were scheduled for the following weeks, under different names. Internal dissension set in when the party's TDs distanced themselves from O'Duffy's extreme views, and his movement fell asunder.<ref>The Earl of Longford and Thomas P. O'Neill (1970), p. 301.</ref>\n\n==Taoiseach (1937\u20131948)==\nFianna F\u00e1il having won the [[1937 Irish general election|1937 election]] held the same day as the plebiscite that ratified the constitution, de Valera continued as President of the Executive Council until 29 December 1937, when the new constitution was enacted. On that date, de Valera's post automatically became that of [[Taoiseach]]. which was a considerably more powerful office. Notably, he could advise the [[President of Ireland|President]] to dismiss Ministers individually\u2013advice that the President was bound to follow by convention. The old Executive Council had to be dissolved and reformed {{lang|fr|en bloc}} if its President wanted to remove a Minister. Additionally, he could request a parliamentary dissolution on his own authority. Previously, the right to seek a dissolution was vested with the Council as a whole.\n\nIn social policy, de Valera's first period as Taoiseach saw the introduction (in 1947) of means-tested allowances for people suffering from infectious diseases.<ref name=\"Growth to Limits\">{{cite book |last=Flora, (editor) |first=Peter |title=Growth to Limits: Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |year=1986 |location=Berlin |page=248 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GaWtd5zJfB8C&pg=PA248 |isbn= 9783110111316 }}</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement===\nWith the new constitution in place, de Valera determined that the changed circumstances made swift resolution to Ireland's ongoing [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|trade war]] with the UK more desirable for both sides\u2014as did the growing probability of the outbreak of war across Europe. In April 1938, de Valera and British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] signed the [[Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement]], lifting all duties imposed during the previous five years and ending British use of the [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] it had retained in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The return of the ports was of particular significance, since it ensured [[Irish neutrality]] during the coming Second World War.\n\n=== Constitution of Ireland ===\nDuring the 1930s, de Valera systematically stripped the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish Free State constitution]] \u2013 a constitution originally drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] \u2013 of features tying Ireland to the United Kingdom, limiting its independence and the republican character of its state. De Valera was able to carry out this program of constitutional change by taking advantage of three earlier modifications of constitutional arrangements. First, though the 1922 constitution originally required a public [[plebiscite]] for any [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] enacted more than eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a ''Constitutional Amendment Act'' through the [[Oireachtas]]. Secondly, while the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny [[Royal Assent]] to any legislation, from 1927, the power to advise the Governor-General to do so no longer rested with the British government in London but with His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, which meant that, in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the governor-general to block the enactment of one of its own bills. Thirdly, though in its original theory, the constitution ''had'' to be in keeping with the provisions of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] as the fundamental law of the state, that requirement had been abrogated a short time before de Valera gained power.\n\nThe Oath of Allegiance was abolished, as were appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The opposition-controlled [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]], when it protested and slowed down these measures, was also abolished. In 1931, the [[British Parliament]] passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which established the legislative equal status of the self-governing [[Dominion]]s of the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], including the Irish Free State, to one another and the United Kingdom. Though a few constitutional links between the Dominions and the United Kingdom remained, this is often seen as the moment at which the Dominions became fully sovereign states.\n\nDe Valera, in his capacity as Prime Minister of His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, wrote in July 1936 to King [[Edward VIII]] in London indicating that he planned to introduce a new constitution, the central part of which was to be the creation of an office de Valera provisionally intended to call ''President of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' ({{lang-ga|Uachtar\u00e1n Shaorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann}}), which would replace the Governor-General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume4/1936/1709.htm|title=Letter from Joseph P.

These included:\n\n* a new name for the state, ''\"[[\u00c9ire]]\"'' (in Irish) and ''\"Ireland\"'' (in English);\n* a claim that the national territory was the entire island of Ireland, thereby challenging Britain's [[Partition of Ireland|partition settlement]] of 1921;\n* the removal of references to the [[Monarchy of Ireland|King of Ireland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.generalmichaelcollins.com/life-times/the-struggle/saorstat-eireann/|title=The Irish Free State (1922\u20131937): Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann|publisher=Collins 22 Society|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zn22MvnyW2QC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Irish Civil War 1922\u201323|last=Cottrell|first=Peter|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84603-270-7|location=Oxford|page=85}}</ref> and the replacement of the monarch's representative, the governor-general, with a popularly elected [[President of Ireland]], who takes \"precedence over all other persons in the State and who shall exercise and perform the powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution and by law\";<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4z5Qj-7HZ68C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Diplomacy With a Difference: The Commonwealth Office of High Commissioner, 1880\u20132006|last=Lloyd|first=Lorna|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=2007|isbn=978-90-04-15497-1|location=Lieden|page=72}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Constitution of Ireland|1937|loc=12.1}}</ref>\n* recognition of the \"special position\" of the Catholic Church;\n* a recognition of the Catholic concept of marriage which excluded civil divorce, even though civil marriage was retained;\n* the declaration that the Irish language was the \"national language\" and the first official language of the nation although English was also included as \"a\" second official language;\n* the use of Irish language terms to stress Irish cultural and historical identity (e.g., Uachtar\u00e1n, Taoiseach, T\u00e1naiste, etc.)\n\nCriticisms of some of the above constitutional reforms include that:\n* the anti-partition articles needlessly antagonised Unionists in [[Northern Ireland]], while simultaneously attracting criticism from hardline republicans by recognising the {{lang|la|de facto}} situation.\n* similarly, the recognition of the \"special position\" of the Catholic Church was inconsistent with the identity and aspirations of northern Protestants (leading to its [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|repeal in the 1970s]]), while simultaneously falling short of the demands of hardline Catholics for Catholicism to be explicitly made the state religion.\n* the affirmation of Irish as the national and primary official language neither reflected contemporary realities nor led to the language's revival\n* though the King was removed from the text of the constitution, he retained a leading role in the state's foreign affairs, and the legal position of the President of Ireland was accordingly [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|uncertain]]; there was also concern that the presidency would evolve into a dictatorial position\n* elements of Catholic social teaching incorporated into the text, such as the articles on the role of women, the family and divorce, were inconsistent both with the practice of the Protestant minority and with contemporary liberal opinion\n\nAs Bew concludes, in the constitution of 1937, de Valera was \"trying to placate left-wing Republicans with national phrases and pious people with expressly Catholic bits [and] patriarchal Catholicism.\"<ref>Paul Bew, ''Ireland: the politics of enmity, 1789\u20132006'' (2007), p. 455.</ref>\n\nThe Constitution was [[Adoption of the Constitution of Ireland|approved in a plebiscite]] on 1 July 1937 and came into force on 29 December 1937.\n\n===The Emergency (World War II)===\n{{Main|The Emergency (Ireland)|Irish neutrality during World War II}}\nBy September 1939, a general European war was imminent.

In [[1948 Irish general election|the 1948 election]], de Valera lost the outright majority he had enjoyed since 1933. It initially looked as if the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] would give Fianna F\u00e1il enough support to stay in office as a minority government, but National Labour insisted on a formal coalition agreement, something de Valera was unwilling to concede. However, while Fianna F\u00e1il was six seats short of a majority, it was still by far the largest party in the D\u00e1il, with 37 more TDs than the next largest party and rival, [[Fine Gael]] (the successor to Cumann na nGaedheal). Conventional wisdom held that de Valera would remain Taoiseach with the support of independent deputies.\n\nThis belief came to nought when (after the final votes were counted) the other parties realised that if they banded together, they would have only one seat fewer than Fianna F\u00e1il, and would be able to form a government with the support of at least seven independents. The result was the [[First Inter-Party Government]], with [[John A. Costello]] of Fine Gael as its compromise candidate for Taoiseach. Costello was duly nominated, consigning de Valera to opposition for the first time in 16 years.

His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify what he saw as the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/ProcCI/2001/PC01/PDF/101C02.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=30 April 2003|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030430180512/http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/ProcCI/2001/PC01/PDF/101C02.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2003|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn recent decades, his role in Irish history has no longer been unequivocally seen by historians as a positive one, and a biography by Tim Pat Coogan alleges<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'', {{ISBN|0-09-995860-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-09-995860-4}}.</ref> that his failures outweigh his achievements, with de Valera's reputation declining while that of his great rival in the 1920s, Michael Collins, is rising.The most recent work on de Valera by historian [[Diarmaid Ferriter]] presents a more positive picture of de Valera's legacy.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/new-book-tries-to-reclaim-devs-legacy-1166836.html|title=New book tries to reclaim Dev's legacy|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=15 October 2007}}</ref>\n[[Bertie Ahern]], at a book launch for Diarmaid Ferriter's biography of de Valera,<ref name=\"Ferriter, 2007\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=558&docID=3552|title=Speech by the Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, TD, at the Launch of ''Judging Dev, A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of \u00c9amon De Valera'' by Diarmaid Ferriter|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach|date=14 October 2007}}</ref> described de Valera's achievements in political leadership during the formative years of the state:\n<blockquote>One of de Valera's finest hours was his regrouping of the Republican side after defeat in the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service of those who had served his predecessors, but made best use of the talent available.</blockquote>\n\nA notable failure was his attempt to reverse the provision of the 1937 Constitution in relation to the electoral system. On retiring as Taoiseach in 1959, he proposed that the [[Proportional Representation]] system enshrined in that constitution should be replaced. De Valera argued that Proportional Representation had been responsible for the instability that had characterised much of the post war period. A constitutional referendum to ratify this was defeated by the people. One aspect of de Valera's legacy is that since the foundation of the state, a de Valera has nearly always served in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. \u00c9amon de Valera served until 1959, his son, [[Vivion de Valera]], was also a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD). [[\u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv]], his grandson, is currently a member of the D\u00e1il while his granddaughter, [[S\u00edle de Valera]] is a former TD. Both have served in ministries in the Irish Government.\n\nCritics complain that de Valera's duplicity and betrayal of the Treaty process and his rejection of agreed upon democratic procedures led to civil war and nearly destroyed Ireland at birth. Liberals decry his conservative social policies and his close relationship with the Catholic bishops.\n\nFor his devout Catholicism, his rejection of material ostentation, his determination to revive the Irish language, and his inability to comprehend Protestant Ulster's fears of Catholic domination, historian Bill Kissane portrays de Valera as representative of his generation in southern Ireland.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Kissane|first1=Bill|year=2007|title=Eamon De Valera and the Survival of Democracy in Inter-war Ireland|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=42|issue=2|pages=213\u2013226|doi=10.1177/0022009407075554}}</ref>\n\n===Catholic social policy===\n\u00c9amon de Valera led his party Fianna F\u00e1il to adopt conservative social policies, since he believed devoutly that the Catholic church and the family were central to Irish identity. He added clauses to the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] (1937) to \"guard with special care the institution of marriage\" and prohibit divorce. His constitution also recognised \"the special position\" of the Catholic Church and recognised other denominations including the [[Church of Ireland]] and Jewish congregations, while guaranteeing the religious freedom of all citizens. However, he resisted an attempt to make Roman Catholicism the [[state religion]] and his constitution forbids the establishment of a [[state religion]]. His policies were welcomed by a largely devout, conservative and rural electorate.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The unenforceable articles in the constitution which reinforced the traditional view that a woman's place was in the home further illustrate the direction in which Ireland was moving. An act of 1935 prohibited the importation or sale of contraceptives. The most rigorous censorship laws in western Europe complete the picture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Louise|year=1998|title=Constructing 'Irishwoman': Modern Girls and Comely Maidens|journal=Irish Studies Review|volume=6|issue=3|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1080/09670889808455611}}</ref>\n\nThe specific recognition of Roman Catholicism was deleted by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] (1973) and the prohibition of divorce was removed by the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] (1996).
