The [[Hall of Fame]] opened in 1999 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA.<ref name=Grasso>{{cite book |last1=Grasso |first1=John |title=Historical Dictionary of Basketball |date=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875067 |page=453 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nZUarsZyzokC&pg=PA453 |language=en}}</ref>  It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women's basketball.  Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame campus===\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n====Pat Summitt Rotunda====\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982.

This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982.

With the introduction of [[comprehensive school]]s and the abolition of [[selective school]]s such as [[Hamilton Academy]] in the early-1970s, Hamilton Grammar School was formed as a new school, using the buildings of the former Hamilton Academy and the nearby St. John's Grammar School, Hamilton.\n\nThe current Hamilton Grammar building was built in 1913 as the Hamilton Academy building. The building underwent an \u00a38,000,000 improvement in 1995, when the original building was retained and fully renovated, with an additional building extension attached to the rear.

With the introduction of [[comprehensive school]]s and the abolition of [[selective school]]s such as [[Hamilton Academy]] in the early-1970s, Hamilton Grammar School was formed as a new school, using the buildings of the former Hamilton Academy and the nearby St. John's Grammar School, Hamilton.\n\nThe current Hamilton Grammar building was built in 1913 as the Hamilton Academy building. The building underwent an \u00a38,000,000 improvement in 1995, when the original building was retained and fully renovated, with an additional building extension attached to the rear. The new building contains science and technical facilities. In 2004, a communication development unit was added to the school.\n\nA new Physical Education centre was built at the rear of the school. Building work started in June 2008 and was completed for August 2009. This replaced the old Physical Education department which was at the back of St John's Primary School.\n\nThe current head teacher is Graeme Sives who joined the school on 3 May 2016, replacing the retired Head Teacher, Colin Stewart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hamilton.s-lanark.sch.uk/head-teacher-appointment |title=Head Teacher Appointment |last1=Stewart |first1=C |last2= |first2= |date=9 March 2016 |website=Hamilton Grammar School |publisher= |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630105741/http://www.hamilton.s-lanark.sch.uk/head-teacher-appointment |archive-date=30 June 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nA notable former pupil is The Reverend Scott J Brown CBE, formerly Chaplain of the Fleet, Royal Navy who was a pupil from 1980-85.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scottishschoolsonline/schools/hamiltongrammarschoolsouthlanarkshire.asp Hamilton Grammar School's page on Scottish Schools Online]\n* {{Official website|http://www.hamilton.s-lanark.sch.uk/}}\n\n[[Category:Hamilton, South Lanarkshire]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in South Lanarkshire]]\n[[Category:Grammar schools in Scotland]]\n\n{{Scotland-school-stub}}\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c4:1384:8c00:6926:3b0a:83a9:7254", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Grammar_School"}

It is held annually in August and features games from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series such as the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video games]], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. Players earn invitations to the World Championships based on their performance in qualifiers and other tournaments held throughout the season and compete for scholarship money, prizes and the title of World Champion. With the exception of [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], invitations to the World Championships are administered by the [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] program.\n\n==History==\nThe Pok\u00e9mon World Championships first began with the [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]] (TCG) in 2004. In 2009, Play! Pok\u00e9mon began to organize competitive tournaments for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series alongside the TCG, which is collectively known as the Video Game Championships (VGC). Like the TCG Championships, players compete with other players in their own age divisions (i.e. Junior, Senior and Masters) in different Premier Tournaments, and the season culminates with the best players earning an invitation to play the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in August. The tournaments in VGC are played with a different game each year. \n\nIn 2016, Play! Pok\u00e9mon announced that ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' will have its own championship series and will be played at the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships.<ref>Official Pokk\u00e9n Tournament website, http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-us/championship-series/</ref>\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships would take place at [[London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> the first time in which the World Championships would be held in a location outside of [[North America]]. This is likely due to the setting of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield'']], which takes place in a region inspired by the United Kingdom, and it is the set of games that would be played by the video game division of the World Championships.  \n\nOn March 31, 2020, [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] cancelled the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships and suspended its 2020 season due to health concerns over the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2020-pokemon-championship-series-canceled/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series Canceled {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/2020-pokemon-championship-series-suspended-due-to-coronavirus/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series suspended due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-31|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This came after earlier announcements in March which saw the cancellation of the 2020 European International Championships<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/update-for-the-2020-pokemon-europe-international-championships/|title=Update for the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon Europe International Championships {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28852369/pokemon-cancels-europe-international-championship-coronavirus-cases-swell|title=Pok\u00e9mon championship canceled as coronavirus cases swell|date=2020-03-06|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and part of its season between March and May 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/play-pokemon-cancels-more-sanctioned-events-due-to-coronavirus/|title=Play Pok\u00e9mon cancels more sanctioned events due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-17|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/esports-arena-leagues-shift-online-events-coronavirus-pandemic-1285112|title=Esports Arena: Leagues Shift to Online Events Amid Coronavirus Pandemic|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It is held annually in August and features games from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series such as the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video games]], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. Players earn invitations to the World Championships based on their performance in qualifiers and other tournaments held throughout the season and compete for scholarship money, prizes and the title of World Champion. With the exception of [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], invitations to the World Championships are administered by the [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] program.\n\n==History==\nThe Pok\u00e9mon World Championships first began with the [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]] (TCG) in 2004. In 2009, Play! Pok\u00e9mon began to organize competitive tournaments for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series alongside the TCG, which is collectively known as the Video Game Championships (VGC). Like the TCG Championships, players compete with other players in their own age divisions (i.e. Junior, Senior and Masters) in different Premier Tournaments, and the season culminates with the best players earning an invitation to play the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in August. The tournaments in VGC are played with a different game each year. \n\nIn 2016, Play! Pok\u00e9mon announced that ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' will have its own championship series and will be played at the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships.<ref>Official Pokk\u00e9n Tournament website, http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-us/championship-series/</ref>\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships would take place at [[London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> the first time in which the World Championships would be held in a location outside of [[North America]]. This is likely due to the setting of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield'']], which takes place in a region inspired by the United Kingdom, and it is the set of games that would be played by the video game division of the World Championships.  \n\nOn March 31, 2020, [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] cancelled the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships and suspended its 2020 season due to health concerns over the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2020-pokemon-championship-series-canceled/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series Canceled {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/2020-pokemon-championship-series-suspended-due-to-coronavirus/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series suspended due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-31|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This came after earlier announcements in March which saw the cancellation of the 2020 European International Championships<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/update-for-the-2020-pokemon-europe-international-championships/|title=Update for the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon Europe International Championships {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28852369/pokemon-cancels-europe-international-championship-coronavirus-cases-swell|title=Pok\u00e9mon championship canceled as coronavirus cases swell|date=2020-03-06|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and part of its season between March and May 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/play-pokemon-cancels-more-sanctioned-events-due-to-coronavirus/|title=Play Pok\u00e9mon cancels more sanctioned events due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-17|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/esports-arena-leagues-shift-online-events-coronavirus-pandemic-1285112|title=Esports Arena: Leagues Shift to Online Events Amid Coronavirus Pandemic|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
