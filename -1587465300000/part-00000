It is located in the [[Lake District National Park]], in [[Cumbria]], and is part of the [[Southern Fells]].\n\n==Topography==\nScafell Pike is one of a horseshoe of high [[fell]]s, open to the south, surrounding the head of [[Eskdale, Cumbria]]. It stands on the western side of the [[cirque]], with [[Scafell]] to the south and [[Great End]] to the north. This ridge forms the watershed between Eskdale and [[Wasdale]], which lies to the west.<ref name=\"wainwright\" />\n\nThe narrowest definition of Scafell Pike begins at the ridge of [[Mickledore]] in the south takes in the wide, stony summit area and ends at the next depression, Broad Crag [[Mountain pass|Col]], c. 920&nbsp;m (3,030&nbsp;ft). A more inclusive view also takes in two further tops: [[Broad Crag]], 934&nbsp;m (3,064&nbsp;ft) and [[Ill Crag]], 935&nbsp;m (3,068&nbsp;ft), the two being separated by Ill Crag Col. This is the position taken by most guidebooks.<ref name=\"richards\">Richards, Mark: ''Mid-Western Fells'': Collins (2004): {{ISBN|0-00-711368-4}}</ref><ref name=\"wainwright\">{{cite book | last = Wainwright | first = A. | authorlink = Alfred Wainwright | year = 1960 | title = The Southern Fells | publisher = Francis Lincoln | location = London | isbn = 0-7112-2230-4}}</ref> North of Ill Crag is the more definite depression of Calf Cove at 850&nbsp;m (2,800&nbsp;ft), before the ridge climbs again to Great End.\n\nScafell Pike also has outliers on either side of the ridge. [[Lingmell]], to the north west, is invariably regarded as a separate fell,<ref name=\"richards\"/><ref name=\"wainwright\"/> while Pen, 760&nbsp;m (2,500&nbsp;ft), a shapely summit above the Esk, is normally taken as a satellite of the Pike. Middleboot Knotts is a further top lying on the Wasdale slopes of Broad Crag, which is listed as a [[nuttall (hill)|Nuttall]].\n\nThe rough summit plateau is fringed by crags on all sides with Pikes Crag and Dropping Crag above Wasdale and Rough Crag to the east. Below Rough Crag and Pen is a further tier, named Dow Crag and Central Pillar on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps, although known as Esk Buttress among climbers.<ref name=\"bmc\">''British Mountain Maps: Lake District'': Harvey (2006): {{ISBN|1-85137-467-1}}</ref>\n\nBroad Crag Col is the source of Little Narrowcove Beck in the east and of Piers Gill in the west. The latter works its way around Lingmell to [[Wast Water]] through a spectacular ravine, one of the most impressive in the Lake District. It is treacherous in winter, as when it freezes over it creates an icy patch, with lethal exposure should you slip. Broad Crag is a small top with its principal face on the west and the smaller Green Crag looking down on Little Narrowcove. From Broad Crag, the ridge turns briefly east across Ill Crag Col and onto the shapely pyramidal summit of Ill Crag. Here, the main crags are on the Eskdale side, Ill Crag having little footing(clarify) in Wasdale.<ref name=\"wainwright\" />\n\nScafell Pike has a claim to the highest standing water in England, although [[Foxes Tarn]] on Scafell is of similar height. The water body in question is Broad Crag Tarn, which (confusingly) is on Scafell Pike proper, rather than Broad Crag. It lies at about 820&nbsp;m (2,700&nbsp;ft), a quarter of a mile (400&nbsp;m) south of the summit.<ref name=\"blair\">Blair, Don: ''Exploring Lakeland Tarns'': Lakeland Manor Press (2003): {{ISBN|0-9543904-1-5}}</ref>\n\n==Summit==\n[[Image:Scafell Pike from Broad Crag.jpg|thumb|right|The summit of Scafell Pike, seen from neighbouring [[Broad Crag]]]]\nThe summit was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1919 by [[Charles Wyndham, 3rd Baron Leconfield|Lord Leconfield]] \"in perpetual memory of the men of the [[Lake District]] who fell for God and King, for freedom peace and right in the [[Great War]] 1914\u20131918 ...\".<ref>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMM0G_Scafell_Pike_Summit_Cumbria Scafell Pike Summit, Cumbria \u2013 World War I Memorials and Monuments on].

The highest point is buried beneath a massive summit cairn over 3 metres high and it is not known how high the fabric of the mountain rises under the cairn. Traditionally the height was given as a very memorable 3210 feet or 978.4 metres.<ref name=\"wainwright\" /> The metric height of 978 metres converts to 3209 feet.\n\nScafell Pike is one of three British peaks climbed as part of the [[National Three Peaks Challenge]], and is the highest ground for over {{convert|90|mi|km|0}}.\n{{GB summits start}}\n{{GB summits entry\n|Name=[[Ill Crag]]\n|Gridref=NY223073\n|Height=935&nbsp;m (3,068&nbsp;ft)\n|Status=Hewitt, Nuttall}}\n{{GB summits entry\n|Name=[[Broad Crag]]\n|Gridref=NY218075\n|Height=934&nbsp;m (3,064&nbsp;ft)\n|Status=Hewitt, Nuttall}}\n{{GB summits entry\n|Name=Middleboot Knotts\n|Gridref=NY213080\n|Height=703&nbsp;m (2,306&nbsp;ft)\n|Status=Nuttall}}\n{{GB summits end}}\n\n== Geology ==\nScafell Pike consists of [[igneous]] rock dating from the [[Ordovician]]; it is [[geology|geologically]] part of the [[Borrowdale Volcanics]]. The summit [[plateau]] of Scafell Pike, and that of other neighbouring peaks, is covered with shattered rock debris which provides the highest-altitude example of a summit boulder field in England.<ref name=\"SSSI\"/> The boulder field is thought to have been caused in part by weathering, such as [[Frost wedging|frost action]]. Additional factors are also considered to be important; however, opinion varies as to what these may be. [[James Clifton Ward]] suggested that weathering with earthquakes as a secondary agent could be responsible, while [[John Edward Marr]] and [[Reginald Aldworth Daly]] believed that earthquakes were unnecessary and suggested that frost action with other unspecified agents was more likely.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hay |first=T |year=1942 |title=Physiographical Notes from Lakeland |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=165\u2013173 |doi=10.2307/1788974 |publisher=The Geographical Journal, Vol. 100, No. 4 |jstor=1788974}}</ref> To the north of the summit are a number of high altitude [[stream|gills]] which flow into Lingmell Beck. These are good examples in Cumbria for this type of gill and are also biologically important due to their [[species richness]].<ref name=\"SSSI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001922.pdf |title=Scafell Pikes SSSI citation sheet  |accessdate=2006-11-10 |format=PDF |work=English Nature}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nScafell Pike is a popular destination for walkers. There is open access to Scafell and the surrounding fells, with many walking and rock climbing routes. Paths connect the summit with Lingmell Col to the northwest, Mickledore to the southwest, and Esk Hause to the northeast, and these in turn connect with numerous other paths, giving access to walkers from many directions including [[Wasdale Head]] to the west, [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite]] to the north, [[Langdale]] to the east, and [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]] to the southwest.

It is located in the [[Lake District National Park]], in [[Cumbria]], and is part of the [[Southern Fells]].\n\n==Topography==\nScafell Pike is one of a horseshoe of high [[fell]]s, open to the south, surrounding the head of [[Eskdale, Cumbria]]. It stands on the western side of the [[cirque]], with [[Scafell]] to the south and [[Great End]] to the north. This ridge forms the watershed between Eskdale and [[Wasdale]], which lies to the west.<ref name=\"wainwright\" />\n\nThe narrowest definition of Scafell Pike begins at the ridge of [[Mickledore]] in the south takes in the wide, stony summit area and ends at the next depression, Broad Crag [[Mountain pass|Col]], c. 920&nbsp;m (3,030&nbsp;ft). A more inclusive view also takes in two further tops: [[Broad Crag]], 934&nbsp;m (3,064&nbsp;ft) and [[Ill Crag]], 935&nbsp;m (3,068&nbsp;ft), the two being separated by Ill Crag Col. This is the position taken by most guidebooks.<ref name=\"richards\">Richards, Mark: ''Mid-Western Fells'': Collins (2004): {{ISBN|0-00-711368-4}}</ref><ref name=\"wainwright\">{{cite book | last = Wainwright | first = A. | authorlink = Alfred Wainwright | year = 1960 | title = The Southern Fells | publisher = Francis Lincoln | location = London | isbn = 0-7112-2230-4}}</ref> North of Ill Crag is the more definite depression of Calf Cove at 850&nbsp;m (2,800&nbsp;ft), before the ridge climbs again to Great End.\n\nScafell Pike also has outliers on either side of the ridge. [[Lingmell]], to the north west, is invariably regarded as a separate fell,<ref name=\"richards\"/><ref name=\"wainwright\"/> while Pen, 760&nbsp;m (2,500&nbsp;ft), a shapely summit above the Esk, is normally taken as a satellite of the Pike. Middleboot Knotts is a further top lying on the Wasdale slopes of Broad Crag, which is listed as a [[nuttall (hill)|Nuttall]].\n\nThe rough summit plateau is fringed by crags on all sides with Pikes Crag and Dropping Crag above Wasdale and Rough Crag to the east. Below Rough Crag and Pen is a further tier, named Dow Crag and Central Pillar on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps, although known as Esk Buttress among climbers.<ref name=\"bmc\">''British Mountain Maps: Lake District'': Harvey (2006): {{ISBN|1-85137-467-1}}</ref>\n\nBroad Crag Col is the source of Little Narrowcove Beck in the east and of Piers Gill in the west. The latter works its way around Lingmell to [[Wast Water]] through a spectacular ravine, one of the most impressive in the Lake District. It is treacherous in winter, as when it freezes over it creates an icy patch, with lethal exposure should you slip. Broad Crag is a small top with its principal face on the west and the smaller Green Crag looking down on Little Narrowcove. From Broad Crag, the ridge turns briefly east across Ill Crag Col and onto the shapely pyramidal summit of Ill Crag. Here, the main crags are on the Eskdale side, Ill Crag having little footing(clarify) in Wasdale.<ref name=\"wainwright\" />\n\nScafell Pike has a claim to the highest standing water in England, although [[Foxes Tarn]] on Scafell is of similar height. The water body in question is Broad Crag Tarn, which (confusingly) is on Scafell Pike proper, rather than Broad Crag. It lies at about 820&nbsp;m (2,700&nbsp;ft), a quarter of a mile (400&nbsp;m) south of the summit.<ref name=\"blair\">Blair, Don: ''Exploring Lakeland Tarns'': Lakeland Manor Press (2003): {{ISBN|0-9543904-1-5}}</ref>\n\n==Summit==\n[[Image:Scafell Pike from Broad Crag.jpg|thumb|right|The summit of Scafell Pike, seen from neighbouring [[Broad Crag]]]]\nThe summit was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1919 by [[Charles Wyndham, 3rd Baron Leconfield|Lord Leconfield]] \"in perpetual memory of the men of the [[Lake District]] who fell for God and King, for freedom peace and right in the [[Great War]] 1914\u20131918 ...\".<ref>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMM0G_Scafell_Pike_Summit_Cumbria Scafell Pike Summit, Cumbria \u2013 World War I Memorials and Monuments on].

The summit [[plateau]] of Scafell Pike, and that of other neighbouring peaks, is covered with shattered rock debris which provides the highest-altitude example of a summit boulder field in England.<ref name=\"SSSI\"/> The boulder field is thought to have been caused in part by weathering, such as [[Frost wedging|frost action]]. Additional factors are also considered to be important; however, opinion varies as to what these may be. [[James Clifton Ward]] suggested that weathering with earthquakes as a secondary agent could be responsible, while [[John Edward Marr]] and [[Reginald Aldworth Daly]] believed that earthquakes were unnecessary and suggested that frost action with other unspecified agents was more likely.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hay |first=T |year=1942 |title=Physiographical Notes from Lakeland |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=165\u2013173 |doi=10.2307/1788974 |publisher=The Geographical Journal, Vol. 100, No. 4 |jstor=1788974}}</ref> To the north of the summit are a number of high altitude [[stream|gills]] which flow into Lingmell Beck.

There is open access to Scafell and the surrounding fells, with many walking and rock climbing routes. Paths connect the summit with Lingmell Col to the northwest, Mickledore to the southwest, and Esk Hause to the northeast, and these in turn connect with numerous other paths, giving access to walkers from many directions including [[Wasdale Head]] to the west, [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite]] to the north, [[Langdale]] to the east, and [[Eskdale, Cumbria|Eskdale]] to the southwest. The shortest route is from Wasdale Head, about 80 metres above sea level, where there is a climbers' hotel, the Wasdale Head Inn, made popular in the Victorian period by [[Owen Glynne Jones]] and others.

Since the game's [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|first edition in 1974]], a [[bestiary]] was included along other game manuals, first called ''Monsters & Treasure'' and now commonly called the ''[[Monster Manual]]''. Described as an \"essential\" part of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', the game's monsters have become notable in their own right, influencing fields such as [[video games]] and [[fiction]], as well as [[popular culture]].<ref name=\"ashgate\">''The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters''. Ed. Jeffrey Weinstock. 2014.</ref>\n\nThe term ''monster'' in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' can refer to a variety of creatures, including traditional [[monsters]] such as [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]], supernatural creatures such as ghosts, and mundane or fantastic animals\u2014in short, \"an enormous heterogeneous collection of natural and monstrous foes.\"<ref name=\"chrulew\">{{cite journal |last1=Churlew |first1=Matthew |date=2006 |title=\u201cMasters of the Wild\u201d: Animals and the Environment in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' |url=http://www.concentric-literature.url.tw/issues/Animals/6.pdf |journal=Concentric: Literary and Cultural Studies |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=135-168 |access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> While many monsters are adapted from pre-existing myths and legends, others have been invented specifically for the game, sometimes having characteristics specifically suited to the mechanics of the game.<ref name=\"chrulew\" />\n\n==Origins==\n{{for|publication history|Monster Manual}}\nThe sources of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' monsters are diverse, including [[mythology]], medieval [[bestiaries]], [[science-fiction literature|science-fiction]] and [[fantasy literature]], and [[film]]. In game books, monsters are typically presented with illustrations, fictional elements, and [[Statistic (role-playing games)|game statistics]]. Monsters are adapted to fit the needs of the game's writers and publishers, such as by describing combat abilities that may have been absent or only implied by an original source. In a few major cases, names taken from the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had to be changed due to [[copyright]] disputes (such as the balor, originally named [[Balrog]]), and fictional elements were altered to further distance the works.<ref name=\"ashgate\" />\n\nOriginal monsters have also been included in ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and these are among the game's most memorable. Monsters such as the [[gelatinous cube]] have been described as \"uniquely weird,\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> inspired by unusual sources or designed to suit the particular needs of a role-playing game. The rust monster and [[owlbear]], for instance, were based on toys purchased at a [[discount store]].<ref name=\"diterlizzi\">{{Cite web|url=https://diterlizzi.com/essay/owlbears-rust-monsters-and-bulettes-oh-my/|title=Owlbears, Rust Monsters and Bulettes, Oh My! \u2013 Tony DiTerlizzi}}</ref> The [[Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic]] disguises itself as a chest, thwarting players expecting to find treasure.<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-10-most-memorable-dungeons-dragons-monsters-1326074030|title=The 10 Most Memorable Dungeons & Dragons Monsters|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their broad, inclusive background, ''D&D'' monsters have been called a [[pastiche]] of sources, freely combining qualities of classical works as well as modern or wholly original creations.<ref name=\"chrulew\" />\n\n==Influence and criticism==\nThe monsters of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have significantly influenced modern fantasy fiction, ranging from licensed fiction, such as the novels of [[R.A. Salvatore]], [[Margaret Weis]], and [[Tracy Hickman]], to how monsters are portrayed in fantasy fiction generally. The scope of this influence has been compared to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Indeed, as Jeffrey Weinstock notes, \"it is not even clear where Tolkien pastiche leaves off and Dungeons & Dragons pastiche begins in modern genre fantasy.\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> In a 2005 interview, author [[China Mieville]] stated,\n{{quote|\"I use AD&D-type fascination with [[teratology]] in a lot of my books, and I have the original Monster Manual, and the Monster Manual 2, and the Fiend Folio.

[[Gary Gygax]] wrote much of the work himself, having included and expanded most of the monsters from [[List of Dungeons & Dragons monsters (1974\u20131976)|the previous D&D supplements]]. Also included are monsters originally printed in ''The Strategic Review'', as well as some originally found in early issues of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' (such as the anhkheg and [[remorhaz]]), and other early game materials.  This book also expanded on the original monster format, such as including the stat lines on the same page as the monsters' descriptions and introducing more stats, expanding the length of most monster descriptions, and featuring illustrations for most of the monsters. The book features an alphabetical table of contents of all the monsters on pages 3\u20134, explanatory notes for the statistics lines on pages 5\u20136, descriptions of the monsters on pages 6\u2013103, a treasure chart on page 105, and an index of major listings on pages 106\u2013109.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

The book contains a foreword on pages 3\u20134, an alphabetical table of contents on page 5, explanatory notes on pages 6\u20137, descriptions of the monsters on pages 8\u201397, a treasure chart on page 99, additional tables and charts for all the monsters in both the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio'' on pages 100\u2013119, an index of major listings (including the contributor for each monster) on pages 120\u2013124, with an epilogue on page 124.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

As with the ''Monster Manual'', this book was written primarily by [[Gary Gygax]]. While this book contains a number of monsters that previously appeared in limited circulation (such as in ''Dragon'' or in adventure modules), unlike the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio'' a large amount of its contents was entirely new at publication. The monsters in this book are presented in the same format as the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Fiend Folio''. The book contains a preface on page 4, a section entitled \"How To Use This Book\" on pages 5\u20137, descriptions of the monsters on pages 8\u2013132, random encounter tables on pages 133\u2013155, and an index of all the monsters in the ''Monster Manual'', ''Fiend Folio'', and ''Monster Manual II'' on pages 156\u2013160. Unlike the previous two books, this book does not contain an alphabetical listing of the monsters in the beginning of the book.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! Creature !!

These include various races of demons and [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]] that are of an [[evil]] [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] and hail from the [[Outer Plane|Lower Planes]]. All fiends are extraplanar [[Outsider (Dungeons & Dragons)|outsiders]].\n\n===The most common types===\n\n====Demons====\n\n\nThe most widespread race of fiends are the demons, a [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] race native to the [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|Abyss]]; they are rapacious, cruel and arbitrary. The dominant race of demons is the tanar'ri {{IPAc-en|t|\u0259|\u02c8|n|\u0251r|i}}. The Abyss and its population are both theoretically infinite in size. \"True\" tanar'ri such as the [[balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]s (originally called [[Balrog]]s) and the six-armed serpentine [[marilith]]s push other weaker tanar'ri around and organise them into makeshift armies for battle. [[Demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demon lords and demon princes]] such as [[Orcus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Orcus]], [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], Zuggtmoy, [[Graz'zt]] and countless others rule over the demons of their individual layers of the Abyss, in as much as the chaotic demons can be ruled over.\n\n====Devils====\nThe [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]], of which the ruling type are called baatezu {{IPAc-en|b|e\u026a|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|t|\u025b|z|u\u02d0}}, are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Lawful Evil|lawful evil]] natives of the [[Baator|Nine Hells of Baator]]; they subjugate the weak and rule tyrannically over their domains. Pit fiends are the most powerful baatezu, though even the strongest pit fiends are surpassed by the [[Lords of the Nine]], or Archdevils, whose ranks include [[Baalzebul (Dungeons & Dragons)|Baalzebul]], [[Mephistopheles (Dungeons & Dragons)|Mephistopheles]], and [[Asmodeus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Asmodeus]]. Unlike the demons, the devils arranged themselves through a strict hierarchy. Like the demons, the devils are scheming backstabbers; while a demon only keeps its words when it is convenient for it, a devil keeps its word all too well; though being used to exploiting repressive bureaucratic machinations to the fullest, always knows all ways around the letter of a contract to begin with. The tanar'ri and the baatezu hold an eternal enmity for one another and wage the [[Blood War]] against one another.\n\n====Yugoloths====\nThe yugoloths (called [[daemon (mythology)|daemon]]s in 1st edition ''D&D'') are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Neutral Evil|neutral evil]] natives of the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna and the [[Gray Waste|Gray Wastes of Hades]]; they are neutral to the affairs of the other fiendish races, interfering only when they see a situation that may be profitable or a potential for the advancement of their own schemes. The yugoloths are manipulative, secretive, and mercenary by nature, often acting as soldiers for deities in their own private wars, or even at times aiding both sides of the Blood War. In 4th Edition, the yugoloths are considered to be demons, and their previously standard naming convention of \"loth\" is replaced by \"demon\" (Ex. the Mezzoloth is the 4e Mezzodemon). In fifth edition, yugoloths are listed as neutral evil fiends under their original names.\n\n===Other fiends===\n\n====Demodands====\nThe demodands are race of evil fiends that live on the plane of [[Carceri (Dungeons & Dragons)|Carceri]] (Tarterus in 1st edition ''D&D''). Demodands were introduced in the 1st edition supplement ''[[Monster Manual II]]'', renamed as Gehreleths in the 2nd edition ''[[Monster Manual#Monstrous Compendium volumes issued|Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix]]'', and reintroduced as demodands in the 3rd edition sourcebook ''[[Fiend Folio]]''. In 1st edition ''D&D'', the three types of demodands from weakest to strongest were tarry, slime, and shaggy. In 2nd and 3rd editions, the three types are  farastu, kelubar, and shator.\n\n====Hordlings====\nThe '''hordlings''' are fiends that form the hordes of the [[Gray Waste|Gray Waste of Hades]]. They first appeared in the 1st edition supplement [[Monster Manual II]]. Hordlings wander the Gray Waste preying upon everything they come across, even other hordlings. Hordlings vary greatly in appearance. It is said that Hordlings evolved from Larvae whose hatred was so unique, their souls became individual. The hordlings can be summoned using an artifact known as the ''Bringer of Doom'', which was created around the time of the [[Invoked Devastation]] of [[Greyhawk]]. Hordlings are the most common inhabitants of the Gray Waste. They also occasionally roam the other Lower Planes as well.\n\n====Kython====\nThe kythons (not to be confused with kytons, which are chain devils [[Baatezu]]) are distinct from the other fiends in that they did not originate on any of the lower planes. When a group of fiends (the Galchutt, from Monte Cook's ''Chaositech'' and ''Ptolus'') were trapped on the [[Material Plane]], they tried creating more of their own kind through magical means. The results were eyeless reptilian creatures with insectoid traits and neutral evil traits. As the kythons matured, they took on varied forms. None of them were loyal to the fiends that created them. Because kythons originated on the Material Plane instead of the [[Abyss (plane)|Abyss]] (or another lower plane), they are also called earth-bound demons. Kythons are only interested in eating and breeding. They have spread rapidly across the [[Material Plane]]. The current hierarchy of kythons, from the weakest to the strongest is: broodlings, juveniles, adults, impalers, slaymasters, and slaughterkings. Eventually, with more time, kythons will grow into newer and more powerful forms. Kythons closely resemble [[Xenomorph (Alien)|xenomorphs]]. They were originally created for Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign, based on some gaming miniatures he had bought, and were added by him to the ''Book of Vile Darkness'' absent the context of the Galchutt, who wouldn't appear until later on in ''Chaositech''.\n\n[[Monte Cook]] originally planned on perhaps renaming them so their name was not quite so similar to kytons, or chain devils, as well as other episodes of Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign to see how they were originally used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |title=Ptolus |last=Cook |first=Monte |authorlink=Monte Cook |date=2001-04-28 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106044607/http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Night hags====\nNight hags are fiends from the Gray Wastes of Hades that traffic in the souls of mortals in 3rd edition sources. In 5th edition they come from the [[Feywild]] and are exiled to the [[Gray Wastes of Hades]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Jeremy |title=D&D Monster manual. |date=2014 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=978-0-7869-6561-8 |pages=177 |edition=Fifthition}}</ref>\n\n====Rakshasas====\n[[Rakshasa (Dungeons & Dragons)|Rakshasas]] are fiends (often tiger-headed) that may have originated on [[Acheron (plane)|Acheron]] according to 3rd edition sources. In 5th edition they originated in the [[Nine Hells]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Jeremy |title=D&D Monster manual. |date=2014 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=978-0-7869-6561-8 |page=257 |edition=Fifthition}}</ref>\n\n====Slaad====\nIn the 4th Edition game, Slaadi are Chaotic Evil and originate out of the Elemental Chaos. This is markedly different from the portrayal of Slaadi in all prior editions of the game, when they were Chaotic Neutral natives of Limbo and thus not fiends.\n\n====Half-fiends and fiendish creatures====\nThe [[Cambion (Dungeons & Dragons)|cambions]] (whose name comes from a different kind of mythological, demonic creature) are simply half-fiends; [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] of fiends and non-fiendish creatures, often humans or other humanoids. Cambions are typically created through fiends raping mortals or seducing them after [[shape-shift]]ing, although some of the most depraved beings actually participate willingly. Those cambions that actually survive birth typically look like grotesque, hellish variants of their mortal progenitors, having wings, claws, fangs and often many other features that reveal their fiendish origins. Cambions are usually outcast, being feared and hated in mortal societies for their fiendish origins and being derided by pure-blooded fiends for their impure heritage. A variant of cambion called durzagon is described in ''[[Monster Manual|Monster Manual II]]'' and is the hybrid of a devil and an unsuspecting [[Duergar (Dungeons & Dragons)|duergar]]. The fiendish creatures are simply fiendish versions of other species in Dungeons & Dragons. They typically look like fearsome travesties of beings from the [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|material plane]]. Most fiendish species are divided into a number of variants, usually in a [[hierarchy]] of increasing power and cunning.\n\n====Other fiends not associated with a specific group====\n*Abominations \u2013 (Chichimec, phane, infernal, dream larva, phaethon, xixecal, hecatoncheires) \u2013 the unwanted offspring of deities.\n*Abyssal Drake \u2013 the result of an ancient breeding program that combines the nastiest elements of demons, wyverns, and red dragons.

They kept intact the terms they had been replaced with, using both when applicable to appeal both to older players and those who played in subsequent editions of the game. While the 1st edition of ''AD&D'' used the term \"Daemon\", all subsequent editions beginning with 2nd edition have used the term \"yugoloth\" for the same creatures.\n\n===Reception===\nFiends were considered among the \"standard repertoire of \"Monsters\"\" of the game by Fabian Perlini-Pfister.<ref>{{cite book |title=Religions in play: games, rituals, and virtual worlds |last=Bornet |first=Philippe |year=2011 |publisher=Theologischer Verlag Z\u00fcrich |location= |isbn=978-3-290-22010-5 |page=282 |accessdate=5 December 2019 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=t3X18dopUoMC&pg=PA282#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">Fabian Perlini-Pfister uses the word \"demon\" instead of fiend, but uses \"Asmodeus and succubi\" as examples.</ref>\n\n===Blood War===\nThe Blood War concept was introduced as part of the new background for the outer planes in 1991's ''Monstrous Compendium Volume Outer Planes Appendix''.

Since the game's [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|first edition in 1974]], a [[bestiary]] was included along other game manuals, first called ''Monsters & Treasure'' and now commonly called the ''[[Monster Manual]]''. Described as an \"essential\" part of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', the game's monsters have become notable in their own right, influencing fields such as [[video games]] and [[fiction]], as well as [[popular culture]].<ref name=\"ashgate\">''The Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters''. Ed. Jeffrey Weinstock. 2014.</ref>\n\nThe term ''monster'' in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' can refer to a variety of creatures, including traditional [[monsters]] such as [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]], supernatural creatures such as ghosts, and mundane or fantastic animals\u2014in short, \"an enormous heterogeneous collection of natural and monstrous foes.\"<ref name=\"chrulew\">{{cite journal |last1=Churlew |first1=Matthew |date=2006 |title=\u201cMasters of the Wild\u201d: Animals and the Environment in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' |url=http://www.concentric-literature.url.tw/issues/Animals/6.pdf |journal=Concentric: Literary and Cultural Studies |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=135-168 |access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> While many monsters are adapted from pre-existing myths and legends, others have been invented specifically for the game, sometimes having characteristics specifically suited to the mechanics of the game.<ref name=\"chrulew\" />\n\n==Origins==\n{{for|publication history|Monster Manual}}\nThe sources of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' monsters are diverse, including [[mythology]], medieval [[bestiaries]], [[science-fiction literature|science-fiction]] and [[fantasy literature]], and [[film]]. In game books, monsters are typically presented with illustrations, fictional elements, and [[Statistic (role-playing games)|game statistics]]. Monsters are adapted to fit the needs of the game's writers and publishers, such as by describing combat abilities that may have been absent or only implied by an original source. In a few major cases, names taken from the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had to be changed due to [[copyright]] disputes (such as the balor, originally named [[Balrog]]), and fictional elements were altered to further distance the works.<ref name=\"ashgate\" />\n\nOriginal monsters have also been included in ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and these are among the game's most memorable. Monsters such as the [[gelatinous cube]] have been described as \"uniquely weird,\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> inspired by unusual sources or designed to suit the particular needs of a role-playing game. The rust monster and [[owlbear]], for instance, were based on toys purchased at a [[discount store]].<ref name=\"diterlizzi\">{{Cite web|url=https://diterlizzi.com/essay/owlbears-rust-monsters-and-bulettes-oh-my/|title=Owlbears, Rust Monsters and Bulettes, Oh My! \u2013 Tony DiTerlizzi}}</ref> The [[Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic]] disguises itself as a chest, thwarting players expecting to find treasure.<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-10-most-memorable-dungeons-dragons-monsters-1326074030|title=The 10 Most Memorable Dungeons & Dragons Monsters|website=io9}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their broad, inclusive background, ''D&D'' monsters have been called a [[pastiche]] of sources, freely combining qualities of classical works as well as modern or wholly original creations.<ref name=\"chrulew\" />\n\n==Influence and criticism==\nThe monsters of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have significantly influenced modern fantasy fiction, ranging from licensed fiction, such as the novels of [[R.A. Salvatore]], [[Margaret Weis]], and [[Tracy Hickman]], to how monsters are portrayed in fantasy fiction generally. The scope of this influence has been compared to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Indeed, as Jeffrey Weinstock notes, \"it is not even clear where Tolkien pastiche leaves off and Dungeons & Dragons pastiche begins in modern genre fantasy.\"<ref name=\"ashgate\" /> In a 2005 interview, author [[China Mieville]] stated,\n{{quote|\"I use AD&D-type fascination with [[teratology]] in a lot of my books, and I have the original Monster Manual, and the Monster Manual 2, and the Fiend Folio.

[[Gary Gygax]] wrote much of the work himself, having included and expanded most of the monsters from [[List of Dungeons & Dragons monsters (1974\u20131976)|the previous D&D supplements]]. Also included are monsters originally printed in ''The Strategic Review'', as well as some originally found in early issues of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'' (such as the anhkheg and [[remorhaz]]), and other early game materials.  This book also expanded on the original monster format, such as including the stat lines on the same page as the monsters' descriptions and introducing more stats, expanding the length of most monster descriptions, and featuring illustrations for most of the monsters. The book features an alphabetical table of contents of all the monsters on pages 3\u20134, explanatory notes for the statistics lines on pages 5\u20136, descriptions of the monsters on pages 6\u2013103, a treasure chart on page 105, and an index of major listings on pages 106\u2013109.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

These include various races of demons and [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]] that are of an [[evil]] [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] and hail from the [[Outer Plane|Lower Planes]]. All fiends are extraplanar [[Outsider (Dungeons & Dragons)|outsiders]].\n\n===The most common types===\n\n====Demons====\n{{details|Demon (Dungeons & Dragons)}}\n\nThe most widespread race of fiends are the demons, a [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] race native to the [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|Abyss]]; they are rapacious, cruel and arbitrary. The dominant race of demons is the tanar'ri {{IPAc-en|t|\u0259|\u02c8|n|\u0251r|i}}. The Abyss and its population are both theoretically infinite in size. \"True\" tanar'ri such as the [[balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]s (originally called [[Balrog]]s) and the six-armed serpentine [[marilith]]s push other weaker tanar'ri around and organise them into makeshift armies for battle. [[Demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demon lords and demon princes]] such as [[Orcus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Orcus]], [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], Zuggtmoy, [[Graz'zt]] and countless others rule over the demons of their individual layers of the Abyss, in as much as the chaotic demons can be ruled over.\n\n====Devils====\nThe [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]], of which the ruling type are called baatezu {{IPAc-en|b|e\u026a|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|t|\u025b|z|u\u02d0}}, are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Lawful Evil|lawful evil]] natives of the [[Baator|Nine Hells of Baator]]; they subjugate the weak and rule tyrannically over their domains. Pit fiends are the most powerful baatezu, though even the strongest pit fiends are surpassed by the [[Lords of the Nine]], or Archdevils, whose ranks include [[Baalzebul (Dungeons & Dragons)|Baalzebul]], [[Mephistopheles (Dungeons & Dragons)|Mephistopheles]], and [[Asmodeus (Dungeons & Dragons)|Asmodeus]]. Unlike the demons, the devils arranged themselves through a strict hierarchy. Like the demons, the devils are scheming backstabbers; while a demon only keeps its words when it is convenient for it, a devil keeps its word all too well; though being used to exploiting repressive bureaucratic machinations to the fullest, always knows all ways around the letter of a contract to begin with. The tanar'ri and the baatezu hold an eternal enmity for one another and wage the [[Blood War]] against one another.\n\n====Yugoloths====\nThe yugoloths (called [[daemon (mythology)|daemon]]s in 1st edition ''D&D'') are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Neutral Evil|neutral evil]] natives of the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna and the [[Gray Waste|Gray Wastes of Hades]]; they are neutral to the affairs of the other fiendish races, interfering only when they see a situation that may be profitable or a potential for the advancement of their own schemes. The yugoloths are manipulative, secretive, and mercenary by nature, often acting as soldiers for deities in their own private wars, or even at times aiding both sides of the Blood War. In 4th Edition, the yugoloths are considered to be demons, and their previously standard naming convention of \"loth\" is replaced by \"demon\" (Ex. the Mezzoloth is the 4e Mezzodemon). In fifth edition, yugoloths are listed as neutral evil fiends under their original names.\n\n===Other fiends===\n\n====Demodands====\nThe demodands are race of evil fiends that live on the plane of [[Carceri (Dungeons & Dragons)|Carceri]] (Tarterus in 1st edition ''D&D''). Demodands were introduced in the 1st edition supplement ''[[Monster Manual II]]'', renamed as Gehreleths in the 2nd edition ''[[Monster Manual#Monstrous Compendium volumes issued|Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix]]'', and reintroduced as demodands in the 3rd edition sourcebook ''[[Fiend Folio]]''. In 1st edition ''D&D'', the three types of demodands from weakest to strongest were tarry, slime, and shaggy. In 2nd and 3rd editions, the three types are  farastu, kelubar, and shator.\n\n====Hordlings====\nThe '''hordlings''' are fiends that form the hordes of the [[Gray Waste|Gray Waste of Hades]]. They first appeared in the 1st edition supplement [[Monster Manual II]]. Hordlings wander the Gray Waste preying upon everything they come across, even other hordlings. Hordlings vary greatly in appearance. It is said that Hordlings evolved from Larvae whose hatred was so unique, their souls became individual. The hordlings can be summoned using an artifact known as the ''Bringer of Doom'', which was created around the time of the [[Invoked Devastation]] of [[Greyhawk]]. Hordlings are the most common inhabitants of the Gray Waste. They also occasionally roam the other Lower Planes as well.\n\n====Kython====\nThe kythons (not to be confused with kytons, which are chain devils [[Baatezu]]) are distinct from the other fiends in that they did not originate on any of the lower planes. When a group of fiends (the Galchutt, from Monte Cook's ''Chaositech'' and ''Ptolus'') were trapped on the [[Material Plane]], they tried creating more of their own kind through magical means. The results were eyeless reptilian creatures with insectoid traits and neutral evil traits. As the kythons matured, they took on varied forms. None of them were loyal to the fiends that created them. Because kythons originated on the Material Plane instead of the [[Abyss (plane)|Abyss]] (or another lower plane), they are also called earth-bound demons. Kythons are only interested in eating and breeding. They have spread rapidly across the [[Material Plane]]. The current hierarchy of kythons, from the weakest to the strongest is: broodlings, juveniles, adults, impalers, slaymasters, and slaughterkings. Eventually, with more time, kythons will grow into newer and more powerful forms. Kythons closely resemble [[Xenomorph (Alien)|xenomorphs]]. They were originally created for Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign, based on some gaming miniatures he had bought, and were added by him to the ''Book of Vile Darkness'' absent the context of the Galchutt, who wouldn't appear until later on in ''Chaositech''.\n\n[[Monte Cook]] originally planned on perhaps renaming them so their name was not quite so similar to kytons, or chain devils, as well as other episodes of Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign to see how they were originally used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |title=Ptolus |last=Cook |first=Monte |authorlink=Monte Cook |date=2001-04-28 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106044607/http://montecook.com/arch_ptolus1.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Night hags====\nNight hags are fiends from the Gray Wastes of Hades that traffic in the souls of mortals in 3rd edition sources. In 5th edition they come from the [[Feywild]] and are exiled to the [[Gray Wastes of Hades]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Jeremy |title=D&D Monster manual. |date=2014 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=978-0-7869-6561-8 |pages=177 |edition=Fifthition}}</ref>\n\n====Rakshasas====\n[[Rakshasa (Dungeons & Dragons)|Rakshasas]] are fiends (often tiger-headed) that may have originated on [[Acheron (plane)|Acheron]] according to 3rd edition sources. In 5th edition they originated in the [[Nine Hells]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Jeremy |title=D&D Monster manual. |date=2014 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=978-0-7869-6561-8 |page=257 |edition=Fifthition}}</ref>\n\n====Slaad====\nIn the 4th Edition game, Slaadi are Chaotic Evil and originate out of the Elemental Chaos. This is markedly different from the portrayal of Slaadi in all prior editions of the game, when they were Chaotic Neutral natives of Limbo and thus not fiends.\n\n====Half-fiends and fiendish creatures====\nThe [[Cambion (Dungeons & Dragons)|cambions]] (whose name comes from a different kind of mythological, demonic creature) are simply half-fiends; [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] of fiends and non-fiendish creatures, often humans or other humanoids. Cambions are typically created through fiends raping mortals or seducing them after [[shape-shift]]ing, although some of the most depraved beings actually participate willingly. Those cambions that actually survive birth typically look like grotesque, hellish variants of their mortal progenitors, having wings, claws, fangs and often many other features that reveal their fiendish origins. Cambions are usually outcast, being feared and hated in mortal societies for their fiendish origins and being derided by pure-blooded fiends for their impure heritage. A variant of cambion called durzagon is described in ''[[Monster Manual|Monster Manual II]]'' and is the hybrid of a devil and an unsuspecting [[Duergar (Dungeons & Dragons)|duergar]]. The fiendish creatures are simply fiendish versions of other species in Dungeons & Dragons. They typically look like fearsome travesties of beings from the [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|material plane]]. Most fiendish species are divided into a number of variants, usually in a [[hierarchy]] of increasing power and cunning.\n\n====Other fiends not associated with a specific group====\n*Abominations \u2013 (Chichimec, phane, infernal, dream larva, phaethon, xixecal, hecatoncheires) \u2013 the unwanted offspring of deities.\n*Abyssal Drake \u2013 the result of an ancient breeding program that combines the nastiest elements of demons, wyverns, and red dragons.

They are horrible conquerors, subjugating other life forms ruthlessly, and causing pain wherever they go.

When the creatures were reintroduced in the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'' supplement ''MC8: The Outer Planes'', the terms \"baatezu\", \"tanar'ri\", \"yugoloth\", and \"gehreleth\" were introduced and were used exclusively in place of the terms \"devil\", \"demon\", \"daemon\", and \"demodand\", respectively.<ref name=mythology>{{cite web|url=http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/monster-mythology|title=Monster Mythology|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|work=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a more relaxed attitude towards the hobby, [[Wizards of the Coast]] reinserted many of these excised references in the third edition of the game. They kept intact the terms they had been replaced with, using both when applicable to appeal both to older players and those who played in subsequent editions of the game. While the 1st edition of ''AD&D'' used the term \"Daemon\", all subsequent editions beginning with 2nd edition have used the term \"yugoloth\" for the same creatures.\n\n===Reception===\nFiends were considered among the \"standard repertoire of \"Monsters\"\" of the game by Fabian Perlini-Pfister.<ref>{{cite book |title=Religions in play: games, rituals, and virtual worlds |last=Bornet |first=Philippe |year=2011 |publisher=Theologischer Verlag Z\u00fcrich |location= |isbn=978-3-290-22010-5 |page=282 |accessdate=5 December 2019 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=t3X18dopUoMC&pg=PA282#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">Fabian Perlini-Pfister uses the word \"demon\" instead of fiend, but uses \"Asmodeus and succubi\" as examples.</ref>\n\n===Blood War===\nThe Blood War concept was introduced as part of the new background for the outer planes in 1991's ''Monstrous Compendium Volume Outer Planes Appendix''. The conflict is depicted as a bitter war of annihilation between the baatezu race and the tanar'ri; an absolute, all encompassing, and virtually eternal struggle.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Game Wizards|last=Brown|first=Timothy B.|authorlink=Timothy Brown (game designer)|journal=Dragon|issue=165|date=January 1991|pages=89}}</ref>  Trenton Webb of ''Arcane'' magazine wrote, \"the fate of all the planes hangs on its outcome\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Webb|first=Trenton|date=October 1996|title=Games Reviews|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=11|pages=71}}</ref>  The Blood War was thoroughly detailed in various books throughout the [[Planescape]] setting, particularly the 1996 boxed set ''[[Hellbound: The Blood War]]''.<ref name=mythology/>  The 4th edition of D&D's ''[[Manual of the Planes]]'' updated the Blood War into a smoldering cold war that was formerly an all-out war.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Blood War has been given various causes across different game books.

When he and his followers take on demonic traits to better combat their foes, these angels, now deemed devils, are either exiled to or granted (depending on perspective) their own plane, where they fight the Blood War without disturbing the primordial lords of order.

For many years black people were forcibly removed from where they lived and then were not allowed to own land in their own country. This led to high unemployment rates among black people, making impoverishment almost inescapable. Unemployment causes families to live in unsanitary conditions because of a lack of financial means to improve living conditions. If the parents are unemployed, this can also affect how the child is brought up and what kind of education they receive.

For many years black people were forcibly removed from where they lived and then were not allowed to own land in their own country. This led to high unemployment rates among black people, making impoverishment almost inescapable. Unemployment causes families to live in unsanitary conditions because of a lack of financial means to improve living conditions. If the parents are unemployed, this can also affect how the child is brought up and what kind of education they receive.

Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the Hindu [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]].

Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the Hindu [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]].

In the early 1980s the banking industry in West Africa was dominated by foreign and state-owned banks. There were hardly any commercial banks in West Africa owned and managed by the African private sector. ETI was founded with the objective of filling this vacuum.\n\nThe Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce promoted and initiated a project for the creation of a private regional banking institution in West Africa. In 1984, Ecopromotions S.A. was incorporated. Its founding shareholders raised the seed capital for the feasibility studies and the promotional activities leading to the creation of ETI.\n\nIn October 1985, ETI was incorporated with an authorised capital of US$100 million. The initial paid up capital of US$32 million was raised from over 1,500 individuals and institutions from West African countries. The largest shareholder was the ECOWAS Fund for Cooperation, Compensation and Development (ECOWAS Fund), the development finance arm of ECOWAS. A Headquarters\u2019 Agreement was signed with the government of Togo in 1985 which granted ETI the status of an international organisation with the rights and privileges necessary for it to operate as a regional institution, including the status of a non-resident financial institution.\n\nETI has two specialised subsidiaries: Ecobank Development Corporation (EDC) and eProcess International (eProcess). EDC was incorporated with a broad mandate to develop Ecobank\u2019s investment banking and advisory businesses throughout the countries where Ecobank operates. EDC operates brokerage houses on all 3 stock exchanges in West Africa and has obtained licences to operate on the two stock exchanges in Central Africa: the Douala Stock Exchange in Cameroon and the Libreville Exchange in Gabon. The mandate of eProcess is to manage the Group\u2019s information technology function with a view to ultimately centralising the Group\u2019s middle and back office operations to improve efficiency, service standards and reduce costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobank.com/aboutus.aspx|title=About Us|work=ecobank.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131002151/http://www.ecobank.com/aboutus.aspx|archivedate=31 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Governance lapses ==\nEcobank has been marred by several well publicized governance lapses:\n\nThe sacking and reinstatement of the CFO in 2014 after she alleged:  \"...

In the early 1980s the banking industry in West Africa was dominated by foreign and state-owned banks. There were hardly any commercial banks in West Africa owned and managed by the African private sector. ETI was founded with the objective of filling this vacuum.\n\nThe Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce promoted and initiated a project for the creation of a private regional banking institution in West Africa. In 1984, Ecopromotions S.A. was incorporated. Its founding shareholders raised the seed capital for the feasibility studies and the promotional activities leading to the creation of ETI.\n\nIn October 1985, ETI was incorporated with an authorised capital of US$100 million. The initial paid up capital of US$32 million was raised from over 1,500 individuals and institutions from West African countries. The largest shareholder was the ECOWAS Fund for Cooperation, Compensation and Development (ECOWAS Fund), the development finance arm of ECOWAS. A Headquarters\u2019 Agreement was signed with the government of Togo in 1985 which granted ETI the status of an international organisation with the rights and privileges necessary for it to operate as a regional institution, including the status of a non-resident financial institution.\n\nETI has two specialised subsidiaries: Ecobank Development Corporation (EDC) and eProcess International (eProcess). EDC was incorporated with a broad mandate to develop Ecobank\u2019s investment banking and advisory businesses throughout the countries where Ecobank operates. EDC operates brokerage houses on all 3 stock exchanges in West Africa and has obtained licences to operate on the two stock exchanges in Central Africa: the Douala Stock Exchange in Cameroon and the Libreville Exchange in Gabon. The mandate of eProcess is to manage the Group\u2019s information technology function with a view to ultimately centralising the Group\u2019s middle and back office operations to improve efficiency, service standards and reduce costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobank.com/aboutus.aspx|title=About Us|work=ecobank.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131002151/http://www.ecobank.com/aboutus.aspx|archivedate=31 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Governance lapses ==\nEcobank has been marred by several well publicized governance lapses:\n\nThe sacking and reinstatement of the CFO in 2014 after she alleged:  \"...

She was pressured by her parents to get into medicine when she was in high school. She was to return to [[Pakistan]] at the age of 18 to study further medicine; but her plans were thwarted by a lack of high school physics and she decided to rather attend [[Kinnaird College]] in [[Lahore]].<ref name=\"CITEREFPage3Bollywood1\">{{cite web|title=Page 3 Bollywood: Vaneeza Ahmad|url=http://page3bollywood.wordpress.com/2008/04/12/vaneeza-ahmed/|publisher=[[WordPress]]|accessdate=June 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWith her interests still inclined towards medicine, she graduated from [[Kinnaird College]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[psychology]]. In her brief stay at the college, she started to model casually.<ref name=\"CITEREFPage3Bollywood1\"/> Not much interested in modelling as a career option, she was showered with offers from various fashion designers, some of which were notable in the Pakistani fashion industry<ref name=\"CITEREFPage3Bollywood1\"/> including the likes of fashion designer [[Nilofer Shahid]].\n\nShe married Ali Afzal Malik (businessman, 42) in 2010. She has given some interviews in which she has stated that her husband and she were made for each other. She had known him in Lahore in the early to mid 1990s and was heartbroken when he left to move to the United States. He came back in 2009 and they were soon married. The couple is known to be enthralled with each other. They became parents in 2012.\n\n===Modelling as a career===\nWhen Nilofer approached Vaneeza, she was unsure of which career to pursue and settled for fashion modeling. Her initial walks at fashion shows led fashion critics to praise her elegance on the cat-walk.

He is known for perfecting [[damascening]], a metalwork technique that involves inlaying gold, silver and other metals into a metal surface, creating an intricate decorative effect. He exhibited his art works at [[World's fair|international fairs]] and was recognised with multiple awards. Zuloaga came from a family of [[Basques|Basque]] metalworkers. He was the son of damascening pioneer [[Eusebio Zuloaga]], the half-brother of the painter and ceramic artist [[Daniel Zuloaga]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and the father of the painter [[Ignacio Zuloaga]]. He improved on the techniques introduced by his father, perfecting a process for inlaying gold and silver into iron.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=37}} For a long time he made art works for the English collector [[Alfred Morrison]]. Many of these items are now in the private collection of the British-Iranian scholar and philanthropist [[Nasser Khalili|Nasser D.

Zuloaga's goal was beauty rather than practical utility.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=57}}\n\nMore than a hundred pieces of Spanish damascened metalwork, including 22 signed by Zuolaga, have been collected by the British-Iranian scholar and philanthropist [[Nasser Khalili|Nasser D.

Work began in Eibar, but due to the [[Third Carlist War|civil war of 1873]] he moved his workshop across to the border to [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] in France where the work was completed.

In 1872, the Keeper of Art Collections in the South Kensington Museum (later renamed the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) wrote that a [[L\u00e9onard Morel-Ladeuil]] vase decorated by Zuloaga \"will be regarded as one of the greatest Art productions of the century\".<ref name=\"blair\" /> An 1879 article said that the his works showed a patience and effort that \"take one into an era when the fine

He is known for perfecting [[damascening]], a metalwork technique that involves inlaying gold, silver and other metals into a metal surface, creating an intricate decorative effect. He exhibited his art works at [[World's fair|international fairs]] and was recognised with multiple awards. Zuloaga came from a family of [[Basques|Basque]] metalworkers. He was the son of damascening pioneer [[Eusebio Zuloaga]], the half-brother of the painter and ceramic artist [[Daniel Zuloaga]],<ref name=\":0\" /> and the father of the painter [[Ignacio Zuloaga]]. He improved on the techniques introduced by his father, perfecting a process for inlaying gold and silver into iron.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=37}} For a long time he made art works for the English collector [[Alfred Morrison]]. Many of these items are now in the private collection of the British-Iranian scholar and philanthropist [[Nasser Khalili|Nasser D. Khalili]].\n\n== Early life ==\nPl\u00e1cido was born in 1834 in [[Madrid]] to Eusebio and Antonia Zuloaga. His father was the director of the [[Royal Armoury of Madrid|Spanish Royal Armoury]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The Zuloaga family were based in Eibar and producing armaments as far back as 1596.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|41}} Pl\u00e1cido learned in his father's workshop from an early age.<ref name=\":0\" /> At fourteen, he visited [[Paris]] where he learned from the armourer [[Faur\u00e9 Le Page|Lepage]]. In [[Dresden]], he studied under [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1867 his father let him take over administration of the family factory in [[Eibar]].<ref name=\":0\" /> It is thought that he had already been carrying out his father's commissions for a decade at this point.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=43}} The workshop's royal commissions ended in 1868 when [[Isabella II of Spain|the queen]] was exiled and Eusebio lost his position in the royal household.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2006/arts-of-the-islamic-world-l06220/lot.120.html|title=Catalogue note|last=Lavin|first=James|date=|website=Sothebys.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Pl\u00e1cido contacted the English art collector [[Alfred Morrison]], heir to a textile fortune, whom he had met at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in South Kensington.<ref name=\":1\" /> Over a twenty year period, Zuloaga and his workshop worked almost exclusively for Morrison,<ref name=\":1\" /> adapting the factory'to make damascened art works rather than armaments.<ref name=\":0\" /> From 1860 to 1890, Zuloaga trained more than 200 artists in damascening.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=63}}\n\n== Works ==\nMany of Zuloaga's works are so intricate they could not feasibly be made by one person; he led a team of specialist artisans who carried out his designs, each object being produced by eight to twelve individuals.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=63}} Damascening involves indenting the iron surface, then pressing fine gold wire and heating the surface so that the gold forms a solid shape.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=45}} Whereas modern damascening uses acid etching to create the indentations, Zuloaga and his workshop did so with hand tools.<ref>Larra\u00f1aga, Ramiro \"Damascene as part of the Engraver's Art\" in {{Harvnb|Lavin|1997}}, p. 37</ref> Zuloaga worked when gold was relatively abundant and his works make greater use of it than later Spanish damascene.<ref>Larra\u00f1aga, Ramiro \"Damascene as part of the Engraver's Art\" in {{Harvnb|Lavin|1997}}, p. 38</ref> Although he made objects with a practical use, they are so delicate they would be damaged by ordinary use. Zuloaga's goal was beauty rather than practical utility.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=57}}\n\nMore than a hundred pieces of Spanish damascened metalwork, including 22 signed by Zuolaga, have been collected by the British-Iranian scholar and philanthropist [[Nasser Khalili|Nasser D.

Zuloaga and his specialists took took two years to construct the casket,{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=71}} which was described in 1879 as \"a triumph of skilled workmanship\".{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=57}} Also commissioned by Morrison are a pair of [[amphora]]-shaped urns, {{convert|108|cm|in}} high, from 1878 whose style imitated the medieval [[Hispano-Moresque ware|Alhambra vases]].{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=83}} Covered in intricate Hispano-Arabic decoration, possibly drawn from contemporary engravings of a specific Alhambra vase, these were exhibited in Paris before delivery to Morrison.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=83}}\n\nA writing desk dated 1884\u20131885 has 44 drawers in a wooden case, each with enamelled floral patterns and a damascened metal button-pull.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=108}} Not a woodworker himself, Zuloaga would have subcontracted out the preparation of the wood and veneer.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=108}} A {{convert|47.3|cm|in}} high iron shrine dated 1880 recalls [[Gothic architecture]] in its overall shape, but the intricate damascened decoration is more suggestive of [[art nouveau]].{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=104}} It contains a cast silver figure of the Virgin and Child in a gothic style.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=104}} Other objects signed by Zuloaga include a [[revolver]],{{sfn|Lavin|1997|p=102}} [[Decorative box|snuff boxes]] and caskets and containers of various dimensions.{{sfn|Lavin|1997|pp=90\u2013114}}\n\nAround 1872, Zuloaga's workshop was commissioned to make the monumental [[sarcophagus]] for [[Juan Prim, 1st Count of Reus|General Juan Prim]]. Work began in Eibar, but due to the [[Third Carlist War|civil war of 1873]] he moved his workshop across to the border to [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] in France where the work was completed.

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]].

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 />\n\n==Horses in the Hall of Fame==\n[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.<ref name=\"EvolvedPt2\">{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 /><ref name=Eligibility>{{cite web|title=Eligibility, Nomination and Election - National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/eligibility-nomination-and-election|website=www.racingmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Photo!!Name!!Inducted!!Career Years!!Starts!!Wins\n|-\n| [[File:1992APIndy (2).jpg|100px]]||[[A.P.
