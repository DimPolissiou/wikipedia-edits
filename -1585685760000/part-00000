Although the first lady\u2019s role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of the nation.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web |last1=Caroli|first1=Betty Boyd|title=First Lady: United States title|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/first-lady-United-States-title|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> Since the early 20th century, the first lady has been assisted by official staff, now known as the [[Office of the First Lady]] and headquartered in the [[East Wing]] of the [[White House]].\n\n[[Melania Trump]] is the current first lady of the United States, as wife of 45th president of the United States, [[Donald J. Trump]].\n\nWhile the title was not in general use until much later, [[Martha Washington]], the wife of [[George Washington]], the first U.S. president (1789\u20131797), is considered to be the inaugural first lady of the United States. During her lifetime, she was often referred to as \"Lady Washington\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Figueroa|first=Acton|title=Washington, Part 3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SbH-nF2QcYC&pg=PA10|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=World Almanac Library|isbn=978-0-8368-5162-5|page=10}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1790s, the role of First Lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. As first ladies now typically publish their memoirs, which are viewed as potential sources of additional information about their husbands' administrations, and because the public is interested in these increasingly independent women in their own right, first ladies frequently remain a focus of attention long after their husbands' terms of office have ended.<ref name=Britannica /> Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy. Historically, should a president be unmarried, or a widower, the President usually asks a relative or friend to act as White House hostess.\n\nThere are four living former first ladies: [[Rosalynn Carter]], wife of [[Jimmy Carter]]; [[Hillary Clinton]], wife of [[Bill Clinton]]; [[Laura Bush]], wife of [[George W. Bush]]; and [[Michelle Obama]], wife of [[Barack Obama]].\n\n== Origins of the title ==\n[[File:Martha Washington by Rembrandt Peale c1856.png|left|thumb|[[Martha Washington]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], circa 1856, based on a portrait by his father, [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]\n\nThe use of the title ''[[First Lady]]'' to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as \"Lady\", \"Mrs. President\" and \"Mrs. Presidentress\"; [[Martha Washington]] was often referred to as \"Lady Washington.\" One of the earliest uses of the term \"First Lady\" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the ''St. Johnsbury Caledonian'', the author, \"Mrs. Sigourney\", discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband [[George Washington|George]] became president. She wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Martha Washington |work=St. Johnsbury Caledonian |date=August 7, 1838 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolley Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dolley Madison]] was said to be the first president's wife to be referred to as \"First Lady\" (this was at her funeral in 1849).]]\n\n[[Dolley Madison]] was reportedly referred to as \"First Lady\" in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President [[Zachary Taylor]]; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=4 |title=First Lady Biography: Dolley Madison |publisher=National First Ladies' Library}}</ref> Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. One of the earliest known written examples comes from November 3, 1863, diary entry of [[William Howard Russell]], in which he referred to gossip about \"the First Lady in the Land\", referring to [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist [[Mary C. Ames]] referred to [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] as \"the First Lady of the Land\" while reporting on the inauguration of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled ''The First Lady in the Land'', popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations.\n\nWhen [[Edith Wilson]] took control of her husband's schedule in 1919 after he had a debilitating stroke, one Republican senator labeled her \"the Presidentress who had fulfilled the dream of the suffragettes by changing her title from First Lady to Acting First Man.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Sharon |last=Creeden |title=In Full Bloom: Tales of Women in Their Prime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2DyOCFDrcwC&pg=PA30 |year=1999 |publisher=August House |page=30}}</ref>\n\nThe wife of the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] is sometimes referred to as the [[Second Lady of the United States|second lady of the United States]] ('''SLOTUS'''), but this title is much less common.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnother acronym used is '''FLOTUS''', or First Lady of the United States. According to the [[Nexis]] database, the term (which is pronounced FLOW-tus, to rhyme with Potus, and not FLOT-tus) was first used in 1983 by Donnie Radcliffe, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Safire, William]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/magazine/on-language-potus-and-flotus.html|title=On Language; Potus And Flotus|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 12, 1997|archivedate=June 18, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909183029/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/magazine/on-language-potus-and-flotus.html}}</ref><ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/FLOTUS \"FLOTUS\"].

Trump]].\n\nWhile the title was not in general use until much later, [[Martha Washington]], the wife of [[George Washington]], the first U.S. president (1789\u20131797), is considered to be the inaugural first lady of the United States. During her lifetime, she was often referred to as \"Lady Washington\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Figueroa|first=Acton|title=Washington, Part 3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SbH-nF2QcYC&pg=PA10|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=World Almanac Library|isbn=978-0-8368-5162-5|page=10}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1790s, the role of First Lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. As first ladies now typically publish their memoirs, which are viewed as potential sources of additional information about their husbands' administrations, and because the public is interested in these increasingly independent women in their own right, first ladies frequently remain a focus of attention long after their husbands' terms of office have ended.<ref name=Britannica /> Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy. Historically, should a president be unmarried, or a widower, the President usually asks a relative or friend to act as White House hostess.\n\nThere are four living former first ladies: [[Rosalynn Carter]], wife of [[Jimmy Carter]]; [[Hillary Clinton]], wife of [[Bill Clinton]]; [[Laura Bush]], wife of [[George W. Bush]]; and [[Michelle Obama]], wife of [[Barack Obama]].\n\n== Origins of the title ==\n[[File:Martha Washington by Rembrandt Peale c1856.png|left|thumb|[[Martha Washington]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], circa 1856, based on a portrait by his father, [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]\n\nThe use of the title ''[[First Lady]]'' to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as \"Lady\", \"Mrs. President\" and \"Mrs. Presidentress\"; [[Martha Washington]] was often referred to as \"Lady Washington.\" One of the earliest uses of the term \"First Lady\" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the ''St. Johnsbury Caledonian'', the author, \"Mrs. Sigourney\", discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband [[George Washington|George]] became president. She wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Martha Washington |work=St. Johnsbury Caledonian |date=August 7, 1838 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolley Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dolley Madison]] was said to be the first president's wife to be referred to as \"First Lady\" (this was at her funeral in 1849).]]\n\n[[Dolley Madison]] was reportedly referred to as \"First Lady\" in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President [[Zachary Taylor]]; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=4 |title=First Lady Biography: Dolley Madison |publisher=National First Ladies' Library}}</ref> Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. One of the earliest known written examples comes from November 3, 1863, diary entry of [[William Howard Russell]], in which he referred to gossip about \"the First Lady in the Land\", referring to [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist [[Mary C. Ames]] referred to [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] as \"the First Lady of the Land\" while reporting on the inauguration of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled ''The First Lady in the Land'', popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations.\n\nWhen [[Edith Wilson]] took control of her husband's schedule in 1919 after he had a debilitating stroke, one Republican senator labeled her \"the Presidentress who had fulfilled the dream of the suffragettes by changing her title from First Lady to Acting First Man.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Sharon |last=Creeden |title=In Full Bloom: Tales of Women in Their Prime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2DyOCFDrcwC&pg=PA30 |year=1999 |publisher=August House |page=30}}</ref>\n\nThe wife of the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] is sometimes referred to as the [[Second Lady of the United States|second lady of the United States]] ('''SLOTUS'''), but this title is much less common.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnother acronym used is '''FLOTUS''', or First Lady of the United States. According to the [[Nexis]] database, the term (which is pronounced FLOW-tus, to rhyme with Potus, and not FLOT-tus) was first used in 1983 by Donnie Radcliffe, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Safire, William]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/magazine/on-language-potus-and-flotus.html|title=On Language; Potus And Flotus|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 12, 1997|archivedate=June 18, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909183029/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/magazine/on-language-potus-and-flotus.html}}</ref><ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/FLOTUS \"FLOTUS\"].

He gained a reputation for his role in defending Finland and [[Governorate of Estonia|Estonia]] from [[Crimean War#Baltic theatre|Anglo-French invasion during the Crimean War]] and was also crucial in suppressing and crushing the [[Congress Poland|Polish]] [[January Uprising]] of 1863, during which rebel forces carried out numerous failed assassination attempts on him, martial law was consequently declared in Poland. Berg also held responsible for improving the economy and industry of Finland and Poland  during his time as viceroy. As a German, Berg was never keen of the [[Russification]] policies introduced in Poland, being opposed to the [[Pan-Slavism]] idealogy of the Russians and keen towards the foreign policies of [[German Confederation|Germany]]. He died in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1874 and was buried in his {{ill|Be\u013cava Manor, Pilskalns|lt=family estate|lv|Be\u013cavas mui\u017ea}} in the village of {{ill|Pilskalns|lt=Korten|lv|Pilskalns (Be\u013cavas pagasts)}}, [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] (in now Pilskalns, [[Latvia]]).\n\n==Biography==\n===Origin===\n[[File:Sangaste m\u00f5isa peahoone2.jpg|thumb|The [[Sangaste Castle|Sagnitz castle]], where Count von Berg and his siblings spent their childhood in]]\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg was born on May 15, 1794 (26 according to the [[Julian calendar]] in use in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] at the time), in the [[Sangaste#Sangaste castle|family estate]] in the small village of [[Sangaste|Sagnitz]], [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]]. His father Friedrich Georg von Berg (1763-1811) was a state councillor and his mother Gertruda Wilhelmine [[Ermes (noble family)|von Ermes]] (1774-1844) was a young noblewoman, the younger Friedrich was the first cousin once removed{{efn|Gregor and Burchard Magnus von Berg were the children of Magnus Johann von Berg{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=660}}, while Magnus Johann was the brother{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=659}} of Gotthard Ernst who was the grandfather{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=661}} of Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert}} of generals Gregor (1765-1838) and Burchard Magnus von Berg (764-1838), both of who served in the [[Russian Imperial Army]] during the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Genealogists still debate{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=654-655}} where the {{ill|Berg (Livonian noble family)|lt=Livonian noble Berg family|de|Berg (Livl\u00e4ndisches Adelsgeschlecht}} originated in, many speculated they originated in [[Westphalia]]. The first known ancestor of the family to appear in [[Terra Mariana|Livonia]] was Otto von Berg. His son, who was also named Otto, was a vassal of the [[Livonian Knighthood]].\n\nFriedrich belonged to the Sagnitz branch of the Luist line of the family. The Luist line{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=659}} was formed by Captain Gustav von Berg (1656-1715), and the further divided Sagnitz branch{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=661}} was formed by Friedrich's grandfather Major Gotthard Ernst von Berg (1714-1766).\n\n===Early life===\nBerg along with his siblings spent their childhood in the Sagnitz castle and were home educated by the young [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]].<ref>[https://www.obs.ee/cgi-bin/w3-msql/vaatleja/artikkel.html?id=84 Fr. G. W. Struve Dorpat period]</ref> After he finished his home education he studied in the {{ill|Tartu Gymnasium|it=Governorate Gymnasium|et|Tartu Kubermangug\u00fcmnaasium}} in [[Tartu|Dorpat]]. Originally not seeking a military career as a family tradition, Berg enrolled into the [[Philosophy]] faculty of [[University of Tartu|Imperial University of Dorpat]] in 1810.{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=662}} But after [[Napoleon]] [[French invasion of Russia|invaded of Russia]] in 1812, Berg dropped out from university and voluntarily entered the [[Russian Imperial Army]].\n\n{{quote|Here he got all the money, with a backpack on his back and boots on a stick, he reached [[Kaunas|Kovno]] barefooted, where the men of General [[Magnus Gustav von Essen|Essen]] stood.{{sfn|Military Encyclopaedia|1911-1915|pp=478}}}}\n\nHe entered the army as a [[Fahnenjunker]] and was enlisted into the [[6th Libau Infantry Regiment]] which was stationed at the north-western part of Russia to defend against Napoleon. Berg's bravery during the war of 1812 rewarded him the rank of [[lieutenant]] from [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] personally. He was also appointed second to the [[quartermaster]] due to his high education and being multilingual among Russian soldiers at the time.\n\nAfter Napoleon was pushed out of Russia, Berg was transferred to a [[Partisan (military)|partisan unit]] under the commands of [[Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn|Baron von Tettenborn]] and [[Pavel Kutuzov]] and took part in actions in [[Germany]] including the [[Battle of Leipzig]].\n\n===Family===\nBerg was born the eldest son of a family with three siblings, including his younger brother Gustav \"Astaf\" Gotthard Karl von Berg, the owner of the {{ill|Vecate Manor|It=Alt-Ottenhof Manor|et|Vecate m\u00f5is}}.{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=662}} His other brother [[Alexander von Berg|Alexander]] was a diplomat and [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Naples]] and [[London]].{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=662}} Count von Berg married late in his life.

He gained a reputation for his role in defending Finland and [[Governorate of Estonia|Estonia]] from [[Crimean War#Baltic theatre|Anglo-French invasion during the Crimean War]] and was also crucial in suppressing and crushing the [[Congress Poland|Polish]] [[January Uprising]] of 1863, during which rebel forces carried out numerous failed assassination attempts on him, martial law was consequently declared in Poland. Berg also held responsible for improving the economy and industry of Finland and Poland  during his time as viceroy. As a German, Berg was never keen of the [[Russification]] policies introduced in Poland, being opposed to the [[Pan-Slavism]] idealogy of the Russians and keen towards the foreign policies of [[German Confederation|Germany]]. He died in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1874 and was buried in his {{ill|Be\u013cava Manor, Pilskalns|lt=family estate|lv|Be\u013cavas mui\u017ea}} in the village of {{ill|Pilskalns|lt=Korten|lv|Pilskalns (Be\u013cavas pagasts)}}, [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] (in now Pilskalns, [[Latvia]]).\n\n==Biography==\n===Origin===\n[[File:Sangaste m\u00f5isa peahoone2.jpg|thumb|The [[Sangaste Castle|Sagnitz castle]], where Count von Berg and his siblings spent their childhood in]]\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg was born on May 15, 1794 (26 according to the [[Julian calendar]] in use in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] at the time), in the [[Sangaste#Sangaste castle|family estate]] in the small village of [[Sangaste|Sagnitz]], [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]]. His father Friedrich Georg von Berg (1763-1811) was a state councillor and his mother Gertruda Wilhelmine [[Ermes (noble family)|von Ermes]] (1774-1844) was a young noblewoman, the younger Friedrich was the first cousin once removed{{efn|Gregor and Burchard Magnus von Berg were the children of Magnus Johann von Berg{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=660}}, while Magnus Johann was the brother{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=659}} of Gotthard Ernst who was the grandfather{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=661}} of Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert}} of generals Gregor (1765-1838) and Burchard Magnus von Berg (764-1838), both of who served in the [[Russian Imperial Army]] during the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The first known ancestor of the family to appear in [[Terra Mariana|Livonia]] was Otto von Berg. His son, who was also named Otto, was a vassal of the [[Livonian Knighthood]].\n\nFriedrich belonged to the Sagnitz branch of the Luist line of the family. The Luist line{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=659}} was formed by Captain Gustav von Berg (1656-1715), and the further divided Sagnitz branch{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=661}} was formed by Friedrich's grandfather Major Gotthard Ernst von Berg (1714-1766).\n\n===Early life===\nBerg along with his siblings spent their childhood in the Sagnitz castle and were home educated by the young [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]].<ref>[https://www.obs.ee/cgi-bin/w3-msql/vaatleja/artikkel.html?id=84 Fr. G. W. Struve Dorpat period]</ref> After he finished his home education he studied in the {{ill|Tartu Gymnasium|it=Governorate Gymnasium|et|Tartu Kubermangug\u00fcmnaasium}} in [[Tartu|Dorpat]]. Originally not seeking a military career as a family tradition, Berg enrolled into the [[Philosophy]] faculty of [[University of Tartu|Imperial University of Dorpat]] in 1810.{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=662}} But after [[Napoleon]] [[French invasion of Russia|invaded of Russia]] in 1812, Berg dropped out from university and voluntarily entered the [[Russian Imperial Army]].\n\n{{quote|Here he got all the money, with a backpack on his back and boots on a stick, he reached [[Kaunas|Kovno]] barefooted, where the men of General [[Magnus Gustav von Essen|Essen]] stood.{{sfn|Military Encyclopaedia|1911-1915|pp=478}}}}\n\nHe entered the army as a [[Fahnenjunker]] and was enlisted into the [[6th Libau Infantry Regiment]] which was stationed at the north-western part of Russia to defend against Napoleon. Berg's bravery during the war of 1812 rewarded him the rank of [[lieutenant]] from [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] personally. He was also appointed second to the [[quartermaster]] due to his high education and being multilingual among Russian soldiers at the time.\n\nAfter Napoleon was pushed out of Russia, Berg was transferred to a [[Partisan (military)|partisan unit]] under the commands of [[Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn|Baron von Tettenborn]] and [[Pavel Kutuzov]] and took part in actions in [[Germany]] including the [[Battle of Leipzig]].\n\n===Family===\nBerg was born the eldest son of a family with three siblings, including his younger brother Gustav \"Astaf\" Gotthard Karl von Berg, the owner of the {{ill|Vecate Manor|It=Alt-Ottenhof Manor|et|Vecate m\u00f5is}}.{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=662}} His other brother [[Alexander von Berg|Alexander]] was a diplomat and [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Naples]] and [[London]].{{sfn|Stackelberg|1930|pp=662}} Count von Berg married late in his life.
