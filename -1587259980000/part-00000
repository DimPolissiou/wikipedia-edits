Neither team was able to build a large lead like the previous six games. The Warriors built a 7-point lead early, but Cleveland bounced back to take the lead late in the first quarter. After a second quarter where neither team built a lead larger than 3, Golden State ended the half on an 11\u20134 run to take a 49\u201342 lead into the break. \n\nFive straight points by [[Klay Thompson]] early in the third quarter gave the Warriors an 8-point lead at 54\u201346. Back-to-back 3-pointers by [[shooting guard]] [[J.R. Smith]] and a layup by [[Kyrie Irving]] briefly tied the game at 54. Warriors' guard [[Stephen Curry]] made a layup in transition and a 3-pointer on the following possession to give Golden State a 59\u201354 lead. Cleveland responded with a 14\u20132 run \u2013 including 10 points from Irving \u2013 to take a 68\u201361 lead with 4 minutes left in the quarter. The Warriors then fired back with a 15\u20137 run to close out the quarter, taking a 76\u201375 lead into the final 12 minutes. \n\nScoring was slow early in the fourth quarter for both teams, but the Cavaliers built an 83\u201380 lead with 7 minutes left. The Warriors pushed back with a Curry 3, Thompson hitting a jump shot from the left corner, and [[Draymond Green]] converting a put-back layup on consecutive possessions to take an 87\u201383 lead with 5:39 left. LeBron James responded with six straight points, making 3/3 free throws after being fouled on a shot fake, and then connecting on his only 3-pointer of the night with 4:53 to play. After Thompson put in a layup off the glass with 4:39 left to tie the game, Cleveland and Golden State began trading missed chances. At this point, the score in the period was just 14\u201313 in favor of Cleveland. Both teams were tied at 699 points scored apiece in the series.\n\n===The Block===\nWith 1:56 to play, Irving released a floater that bounced off the glass and was eventually corralled by Iguodala with the game tied at 89.\n\nIguodala immediately streaked up the floor as Curry sprinted ahead on the left wing. The only Cavaliers player who appeared to be in position to defend the fast break was Smith, who quickly began back-pedaling towards his own basket. James, standing in the corner in front of the Warriors bench, took off after them. Iguodala passed half court, threw a chest pass to Curry who immediately gave it back with a bounce pass. Iguodala gathered the ball, took two steps as he powered past Smith and toward the hoop before going airborne. Good defense by Smith on the initial layup attempt forced Iguodala to delay the release of his shot by a few tenths-of-a-second, double-pumping before softly floating the ball up toward the glass. James, who had been trailing the play the entire length of the floor, sized up the shot and sprung at the ball from behind, knocking the potential layup off the glass with 1:50 left. The ball was then rebounded by Smith, and brought back up the floor.

James would then go for a dunk, but hurt his right wrist after being fouled in the process. At the free throw line, he clinched the title for the Cavaliers by making one of two free throws. With the clock at 6.5 seconds, the Cavaliers fouled Green, who subsequently threw the inbound pass to Curry, who pump faked, and shot a three-pointer over Cavaliers guard [[Iman Shumpert]]. The attempt missed, and was rebounded by [[Marreese Speights]] of the Warriors, who then missed an attempted three-pointer as time expired.\n\n==Reaction to the play==\nAfter the game ended, James remarked to [[ESPN]] \"Iguodala is a bad motherfucker!

If you got an opportunity, just try to make this play. I was also thinking like, 'J.R., please don't foul him. I know I'm right there, I can get it, I can get it.'

James would then go for a dunk, but hurt his right wrist after being fouled in the process. At the free throw line, he clinched the title for the Cavaliers by making one of two free throws. With the clock at 6.5 seconds, the Cavaliers fouled Green, who subsequently threw the inbound pass to Curry, who pump faked, and shot a three-pointer over Cavaliers guard [[Iman Shumpert]]. The attempt missed, and was rebounded by [[Marreese Speights]] of the Warriors, who then missed an attempted three-pointer as time expired.\n\n==Reaction to the play==\nAfter the game ended, James remarked to [[ESPN]] \"Iguodala is a bad motherfucker! I had to go chase it down.\"  <ref>[https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1046936-lebron-on-block-i-had-to-go-chase-it-down]</ref>\n\nJames later recalled to [[The Plain Dealer|Cleveland.com]], \"I was like, just don't give up on the play. Just don't give up on the play. Kyrie made a move into the lane, missed it, it shot long, and Iguodala, one of the best guys we have in the open court, gets the rebound, pushes it to Steph, and I was just like, do not give up on the play. If you got an opportunity, just try to make this play. I was also thinking like, 'J.R., please don't foul him. I know I'm right there, I can get it, I can get it.' I was like, 'J.R., don't foul him, and Bron, get the ball before it hit the backboard.' And we did that.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Vardon|first=Joe|title=LeBron James and the next part of the greatest American sports story ever told|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/06/lebron_james_and_the_next_part.html|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Mike Breen]], who called the Finals for [[NBA on ABC|ESPN on ABC]], added: \"It's just another example of how he's just not going to let them lose.

The founding principal was Prof. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]], a pioneering educationist in India. He was a graduate of [[Loyola College, Chennai|Loyola College]], [[Chennai]] and the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (now known as [[Faculty of Engineering, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Engineering]], [[Dalhousie University]]), [[Canada]]; he pioneered the formation of Computer Science as a separate educational stream on the Indian scene.

In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the [[Bharathidasan University]] umbrella, of which Dr. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]] served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor. The Institute would grant degrees under this name for the next 20 years, except for a brief stint under [[Anna University]] in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under [[Bharathidasan University]] and introduced a Computer Science Department around 1984, split off the Mechanical Engineering Department's manufacturing stream into a Production Engineering Department and introduced the Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, [[Anna University]] was granted authority over REC Trichy. This was temporary, however, as the 40-year collaboration between the Center and the State Governments for all the RECs finally dissolved; the Center upgraded all the RECs to [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NIT) and completely took control of them under the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]]. In 2002, former Minister of Human Resource Development [[Murli Manohar Joshi|Murali Manoher Joshi]] decided to upgrade the RECs to NITs with the goal of modelling each institute based on the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], but with roots in Indian culture.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nitt.edu/home/about/|title=NIT Trichy - About|website=www.nitt.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref><ref name=\"mhrd.gov.in\">{{Cite web|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/technical-education-5|title=Technical Education {{!}} Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development|website=mhrd.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21}}</ref> In 2003, the institution was granted [[Deemed University]] status with the approval of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] / [[All India Council for Technical Education]]; it was renamed the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli and was finally granting degrees under its own name.

In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the [[Bharathidasan University]] umbrella, of which Dr. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]] served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor. The Institute would grant degrees under this name for the next 20 years, except for a brief stint under [[Anna University]] in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under [[Bharathidasan University]] and introduced a Computer Science Department around 1984, split off the Mechanical Engineering Department's manufacturing stream into a Production Engineering Department and introduced the Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, [[Anna University]] was granted authority over REC Trichy. This was temporary, however, as the 40-year collaboration between the Center and the State Governments for all the RECs finally dissolved; the Center upgraded all the RECs to [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NIT) and completely took control of them under the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]].

He possesses the [[superhuman]] power of [[telekinesis]]. Astrovik has been affiliated with the [[New Warriors]] and [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|Giant-Size Defenders]]'' #5 (July, 1975) and was created by [[Don Heck]] and [[Gerry Conway]]\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nMore than a decade after his creation, Vance appeared first as a mainstay in the New Warriors and later in the third volume of the ''Avengers'' titles. He usually appeared with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], who was his girlfriend then later [[fiancee]].\n\nIn 1994, he had his own four issue limited series, ''Justice: Four Balance'' and appeared in the ''I (heart) Marvel: Masked Intentions'' oneshot in 2006.\n\nHe was a major character in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', early in the series.\n\nJustice appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug 2010) through issue #20 (Dec 2011).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nVance Astrovik was born in [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was visited as a teenager by an alternate, [[time travel]]ing version of his future self, Major [[Vance Astro]] of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], an [[astronaut]] who had volunteered for an experimental space flight and consequently been lost in space in [[cryonics|cryogenic suspension]] for a thousand years. The elder Vance Astro convinced his younger self to not become an astronaut, and in the process, sparked the premature emergence of the younger Vance's telekinetic powers. Due to the vagaries of time travel in the [[Marvel Universe]], this did not create a [[paradox]], but instead made the Guardians' future world into a parallel timeline, to which they later returned. Although Major Vance Astro had not had a chance to fully develop his psionic power in his time in [[NASA]], the younger Astrovik now had the opportunity to hone his power. Astrovik soon became the costumed crime-fighter '''Marvel Boy'''.\n\n===Early adventures===\nAfter his powers developed, Vance's father, Arnold, began to physically abuse him for being \"different\". Running away from home, Vance wound up supporting himself as a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] in the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]], a circuit for superhuman competitors. While wrestling as \"Manglin' John Mahoney\", he befriended Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who at the time was himself estranged from his \"family\", the [[Fantastic Four]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Eventually, Vance was convinced to return home, with assurances from his parents that the abuse would stop.{{issue|date=November 2012}}\n\n===New Warriors===\nWhen Marvel Boy was rejected for membership in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by [[Captain America]], he helped found a team of teenage superheroes, the [[New Warriors]], led by the new hero [[Night Thrasher]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #1</ref> He had many intense times during this early period, such as a fight against the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #10</ref> and the immortal villain [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]].{{Issue|date=March 2012}} At the same time, Vance developed friendships with the other Warriors, and a romantic relationship with teammate [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]],{{Issue|date=March 2012}} and his powers increased both in strength and skill. However, his costumed activities renewed Arnold Astrovik's prejudice towards Vance's powers; both Vance and his mother suffered from Arnold's abusive behavior, and Vance's instinctively protecting himself with his powers only made things worse, with tragic consequences.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Murder Trial===\nOne night, Arnold Astrovik not only attacked a disadvantaged Vance (injured in a fight with [[Terrax]] and further injured by Gideon), but struck his wife when she tried to intervene. In one burst of his ever-growing superpowers and pent-up emotion, Vance lashed out at his abusive father and unintentionally killed him. Vance turned himself in and went to trial, charged with first degree murder and negligent homicide, and defended by attorney [[Foggy Nelson]]. The Thing was a [[character witness]] for Vance and helped establish the history of abuse that he suffered, as did Vance's mother, Norma; other testimony established the good he had done as a costumed hero and his increasing competence with his powers.  However, the prosecuting attorney pursued the latter angle, using testimony from Firestar and cross-examination of Norma Astrovik to establish that Vance could have used his powers to stop his father without lethal force.  Finally, in her closing argument, the prosecutor drew a gun on Vance and fired a (unknown to Vance) blank round.  Instinctively, Vance not only disarmed her, but reacted so precisely that he contained the actual smoke from the gun, driving home the prosecution's case; Vance was acquitted of murder, but was convicted of negligent homicide.  As a result of the trial, Vance's secret identity became public knowledge.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #20-25</ref>\n\nVance was sentenced to serve his time at the superhuman restraint facility known as the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. He was shown enjoying the occasional free walkabout on the long road-trip to the Vault, joking and playing around with the officers. When his friends Firestar, Namorita, and Nova showed up to free him, Vance protested, declaring he wished to serve his time. He also said he was going to be paroled in fourteen months, so they'd see him again, soon. Firestar, even though she tried to tough it out, was very torn up about it, but she realized what Vance wanted to do and decided to go on.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #26</ref> During his stay in the Vault, he was granted \"training periods\" with the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] on duty, determined to hone his abilities to prevent another incident like his father's death.  When a riot broke out over the perception of poor living conditions, Vance helped calm the riot by convincing the warden to allow the plant-based villain Terraformer, once part of the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]], access to a plant. Despite the warden's fears Terraformer would use it in an escape attempt, the villain simply enjoys it being with him. This serves to calm the ire of the other prisoners and it is agreed that, on a case-by-case basis, their living conditions would be examined to accommodate superhuman prisoners' unique needs.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #36</ref>\n\n===Justice===\nAfter his time in the Vault, he adopted the codename '''Justice'''. He briefly went undercover working with [[Shinobi Shaw]] to spy on the activities in the so-called \"Younghunt.\"\n\nWhen the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)#The First Sphinx|Sphinx]], a previous Warriors foe, dispersed members of the team throughout history, Vance encountered his father as an adolescent. He discovered that Arnold, his father, was a [[homosexual]] who was bullied into accepting a [[heterosexual]] lifestyle by his own abusive father. Understanding that his father was as much a victim as he was, Vance attempted to change history by threatening his grandfather, but stopped when he realized that he was, in his own way, perpetuating the cycle of violence handed down from father to son. Though history remained unchanged, this new knowledge allowed Vance to make a measure of peace with the memory of his father.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #47-49</ref>\n\nJustice spent some time in a leadership role with the New Warriors and talked about marriage with Firestar. This hit a snag when she learned her microwave powers might render her infertile.\n\n===The Avengers===\nA mystical incident had caused all those who were once Avengers to be targeted by creatures and monsters. Vance and Angelica accompanied their friend Rage, who had been an Avenger, to a meeting at Avengers Mansion. They willingly helped out in various ways before Morgan LeFay attacked, altering reality. Vance and Angelica were caught up in the literal mystical maelstrom and were turned into super-powered enforcers under the command of LeFay. However, several Avengers managed to break free of the control, based on their deep belief in the team itself. Vance found himself coming to his senses despite never being an Avenger, a fact that surprised the remaining heroes; thus, he joined the resistance.{{issue|date=October 2011}}\n\nAfter the threat of LeFay was ended and the two proved themselves by defeating [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] on their own, they managed to become Avengers.{{issue|date=October 2011}} Although he was thrilled to be living his lifelong dream of being an Avenger, Vance made some small rookie mistakes at first, stemming from a case of hero worship. However, he proved himself when he came up with a way to defeat the current plans of the current form (or forms) of the villain [[Ultron]], despite a broken leg.{{issue|date=October 2011}} Vance and Angelica then spent some time undercover investigating the [[Triune Understanding]], a cult-like movement with seemingly good intentions but a villainous leadership.{{issue|date=October 2011}}\n\nAfter the ''[[House of M]]'' ended, Justice and Firestar were unaffected by the [[Decimation (comics)|global depowerment of mutants]] and thus retained their powers.{{issue|date=October 2011}} Vance's wish for more in their relationship, opposed to Firestar's wish for less (being ages 22 and 19 respectively) ended their engagement, and their relationship.{{issue|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Civil War===\nJustice and former teammate [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] learned that people were hunting down former New Warriors members because of perceived blame for the deaths caused by [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] while fighting an incarnation of the team.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (July, 2006)</ref> They both sought out the legal services of Jennifer Walters ([[She-Hulk]]) in protecting the allies of the New Warriors, as their identities were already publicly exposed. They eventually discovered that former New Warriors member Carlton LaFroyge ([[Hindsight Lad|Hindsight]]) was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates, operating a website that was slowly outing the identities of the twenty or so remaining Warriors.\n\nBoth Rage and Justice refused to go along with the proposed super-human registration act. This is further evidenced when they join Captain America's Secret Avengers during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] as a result of the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]].<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4</ref>\n\n===The Initiative===\nAfter the Civil War, Justice was recruited by [[Iron Man]] to head the youth outreach arm of [[Fifty State Initiative|The Initiative]] superhero training program, based at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]. He is clearly unaware of some of the shadier aspects of the program, and is growing increasingly irritated by the Initiative \"Drill Sergeant\" [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]]'s constant demeaning and disparaging remarks about the deceased New Warriors.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref> During the investigation of former New Warriors members due to an attack upon Gauntlet, it was revealed to readers that Justice is currently secretly seeing [[Ultra Girl]], a trainee with the Initiative and former New Warriors associate.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #6</ref>\n\nJustice's personal investigation into the fate of Initiative recruit [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] opened his eyes to the morally ambiguous activities of the Initiative, instituted by Camp Hammond director [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. As a result, Justice apparently [[desertion|deserted]] from the Initiative to continue his investigation, and recruited Ultra Girl, Rage and other former New Warriors [[Debrii]] and [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] to his cause.<ref>''Avengers:The Initiative'' #10</ref> After a [[KIA (comics)|clone of MVP]] goes rogue and leaves the Initiative with major casualties, Justice and these former New Warriors, along with the two surviving Scarlet Spiders, officially inform Iron Man of their intention to quit the Initiative and act as [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]], a form of independent oversight for the program; as the group are all registered superhumans, Iron Man is unable to act against Justice's team unless they commit an illegal act. However, Ultra Girl decides to return to the Initiative, apparently ending her relationship with Justice.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>\n\n===Secret Invasion===\nDuring the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], Justice and Counter Force encounter [[Night Thrasher]] ([[Donyell Taylor]]) at the old New Warriors, looking for a DNA sample to prove whether or not the Night Thrasher that died at Stamford was a Skrull imposter. Counter Force initially believe that Donyell is a Skrull, due to his reluctance to reveal his identity, and comes into conflict with Donyell's New Warriors.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #15</ref> When Donyell finally reveals his identity, the two teams join together to storm the S.H.I.E.L.D.  helicarrier where the deceased New Warriors bodies were being held, and recover them. The corpse of Night Thrasher is proven to be of human composition, and the two teams bury the bodies outside the old base.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #16</ref>\n\n===Dark Reign===\nWhen [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], a deranged clone of Thor, attacks Camp Hammond, Counter Force (Now calling themselves \"The New Warriors\", and boasting Night Thrasher as a member) arrive to help.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> During the fight, Ragnarok kills one of the Scarlet Spiders, and nearly kills Vance, who is saved by Ultra Girl. After the battle, Vance retrieves the corpse of the original MVP, seeking to give him a proper burial.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref> However, their actions in exposing the duplicity to the public, allowed H.A.M.M.E.R. director, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to shut down Camp Hammond and reorganize the Initiative, placing villains on Initiative teams. The New Warriors rescue Gauntlet and Tigra from the Hood's gang and formed the Avengers Resistance.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24-25</ref>\n\n===Siege===\nThings hit the tipping point for the Resistance, when Osborn orchestrates a [[Siege (comics)|siege on Asgard]] by creating an incident similar to Stamford. Justice declares that while most of the Initiative is busy with the Siege, the Resistance will take down Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. in order to expose Osborn once and for all.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #32</ref>\n\n===Heroic Age===\nVance becomes one of the teaching staff of \"Avengers Academy\", alongside former Avengers teammates Hank Pym, Tigra, Quicksilver and former New Warriors teammate Speedball.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #1 (2010)</ref> One of his students, [[Veil (comics)|Veil]], has a secret crush on him until she finds out that he has renewed his relationship with [[Ultra Girl]]. His relationship with Ultra Girl is further complicated during the Avengers Academy Prom Night, when Firestar appears.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #13</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJustice is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses [[telekinesis]]. By using his powers to lift himself, he can levitate and fly at high speed. He has shown the ability to hold a large number of people. Initially, Justice's telekinesis was limited in its scope and using them at the peak level of his power would cause him headaches and nosebleeds.<ref>''New Warriors'' #1</ref><ref>''New Warriors'' #3</ref><ref>''New Warriors'' #5</ref> However, his powers later increased dramatically and he was no longer hindered by the physical symptoms he had once suffered from.<ref>''New Warriors'' #11-13</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nThe Vance Astrovik character in an [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate timeline]] became a founding member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], calling himself [[Vance Astro]]. Marvel has treated this as a separate character from the alternate Earth-691, and the two have even met on occasion.<ref>''New Warriors'' #68</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* On the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' [[animated series]], Justice makes a brief cameo at the beginning of the episode ''\"Doomsday\"'' flying alongside [[Darkhawk]] as the [[Silver Surfer]] passes by both of them.\n\n===Video games===\n* Justice appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by Sean Donnellan. He ends up under the control of the nanites and assists [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]] in fighting the heroes in Wakanda on the path to the Black Panther's palace.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.9381.MUA2_NPC_Spotlight~colon~_Firestar_and_Justice |title=Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2: NPC Spotlight on Firestar and Justice &#124; Marvel Heroes Games &#124; Games News &#124; News |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> He mentions his past and his relationship with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Avengers Academy}}\n{{Initiative}}\n{{New Warriors}}\n{{Avengers}}\n{{Avengers characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Astrovik, Vance}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Heck]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:Jewish superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who have mental powers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Avengers member, Vance Astrovik|the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate timeline]] member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]|Vance Astro}}\n{{Hatnote|This article is about the Avenger and New Warrior Justice.

He possesses the [[superhuman]] power of [[telekinesis]]. Astrovik has been affiliated with the [[New Warriors]] and [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|Giant-Size Defenders]]'' #5 (July, 1975) and was created by [[Don Heck]] and [[Gerry Conway]]\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nMore than a decade after his creation, Vance appeared first as a mainstay in the New Warriors and later in the third volume of the ''Avengers'' titles. He usually appeared with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], who was his girlfriend then later [[fiancee]].\n\nIn 1994, he had his own four issue limited series, ''Justice: Four Balance'' and appeared in the ''I (heart) Marvel: Masked Intentions'' oneshot in 2006.\n\nHe was a major character in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', early in the series.\n\nJustice appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug 2010) through issue #20 (Dec 2011).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nVance Astrovik was born in [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was visited as a teenager by an alternate, [[time travel]]ing version of his future self, Major [[Vance Astro]] of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], an [[astronaut]] who had volunteered for an experimental space flight and consequently been lost in space in [[cryonics|cryogenic suspension]] for a thousand years. The elder Vance Astro convinced his younger self to not become an astronaut, and in the process, sparked the premature emergence of the younger Vance's telekinetic powers. Due to the vagaries of time travel in the [[Marvel Universe]], this did not create a [[paradox]], but instead made the Guardians' future world into a parallel timeline, to which they later returned. Although Major Vance Astro had not had a chance to fully develop his psionic power in his time in [[NASA]], the younger Astrovik now had the opportunity to hone his power. Astrovik soon became the costumed crime-fighter '''Marvel Boy'''.\n\n===Early adventures===\nAfter his powers developed, Vance's father, Arnold, began to physically abuse him for being \"different\". Running away from home, Vance wound up supporting himself as a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] in the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]], a circuit for superhuman competitors. While wrestling as \"Manglin' John Mahoney\", he befriended Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who at the time was himself estranged from his \"family\", the [[Fantastic Four]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Eventually, Vance was convinced to return home, with assurances from his parents that the abuse would stop.{{issue|date=November 2012}}\n\n===New Warriors===\nWhen Marvel Boy was rejected for membership in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by [[Captain America]], he helped found a team of teenage superheroes, the [[New Warriors]], led by the new hero [[Night Thrasher]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #1</ref> He had many intense times during this early period, such as a fight against the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 1 #10</ref> and the immortal villain [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]].{{Issue|date=March 2012}} At the same time, Vance developed friendships with the other Warriors, and a romantic relationship with teammate [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]],{{Issue|date=March 2012}} and his powers increased both in strength and skill.

''Out in psychology: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref> Now it also includes [[Bisexuality|Bisexual]] and [[Transgender]] identities and behaviours. In addition, the \"Q\" stands for [[Queer]] which includes [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]] and [[Sexual behaviour|behaviours]] that go beyond traditional sex and gender labels, roles and expectations.<ref name=\":2\">Peel, E.

In the UK, the acronym [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] is widely used. In contrast, in the USA, [[LGBT]] is more commonly used. The terms '[[lesbian]]', '[[gay]]', '[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]', '[[Transgender|trans]]' and '[[queer]]' are not used all around the world and definitions vary.\n\nApart from the terms above, there are other words and phrases that are used to define [[sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. These words and phrases typically come from [[western culture]]s. In contrast, in non-western cultures, the range of sexual and gender identities and practices are labelled and categorized using different languages, which naturally also involve different concepts compared to Western ones.\n\nIt is concerned with the study of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] \u2013 [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]] and [[Sexual behaviour|behaviours]] \u2013 thereby validating their unique identities and experiences. This research focus is affirmative for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as it challenges prejudiced beliefs and attitudes and discriminatory policies and practices towards the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Herek, G.

In raising this awareness, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology aims to be one of the fields in which inclusive, non-heterosexist, non-genderist approaches are applied in psychological research and practice.<ref name=\":0\" /> In line with [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology being an inclusive field of study and practice, it welcomes scholars or professionals from any branch of psychology with an interest in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] research.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Alfred Kinsey (5493900781).jpg|thumb|333px|[[Alfred Kinsey]].]]\n\n=== Sexology ===\n[[Sexology]] is a part of the historical foundation upon which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology was built.<ref name=\":2\" /> The work of early sexologists, in particular those who contributed to the establishment of [[sexology]] as a scientific field of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Androgyny|gender ambiguity]], is highly relevant and seminal to the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology.\n\nAs previously mentioned, [[sexology]] is a scientific field of study focusing on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. In the field of [[sexology]], a broad classification spectrum known as inversion, is used to define [[homosexuality]]. On this spectrum, early sexologists included both '[[Homosexuality|same-sex sexuality]]' and 'cross-gender identification' as belonging to this all-inclusive category. More contemporary sexology researchers conceptualize and categorize [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender diversity]] separately. In terms of [[LGBT|LGB]] sexualities, this would fall under [[sexual diversity]]. As for [[transsexual]]ity, this would be placed under [[gender diversity]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Important figures in this field include [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]].\n\n=== The historical emergence of 'gay affirmative' psychology ===\nGay affirmative psychology was first established in the 1970s. It was founded with the mission of 1) challenging the idea and view of [[homosexuality]] as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and 2) affirming the normal and healthy psychological functioning of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] individuals by dispelling beliefs and attitudes of [[homosexuality]] being associated with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].<ref>Brown, L. S. (1989). New voices, new visions: Toward a lesbian/gay paradigm for psychology. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 13''(4), 445\u2013458.</ref>\n\nFollowing this field's mission, most of the research conducted in this area has naturally looked at the pathologization of homosexuality. In relation to this, much attention has also been placed on [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and non-trans individuals' lived experiences.\n\nBy involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, mainstream psychological research could be more inclusive. With this in mind, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychologists hold the firm belief that psychology can truly be called the 'psychology of people' if it includes an open-minded, accepting attitude towards examining individuals from all backgrounds and their diverse lived experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the name ''gay affirmative psychology'' changed to [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] psychology to denote that this branch of psychology spanned both the lives and experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian women]].<ref>Clarke, V., & Peel, E. (2007). From lesbian and gay psychology to LGBTQ psychologies: A journey into the unknown (or unknownable)? In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Later on, additional terms were included in the name of this field. Variations of LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ or LGBTQI are used to refer to the field of LGBTQ psychology.\n\nDue to the variation in the terminology to define this field, it has led to significant discussion and debate regarding which term is the most inclusive of all individuals. Though there continues to be ongoing debate surrounding the terminology used to define the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology, this in fact highlights the field's concern over the diversity in [[human sexuality]] and gender orientation. Further, the various letters within the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] acronym indicates the diversity and variation in the scope of research that is conducted within the field \u2013 namely the types of research questions and the types of methodological approaches used to address these questions.\n\nTraditionally, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has largely focused on researching the experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian]] women meeting the following criteria:<ref>Riggs, D. W. (2007). Recognizing race in LGBTQ psychology: Power, privilege and complicity. In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref>\n\n# Young\n# Caucasian\n# Middle-class\n# Healthy\n# Residing in urban areas\n\nThe scope of research within the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has been somewhat lacking in breadth and diversity, neglecting the experiences of those who do not fit the above stated criteria but who also rightly belong to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].\n\nOverall, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology is a sub-discipline of psychology that incorporates multiple perspectives and approaches regarding the populations of study, topics of research, as well as the theories and methodologies that inform the ways in which this research is carried out.\n\n=== The historical emergence of critical psychology ===\nThe emergence of the field of [[critical psychology]] has led to the establishment of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] divisions within several key professional psychological associations.\n\nFirstly, within the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA),  Division 44 is known as the Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Issues. Secondly, within the [[Australian Psychological Society]], there is a Gay and Lesbian Issues and Psychology Interest Group. Thirdly, within the [[British Psychological Society]], there is a Psychology of Sexualities Section. Lastly, within the [[Canadian Psychological Association]], there is a Section on Sexual Orientation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAll the above divisions specializing in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology research and research-related issues demonstrate the increasing recognition and status of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology in major psychological organizations covering the English speaking world.\n\n=== Mental health ===\n{{See also|Mental health inequality}}\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experience a significant amount of stigma and [[discrimination]] at various stages of their lives. Often this [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] persists throughout their lifetime. Specific acts of [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals include physical and [[sexual harassment]]. [[Hate crime]]s are also included.<ref name=\":4\">Bohan, J. (1996). ''Psychology and sexual orientation: Coming to terms.'' New York: Routledge.</ref> These negative experiences put [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' physical and emotional well-being at risk. As a result of these experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals typically experience a higher frequency of [[mental health]] issues compared to those who do not belong to the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] population.<ref>Amadio, D. M., & Chung, Y. B. (2004). Internalized homophobia and substance use among lesbina, gay, and bisexual persons. ''Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services: Issues in Practice, Policy and Research, 17''(1), 83\u2013101.</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe following list shows the different mental health issues that LGBTQ individuals may experience:\n* [[Anxiety]]\n* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]\n* [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]\n* [[Phobia|Phobic disorder]]\n* [[Psychological trauma|Trauma]]\n* [[Substance abuse]]\n*[[Self-harm]]ing behaviors\n* Suicidal tendencies and [[suicide]]\nThe list above is by no means complete or exhaustive, rather it shows the range and severity of the issues that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals often experience. These issues usually result from a combination of negative experiences and a perpetual difficulty accepting their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity in an anti-LGBTQ society.<ref>Cochran, S. D. (2001). Emerging issues in research on lesbians' and gay men's mental health: Does sexual orientation really matter? American Psychologist, 56(11), 931\u2013947. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.56.11.931</nowiki></ref>\n\n[[File:Taunting 0001.jpg|thumb]]\nSuicidal tendencies and suicide [[LGBT youth vulnerability|are serious issues for LGBTQ]] youth. Compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth typically engage in a higher rate (around 3 to 4 times higher) of [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicides]]. In school, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth have a higher likelihood of experiencing [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] due to their [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[Gender expression|expression]]. [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth quickly learn from these negative social experiences that they are more likely to receive negative judgment and treatment, and often rejection, from those around them. This becomes a vicious cycle in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youths' self-beliefs and self-perceptions are negatively reinforced by society. Evidently, the high rates of mental health issues among [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] communities has been perpetuated, and continues to be so, by systemic prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals.<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C.; Ream, G. L. (2003). \"Suicide attempts among sexual-minority male youth\". ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology''. '''32''' (4): 509\u2013522. doi:10.1207/s15374424jccp3204_3</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals do not necessarily experience the same types of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]], nor do they respond in the same ways to [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]]. What is common are the reasons leading to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]. In the context of LGBTQ-targeted [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], it broadly relates to [[sexual orientation]] issues (e.g. LGB) or [[gender identity]] issues (e.g. transgender). Systemic [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] leads to [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experiencing substantial amounts of stress on a long term basis. It also influences [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to internally assimilate all the negativity they receive, emphasizing the differences they have with others. This, in turn, causes [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to experience guilt and shame regarding their identity, feelings and actions.<ref>Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129(5), 674\u2013697. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674</nowiki></ref>\n\nThe '[[coming out]]' process involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals can also create a lot of added pressure from [[family]], peers and [[society]]. This process is about [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals openly proclaiming their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] to others.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals also experience other negative outcomes, for example:\n\n[[Sexual orientation]] and/or [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]]\n[[Internalized oppression]] of [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]]\n* Exclusion and ostracization\n* Removed or reduced [[family]] or [[social support]]\n* Facilitating [[mental health]] well-being for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is a highly pertinent matter.\nThe main factors in promoting positive [[mental health]] for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals are as follows:<ref>Monsen, J. J., & Bayley, S. (2007). Educational psychology practice with LGB youth in schools: Individual and institutional interventions. In V. Clarke and E.

Since 2000 the average age of '[[coming out]]' was around 14. This age compared to the average age of 16 recorded between 1996 and 1998, and 20 during the 1970s, shows that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are comfortably recognizing their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] at an earlier age. Based on the large aggregate of research on identity development, in particular [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]], it appears that young people have an awareness of their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity from an early age. This awareness can be observed starting in [[childhood]], specifically the feeling of being different from their peers and non-normative appearances, behaviours and interests.\n\nDuring adolescence, there are gradual shifts in young people's attitudes and behaviours regarding themselves and others. At the beginning of [[adolescence]], young people are more aware of, and concerned about how they and others present against [[Gender norms|gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] norms. In the middle of [[adolescence]], young people tend to hold more biased, stereotypical attitudes and show more negative behaviours towards [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals and topics. It is clear that the early adolescence years make it easy for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth who have '[[Coming out|come out]]' to have negative or unpleasant social experiences. These experiences could involve peers intentionally excluding them from friendship groups, peers engaging in persistent, harmful acts of [[bullying]], and more.<ref>Goldman, L. (2007). Coming out, coming in: Nurturing the well-being and inclusion of gay youth in mainstream society. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile there appears to be more and more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth '[[coming out]]' about their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] and [[Gender identity|gender identities]], there are also youth who do not \"[[Coming out|come out]]\" and are against the idea of '[[coming out]]'. Thus far, psychological theory surrounding [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity development suggests that individuals who do not '[[Coming out|come out]]', or are against the idea of '[[coming out]]' are either in denial about their identity or wish to '[[Coming out|come out]]' but are unable to. Aside from the fact that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are more vulnerable to experiencing negative social reactions and treatment as a result of '[[coming out]]',<ref name=\":4\" /> there may also be other reasons for this. Firstly, the higher visibility of diverse sexualities and [[Gender identity|gender identities]] could influence young people in becoming more reluctant towards concretely defining their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C. (2005). ''The new gay teenager.'' Cambridge, MA: harvard University Press.</ref>(Savin-Williams, 2005). Young people are turning away from these types of labels in opposition of [[social identity]] labels, demonstrating the importance of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]] within their [[personal identity]].<ref>Cohler, B. J., & Hammack, P. L. (2007). The psychological world of the gay teenager: Social change, narrative, and 'normality'. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36''(1), 47\u201359.</ref> As well, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals from [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[cultural minority]] groups refrain from using [[sexual identity]] labels, which they see as westernized concepts that do not relate to them.<ref>Chan, C. S. (1996). Don't ask, don't tell, don't know: Sexual identity and expression among East Asian-American lesbians. In B. Zimmerman and [[Toni A. H. McNaron]] (Eds.), ''The New Lesbian Studies: Into the Twenty-First Century'' (pp.91\u201397). New York: The Feminist Press.</ref>\n\n== Schools ==\n\nCurrent data regarding [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] and their children show an increasing number of such families, as in the United States of America, and suggests that this number is continuously increasing.<ref>Byard, E., Kosciw, J., & Bartkiewicz, M. (2013). Schools and LGBT-parent families: Creating change through programming and advocacy. In A. Goldberg & K. ALlen (Eds.), ''LGBT-Parent Families''. New York, NY: Springer</ref> Children of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents are at risk of being the targets of [[discrimination]] and [[violence]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals in the education system.<ref name=\":5\">Amato, P. R. (2012). The well-being of children with gay and lesbian parents. ''Social Science Research, 41'', 771\u2013774.</ref> Therefore, this is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure the [[Physical well-being|physical]] and [[psychological well-being]] of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Apart from children of [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] having negative school experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents also face challenges with regards to anti-LGBTQ bias and related negative behaviours that are often a part of the [[school climate]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|310x310px|Gay-Straight Alliance]]\n\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents can refer to the following strategies to facilitate a more safe, positive and welcoming experience in interacting with schools and school personnel: school choice, engagement and advocacy. Many schools are not particularly inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as anti-LGBTQ language is often used and cases of [[harassment]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] with regards to [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] often occur. Therefore, parental choice of the school in which their child enrolls is crucial. As far as parents are able to select a school for their child, selecting a school that is inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is one way to ensure a more positive school experience for themselves and for their children. Parental engagement with schools in terms of volunteering and other forms of involvement, such as being on parent-teacher organizations, allows [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents to be more involved in issues which may concern their child. Parents can access resources that provide information on how parents can facilitate dialogue and collaboration with teachers and schools, enabling them to become proactive advocates of their child's education and school experience.<ref>Kosciw, J.G., & Diaz, E.M. ( 2008). Involved, invisible, ignored: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents and their children in our nation's K-12 schools. New, NY York: GLSEN</ref>\n\nSchool-based interventions are also effective in improving the experiences of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Typically, these interventions target [[school climate]], in particular the aspects which pertain to [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Enforcing [[anti-bullying legislation|anti-bullying]]/harassment policies and laws in schools can protect students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] from being victims of [[bullying]] and [[harassment]]. Having these policies in place generally allows students to have fewer negative experiences in school, such as a lower likelihood of mistreatment by teachers and other students. Implementing professional development opportunities for school staff on how to provide appropriate support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] will not only facilitate a more positive school experience for students, but will in turn, lead to a more positive [[school climate]] in general. Using an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum where [[LGBT history|LGBTQ individuals, history and events]] are portrayed in a more positive manner allows students to become more aware and more accepting of LGBTQ-related issues. Specific ways in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] matters can be incorporated into the curriculum include: talking about diverse families (e.g. [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and [[LGBT families|LGBTQ parents]]), discussing [[LGBT history|LGBTQ history]] (e.g. talking about significant historical events and movements related to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]]), using LGBTQ-inclusive texts in class and celebrating [[List of LGBT events|LGBTQ events]] (e.g. [[LGBT History Month|LGBTQ History Month]] in October or [[LGBT Pride Month|LGBTQ Pride Month]] in June). On top of this, organizing [[LGBT student organizations|LGBTQ student clubs]] (e.g. [[Gay\u2013straight alliance|Gay-Straight Alliances]]) are a positive resource and source of support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]].<ref>Hutton, S.

For example, parents had time to think through how they felt about their child's LGB orientation, and be made aware of how their responses towards their child could potentially reflect attitudes of devaluation.

In the UK, the acronym [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] is widely used. In contrast, in the USA, [[LGBT]] is more commonly used. The terms '[[lesbian]]', '[[gay]]', '[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]', '[[Transgender|trans]]' and '[[queer]]' are not used all around the world and definitions vary.\n\nApart from the terms above, there are other words and phrases that are used to define [[sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. These words and phrases typically come from [[western culture]]s. In contrast, in non-western cultures, the range of sexual and gender identities and practices are labelled and categorized using different languages, which naturally also involve different concepts compared to Western ones.\n\nIt is concerned with the study of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] \u2013 [[Sexual identity|sexual identities]] and [[Sexual behaviour|behaviours]] \u2013 thereby validating their unique identities and experiences. This research focus is affirmative for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as it challenges prejudiced beliefs and attitudes and discriminatory policies and practices towards the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Herek, G.

In raising this awareness, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology aims to be one of the fields in which inclusive, non-heterosexist, non-genderist approaches are applied in psychological research and practice.<ref name=\":0\" /> In line with [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology being an inclusive field of study and practice, it welcomes scholars or professionals from any branch of psychology with an interest in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] research.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Alfred Kinsey (5493900781).jpg|thumb|333px|[[Alfred Kinsey]].]]\n\n=== Sexology ===\n[[Sexology]] is a part of the historical foundation upon which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology was built.<ref name=\":2\" /> The work of early sexologists, in particular those who contributed to the establishment of [[sexology]] as a scientific field of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[Androgyny|gender ambiguity]], is highly relevant and seminal to the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology.\n\nAs previously mentioned, [[sexology]] is a scientific field of study focusing on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]. In the field of [[sexology]], a broad classification spectrum known as inversion, is used to define [[homosexuality]]. On this spectrum, early sexologists included both '[[Homosexuality|same-sex sexuality]]' and 'cross-gender identification' as belonging to this all-inclusive category. More contemporary sexology researchers conceptualize and categorize [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender diversity]] separately. In terms of [[LGBT|LGB]] sexualities, this would fall under [[sexual diversity]]. As for [[transsexual]]ity, this would be placed under [[gender diversity]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Important figures in this field include [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]].\n\n=== The historical emergence of 'gay affirmative' psychology ===\nGay affirmative psychology was first established in the 1970s. It was founded with the mission of 1) challenging the idea and view of [[homosexuality]] as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and 2) affirming the normal and healthy psychological functioning of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] individuals by dispelling beliefs and attitudes of [[homosexuality]] being associated with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].<ref>Brown, L. S. (1989). New voices, new visions: Toward a lesbian/gay paradigm for psychology. ''Psychology of Women Quarterly, 13''(4), 445\u2013458.</ref>\n\nFollowing this field's mission, most of the research conducted in this area has naturally looked at the pathologization of homosexuality. In relation to this, much attention has also been placed on [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and non-trans individuals' lived experiences.\n\nBy involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, mainstream psychological research could be more inclusive. With this in mind, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychologists hold the firm belief that psychology can truly be called the 'psychology of people' if it includes an open-minded, accepting attitude towards examining individuals from all backgrounds and their diverse lived experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1980s, the name ''gay affirmative psychology'' changed to [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] psychology to denote that this branch of psychology spanned both the lives and experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian women]].<ref>Clarke, V., & Peel, E. (2007). From lesbian and gay psychology to LGBTQ psychologies: A journey into the unknown (or unknownable)? In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Later on, additional terms were included in the name of this field. Variations of LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ or LGBTQI are used to refer to the field of LGBTQ psychology.\n\nDue to the variation in the terminology to define this field, it has led to significant discussion and debate regarding which term is the most inclusive of all individuals. Though there continues to be ongoing debate surrounding the terminology used to define the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology, this in fact highlights the field's concern over the diversity in [[human sexuality]] and gender orientation. Further, the various letters within the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] acronym indicates the diversity and variation in the scope of research that is conducted within the field \u2013 namely the types of research questions and the types of methodological approaches used to address these questions.\n\nTraditionally, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has largely focused on researching the experiences of [[Human male sexuality|gay men]] and [[lesbian]] women meeting the following criteria:<ref>Riggs, D. W. (2007). Recognizing race in LGBTQ psychology: Power, privilege and complicity. In V. Clarke and E. Peel (Eds.), ''Out in Psychology: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer Perspectives.'' Chichester, UK: Wiley.</ref>\n\n# Young\n# Caucasian\n# Middle-class\n# Healthy\n# Residing in urban areas\n\nThe scope of research within the field of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology has been somewhat lacking in breadth and diversity, neglecting the experiences of those who do not fit the above stated criteria but who also rightly belong to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]].\n\nOverall, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology is a sub-discipline of psychology that incorporates multiple perspectives and approaches regarding the populations of study, topics of research, as well as the theories and methodologies that inform the ways in which this research is carried out.\n\n=== The historical emergence of critical psychology ===\nThe emergence of the field of [[critical psychology]] has led to the establishment of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] divisions within several key professional psychological associations.\n\nFirstly, within the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA),  Division 44 is known as the Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Issues. Secondly, within the [[Australian Psychological Society]], there is a Gay and Lesbian Issues and Psychology Interest Group. Thirdly, within the [[British Psychological Society]], there is a Psychology of Sexualities Section. Lastly, within the [[Canadian Psychological Association]], there is a Section on Sexual Orientation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAll the above divisions specializing in [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology research and research-related issues demonstrate the increasing recognition and status of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] psychology in major psychological organizations covering the English speaking world.\n\n=== Mental health ===\n{{See also|Mental health inequality}}\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experience a significant amount of stigma and [[discrimination]] at various stages of their lives. Often this [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] persists throughout their lifetime. Specific acts of [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals include physical and [[sexual harassment]]. [[Hate crime]]s are also included.<ref name=\":4\">Bohan, J. (1996). ''Psychology and sexual orientation: Coming to terms.'' New York: Routledge.</ref> These negative experiences put [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals' physical and emotional well-being at risk. As a result of these experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals typically experience a higher frequency of [[mental health]] issues compared to those who do not belong to the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] population.<ref>Amadio, D. M., & Chung, Y. B. (2004). Internalized homophobia and substance use among lesbina, gay, and bisexual persons.

These issues usually result from a combination of negative experiences and a perpetual difficulty accepting their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity in an anti-LGBTQ society.<ref>Cochran, S. D. (2001). Emerging issues in research on lesbians' and gay men's mental health: Does sexual orientation really matter? American Psychologist, 56(11), 931\u2013947. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.56.11.931</nowiki></ref>\n\n[[File:Taunting 0001.jpg|thumb]]\nSuicidal tendencies and suicide [[LGBT youth vulnerability|are serious issues for LGBTQ]] youth. Compared to their non-LGBTQ peers, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth typically engage in a higher rate (around 3 to 4 times higher) of [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicides]]. In school, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth have a higher likelihood of experiencing [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] due to their [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[Gender expression|expression]]. [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth quickly learn from these negative social experiences that they are more likely to receive negative judgment and treatment, and often rejection, from those around them. This becomes a vicious cycle in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youths' self-beliefs and self-perceptions are negatively reinforced by society. Evidently, the high rates of mental health issues among [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] communities has been perpetuated, and continues to be so, by systemic prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals.<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C.; Ream, G. L. (2003). \"Suicide attempts among sexual-minority male youth\". ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology''. '''32''' (4): 509\u2013522. doi:10.1207/s15374424jccp3204_3</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals do not necessarily experience the same types of [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]], nor do they respond in the same ways to [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]]. What is common are the reasons leading to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]. In the context of LGBTQ-targeted [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], it broadly relates to [[sexual orientation]] issues (e.g. LGB) or [[gender identity]] issues (e.g. transgender). Systemic [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] leads to [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals experiencing substantial amounts of stress on a long term basis. It also influences [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to internally assimilate all the negativity they receive, emphasizing the differences they have with others. This, in turn, causes [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals to experience guilt and shame regarding their identity, feelings and actions.<ref>Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129(5), 674\u2013697. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674</nowiki></ref>\n\nThe '[[coming out]]' process involving [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals can also create a lot of added pressure from [[family]], peers and [[society]]. This process is about [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals openly proclaiming their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]] to others.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals also experience other negative outcomes, for example:\n\n[[Sexual orientation]] and/or [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]]\n[[Internalized oppression]] of [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]]\n* Exclusion and ostracization\n* Removed or reduced [[family]] or [[social support]]\n* Facilitating [[mental health]] well-being for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is a highly pertinent matter.\nThe main factors in promoting positive [[mental health]] for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals are as follows:<ref>Monsen, J. J., & Bayley, S. (2007). Educational psychology practice with LGB youth in schools: Individual and institutional interventions. In V. Clarke and E.

Since 2000 the average age of '[[coming out]]' was around 14. This age compared to the average age of 16 recorded between 1996 and 1998, and 20 during the 1970s, shows that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are comfortably recognizing their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] at an earlier age. Based on the large aggregate of research on identity development, in particular [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]], it appears that young people have an awareness of their [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity from an early age. This awareness can be observed starting in [[childhood]], specifically the feeling of being different from their peers and non-normative appearances, behaviours and interests.\n\nDuring adolescence, there are gradual shifts in young people's attitudes and behaviours regarding themselves and others. At the beginning of [[adolescence]], young people are more aware of, and concerned about how they and others present against [[Gender norms|gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] norms. In the middle of [[adolescence]], young people tend to hold more biased, stereotypical attitudes and show more negative behaviours towards [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals and topics. It is clear that the early adolescence years make it easy for [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth who have '[[Coming out|come out]]' to have negative or unpleasant social experiences. These experiences could involve peers intentionally excluding them from friendship groups, peers engaging in persistent, harmful acts of [[bullying]], and more.<ref>Goldman, L. (2007). Coming out, coming in: Nurturing the well-being and inclusion of gay youth in mainstream society. New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile there appears to be more and more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth '[[coming out]]' about their [[Sexual identity|sexual]] and [[Gender identity|gender identities]], there are also youth who do not \"[[Coming out|come out]]\" and are against the idea of '[[coming out]]'. Thus far, psychological theory surrounding [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] identity development suggests that individuals who do not '[[Coming out|come out]]', or are against the idea of '[[coming out]]' are either in denial about their identity or wish to '[[Coming out|come out]]' but are unable to. Aside from the fact that [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] youth are more vulnerable to experiencing negative social reactions and treatment as a result of '[[coming out]]',<ref name=\":4\" /> there may also be other reasons for this. Firstly, the higher visibility of diverse sexualities and [[Gender identity|gender identities]] could influence young people in becoming more reluctant towards concretely defining their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]<ref>Savin-Williams, R. C. (2005). ''The new gay teenager.'' Cambridge, MA: harvard University Press.</ref>(Savin-Williams, 2005). Young people are turning away from these types of labels in opposition of [[social identity]] labels, demonstrating the importance of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender identity]] within their [[personal identity]].<ref>Cohler, B. J., & Hammack, P. L. (2007). The psychological world of the gay teenager: Social change, narrative, and 'normality'. ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36''(1), 47\u201359.</ref> As well, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals from [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[cultural minority]] groups refrain from using [[sexual identity]] labels, which they see as westernized concepts that do not relate to them.<ref>Chan, C. S. (1996). Don't ask, don't tell, don't know: Sexual identity and expression among East Asian-American lesbians. In B. Zimmerman and [[Toni A. H. McNaron]] (Eds.), ''The New Lesbian Studies: Into the Twenty-First Century'' (pp.91\u201397). New York: The Feminist Press.</ref>\n\n== Schools ==\n\nCurrent data regarding [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] and their children show an increasing number of such families, as in the United States of America, and suggests that this number is continuously increasing.<ref>Byard, E., Kosciw, J., & Bartkiewicz, M. (2013). Schools and LGBT-parent families: Creating change through programming and advocacy. In A. Goldberg & K. ALlen (Eds.), ''LGBT-Parent Families''. New York, NY: Springer</ref> Children of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents are at risk of being the targets of [[discrimination]] and [[violence]] against [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals in the education system.<ref name=\":5\">Amato, P. R. (2012). The well-being of children with gay and lesbian parents. ''Social Science Research, 41'', 771\u2013774.</ref> Therefore, this is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure the [[Physical well-being|physical]] and [[psychological well-being]] of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Apart from children of [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] having negative school experiences, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents also face challenges with regards to anti-LGBTQ bias and related negative behaviours that are often a part of the [[school climate]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:GSAboard.JPG|thumb|310x310px|Gay-Straight Alliance]]\n\n[[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents can refer to the following strategies to facilitate a more safe, positive and welcoming experience in interacting with schools and school personnel: school choice, engagement and advocacy. Many schools are not particularly inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals, as anti-LGBTQ language is often used and cases of [[harassment]] and [[Victimology|victimization]] with regards to [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] often occur. Therefore, parental choice of the school in which their child enrolls is crucial. As far as parents are able to select a school for their child, selecting a school that is inclusive of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] individuals is one way to ensure a more positive school experience for themselves and for their children. Parental engagement with schools in terms of volunteering and other forms of involvement, such as being on parent-teacher organizations, allows [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] parents to be more involved in issues which may concern their child. Parents can access resources that provide information on how parents can facilitate dialogue and collaboration with teachers and schools, enabling them to become proactive advocates of their child's education and school experience.<ref>Kosciw, J.G., & Diaz, E.M. ( 2008). Involved, invisible, ignored: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents and their children in our nation's K-12 schools. New, NY York: GLSEN</ref>\n\nSchool-based interventions are also effective in improving the experiences of children from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]]. Typically, these interventions target [[school climate]], in particular the aspects which pertain to [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Enforcing [[anti-bullying legislation|anti-bullying]]/harassment policies and laws in schools can protect students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] from being victims of [[bullying]] and [[harassment]]. Having these policies in place generally allows students to have fewer negative experiences in school, such as a lower likelihood of mistreatment by teachers and other students. Implementing professional development opportunities for school staff on how to provide appropriate support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]] will not only facilitate a more positive school experience for students, but will in turn, lead to a more positive [[school climate]] in general. Using an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum where [[LGBT history|LGBTQ individuals, history and events]] are portrayed in a more positive manner allows students to become more aware and more accepting of LGBTQ-related issues. Specific ways in which [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] matters can be incorporated into the curriculum include: talking about diverse families (e.g. [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and [[LGBT families|LGBTQ parents]]), discussing [[LGBT history|LGBTQ history]] (e.g. talking about significant historical events and movements related to the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]]), using LGBTQ-inclusive texts in class and celebrating [[List of LGBT events|LGBTQ events]] (e.g. [[LGBT History Month|LGBTQ History Month]] in October or [[LGBT Pride Month|LGBTQ Pride Month]] in June). On top of this, organizing [[LGBT student organizations|LGBTQ student clubs]] (e.g. [[Gay\u2013straight alliance|Gay-Straight Alliances]]) are a positive resource and source of support for students from [[LGBT families|LGBTQ families]].<ref>Hutton, S.

She is a foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men]].\n\n== Publication history ==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nViper was created by [[Jim Steranko]] and first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #110 (February 1969).\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nOphelia Sarkissian was orphaned as a child in [[Hungary]]. Part of her face was scarred at one time, although it has since been healed. Among twelve other girls, Ophelia was taken in by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and raised by [[Kraken (character)#Daniel Whitehall|Kraken]]. For twenty-two years, Ophelia excelled and became Kraken's best student.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #15</ref> She eventually rose through the ranks of Hydra and frequently came into conflict with [[Captain America]] and the organization known as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She first appeared as a leader of Hydra under the codename [[Madame Hydra]], and first fought and captured Captain America while trying to contaminate New York City's water supply.<ref>''Captain America'' #110</ref> She captured [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to bait a trap for Captain America,<ref>''Captain America'' #111</ref> and then subdued the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with gas, planning to bury them alive, and battled Captain America again. However she was apparently killed when Captain America and Rick Jones dodged missiles she fired at them and she was caught in their explosion.<ref>''Captain America'' #113</ref> Some time later, it was revealed that the [[Space Phantom]] had exchanged places with her, and her whereabouts at the time were undisclosed.<ref>''Avengers'' #107</ref>\n\nShe severed ties with Hydra.<ref>''Captain America'' #170 (February, 1974)</ref> Madame Hydra helped Jordan Stryke, a [[supervillain]] codenamed [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], escape custody in [[Virginia]], only to proceed in [[Assassination|assassinating]] him, and usurping his codename and leadership of the group known as the [[Serpent Squad]].<ref>''Captain America'' #180 (December 1974)</ref> As the new Viper, she kidnapped [[Roxxon Oil|Roxxon]] president [[Hugh Jones (comics)|Hugh Jones]], in order to put him in thrall of the [[Serpent Crown]]. She battled [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] and [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner.<ref>''Captain America'' #181-182</ref> Viper was the founder and leader of the elite criminal underworld through sheer ruthlessness, treachery, and the cunning of her black heart.\n\nViper took over the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], and planned to crash it into the Congress building. She employed [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] as operatives, and battled [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Shang-Chi]], and [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #83-85</ref> Viper later employed the Silver Samurai as her chief operative, and attempted to kidnap Michael Kramer, a man carrying a fatal experimental disease, in order to release it on America. The Viper battled the first [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and became convinced that she was Merriem Drew. Drew was the mother of Spider-Woman and was considered deceased since 1931. The issue revealed Merriem had become allied to Chthon and was granted longevity in return. The Viper revealed herself to have been a pawn of Chthon for fifty years, but saved Spider-Woman's life by defying Chthon.<ref>''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #42-#44 (February&nbsp;\u2013 June, 1982)</ref> Viper, employing [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] as her chief operative, captured Spider-Woman, believing she was responsible for making her think they were related. It was revealed that Chthon had actually granted Viper [[False memory syndrome|false memories]] of mothering Jessica as part of a plan to place both women under his control. Viper captured Captain America, and planned to release her new bubonic plague.<ref>''Captain America'' #281-283 (May\u2013July, 1983)</ref> Whether Viper actually has extraordinary longevity was left uncertain.\n\nEmploying the Silver Samurai, Viper attempted to coerce [[Thunderiders|Team America]] into stealing the cavourite crystal, and then battled the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #5-6</ref> In one of her many terrorist acts, she would try to gain control of the snake-themed organization called the [[Serpent Society]], with [[Slither (comics)|Slither]], [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-De-Lance]], and [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]] as her operatives. The latter four operatives infiltrated the Serpent Society in an attempt to take it over. Viper dispatched [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]], [[Boomslang (comics)|Boomslang]], and Copperhead to poison Washington D.C.'s water supply with a snake mutagen. Viper terrorized the White House and the President, and battled Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-344</ref> She attempted to assassinate the organization's former leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], but she was betrayed by Cobra and arrested by [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Viper was later freed from prison by [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]]. She used a snake mutagen on drug addicts, and then battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #2</ref> She then turned against and battled Tyrannus.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #4</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra has also had conflict with the [[X-Men]]. She first came into contact with them upon trying to assassinate [[Mariko Yashida]] on behalf of her ally and presumed lover [[Silver Samurai]], and tried to poison the team while disguised as Mariko's unconscious maid.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172, August 1983</ref> She nearly killed X-Men members [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] on two separate occasions, with Storm being nearly killed by Viper during the invasion of [[Khan (comics)|Khan]].<ref name=\"X-Treme X-Men #11\">''X-Treme X-Men'' #11</ref> She also faced the [[New Mutants]] and was considered responsible for the presumed demise of [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] (Karma was only wounded and was abducted by the [[Shadow King]] for his own reasons).<ref>''New Mutants'' #6, August 1983</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra is a professional [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and has her own organization. She has come into conflict with many superheroes and supervillains over the years. Her [[nihilism]] and tendency to spread death around her has made it hard for other villains to associate with her. Only the [[Red Skull]] has found it a charming tendency and pursued a relationship with her for a while. The relationship ended when the Skull found out Viper was using his resources to finance massacres with no apparent financial benefit for either of them.<ref>''Captain America'' #419, September 1993</ref>\n\nFor a time the Viper employed a team of doppelg\u00e4ngers (known as \"Pit-Vipers\") to impersonate her. However, acting on her own, Pit-Viper 12<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/pitviper.htm|Pit-Viper}}</ref> became involved with the [[Punisher]] during an international crime conference in Las Vegas<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #45-47, August\u2013October 1992</ref> and later tipped off S.H.I.E.L.D. to the real Viper's attempt to steal Russian nuclear missiles in Moscow.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol. 2 #45, March 1993</ref> For compromising her anonymity, the Viper personally killed her treacherous double.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #15, August 1993</ref>\n\nLater she blackmailed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into marrying her as a means to secure her criminal empire in [[Madripoor]]. Although this was a marriage of convenience, she did request to consummate the arrangement. Some time later, her body was briefly inhabited by the spirit of [[Ogun (Marvel Comics)|Ogun]], and Wolverine mortally wounded her as a means of driving the spirit from her dying body. In return for seeking medical attention to save her life, Wolverine demanded a divorce.<ref>''Wolverine'' # 125</ref> It is later implied that she actually had feelings for Wolverine.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nViper was then a member of an incarnation of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], working with [[Sat-Yr-9|Courtney Ross]], briefly under the title 'White Warrior Princess'.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #452</ref> She has also associated with the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] and resumed her ties with the Silver Samurai. She has also retaken the name \"Madame Hydra\".{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nFor a time, Viper was the dictator of the nation of [[Madripoor]], using the nation's resources to support global terrorism via Hydra.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} She was overthrown by new S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Tony Stark]] and [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tiger]], the latter of whom is now ruler of Madripoor.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #2 during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Viper is seen leaving her lover, the [[Silver Samurai]], to rejoin [[Baron von Strucker]] and the ruling council of Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2</ref> It was revealed in ''Secret Warriors #3'' that she is no longer Madame Hydra, as she was replaced by Contessa [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]], taking up the mantle of Madame Hydra, wearing an elaborate tentacle headdress and elaborate Hydra robes.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #3</ref>\n\nIn ''Secret Warriors #12'', Viper is kidnapped by the mysterious Leviathan group, who are determined to find out the location of a mysterious box that both she and Madame Hydra procured from the Yashidas. Madame Hydra arrived at the Leviathan headquarters and offered the box to its leader, much to Viper's dismay. Madame Hydra then shot Viper to death. However, when Hydra arrived, the Hive resurrected her, giving her tentacles that stemmed from her head, and she renames herself Madame Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #12-15</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Madame Hydra joins up with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] after [[Norman Osborn]] escapes from the Raft and regains leadership.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #16.1</ref> After the defeat of Osborn and the [[Dark Avengers]], Madame Hydra uses the resources of the now-defunct H.A.M.M.E.R. to begin rebuilding the Hydra organization.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #24</ref> She later tips off Spider-Woman and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] about a heist [[Mister Negative]] is planning on a S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouse. While the Avengers deal with Mister Negative, Madame Hydra attacks a different S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals several captive Skrulls left over from the Secret Invasion.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #30</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra later led an attack on [[Avengers Tower]] while the team is away. She and the rest of her forces are defeated by [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and his younger self from [[All-New X-Men|earlier in the timestream]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #8</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Death of Wolverine]]\", she was revealed by [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] as the \"Green Queen\" and current leader of [[Madripoor]] who sent out a contract to capture Wolverine.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #2</ref>\n\nViper is part of the Hydra High Council that the new [[Madame Hydra]] is collecting to assist Steve Rogers who had history altered by Red Skull's clone using Kobik's powers to be a Hydra sleeper agent for years.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" storyline, Viper attends the meeting of the Hydra High Council and talks about the opening of two new detention facilities to double the amount of Inhumans held in indefinite custody.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While doing business with some men, Viper is told by a Hydra agent that they have apprehended Black Widow. This is part of a diversion so that the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] can infiltrate a Hydra base. When Viper figures out that Widow is planning to kill Hydra Supreme, Viper tries to persuade Widow to join up with her enterprise.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, Viper is seen in Madripoor where she leads the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]] (consisting of [[Knockout (Marvel Comics)|Knockout]], [[Bloodlust (comics)|Bloodlust]], [[Mindblast]], [[Whiplash (comics)#Leeann Foreman|Snake Whip]], and [[Sapphire Styx]]) into ambushing [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] at the King's Impresario Restaurant. While Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm are defeated and taken prisoner by Madame Hydra and the Femme Fatales, Kitty Pryde escapes with Domino and Jubilee.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper congratulates the Femme Fatales for their work as they now have Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm as their prisoners. Mindblast suggests that they put a bounty on the ones that escaped stating that every gang member in Lowtown will be looking for them. Viper states that she will discuss with her client on where to proceed next and to deposit Rogue and Storm to the client as \"special guests.\" As Viper gives the status report to a representative of her client, she mentions that Sapphire Styx is still draining off of Psylocke just like she did with Magneto. The representative tells Viper that Sapphire Styx tends to prefer the life force of the mutants and tells Viper to focus on delivering the package as all that they are serves the will of Soteira. As Snake Whip asks if they are going to ignore Sapphire Styx's vampiric appetite, Viper says that they have to obey the representative's orders and \"let the @#$%& feed.\"<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper is contacted by a representative of Soteira who was displeased that the launch was delayed by a torrential rainstorm and suggest that they launch before sunrise. While reluctantly taking the representative's suggestion, Viper and Snake Whip check up on Sapphire Styx who knocks down Snake Whip and claims that Wolverine's Patch alias is present even though Sapphire is the only one who can see him. Viper calls Knockout and Mindblast away from the prisoners to help deal with Sapphire. After hearing that the launch site for the rocket bound for Soteira is under attack, Viper gives the orders to launch it now.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Sapphire Styx explodes, Viper maintains the higher ground while Snake Whip joins the fight. When the Femme Fatales are defeated, Viper flees as Magneto plans to pursue her in order to purge Madripoor of Viper's criminal empire.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nViper has no superhuman abilities but her strength, speed, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance and endurance are on the order of an Olympic athlete. She is a great swordsman and even greater marksman with most long range weapons, and has extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Viper occasionally employs poisoned weapons with snake-motifs, such as venomous darts or artificial fangs filled with poison. She utilizes experimental weaponry, including a ring that enables teleportation, and in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', she made use of razor-sharp claw attachments apparently built into her gloves.<ref name=\"X-Treme X-Men #11\" /> A brilliant strategist and tactician with extensive combat tactical experience, Viper is highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld. She is also a master of stealth and espionage. Perhaps her greatest strengths are her influence, the financial resources at her disposal due to her stature in [[organized crime]], and an uncanny luck which has allowed her to cheat death in situations where lesser people would have died. Viper may or may not have supernaturally augmented longevity.\n\nViper is usually armed with various ray pistols and conventional handguns. She has also used various other special weaponry, including poison-tipped throwing darts, knives, and whips.  She has sharpened and elongated canine teeth with hollows inside them. She keeps a special poison in them, to which she has an immunity.\n\nFor a brief time, Chthon replaced her right eye with a black orb capable of projecting persons into a magical dimension.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Age of Apocalypse ===\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Viper was married to the Silver Samurai. She and her husband fought their way from the islands of Japan through hordes of Apocalypse's Infinites. Viper was killed saving Samurai's life, leading to the Silver Samurai accepting Magneto's offer to join the X-Men.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n=== Exiles ===\nOne of the alternate dimensions that is visited in ''Exiles'' #91-95 has been overtaken by a version of Madame Hydra. This world (Earth 1720) was dominated by Madame Hydra (actually [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm Richards]]), her lover [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and their top assassin [[Slaymaster]]. However, before the Exiles can exact retribution, Madame Hydra and her lackeys escape into the omniverse to seek out other worlds to conquer.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nThe ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' version of Viper appears in ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]: [[Ultimate Requiem|Spider-Man Requiem]]'' along with Hydra. She attacks Tony Stark's offices in order to retrieve the Iron Man armor but is subdued by [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]], with the help of [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]], and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem'' #1 (June 2009)</ref>\n\n== In other media ==\n=== Television ===\n* The Viper iteration of Madame Hydra appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Lisa Ann Beley]].

She is a foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men]].\n\n== Publication history ==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nViper was created by [[Jim Steranko]] and first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #110 (February 1969).\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nOphelia Sarkissian was orphaned as a child in [[Hungary]]. Part of her face was scarred at one time, although it has since been healed. Among twelve other girls, Ophelia was taken in by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and raised by [[Kraken (character)#Daniel Whitehall|Kraken]]. For twenty-two years, Ophelia excelled and became Kraken's best student.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #15</ref> She eventually rose through the ranks of Hydra and frequently came into conflict with [[Captain America]] and the organization known as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She first appeared as a leader of Hydra under the codename [[Madame Hydra]], and first fought and captured Captain America while trying to contaminate New York City's water supply.<ref>''Captain America'' #110</ref> She captured [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to bait a trap for Captain America,<ref>''Captain America'' #111</ref> and then subdued the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with gas, planning to bury them alive, and battled Captain America again. However she was apparently killed when Captain America and Rick Jones dodged missiles she fired at them and she was caught in their explosion.<ref>''Captain America'' #113</ref> Some time later, it was revealed that the [[Space Phantom]] had exchanged places with her, and her whereabouts at the time were undisclosed.<ref>''Avengers'' #107</ref>\n\nShe severed ties with Hydra.<ref>''Captain America'' #170 (February, 1974)</ref> Madame Hydra helped Jordan Stryke, a [[supervillain]] codenamed [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], escape custody in [[Virginia]], only to proceed in [[Assassination|assassinating]] him, and usurping his codename and leadership of the group known as the [[Serpent Squad]].<ref>''Captain America'' #180 (December 1974)</ref> As the new Viper, she kidnapped [[Roxxon Oil|Roxxon]] president [[Hugh Jones (comics)|Hugh Jones]], in order to put him in thrall of the [[Serpent Crown]]. She battled [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] and [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner.<ref>''Captain America'' #181-182</ref> Viper was the founder and leader of the elite criminal underworld through sheer ruthlessness, treachery, and the cunning of her black heart.\n\nViper took over the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], and planned to crash it into the Congress building. She employed [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] as operatives, and battled [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Shang-Chi]], and [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #83-85</ref> Viper later employed the Silver Samurai as her chief operative, and attempted to kidnap Michael Kramer, a man carrying a fatal experimental disease, in order to release it on America. The Viper battled the first [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and became convinced that she was Merriem Drew. Drew was the mother of Spider-Woman and was considered deceased since 1931. The issue revealed Merriem had become allied to Chthon and was granted longevity in return. The Viper revealed herself to have been a pawn of Chthon for fifty years, but saved Spider-Woman's life by defying Chthon.<ref>''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #42-#44 (February&nbsp;\u2013 June, 1982)</ref> Viper, employing [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] as her chief operative, captured Spider-Woman, believing she was responsible for making her think they were related. It was revealed that Chthon had actually granted Viper [[False memory syndrome|false memories]] of mothering Jessica as part of a plan to place both women under his control. Viper captured Captain America, and planned to release her new bubonic plague.<ref>''Captain America'' #281-283 (May\u2013July, 1983)</ref> Whether Viper actually has extraordinary longevity was left uncertain.\n\nEmploying the Silver Samurai, Viper attempted to coerce [[Thunderiders|Team America]] into stealing the cavourite crystal, and then battled the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #5-6</ref> In one of her many terrorist acts, she would try to gain control of the snake-themed organization called the [[Serpent Society]], with [[Slither (comics)|Slither]], [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-De-Lance]], and [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]] as her operatives. The latter four operatives infiltrated the Serpent Society in an attempt to take it over. Viper dispatched [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]], [[Boomslang (comics)|Boomslang]], and Copperhead to poison Washington D.C.'s water supply with a snake mutagen. Viper terrorized the White House and the President, and battled Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-344</ref> She attempted to assassinate the organization's former leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], but she was betrayed by Cobra and arrested by [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Viper was later freed from prison by [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]]. She used a snake mutagen on drug addicts, and then battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #2</ref> She then turned against and battled Tyrannus.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #4</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra has also had conflict with the [[X-Men]]. She first came into contact with them upon trying to assassinate [[Mariko Yashida]] on behalf of her ally and presumed lover [[Silver Samurai]], and tried to poison the team while disguised as Mariko's unconscious maid.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172, August 1983</ref> She nearly killed X-Men members [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] on two separate occasions, with Storm being nearly killed by Viper during the invasion of [[Khan (comics)|Khan]].<ref name=\"X-Treme X-Men #11\">''X-Treme X-Men'' #11</ref> She also faced the [[New Mutants]] and was considered responsible for the presumed demise of [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] (Karma was only wounded and was abducted by the [[Shadow King]] for his own reasons).<ref>''New Mutants'' #6, August 1983</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra is a professional [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and has her own organization. She has come into conflict with many superheroes and supervillains over the years. Her [[nihilism]] and tendency to spread death around her has made it hard for other villains to associate with her. Only the [[Red Skull]] has found it a charming tendency and pursued a relationship with her for a while. The relationship ended when the Skull found out Viper was using his resources to finance massacres with no apparent financial benefit for either of them.<ref>''Captain America'' #419, September 1993</ref>\n\nFor a time the Viper employed a team of doppelg\u00e4ngers (known as \"Pit-Vipers\") to impersonate her. However, acting on her own, Pit-Viper 12<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/pitviper.htm|Pit-Viper}}</ref> became involved with the [[Punisher]] during an international crime conference in Las Vegas<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #45-47, August\u2013October 1992</ref> and later tipped off S.H.I.E.L.D. to the real Viper's attempt to steal Russian nuclear missiles in Moscow.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol. 2 #45, March 1993</ref> For compromising her anonymity, the Viper personally killed her treacherous double.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #15, August 1993</ref>\n\nLater she blackmailed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into marrying her as a means to secure her criminal empire in [[Madripoor]]. Although this was a marriage of convenience, she did request to consummate the arrangement. Some time later, her body was briefly inhabited by the spirit of [[Ogun (Marvel Comics)|Ogun]], and Wolverine mortally wounded her as a means of driving the spirit from her dying body. In return for seeking medical attention to save her life, Wolverine demanded a divorce.<ref>''Wolverine'' # 125</ref> It is later implied that she actually had feelings for Wolverine.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nViper was then a member of an incarnation of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], working with [[Sat-Yr-9|Courtney Ross]], briefly under the title 'White Warrior Princess'.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #452</ref> She has also associated with the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] and resumed her ties with the Silver Samurai. She has also retaken the name \"Madame Hydra\".{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nFor a time, Viper was the dictator of the nation of [[Madripoor]], using the nation's resources to support global terrorism via Hydra.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} She was overthrown by new S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Tony Stark]] and [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tiger]], the latter of whom is now ruler of Madripoor.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #2 during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Viper is seen leaving her lover, the [[Silver Samurai]], to rejoin [[Baron von Strucker]] and the ruling council of Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2</ref> It was revealed in ''Secret Warriors #3'' that she is no longer Madame Hydra, as she was replaced by Contessa [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]], taking up the mantle of Madame Hydra, wearing an elaborate tentacle headdress and elaborate Hydra robes.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #3</ref>\n\nIn ''Secret Warriors #12'', Viper is kidnapped by the mysterious Leviathan group, who are determined to find out the location of a mysterious box that both she and Madame Hydra procured from the Yashidas. Madame Hydra arrived at the Leviathan headquarters and offered the box to its leader, much to Viper's dismay. Madame Hydra then shot Viper to death. However, when Hydra arrived, the Hive resurrected her, giving her tentacles that stemmed from her head, and she renames herself Madame Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #12-15</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Madame Hydra joins up with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] after [[Norman Osborn]] escapes from the Raft and regains leadership.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #16.1</ref> After the defeat of Osborn and the [[Dark Avengers]], Madame Hydra uses the resources of the now-defunct H.A.M.M.E.R. to begin rebuilding the Hydra organization.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #24</ref> She later tips off Spider-Woman and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] about a heist [[Mister Negative]] is planning on a S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouse. While the Avengers deal with Mister Negative, Madame Hydra attacks a different S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals several captive Skrulls left over from the Secret Invasion.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #30</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra later led an attack on [[Avengers Tower]] while the team is away. She and the rest of her forces are defeated by [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and his younger self from [[All-New X-Men|earlier in the timestream]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #8</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Death of Wolverine]]\", she was revealed by [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] as the \"Green Queen\" and current leader of [[Madripoor]] who sent out a contract to capture Wolverine.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #2</ref>\n\nViper is part of the Hydra High Council that the new [[Madame Hydra]] is collecting to assist Steve Rogers who had history altered by Red Skull's clone using Kobik's powers to be a Hydra sleeper agent for years.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" storyline, Viper attends the meeting of the Hydra High Council and talks about the opening of two new detention facilities to double the amount of Inhumans held in indefinite custody.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While doing business with some men, Viper is told by a Hydra agent that they have apprehended Black Widow. This is part of a diversion so that the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] can infiltrate a Hydra base. When Viper figures out that Widow is planning to kill Hydra Supreme, Viper tries to persuade Widow to join up with her enterprise.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, Viper is seen in Madripoor where she leads the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]] (consisting of [[Knockout (Marvel Comics)|Knockout]], [[Bloodlust (comics)|Bloodlust]], [[Mindblast]], [[Whiplash (comics)#Leeann Foreman|Snake Whip]], and [[Sapphire Styx]]) into ambushing [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] at the King's Impresario Restaurant. While Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm are defeated and taken prisoner by Madame Hydra and the Femme Fatales, Kitty Pryde escapes with Domino and Jubilee.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper congratulates the Femme Fatales for their work as they now have Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm as their prisoners. Mindblast suggests that they put a bounty on the ones that escaped stating that every gang member in Lowtown will be looking for them. Viper states that she will discuss with her client on where to proceed next and to deposit Rogue and Storm to the client as \"special guests.\" As Viper gives the status report to a representative of her client, she mentions that Sapphire Styx is still draining off of Psylocke just like she did with Magneto. The representative tells Viper that Sapphire Styx tends to prefer the life force of the mutants and tells Viper to focus on delivering the package as all that they are serves the will of Soteira. As Snake Whip asks if they are going to ignore Sapphire Styx's vampiric appetite, Viper says that they have to obey the representative's orders and \"let the @#$%& feed.\"<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Viper is contacted by a representative of Soteira who was displeased that the launch was delayed by a torrential rainstorm and suggest that they launch before sunrise. While reluctantly taking the representative's suggestion, Viper and Snake Whip check up on Sapphire Styx who knocks down Snake Whip and claims that Wolverine's Patch alias is present even though Sapphire is the only one who can see him. Viper calls Knockout and Mindblast away from the prisoners to help deal with Sapphire. After hearing that the launch site for the rocket bound for Soteira is under attack, Viper gives the orders to launch it now.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Sapphire Styx explodes, Viper maintains the higher ground while Snake Whip joins the fight. When the Femme Fatales are defeated, Viper flees as Magneto plans to pursue her in order to purge Madripoor of Viper's criminal empire.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nViper has no superhuman abilities but her strength, speed, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance and endurance are on the order of an Olympic athlete. She is a great swordsman and even greater marksman with most long range weapons, and has extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Viper occasionally employs poisoned weapons with snake-motifs, such as venomous darts or artificial fangs filled with poison. She utilizes experimental weaponry, including a ring that enables teleportation, and in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', she made use of razor-sharp claw attachments apparently built into her gloves.<ref name=\"X-Treme X-Men #11\" /> A brilliant strategist and tactician with extensive combat tactical experience, Viper is highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld. She is also a master of stealth and espionage. Perhaps her greatest strengths are her influence, the financial resources at her disposal due to her stature in [[organized crime]], and an uncanny luck which has allowed her to cheat death in situations where lesser people would have died. Viper may or may not have supernaturally augmented longevity.\n\nViper is usually armed with various ray pistols and conventional handguns. She has also used various other special weaponry, including poison-tipped throwing darts, knives, and whips.  She has sharpened and elongated canine teeth with hollows inside them. She keeps a special poison in them, to which she has an immunity.\n\nFor a brief time, Chthon replaced her right eye with a black orb capable of projecting persons into a magical dimension.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Age of Apocalypse ===\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Viper was married to the Silver Samurai. She and her husband fought their way from the islands of Japan through hordes of Apocalypse's Infinites. Viper was killed saving Samurai's life, leading to the Silver Samurai accepting Magneto's offer to join the X-Men.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n=== Exiles ===\nOne of the alternate dimensions that is visited in ''Exiles'' #91-95 has been overtaken by a version of Madame Hydra. This world (Earth 1720) was dominated by Madame Hydra (actually [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm Richards]]), her lover [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and their top assassin [[Slaymaster]]. However, before the Exiles can exact retribution, Madame Hydra and her lackeys escape into the omniverse to seek out other worlds to conquer.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nThe ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' version of Viper appears in ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]: [[Ultimate Requiem|Spider-Man Requiem]]'' along with Hydra. She attacks Tony Stark's offices in order to retrieve the Iron Man armor but is subdued by [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]], with the help of [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]], and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem'' #1 (June 2009)</ref>\n\n== In other media ==\n=== Television ===\n* The Viper iteration of Madame Hydra appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Lisa Ann Beley]].

Malate dehydrogenase is present in two forms in the shuttle system: mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. The two malate dehydrogenases are differentiated by their location and structure, and catalyze their reactions in opposite directions in this process.\n\nFirst, in the cytosol, malate dehydrogenase catalyses the reaction of [[oxaloacetate]] and NADH to produce malate and NAD<sup>+</sup>. In this process, two electrons generated from NADH, and an accompanying H<sup>+</sup>, are attached to oxaloacetate to form malate.\n\nOnce malate is formed, the first antiporter (malate-[[alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|alpha-ketoglutarate]]) imports the malate from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix and also exports alpha-ketoglutarate from the matrix into the cytosol simultaneously. After malate reaches the mitochondrial matrix, it is converted by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase into oxaloacetate, during which NAD<sup>+</sup> is reduced with two electrons to form NADH. Oxaloacetate is then transformed into aspartate (since oxaloacetate cannot be transported into the cytosol) by mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase. Since aspartate is an amino acid, an amino radical needs to be added to the oxaloacetate. This is supplied by glutamate, which in the process is transformed into alpha-ketoglutarate by the same enzyme.\n\nThe second antiporter (the [[Glutamate_aspartate_transporter|glutamate-aspartate antiporter]]) imports glutamate from the cytosol into the matrix and exports aspartate from the matrix to the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, aspartate is converted by cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase to oxaloacetate.\n\nThe net effect of the malate-aspartate shuttle is purely [[redox]]: NADH in the cytosol is oxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup>, and NAD<sup>+</sup> in the matrix is reduced to NADH. The NAD<sup>+</sup> in the cytosol can then be reduced again by another round of glycolysis, and the NADH in the matrix can be used to pass electrons to the electron transport chain so ATP can be synthesized.\n\nSince the malate-aspartate shuttle regenerates NADH inside the mitochondrial matrix, it is capable of maximizing the number of ATPs produced in glycolysis (3/NADH), ultimately resulting in a net gain of 38 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose metabolized. Compare this to the [[glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle]], which reduces FAD<sup>+</sup> to produce FADH<sub>2</sub>, donates electrons to the quinone pool in the [[electron transport chain]], and is capable of generating only 2 ATPs per NADH generated in glycolysis (ultimately resulting in a net gain of 36 ATPs per glucose metabolized). (These ATP numbers are prechemiosmotic, and should be reduced in light of the work of Mitchell and many others{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Each NADH produces only 2.5 ATPs, and each FADH<sub>2</sub> produces only 1.5 ATPs. Hence, the ATPs per glucose should be reduced to 32 from 38 and 30 from 36. The extra H<sup>+</sup> required to bring in the inorganic phosphate during oxidative-phosphorylation contributes to the 30 and 32 numbers as well).\n\n==Regulation==\n\nThe activity of malate-aspartate shuttle is modulated by arginine methylation of [[MDH1|malate dehydrogenase 1]] (MDH1). Protein arginine N-methyltransferase [[CARM1]] methylates and inhibits MDH1 by disrupting its dimerization, which represses malate-aspartate shuttle and inhibits [[cellular respiration|mitochondria respiration]] of [[pancreatic cancer]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang YP, Zhou W, Wang J, Huang X, Zuo Y, Wang TS, Gao X, Xu YY, Zou SW, Liu YB, Cheng JK, Lei QY | title = Arginine Methylation of MDH1 by CARM1 Inhibits Glutamine Metabolism and Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 673\u201387 | date = Nov 2016 | pmid = 27840030 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2016.09.028 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==Interactive pathway map==\n{{GlycolysisGluconeogenesis_WP534|highlight=Aspartic_acid__alt1}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glycerol phosphate shuttle]]\n* [[Mitochondrial shuttle]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Monty Krieger |author2=Matthew P Scott |author3=Matsudaira, Paul T. |author4=Lodish, Harvey F. |author5=Darnell, James E. |author6=Lawrence Zipursky |author7=Kaiser, Chris |author8=Arnold Berk |title=Molecular Cell Biology, Fifth Edition |publisher=W.
