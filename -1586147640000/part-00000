{"title_page": "Gabriel Morency", "text_new": "'''Gabriel Morency''' (born August 10, 1970) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] sports broadcaster, who hosted the daily shows '''Morency''' and '''Covers Experts''' on [[Hardcore Sports Radio]] as well as '''Sports Rage''' on both Hardcore Sports Radio (HSR) and [[The Score Television Network]]. He was also a host on Team 1040 in Vancouver and Team 990 in Montreal. In November 2018 he launched a new show with Corey Parsons and Michelle Serpico, '''The Morning After''' on [[FNTSY Sports Network]] in New York City. He now hosts several shows for Sportsgrid TV alongside Scott Ferrall, live from the Meadowlands. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Morning After |url=http://sportsbyline.com/the-morning-after/ |website=sportsbyline.com |date=December 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Montreal/Team 990==\nMorency was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Before becoming a broadcaster, Morency played minor hockey and was on  his way to England to play professionally, but chose a career in  entertainment, dropping out of school to tour in a rock/metal band named ''Homicide''.  Ultimately, he ended up in radio after a local Montreal radio talent  suggested that he get his own show.\n\nIn Montreal, Morency also wrote in the [[Montreal Mirror]], a free press newspaper and was host of '''The Blue Line''', a [[Montreal Canadiens]] postgame show, and '''Sports Line Saturday''', as well as a weekly [[Montreal Expos]] Show. He hosted the show '''Sports Weekly''' before joining the Team 990 channel.\n\nMorency placed fourth in the Montreal Readers Poll as the biggest sports  personality in the city behind only [[Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore]], [[Saku Koivu]] and [[Vladimir Guerrero]] in 2005. He has placed lower in recent years.\n\n==Hardcore Sports Radio==\n\nOn November 17, 2006, Morency announced that he would be leaving the Team 990 on December 1, 2006. 11 days later, he was on [[Hardcore Sports Radio]], in Toronto, co-hosting Hardcore Football Sunday and later, hosting ''Sports Rage''. As well, he made picks on ''To the Point'', a television show on [[The Score Television Network|The Score]]. Morency had several regulars on his show.\n\n''Sports Rage'' was also known for \"Road Rages\", the title given to shows which were broadcast at various venues around North America where Morency and his listeners come together, usually accompanied by guest stars. ''Sports Rage'' also had regular callers, including \"The Rickster\", Brandon in St. Louis, Avry in Edmonton, Rocco in California, Rob in Boston, \"Bruder\", and \"Baroni\", among many others. \"Cage Calls\" were also a common event on the show. The most recent Cage Call was on December 23, 2008 with \"The Rickster\" and Drew in Nelson, BC. \"Cage Calls\" featured two callers who talk \"smack\" back and forth. Previously, when Sportsrage was on the Team 990, \"Cage Call\" Championships were held. Champions included The Spoiler, Johnny Powers, Mike from the Gas Station and Madness. ''Sports Rage'' also had a position of power that was given to the callers and Sports Rage staff known as the Councilman. The first councilman election was won by Eric Cohen. Later councilmen included Rickster and Avry in Edmonton who was the last known councilman when the post was vacated by Eric Cohen who replaced Rickster after he stepped down. The position was soon retired on Hardcore Sports Radio after Morency left the company.\n\nMorency was joined by fellow The Score/Hardcore Sports Radio personality [[Cam Stewart (sportscaster)|Cam Stewart]] on two shows by the names of '''Morency''' and '''Covers Experts'''' (Formerly ''Game On!'') that broadcast on Hardcore Sports Radio Sirius 98. Gabe and Cam were joined by [[Greg Sansone]] during ''Morency'', and a different member of the Covers.com website to break down the night in betting during Covers Experts. They often talked to Las Vegas Sports Insider expert Brian Blessing, who Morency gave the nicknames \"Ricky Rickshaw\" (from a prior incident where it was suggested he start a [[Pulled rickshaw|Rickshaw]] Business in Vegas) and \"Kenny Rogers\"(because of a caller who said the photo of him that was used looked like [[Kenny Rogers|the singer]]). Covers Experts was broadcast every weekday at 6:30pm EST on The Score Television Network and Hardcore Sports Radio. Morency also appeared alongside [[Cam Stewart (sportscaster)|Cam Stewart]] and Sarah Meehan at the last segment of the show ''[[Drive This!]]'' on Hardcore Sports Radio hosted by [[Richard Garner]].\n\n==Departure from HSR==\nMorency left Sirius / The Score in November 2009 to 'go solo', and in early December, 2009 he started ''Morency Sports''.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, it was officially announced by his superiors that Morency was let go by Score Media on a new HSR show called \"The Meeting.\" Confidentiality agreements between Morency and the Score Media were in place when \"The Meeting\" was broadcasting and his superiors were unable to provide details/reasons about Morency's departure from Score Media.\n\n==Morency Sports==\n\nOn December 4, 2009, Morency launched MorencySports.com. ''Sports Rage'' aired live Monday to Friday from 10 P.M. to 12 A.M. via webcast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morency-sports |url=http://www.morencysports.com/ |website=morencysports.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712170854/http://www.morencysports.com/ |archivedate=July 12, 2016}}</ref> Other shows on the site included ''Gametime Decisions'', ''MMA Meltdown'' and ''Avry's Sports Show''.\n\nMorency brought a large portion of his former Sirius Radio audience with him and attracted some of his on-air talent as well. Former NFL linesman [[Kyle Turley]] was on board with Morency as was Arena Leaguer Rich 'Moose' Salzer also covered football on air with Morency for nine years.\n\n==FNTSY Sports Network==\n\nMorency is now hosting multiple shows on the network, including ''Game Time Decisions'', which include bets and DraftKings picks, and Morency Unfiltered. In October 2018, he began hosting the morning show ''Carton and Friends'' after Craig Carton took a leave of absence from the station. Morency began hosting ''The Morning After'' in November 2018.\n\nIn August 2017, he began doing late night content on SBRpicks.com a subsidiary of Costa Rican sportsbook news and information company SBRforum.com. He's also featured on Sunday for NFL commentary with Donnie Rightside and Jeff \"The Big Man on Campus\" Nadu. He also is sometimes joined by bob from Vermont. Bob has not had sex in over 20 years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morency, Gabriella}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian radio sportscasters]]\n[[Category:People from Montreal]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French Quebecers]]\n[[Category:Canadian television sportscasters]]\n", "text_old": "'''Gabriel Morency''' (born August 10, 1970) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] sports broadcaster, who hosted the daily shows '''Morency''' and '''Covers Experts''' on [[Hardcore Sports Radio]] as well as '''Sports Rage''' on both Hardcore Sports Radio (HSR) and [[The Score Television Network]].

Ultimately, he ended up in radio after a local Montreal radio talent  suggested that he get his own show.\n\nIn Montreal, Morency also wrote in the [[Montreal Mirror]], a free press newspaper and was host of '''The Blue Line''', a [[Montreal Canadiens]] postgame show, and '''Sports Line Saturday''', as well as a weekly [[Montreal Expos]] Show. He hosted the show '''Sports Weekly''' before joining the Team 990 channel.\n\nMorency placed fourth in the Montreal Readers Poll as the biggest sports  personality in the city behind only [[Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore]], [[Saku Koivu]] and [[Vladimir Guerrero]] in 2005. He has placed lower in recent years.\n\n==Hardcore Sports Radio==\n\nOn November 17, 2006, Morency announced that he would be leaving the Team 990 on December 1, 2006. 11 days later, he was on [[Hardcore Sports Radio]], in Toronto, co-hosting Hardcore Football Sunday and later, hosting ''Sports Rage''. As well, he made picks on ''To the Point'', a television show on [[The Score Television Network|The Score]]. Morency had several regulars on his show.\n\n''Sports Rage'' was also known for \"Road Rages\", the title given to shows which were broadcast at various venues around North America where Morency and his listeners come together, usually accompanied by guest stars. ''Sports Rage'' also had regular callers, including \"The Rickster\", Brandon in St. Louis, Avry in Edmonton, Rocco in California, Rob in Boston, \"Bruder\", and \"Baroni\", among many others. \"Cage Calls\" were also a common event on the show. The most recent Cage Call was on December 23, 2008 with \"The Rickster\" and Drew in Nelson, BC. \"Cage Calls\" featured two callers who talk \"smack\" back and forth. Previously, when Sportsrage was on the Team 990, \"Cage Call\" Championships were held. Champions included The Spoiler, Johnny Powers, Mike from the Gas Station and Madness. ''Sports Rage'' also had a position of power that was given to the callers and Sports Rage staff known as the Councilman. The first councilman election was won by Eric Cohen. Later councilmen included Rickster and Avry in Edmonton who was the last known councilman when the post was vacated by Eric Cohen who replaced Rickster after he stepped down. The position was soon retired on Hardcore Sports Radio after Morency left the company.\n\nMorency was joined by fellow The Score/Hardcore Sports Radio personality [[Cam Stewart (sportscaster)|Cam Stewart]] on two shows by the names of '''Morency''' and '''Covers Experts'''' (Formerly ''Game On!'') that broadcast on Hardcore Sports Radio Sirius 98. Gabe and Cam were joined by [[Greg Sansone]] during ''Morency'', and a different member of the Covers.com website to break down the night in betting during Covers Experts. They often talked to Las Vegas Sports Insider expert Brian Blessing, who Morency gave the nicknames \"Ricky Rickshaw\" (from a prior incident where it was suggested he start a [[Pulled rickshaw|Rickshaw]] Business in Vegas) and \"Kenny Rogers\"(because of a caller who said the photo of him that was used looked like [[Kenny Rogers|the singer]]). Covers Experts was broadcast every weekday at 6:30pm EST on The Score Television Network and Hardcore Sports Radio. Morency also appeared alongside [[Cam Stewart (sportscaster)|Cam Stewart]] and Sarah Meehan at the last segment of the show ''[[Drive This!]]'' on Hardcore Sports Radio hosted by [[Richard Garner]].\n\n==Departure from HSR==\nMorency left Sirius / The Score in November 2009 to 'go solo', and in early December, 2009 he started ''Morency Sports''.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, it was officially announced by his superiors that Morency was let go by Score Media on a new HSR show called \"The Meeting.\" Confidentiality agreements between Morency and the Score Media were in place when \"The Meeting\" was broadcasting and his superiors were unable to provide details/reasons about Morency's departure from Score Media.\n\n==Morency Sports==\n\nOn December 4, 2009, Morency launched MorencySports.com. ''Sports Rage'' aired live Monday to Friday from 10 P.M. to 12 A.M. via webcast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morency-sports |url=http://www.morencysports.com/ |website=morencysports.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712170854/http://www.morencysports.com/ |archivedate=July 12, 2016}}</ref> Other shows on the site included ''Gametime Decisions'', ''MMA Meltdown'' and ''Avry's Sports Show''.\n\nMorency brought a large portion of his former Sirius Radio audience with him and attracted some of his on-air talent as well. Former NFL linesman [[Kyle Turley]] was on board with Morency as was Arena Leaguer Rich 'Moose' Salzer also covered football on air with Morency for nine years.\n\n==FNTSY Sports Network==\n\nMorency is now hosting multiple shows on the network, including ''Game Time Decisions'', which include bets and DraftKings picks, and Morency Unfiltered. In October 2018, he began hosting the morning show ''Carton and Friends'' after Craig Carton took a leave of absence from the station. Morency began hosting ''The Morning After'' in November 2018.\n\nIn August 2017, he began doing late night content on SBRpicks.com a subsidiary of Costa Rican sportsbook news and information company SBRforum.com. He's also featured on Sunday for NFL commentary with Donnie Rightside and Jeff \"The Big Man on Campus\" Nadu.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morency, Gabriella}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian radio sportscasters]]\n[[Category:People from Montreal]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French Quebecers]]\n[[Category:Canadian television sportscasters]]\n", "name_user": "24.186.199.165", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFNTSY Sports Network:Added host)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Morency"}

Dysktra was a three-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and won a [[World Series]] championship as a member of the 1986 Mets. Since retirement, Dykstra has been mired in financial and legal troubles. In 2009, he filed for [[bankruptcy]]. In 2011, he was arrested and charged with [[bankruptcy fraud]], followed by [[motor vehicle theft|grand theft auto]] and [[drug possession]] charges on an unrelated case, as well as [[indecent exposure]]. He served six-and-a-half-months in federal prison. \n\n==Baseball career==\n===New York Mets===\nThe Mets signed Dykstra as a 13th round draft pick in 1981. A star in the [[minor league baseball|minors]], in 1983 he led the [[Carolina League]] in [[at-bat]]s, [[run (baseball statistics)|runs]], [[hit (baseball statistics)|hits]], [[triple (baseball)|triples]], [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and [[stolen bases]]. That season, he hit .358 with 8 HR, 81 RBI, 105 stolen bases (a league record for 17 years), 107 walks and only 35 strikeouts. He was consequently named the Carolina League's MVP, and soon emerged as one of the Mets' prized prospects.  While playing in Double-A in 1984 he befriended fellow outfielder and teammate [[Billy Beane]], who later said that Dykstra was \"perfectly designed, emotionally\" to play baseball and that he had \"no concept of failure.\" According to Beane, his first comments on seeing Hall of Fame pitcher [[Steve Carlton]] warming up were, \"Shit, I'll stick him.\"<ref name=\"moneyball\">{{cite book|title=Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game |authorlink=Michael Lewis (author) |first=Michael |last=Lewis |publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]] |date=April 10, 2003 |isbn=|location=New York |pages=45\u201347|title-link=Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game }}</ref>\n\nIn 1985 Dykstra, deemed ready for the major leagues, was promoted to the Mets when the team's starting [[center fielder]], [[Mookie Wilson]], was placed on the disabled list. The rookie's play and energy was a big boost to a [[1985 New York Mets season|Mets]] team that surged to a 98-win season and narrowly missed out on the NL East crown. The following season, Dykstra was intended to be platooned in center field with Wilson, but took over the position as outright starter and leadoff hitter when Wilson suffered a severe eye injury during spring training. Later that season, the Mets released [[left fielder]] [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]] and moved Wilson to left. Mets fans soon nicknamed Dykstra \"Nails\" for his hard-nosed personality and fearless play. In 1986, he even posed shirtless for a \"beefcake\" poster under the \"Nails\" nickname. Dykstra and #2 hitter [[Wally Backman]] were tagged as \"The Partners in Grime\" for their scrappy play as spark plugs for the star-studded Met lineup.\n\n====1986 season====\n[[File:Lenny Dykstra 1986.jpg|thumb|180px|Dykstra in 1986]]\nWith Dykstra as leadoff hitter, the [[1986 New York Mets season|1986 Mets]] coasted to the division crown, beating the second-place [[1986 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] by 21.5 games en route to a 108\u201354 season. The Mets ended up in the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] after a  victory over the NL West champion [[1986 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] in the [[1986 National League Championship Series|1986 NLCS]], 4 games to 2. Dykstra hit a walk-off home run in Game 3, which is considered one of the biggest hits in Mets franchise history and of Dykstra's career. He hit .304 in the 1986 NLCS, and then .296 in the World Series against the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. But his leadoff home run in Game 3 at [[Fenway Park]] sparked the Mets, who had fallen behind 2 games to none even though those games were played at [[Shea Stadium]]. The home run made him the third Met in team history (along with [[Tommie Agee]] and [[Wayne Garrett]], both of whose home runs also came in a Game 3, in the [[1969 World Series|1969]] and [[1973 World Series]] respectively) to hit a leadoff home run in the World Series. Following Dykstra's home run, the Mets rallied to defeat the Red Sox in seven games.\n\n====1987\u20131989====\nDykstra continued to play in a [[platoon system|platoon]] with Wilson.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&dat=19880301&id=8CdVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aI8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5245,6225102|title=Baseball roundup: Mookie Wilson asks for trade|agency=[[United Press International]]|newspaper=The Daily Record|location=Ellensburg, Washington|date=March 1, 1988|page=11|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref> In the [[1988 National League Championship Series|1988 NLCS]] against the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], he continued his postseason success by hitting .429 in a losing effort.

He was known for his trademark cheek full of [[tobacco]] and hard-nosed play.<ref name=\"james\">{{JamesAbstract|pages=751}}</ref> With the Phillies, Dykstra's career was marked by incredible highs and lows. In 1990, he started the [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star Game]], led the league in hits and finished fourth in batting average, hitting over .400 as late as June.\n\nDykstra's next two seasons were marred by [[injury]]. In 1991, while [[Driving under the influence|driving drunk]], he crashed his car into a tree on Darby-Paoli Road in [[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania]]. Teammate [[Darren Daulton]], his passenger, was also injured. Dykstra suffered fractured [[rib]]s, a broken [[cheekbone]] and a fractured [[collarbone]], and lost two months of playing time. In late August he re-broke his collarbone in [[1991 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] running into the outfield wall and missed the rest of the season.\n\nOn Opening Day 1992, Dykstra was [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] that broke his hand. He played in just 145 of 324 possible games for the Phils in [[1991 Philadelphia Phillies season|1991]] and [[1992 Philadelphia Phillies season|1992]].\n\nIt all came together again in 1993 for Dykstra and the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]]. The team, which had been rebuilding since its last playoff appearance [[1983 Philadelphia Phillies season|ten years before, when they won the 1983 pennant but lost the World Series to Baltimore]], returned to the top of the [[National League|National League East]] and won the pennant again. He played in 161 games, setting a then major league record with 773 plate appearances. Despite being overlooked for the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star]] team he led the league in runs, hits, [[base on balls|walks]] and at-bats, and was runner-up to the Giants' [[Barry Bonds]] in voting for NL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]]. He led the Phillies into the [[1993 World Series|World Series]], which they lost to the defending World Series champion [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] in six games. In the series, Dykstra batted .348 and hit four [[home run]]s, including two in a futile 15\u201314 loss at home in Game 4.\n\nIn October 2015, Dykstra told [[Colin Cowherd]] that beginning in 1993, he paid a team of private investigators $500,000 to dig up dirt on MLB umpires.  He used the information, he said, to leverage a more favorable strike zone during games.  He said it was not a coincidence that he led the Majors in walks in 1993, going from 40 in 392 plate appearances in 1992 to 129 in 773 at-bats the following year. In 1994, Dykstra walked 68 times in 386 plate appearances.<ref>Lenny Dykstra says he hired private investigators to spy on umpires.

Dysktra was a three-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] and won a [[World Series]] championship as a member of the 1986 Mets. Since retirement, Dykstra has been mired in financial and legal troubles. In 2009, he filed for [[bankruptcy]]. In 2011, he was arrested and charged with [[bankruptcy fraud]], followed by [[motor vehicle theft|grand theft auto]] and [[drug possession]] charges on an unrelated case, as well as [[indecent exposure]]. He served six-and-a-half-months in federal prison. \n\n==Baseball career==\n===New York Mets===\nThe Mets signed Dykstra as a 13th round draft pick in 1981. A star in the [[minor league baseball|minors]], in 1983 he led the [[Carolina League]] in [[at-bat]]s, [[run (baseball statistics)|runs]], [[hit (baseball statistics)|hits]], [[triple (baseball)|triples]], [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and [[stolen bases]]. That season, he hit .358 with 8 HR, 81 RBI, 105 stolen bases (a league record for 17 years), 107 walks and only 35 strikeouts. He was consequently named the Carolina League's MVP, and soon emerged as one of the Mets' prized prospects.  While playing in Double-A in 1984 he befriended fellow outfielder and teammate [[Billy Beane]], who later said that Dykstra was \"perfectly designed, emotionally\" to play baseball and that he had \"no concept of failure.\" According to Beane, his first comments on seeing Hall of Fame pitcher [[Steve Carlton]] warming up were, \"Shit, I'll stick him.\"<ref name=\"moneyball\">{{cite book|title=Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game |authorlink=Michael Lewis (author) |first=Michael |last=Lewis |publisher=[[W.

The rookie's play and energy was a big boost to a [[1985 New York Mets season|Mets]] team that surged to a 98-win season and narrowly missed out on the NL East crown. The following season, Dykstra was intended to be platooned in center field with Wilson, but took over the position as outright starter and leadoff hitter when Wilson suffered a severe eye injury during spring training. Later that season, the Mets released [[left fielder]] [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]] and moved Wilson to left. Mets fans soon nicknamed Dykstra \"Nails\" for his hard-nosed personality and fearless play. In 1986, he even posed shirtless for a \"beefcake\" poster under the \"Nails\" nickname. Dykstra and #2 hitter [[Wally Backman]] were tagged as \"The Partners in Grime\" for their scrappy play as spark plugs for the star-studded Met lineup.\n\n====1986 season====\n[[File:Lenny Dykstra 1986.jpg|thumb|180px|Dykstra in 1986]]\nWith Dykstra as leadoff hitter, the [[1986 New York Mets season|1986 Mets]] coasted to the division crown, beating the second-place [[1986 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] by 21.5 games en route to a 108\u201354 season. The Mets ended up in the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] after a  victory over the NL West champion [[1986 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] in the [[1986 National League Championship Series|1986 NLCS]], 4 games to 2. Dykstra hit a walk-off home run in Game 3, which is considered one of the biggest hits in Mets franchise history and of Dykstra's career. He hit .304 in the 1986 NLCS, and then .296 in the World Series against the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. But his leadoff home run in Game 3 at [[Fenway Park]] sparked the Mets, who had fallen behind 2 games to none even though those games were played at [[Shea Stadium]]. The home run made him the third Met in team history (along with [[Tommie Agee]] and [[Wayne Garrett]], both of whose home runs also came in a Game 3, in the [[1969 World Series|1969]] and [[1973 World Series]] respectively) to hit a leadoff home run in the World Series.

He was known for his trademark cheek full of [[tobacco]] and hard-nosed play.<ref name=\"james\">{{JamesAbstract|pages=751}}</ref> With the Phillies, Dykstra's career was marked by incredible highs and lows. In 1990, he started the [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star Game]], led the league in hits and finished fourth in batting average, hitting over .400 as late as June.\n\nDykstra's next two seasons were marred by [[injury]]. In 1991, while [[Driving under the influence|driving drunk]], he crashed his car into a tree on Darby-Paoli Road in [[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania]]. Teammate [[Darren Daulton]], his passenger, was also injured. Dykstra suffered fractured [[rib]]s, a broken [[cheekbone]] and a fractured [[collarbone]], and lost two months of playing time. In late August he re-broke his collarbone in [[1991 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] running into the outfield wall and missed the rest of the season.\n\nOn Opening Day 1992, Dykstra was [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] that broke his hand. He played in just 145 of 324 possible games for the Phils in [[1991 Philadelphia Phillies season|1991]] and [[1992 Philadelphia Phillies season|1992]].\n\nIt all came together again in 1993 for Dykstra and the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]]. The team, which had been rebuilding since its last playoff appearance [[1983 Philadelphia Phillies season|ten years before, when they won the 1983 pennant but lost the World Series to Baltimore]], returned to the top of the [[National League|National League East]] and won the pennant again. He played in 161 games, setting a then major league record with 773 plate appearances. Despite being overlooked for the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star]] team he led the league in runs, hits, [[base on balls|walks]] and at-bats, and was runner-up to the Giants' [[Barry Bonds]] in voting for NL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]]. He led the Phillies into the [[1993 World Series|World Series]], which they lost to the defending World Series champion [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] in six games. In the series, Dykstra batted .348 and hit four [[home run]]s, including two in a futile 15\u201314 loss at home in Game 4.\n\nIn October 2015, Dykstra told [[Colin Cowherd]] that beginning in 1993, he paid a team of private investigators $500,000 to dig up dirt on MLB umpires.  He used the information, he said, to leverage a more favorable strike zone during games.  He said it was not a coincidence that he led the Majors in walks in 1993, going from 40 in 392 plate appearances in 1992 to 129 in 773 at-bats the following year. In 1994, Dykstra walked 68 times in 386 plate appearances.<ref>Lenny Dykstra says he hired private investigators to spy on umpires.

This means that it is hard to define what the most original, authentic version of the story is. Also, when the manga was to be made into the anime, further revisions had to be made, including a simplifying of the story to suit the less sophisticated, wider target audience the show was aiming to appeal to.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter a while, since the television company that made the series needed an output of fifty-two episodes a year, the anime quickly outpaced the manga, meaning Tezuka also had to create many original stories for the anime series that would not appear in the manga, for the purpose of filling in the gaps.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==English-language version==\nFor the English version, the producers, [[NBC Universal Television Distribution|NBC Enterprises]] settled on \"Astro Boy\" after discussions between producer [[Fred Ladd]] and representatives from NBC. Of the first 124 episodes created (there would be 193 altogether), 104 were adapted into an English-language version by [[Fred Ladd]], and initially syndicated on U.S. TV from June 22, 1963 through June 4, 1965, with repeats continuing until the series was withdrawn from syndication in the early 1970s.

Only the first 52 episodes were aired.\n\n[[The Right Stuf International]] and [[Madman Entertainment]] have recently released the entire dubbed series on DVD in two box sets. The Right Stuf sets also include episodes 1, 20, 34, 56, and 193 in Japanese with English subtitles, a behind-the-scenes film, and an interview with Fred Ladd.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Atom''' / '''Astro Boy''', A robot created and modeled upon Dr. Boynton's late son, Astor Boynton. \n:At first, Dr. Boynton enjoyed his company and having his son back, however he rejected the robot after realizing he could not grow up physically like a real human child. With this, the robot Astor was sold to the cruel circus owner, The Great Cacciatore, in order to perform in a circus and renamed as Astro. After a fire broke out during a circus show, Astro saved Cacciatore and was granted his freedom, due in part  by intervention from Dr. Elefun and following the Law of Robot Rights being passed to grant robots the ability to lead the same lives as humans.\n:Astro has several special powers, such as flying with rockets, super hearing, 100,000 horsepower, super human endurance and a machine gun which lies in his backside.\n:In the final episode, which aired only in Japan, Astro sacrifices himself to save the Earth while carrying a shutter which would normalize the sun, which was threatening all life on the planet. <br /> Astro is voiced by [[Mari Shimizu]] with the exception of episodes 97-106 where he is voiced by [[Kazue Tagami]].\n*[[Professor Ochanomizu|'''Professor Ochanomizu''' / Doctor Ochanomizu / Dr. Packidermus J. Elefun]], head of the Ministry of Science after Dr. Boynton resigned. He is Astro's father figure and mentor, and is very supportive of him. He also created a robot family for Astro, including a mother, father, and a robot sister named Uran. Afterward, he reactivated the prototype of Astro, Cobalt, as his brother.

He lost his only son, Astor Boynton III, to a deadly traffic accident. Overcome with grief, he vowed to recreate Astor as a great and powerful robot, and used every available resource of the Ministry to create his greatest creation: Astro Boy. Once he activated Astro, he was seemingly mentally better, but grew frustrated with the fact that, as a robot, Astro did not grew physically like a human child. He sold Astro off to a circus owner, the Great Cacciatore, and resigned from the Ministry and was said to have disappeared. However, he has come out of hiding on occasion to assist Astro; one such occasion was to upgrade Astro's systems to allow him to output 1,000,000 horsepower. <br /> Tenma is voiced by [[Hisashi Yokomori]].\n*'''Astro Boy's parents''', created by Dr. Elefun in order to make Astro feel more human-like. His mother and father are kind and doting to Astro. They were not part of the cast in the 2003 series.\n*[[Uran (manga character)|'''Uran''' / Astro Girl / Zoran]], Astro's younger sister and his most recurring sibling. Uran was given to him as a gift on Astro's birthday. She is often tomboyish and usually gets herself in trouble, like allowing a scientist to give her the ability of splitting in two in order to both live a normal life with one body and fight in a robot battle arena with another. However, her strength was halved and her other half was destroyed. She is repaired, but no longer had the ability of splitting in two after Dr. Elefun repaired her. <br /> Uran is voiced first by [[Yoko Mizugaki]], secondly [[Reiko Mut\u014d]], and thirdly [[Kazuko Yoshikawa]].\n*[[List of Astro Boy characters|'''Cobalt''' / Jetto]], Astro's older prototype brother.\n:He was thrown away by Dr. Boynton as scrap for being a failed prototype and reactivated by Dr. Elefun when Astro went missing during a search for a deadly H-bomb. The two found each other deep in the ocean due to transmitting on a common frequency, and Cobalt managed to save his brother from certain destruction. <br /> Cobalt is voiced by [[Kiyoshi Komiyama]]\n*'''Chi-Tan''' / Ti-Tan, Astro's baby brother (not shown in the English dubbed version).\n:Dr. Elefun had made him alongside other robot babies, but Uran took him as the family's new baby brother.\n*[[Shunsaku Ban|'''Higeoyaji''' / '''Mustachio''' / Shunsaku Ban / Mr. Percival Pompous / Daddy Walrus / Albert Duncan / Wally Kisaragi]], Astro's schoolteacher and/or neighbor in the original manga and color 1980 TV series; a private detective and surrogate uncle for Astro in the 1960s TV series. <br /> He is voiced first by [[Masaaki Yajima]] and secondly by [[Ayao Wada]].\n*'''Shibugaki''' and '''Tamao''' / Dinny and Specs, two of Astro's friends.\n:Tamao is a very good friend for Astro, while Shibugaki is rather a bully who learns of Astro's moral values after some adventures.\n*[[List of Astro Boy characters|'''Chief Nakamura''' / Chief McLaw]]\n:Inspector Tawashi's partner who is made for comical relief, he acknowledges Astro's bravery and often tries to defend him from his partner Tawashi, specially when Astro is accused of a crime he did not commit. <br /> Nakamura is voiced by [[Shinpei Sakamoto]]\n*[[List of Astro Boy characters|'''Inspector Tawashi''' / Inspector Gumshoe]]\n:A police inspector who have a huge distaste for robots and does not had much faith in Astro until he manage to prove his worth. <br /> Tawashi is voiced first by [[Shingo Kanemoto]] and secondly by [[Koichi Chiba]]\n*'''[[Tobio Tenma]]''' / Astor Boynton III/ Toby Boynton / Toby Tenma, the little boy Astro was modeled after, who dies in the first episode.\n* [[Atlas (Astro Boy)|'''Atlas''']], a robot created by Dr. Ram who wanted revenge against the whites for slavery and in order to accomplish this task, he added the Omega Factor which would allow Atlas to commit several crimes. However, Atlas turns against his creator and leaves him to be burned by the flowing lava caused by an artificial volcanic eruption, but Atom manages to defeat Atlas and save his creator.\n* '''Dr. Ram''', an Incan who wants revenge against the whites for slavery; to do this he creates a robot named Atlas who helps him in his cause but, after a turn of events, Atlas turns against him and leaves him to be burned in the flowing lava caused by an artificial volcanic eruption. However, Astro manages to beat Atlas and save Dr. Ram, who realizes his mistake.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Astro Boy (1963) episodes}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Astro Boy'' was initially very popular, being the first Japanese animated television series to make it to U.S. televisions, with the highest ratings of any show at the time. However, its popularity eventually declined to the point where only 104 of the 193 original episodes were released in the U.S., the reasons being mainly that it was still in black and white when most television sets were switching to color and many of the storylines were considered too violent and depressing for the mainstream audience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/astro-boy-1963/|title=Astro Boy (1963)|last=TV.com|website=TV.com|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\nIt was named the 86th best animated series by [[IGN]], calling it the first popular anime television series.<ref name=\"ign100\">{{cite web |title=86, Astro Boy |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/86.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2009-01-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005144/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/86.html |archivedate=19 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In February 2004, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\", citing the show's \"dark themes and Tezuka's use of sci-fi as a conduit to address such issues as war and intolerance.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Persons|first1=Dan|title=The Americanization of Anime: 10 Essential Animations|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=February\u2013March 2004|volume=36|issue=1|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ly0nAQAAIAAJ&dq=editions:0AFLRE736LO1AnqYXhN92VLUi3o6sFT1GgYU-Fw2cLmjwIZk1c7q9_ZE|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0056739|Astroboy}}\n\n{{Portal|Anime and manga|Japan|1960s}}{{Astro Boy}}\n{{Osamu Tezuka}}\n\n[[Category:Astro Boy]]\n[[Category:1963 Japanese television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1963 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1966 Japanese television series endings]]\n[[Category:1976 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:Fuji Television shows]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about robots]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the future]]\n[[Category:Mushi Production]]\n[[Category:Osamu Tezuka anime]]\n[[Category:Androids in television]]\n[[Category:Animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:Television series set in 2000]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name = Astro Boy\n| image = AstroBoy1963.jpg\n| caption = Promotional artwork for the [[United States]] broadcast of ''Astro Boy''\n| ja_kanji = \u9244\u8155\u30a2\u30c8\u30e0\n| ja_romaji = Tetsuwan Atomu\n| genre = <!-- Genres should be based on what reliable sources list them as and not on personal interpretations.

After realising how advanced Atom is compared to the rest of the other robots, he sets him free from the circus, becoming a surrogate father figure to him.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Astro Boy Essays|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=9781933330549|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.astroboy-online.com/wiki/episodes/1960|title=1960s Black and White Series :: AstroBoy Online|website=www.astroboy-online.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to Osamu Tezuka, the main themes of much of the manga he had created, specifically Astro Boy, were that of anti-war, the preservation of nature, and discrimination, which had emanated from his childhood experiencing the devastation of World War II.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/cas/tea/curriculum/imaging-japanese-history/late-20th-century/pdfs/handout2.pdf|title=Imaging Late 20th Century Japanese History - Tezuka Osamu and Astro Boy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince Mighty Atom ended up being re-written more than ten times, either due to limits on size or duration in the magazines Astro Boy was published in, instead of just simply cutting or scaling down certain parts of the manga, Tezuka would completely redraw certain panels and sections of the manga to fit and flow better with the rest of the story. This means that it is hard to define what the most original, authentic version of the story is. Also, when the manga was to be made into the anime, further revisions had to be made, including a simplifying of the story to suit the less sophisticated, wider target audience the show was aiming to appeal to.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter a while, since the television company that made the series needed an output of fifty-two episodes a year, the anime quickly outpaced the manga, meaning Tezuka also had to create many original stories for the anime series that would not appear in the manga, for the purpose of filling in the gaps.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==English-language version==\nFor the English version, the producers, [[NBC Universal Television Distribution|NBC Enterprises]] settled on \"Astro Boy\" after discussions between producer [[Fred Ladd]] and representatives from NBC. Of the first 124 episodes created (there would be 193 altogether), 104 were adapted into an English language version by [[Fred Ladd]], and initially syndicated on U.S. TV from June 22, 1963 through June 4, 1965, with repeats continuing until the series was withdrawn from syndication in the early 1970s. The names were adjusted for American audiences. [[Frederik L.

However, its popularity eventually declined to the point where only 104 of the 193 original episodes were released in the U.S., the reasons being mainly that it was still in black and white when most television sets were switching to color and many of the storylines were considered too violent and depressing for the mainstream audience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/astro-boy-1963/|title=Astro Boy (1963)|last=TV.com|website=TV.com|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\nIt was named the 86th best animated series by [[IGN]], calling it the first popular anime television series.<ref name=\"ign100\">{{cite web |title=86, Astro Boy |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/86.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-01-24 |date=2009-01-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005144/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/86.html |archivedate=19 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In February 2004, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\", citing the show's \"dark themes and Tezuka's use of sci-fi as a conduit to address such issues as war and intolerance.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Persons|first1=Dan|title=The Americanization of Anime: 10 Essential Animations|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=February\u2013March 2004|volume=36|issue=1|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ly0nAQAAIAAJ&dq=editions:0AFLRE736LO1AnqYXhN92VLUi3o6sFT1GgYU-Fw2cLmjwIZk1c7q9_ZE|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0056739|Astroboy}}\n\n{{Portal|Anime and manga|Japan|1960s}}{{Astro Boy}}\n{{Osamu Tezuka}}\n\n[[Category:Astro Boy]]\n[[Category:1963 Japanese television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1963 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1966 Japanese television series endings]]\n[[Category:1976 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:Fuji Television shows]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about robots]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television series set in the future]]\n[[Category:Mushi Production]]\n[[Category:Osamu Tezuka anime]]\n[[Category:Androids in television]]\n[[Category:Animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:Television series set in 2000]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEnglish-language version:replaced: an English language \u2192 an English-language,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy_(1963_TV_series)"}
