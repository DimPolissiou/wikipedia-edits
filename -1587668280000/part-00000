Since 2002, the Unimog has been built in the Mercedes-Benz truck plant in [[W\u00f6rth am Rhein]] in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-8792-49-36829-1-0-0-0-0-0-91-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |title=W\u00f6rth, Mercedes-Benz Werk |publisher=Daimler |access-date=2011-05-16 |quote=Produktion: Actros, Atego, Axor, Econic, Produktbereich Unimog / Sonderfahrzeuge, Zetros, Produktentwicklung |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329150757/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-8792-49-36829-1-0-0-0-0-0-91-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |archivedate=2010-03-29}}</ref> The [[Mercedes-Benz buses#Mercedes-Benz T\u00fcrk|Mercedes-Benz T\u00fcrk A.\u015e.]] plant assembles Unimogs in [[Aksaray]], [[Turkey]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-8792-49-175941-1-0-0-0-0-0-91-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |title=Aksaray, Werk (Mercedes-Benz T\u00fcrk A.S.) |publisher=Daimler |date=2009-12-31 |access-date=2011-01-02 |quote=Produktion: Atego, Axor und Unimog, Produktentwicklung |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609130111/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-8792-49-175941-1-0-0-0-0-0-91-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |archivedate=2010-06-09}}</ref> Unimogs were also built in Argentina (first ever country to do so outside Germany) by Mercedes-Benz Argentina S.A. under licence from 1968 until 1983 (with some extra units built until 1991 off the assembly line from parts in stock) in the [[Gonz\u00e1lez Cat\u00e1n]] factory near the city of Buenos Aires.<ref>Garc\u00eda Loperena, Gast\u00f3n Javier (2015).

It was created by German engineer Hans Zabel, who made the note ''Universal-Motor-Ger\u00e4t'' on one of the technical drawings for the Unimog. Later, the ''Universal-Motor-Ger\u00e4t'' was shortened to the acronym ''Unimog''. On 20 November 1946, the name Unimog was officially unveiled.<ref name=\"Nellinger_8\">[[#LN16|Nellinger]], p. 8</ref> Since 1952, Unimog has been a brand of the [[Daimler AG]].<ref>DPMA: ''[https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/624275/DE Registernummer: 624275]'', retrieved 23 September 2019</ref>\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004772-0001, Sechtem, R\u00fcbenernte.jpg|thumb|Unimog 411 with beet lifter]]\n[[File:Unimog-3318657.jpg|thumb|Unimog 401, 406 and 411]]\n\n=== Design ===\nThe Unimog's characteristic design element is its [[chassis]]&nbsp;:\u2014 a flexible ladder frame with short overhangs, and coil sprung beam [[portal axle]]s with a central torque tube and transverse links. Having portal axles, the tyres' centres are below the axle centre, which gives the Unimog a high ground clearance without big tyres. The coil sprung axles with torque tubes allow an axle angle offset of up to 30\u00b0, giving the tyres a wide range of vertical movement to allow the truck to comfortably drive over extremely uneven [[terrain]], even [[boulder]]s of one metre in height.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: ''Unimog 406: Typengeschichte und Technik''. GeraMond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 23</ref>\n\nUnimogs are equipped with high visibility driving cabs to enable the operator to see the terrain and more easily manipulate mounted tools. The newest Unimog models can be changed from left-hand drive to right-hand drive in the field to permit operators to work on the more convenient side of the truck. The ability to operate on highways enables the Unimog to be returned to a home garage or yard to thwart vandalism.\n\n=== Equipment ===\nUnimogs can be equipped with front and rear tool mounting brackets and [[hydraulic]] connections to allow bucket loaders and hydraulic arms to be used. Most units have a [[power takeoff]] (PTO) connection to operate rotary equipment such as snow brooms, [[snow blower]]s, brush mowers, loaders or stationary [[conveyor belts]].\n\n=== Variants ===\nUnimogs are available with short wheelbases for implement carrier operations or long wheelbases for all-terrain cargo carrying operations. Currently, Daimler offers the 437.4 heavy series and the 405 implement carrier series. Starting in 1951 having purchased the traditional Unimog from Boehringer, Daimler-Benz started making the Unimog S series in the mid-1950s and added light, medium and heavy series to the model lineup in the 1960s and 1970s, before they successively reduced the available models during the 1990s to end up with the modern implement carrier and the heavy series today.\n\nOriginally, the traditional [[Unimog 70200]] was a rather small agricultural tractor, measuring just 3,520&nbsp;mm in length. It was only offered as a Cabrio with a canvas roof. The engine power output of 25&nbsp;DIN-PS (18.5&nbsp;kW) proved to be insufficient for many applications. To accommodate customer needs, a longer wheelbase version, a proper cab and more powerful engines (up to 34&nbsp;DIN-PS (25&nbsp;kW)) were introduced soon after Daimler-Benz took over Unimog manufacture; the traditional Unimog evolved into its final stage, the 411-series. Yet, Daimler-Benz decided that an entirely new, more powerful version of the Unimog would be required to meet future customer expecations. This Unimog version would later be known as 406-series.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}, p. 12-14</ref>\n\nThe military Unimog&nbsp;S&nbsp;series is the first Unimog designed to be an offroad truck rather than a tractor, and it is the only series production Unimog that has an Otto engine.<ref group=\"N\">In this article, the terms Otto cycle engine and Diesel cycle engine are used to differentiate between a traditional petrol engine and a traditional Diesel engine. This is because the original Unimog does not only have a Diesel engine that can burn petrol (precombustion chamber design), but also used to require petrol as a fuel additive in winter to prevent the fuel from gelling. Furthermore, many German military vehicles (such as the Unimog S) have petrol engines, but several military petrol engines use the Diesel principle.</ref> Daimler-Benz designed a new frame for it, but it still shares its drivetrain with the 411-series.\n\nWith the introduction of the 406-series in 1962, Daimler-Benz laid the foundation for a completely new Unimog model family, the 406-based medium series (in the 1960s known as ''heavy'' series). It was produced until 1994. Unimogs belonging to the medium series are the series 403, 413, 406, 416, 426, and 419. These models were offered with three different wheelbases (2,380&nbsp;mm, 2,900&nbsp;mm, 3,400&nbsp;mm) and two engines, the straight-four and straight-six direct injected Diesel engines OM&nbsp;314 and OM&nbsp;352, ranging from 54&nbsp;DIN-PS to 110&nbsp;DIN-PS (40&nbsp;kW \u2013 81&nbsp;kW). The light series 421 and 431 share their frame design with the 411-series, but borrow their drivetrain and cab design from the 406-series, which is why they also count as 406-related Unimogs.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik.

The short bonnet allows good visibility]]\n\n=== Chassis ===\nLike other trucks, but unlike agricultural tractors, the Unimog is a body-on-frame vehicle with short overhangs. The original Unimog was made with a plane ladder frame<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond-Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 82</ref> and a wheelbase of 1720&nbsp;mm. Later, the wheelbase was extended several times to accommodate customer needs. Starting in the mid-1950s, with the introduction of the Unimog 404, the frame received a drop. Originally, this was done to make space for a spare tyre, but soon engineers found out that the new frame would improve the torsion performance, which is why all following Unimog series also received a frame with a drop.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}, p. 45</ref> Several mounting brackets, additional cross members and tool boards were offered as factory options for the frame.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond-Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 79</ref>\n\n=== Suspension ===\nThe Unimog has live front and rear axles that have portal gears ([[portal axle]]s). Such axles have a lifted axle centre, but the wheels' centre remains unchanged, meaning that a high ground clearance can be achieved with small wheels and tyres. Unlike \"regular\" trucks, the Unimog has [[coil spring]]s with hydraulic [[shock absorber]]s rather than [[leaf spring]]s, as coil springs provide more spring travel. The axles themselves have only one longitudinal pivot point each, the so-called [[torque tube]]s. The torque tubes contain the drive shafts and connect the axles' differential gearboxes to the Unimog gearbox, but being also parts of the suspension system, the torque tubes prevent longitudinal movement of the axles, whilst still allowing limited vertical movement. Lateral axle movement is prevented by [[panhard rod]]s and [[transverse link]]s. This design results in extreme axle angle offsets of up to 30\u00b0 possible.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 36\u201340</ref>\n\nA wide variety of wheels and tyres were available for the Unimog. Originally, the first Unimog was equipped with 6.5\u201318&nbsp;in tyres designed for both on- and offroad use.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: ''Typengeschichte und Technik''. GeraMond, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 48 and 49</ref> Later, bigger wheels and tyres with different tread patterns were available, reaching from agricultural tractor tread patterns to massive bar tyre treads to low pressure ballon tyre treads. Until 1973, drum brakes were standard for all Unimogs, until they were replaced by disc brakes, however, until 1989, drum brakes remained an option for Unimogs of the 406-family.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 78</ref> The steering system used to be a screw-and-nut system until 1970. Then it was replaced by a power assisted ball-and-nut system for the 406-series.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 77</ref>\n\n=== Drivetrain ===\nThe classical Unimog is rear-wheel drive vehicle, meaning that the rear axle is directly connected to the gearbox. Turning on front wheel drive automatically locks both axles, without torque compensation. The mechanical lever that turns on all wheel drive has a third position that locks front- and rear differentials. As of 1963, a pneumatic power switch was used instead of a lever. Due to the reduction gears inside the portal axles, the rotational frequency of the driveshafts inside the torque tubes is relatively high, meaning that the amount of torque they have to withstand is fairly low.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 23</ref>\n\n=== Gearbox ===\nTraditionally, the Unimog has a splitter gearbox. Over the years, three different ''base gearbox'' designs were used, all following the same principle, and having four gears and two ranges (called ''groups'') and an additional direction gear. Those designs were ''UG-1/xx'', ''UG-2/xx'', and ''UG-3/xx''. UG is an abbreviation for ''Unimog-Getriebe (Unimog-Gearbox)'', the number after the slash resembles the input torque in [[Kilopondmetre|kp\u00b7m]] (=9.80665&nbsp;N\u00b7m).<ref group=\"N\">The kilopondmetre (kp\u00b7m) is the traditional technical unit of torque used in many European countries until the early 1980s. It equals the force that a mass of 1 kilogram applies. If the acceleration is exactly 9.80665&nbsp;m\u00b7s<sup>&minus;2</sup> (default gravitational acceleration), this equals 9.80665&nbsp;N\u00b7m.</ref> Until 1955, the Unimog ''base gearbox'' UG-1 was a constant-mesh countershaft gearbox, it was then upgraded with synchroniser rings to a synchromesh gearbox. However, the synchromesh-version was only used for the [[Unimog 404|404-series]], and the constant-mesh version remained the standard gearbox for the 411-series. In 1957, the synchromesh-version became an option for the 411-series, before it became the standard gearbox for all Unimogs in 1959.<ref name=\"Carl-Heinz Vogler 2014\">Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond-Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 38 and 39</ref> The following gearbox versions UG-2 and UG-3 were made as synchromesh versions only.\n\nThere are different ''layouts'' of the gearbox, namely ''F-layout'' and ''G-layout'' as well as their upgraded layouts, not having particular names. The F-layout is the original gearbox layout and is limited to the first two gears in the first range as it does not have selector sleeves, meaning that in total there are six forward gears. Instead of a reverse gear, the gearbox has its direction gear, which, in therory, can be used to reverse any gear. Due to the lacking shifting sleeves however, the reverse direction can only be used in the first range, which itself is limited to the first two gears, resulting in only two reverse gears (resulting in 6 forward and 2 reverse gears). To operate the gearbox, there is only one shift lever with a 6-speed H-layout, the gearbox shifts its ranges automatically. An additional shift lever is used for shifting into reverse. The ''G-layout'' has an additional reduction gearbox, which can be used in all gears. This effectively doubles the number of gears (12 forward and 4 reverse gears). This reduction gearbox was also available with an additional crawler gear, which can only be used in the first range (20 forward and 8 reverse gears). As of 1976, shifting sleeves were added and a 4-speed-H-layout replaced the 6-speed-H-layout, which allows using all gears in all ranges.<ref name=\"Gearbox\">Helmut Schmitz: ''[https://www.unimog-community.de/2012/08/20/getriebevarianten-u-406u-421/ Getriebevarianten U 406/U 421]''. August 20th, 2012. Retrieved May 19th, 2017 (in German)</ref> With the introduction of the UG-3-gearbox, the standard gearbox-shifter-layout was changed to an 8-speed-H-H-layout, with 8 gears on one lever, without any additional switches. When shifting from \"4th\" into \"5th\" gear, the gearbox automatically shifts into range 2 and back into gear 1. Crawler gearboxes were offered as a factory option for the UG-3 gearbox as well, resulting in 24 gears. The design with the additional direction gear was kept, which means that all 24 gears can also be used in reverse mode. Since the highest final gear ratio allows top speeds of up to 110&nbsp;km/h, and the reverse gear only comes with a small reduction of 1:1.03, the top speed in reverse mode is more than 100&nbsp;km/h. To prevent such high reverse speeds, a lock for the second range was available as a factory option, allowing only the first range (gears \"1\" to \"4\") in reverse mode.<ref>Oldtimer Traktor Heft 11-12/2012</ref>\n\n=== Engine ===\nThe initial Unimogs were equipped with passenger car engines, the first Unimog series to receive a truck engine was the 406-series in 1963. All engines use the [[Diesel engine|Diesel principle]], except for engines used for the Unimog 404-series and the first four Unimog prototypes, which use the [[Otto cycle|Otto principle]]. The following engines were used as of 1947, with ''M'' being Otto and ''OM'' being Diesel engines (the list is incomplete):\n\n* [[Mercedes-Benz M136 engine|M&nbsp;136]]<ref name=\"Carl-Heinz Vogler 1993\">Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog.

Because the Unimog was designed to be a better agricultural tractor, its original design did not include a closed cab (as agricultural tractors in Germany usually did not have a closed cab in the 1940s). The first Unimog series to be officially offered with a cab was the 401-series. However, the first cabs were made by Westfalia in Rheda-Wiedenbr\u00fcck and then shipped to the Unimog plant in Gaggenau for assembly. These cabs are known as ''Westfalia type B'' or simply ''Froschauge'' (frog's eye). Starting in 1957, a new cab with 30% more volume, called ''Westfalia type DvF'', Typ D, verbreitertes Fahrerhaus (Type D, widened cab), was used. Both Westfalia cabs were fairly narrow and came with the problem of engine heat causing high cabin temperatures.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond-Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 44\u201347</ref> The first Unimog that was designed with a cab was the series 406. Just for the purpose of manufacturing cabs, Daimler-Benz built a new 1000-[[Megapond]]-sheet-panel-press in the Unimog plant.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik.

They proved successful, and the Swiss army purchased 540 units of the 70200's successor, the [[Unimog 2010]]. These early Swiss military vehicles were known as \u2033Dieseli\u2033. The Dieseli-Unimogs remained in service until 1989.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog. Alle Unimog-Klassiker seit 1946 bis 1993.

Soon after, the French army purchased Unimogs of the series 2010 and 401. The Unimog proved to be so successful, that Daimler-Benz was ordered to develop an entirely new Unimog just for military purposes. This new model was supposed to be a small 1.5-tonne truck, capable of carrying 10 to 12 soldiers on its bed, at a speed of up to 90&nbsp;km/h, rather than being an agricultural tractor. Being a NATO member state, France demanded that the military Unimog would have an engine running on petrol.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog. Alle Unimog-Klassiker seit 1946 bis 1993.

In addition to the military series 404, several civilian models have been adapted for military use. In Argentina, the series 426, actually a version of the civilian series 416 produced under licence, was made for the Argentinan, Chilean, Peruvian and Bolivian military. In total, 2643 units of the series 426 were made. The Argentinian made Unimog 431, which was a licenced version of the civilian series 421, was also used as a military vehicle, mainly as a self-propelled [[howitzer]]. Another civilian Unimog that was mainly used a military vehicle, is the series 418.<ref name=\"Vogler_506_122\">Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik.

Most Unimog models found in North America have been imported by individual dealers or independent enthusiasts.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1980 the [[Case Corporation]] (now merged into [[CNH Industrial#CNH Global|CNH Global]]) imported the U-900 model into the United States and sold it through Case tractor dealerships as the MB4/94.\n\nIn 2002 DaimlerChrysler tried to re-enter the North American market and engaged in four years of aggressive marketing, such as truck and trade shows, exposure on the television show ''[[Modern Marvels]]'', numerous magazine articles and extensive demonstrations (both touring and on an individual basis). North American retail models were officially limited to the U 500 series (the North-America-specific member of the UGN series) sold through heavy-truck dealerships, generally [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] dealerships.<ref>Bill Cawthon - [http://www.allpar.com/model/ram/unimog.html Freightliner and the Unimog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517042926/http://www.allpar.com/model/ram/unimog.html |date=2008-05-17}}.

High-powered factory-sponsored entries of truck companies aiming for the overall win have since taken the laurels, with Unimogs used mainly for service purposes.\n\n== Derivatives ==\n=== MB Trac ===\nIn 1973 the Unimog department in Gaggenau also designed the [[MB Trac]], a more tractor-like version. It was produced by Daimler-Benz until 1991, when the product line was sold to '''Werner Forst- und Industrietechnik''', who continues to produce it as the '''[[WF trac]]'''. It is sold and maintained by Mercedes Unimog dealers.\n\n=== Military derivatives ===\n[[File:UR-416.jpg|thumb|UR-416, a police vehicle based on an Unimog 416 chassis.]]\nThe Unimog also serves as a technical platform for armoured vehicles like the [[ATF Dingo]], a mine-protected utility and reconnaissance vehicle used by the German and other European Armed Forces (e.g. Belgium) for territorial defence purposes as well as in international missions.\n\nIn late Autumn 1956, Daimler-Benz started developing a new military version of the Unimog, the ''Unimog SH''. It was based on the [[Unimog S]] and had a rear engine (German: Heckmotor), hence the name Unimog ''SH''.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog. Alle Unimog-Klassiker seit 1946 bis 1993.

Initially, the Belgian Army intended to purchase these vehicle for their police forces in the [[Belgian Congo]], but only 9 vehicles were actually sold to the Belgian forces; the 15 remaining vehicles were purchased by the [[Irish Army]] in 1972.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog.

The type had excellent off-road capability but poor on-road handling due to a high centre of gravity and several accidents occurred as a result. A four-man dismountable squad was carried, but space was cramped, and in any case a four-man detachment was far too small for any sort of realistic military purpose. Other considerations were that the [[FN MAG]] gunner's position was too exposed. Eventually the Unimog Scout Cars arrived in Ireland in February 1972, their departure having been delayed by a local peace group who thought they were destined for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA). By mid-1978 all had been transferred to the [[Irish Army Reserve]], the FCA. All were withdrawn by 1984, and two are preserved; one in the transport museum in [[Howth]] Co Dublin and one in the [[Muckleburgh Collection]], England.\n\nAn updated version of the Unimog SH, the Unimog T was made for the German Bundeswehr in 1962. The German defence ministry decided not to purchase the Unimog T, which is why it was never put into series production.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog.

The Unimog was designed with equal-sized wheels, a mounting bracket in front, a hitch in the rear, and loading space in the center. This was to make it a multi-purpose vehicle that farmers could use in the field and on the highway.<ref name=\"Nellinger_7\" />\n\nAlbert Friedrich was granted permission to develop the Unimog in November 1945,<ref name=\"Vogler_p6\" /> and entered a production agreement with Erhard und S\u00f6hne (Erhard and Sons) in [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]] on 1 December 1945.<ref name=\"Nellinger_7\" /> Development began on 1 January 1946. Soon after, Heinrich R\u00f6\u00dfler, the Unimog lead designer, joined the development team. The first prototype was ready by the end of 1946. The early prototypes were equipped with the [[Mercedes-Benz M136 engine|M 136]] [[Otto cycle|Otto engine]], because the development of the OM 636 [[Diesel engine]] had not been finished.<ref name=\"Carl-Heinz Vogler 1993\" /> The prototypes were similar to the later series production models.

To actually serve the agricultural market, Daimler-Benz designed a completely new agricultural tractor in 1972, the [[MB Trac]]. It is a body-on-frame design ''trac''-tractor, has four big wheels of the same size, and all-wheel-drive, a slim bonnet, and an angular driver cab. In contrast to conventional tractors the cab is situated between the axles, similar to comparable four-wheel-drive tractors. There is no articulation between the front and rear sections, instead, the MB Trac has conventional steering.\n\nA wide range of MB Trac tractors were offered, ranging from the entry model MB-trac 65 to the top model MB Trac 1800 intercooler. Daimler-Benz later merged the MB-trac with the agricultural machinery activities of [[Deutz AG]]. The manufacturing of the MB Trac series was ceased in 1991.\n\n==== 1974 \u2013 Heavy series ====\n{{Main article|Unimog 425}}\nIn 1974, Mercedes-Benz presented the new Unimog U 120. It was the first model of the \"heavy duty\" Unimog series 425. The heavy duty series, or simply \"heavy\" series, extended the Unimog model lineup. The characteristic \"edgy\" bonnet introduced with the heavy Unimog series remains am Unimog style element to this day.\n\nThe series 425 have a {{Convert|2810|mm|in|abbr=on}} wheelbase, 9&nbsp;t permissible maximum mass and an OM 352 Diesel engine producing {{Convert|120|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (shortly thereafter {{Convert|125|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} as U 125).\n\n==== 1975 \u2013 Series 435 ====\n{{Main|Unimog 435}}\nManufacture of the series 435 for the [[Bundeswehr]] began in 1975, as a successor of the Unimog S&nbsp;404. The 435 was characterized by a long wheelbase of {{Convert|3250|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|3700|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} or {{Convert|3850|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} and shares its cab with the series 425.\n\n==== 1976 \u2013 Unimog models renamed ====\n[[File:Unimog U1300.jpg|thumb|right|Unimog U 1300 municipal truck in [[R\u0113zekne]], [[Latvia]]]]\nThe new 424 \"middle\" series of Unimogs was produced starting from 1976. They share the cab with the series-425 and are designated U 1000, U 1300/L, U 1500, and U 1700/L with {{Convert|124|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} engine performance.\n\nIn the same period Daimler-Benz re-ordered the type designations for the older series. The classical round form series of the Unimog were now designated U 600/L, U 800/L, U 900 and U 1100/L. (The letter L stands for a long wheelbase, because most models were available in two wheelbase variants.)\n\nThe Unimog with the rounded driving cab became known as the ''light'' series. The new series with angular cab was divided by payload into a ''middle'' and ''heavy'' series. Some engines overlap \u2013 the Unimog nomenclature is not simple to understand (see below for notes on series names).\n\nThe long-proven Unimog-S (404), although with clearly decreasing production figures, was the only Unimog with an Otto cycle engine in the lineup.\n\nWith the exception of the entry-level model, all Unimogs for 1976 were equipped with four wheel [[disc brakes]].\n\n==== 1977 \u2013 200,000th Unimog ====\nThe 200,000th Unimog, a 424.121, was produced in 1977.<ref name=\"Unimog 1976 bis 1985\" />\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1980, production of the U 404 (Unimog S) ended.\n\nThe light and medium series 407 and 427 were introduced in 1985.\n\nProduction of the 406 and 416 ceased in 1988 and the 437-series was introduced the same year.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n==== 1992 \u2013 New light models ====\n[[File:Blue Unimog 408 or 418 pickup truck.jpg|thumb|Unimog 408 [[dump truck]]]]\nIn the early 1990s, the new light models 408 (U 90) and 418 (U 110-U 140) with newly designed cabins were introduced to replace the predecessor models. The new very diagonal front portion gives the operator a good overview forward. The 408 features an asymmetric front bonnet, which is lower on the driver's side. This is supposed to permit the driver a good overview. A new ladder frame and progressively working coil springs to improve the Unimog's handling were implemented. In addition to that, the Unimog received a new tyre pressure adjustment system that can be operated whilst driving, an anti-skid system, new engines, and a \"Servolock\" mechanism for the hydraulic connection of implements.\n\n==== 1994 \u2013 The \"Funmog\" ====\nIn March 1994, Mercedes-Benz presented the design concept \"Funmog\", a luxury version of the Unimog, on the International Off-Road-Exhibition in K\u00f6ln, Germany.

It is a similar luxury offering comparable to the Funmog.\n\nStarting from June 2006 the UGN series was produced with \"BlueTec\" technology so that the future exhaust limit [[Euro IV]] requirements would be met. With that a new packaging of the vehicle and new design designations are connected (old design +1, e.g. from 405.100 becomes 405.101)\n\nAt the IAA 2006 commercial vehicle show in Hanover a new Unimog'' U&nbsp;20 '' was presented, which was to be available at the end of 2007. The most striking feature is the [[cab over]] design with no vestigial front bonnet characteristic of the traditional Unimog. It has a total mass of 7,500&nbsp;kg up to 8,500&nbsp;kg. The underlying technology comes from the U 300. The driving cab is from the new Brazilian Accelo light truck (Caminh\u00f5es Leves) series.

It was created by German engineer Hans Zabel, who made the note ''Universal-Motor-Ger\u00e4t'' on one of the technical drawings for the Unimog. Later, the ''Universal-Motor-Ger\u00e4t'' was shortened to the acronym ''Unimog''. On 20 November 1946, the name Unimog was officially unveiled.<ref name=\"Nellinger_8\">[[#LN16|Nellinger]], p. 8</ref> Since 1952, Unimog has been a brand of the [[Daimler AG]].<ref>DPMA: ''[https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/624275/DE Registernummer: 624275]'', retrieved 23 September 2019</ref>\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004772-0001, Sechtem, R\u00fcbenernte.jpg|thumb|Unimog 411 with beet lifter]]\n[[File:Unimog-3318657.jpg|thumb|Unimog 401, 406 and 411]]\n\n=== Design ===\nThe Unimog's characteristic design element is its [[chassis]]&nbsp;:\u2014 a flexible ladder frame with short overhangs, and coil sprung beam [[portal axle]]s with a central torque tube and transverse links. Having portal axles, the tyres' centres are below the axle centre, which gives the Unimog a high ground clearance without big tyres. The coil sprung axles with torque tubes allow an axle angle offset of up to 30\u00b0, giving the tyres a wide range of vertical movement to allow the truck to comfortably drive over extremely uneven [[terrain]], even [[boulder]]s of one metre in height.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: ''Unimog 406: Typengeschichte und Technik''. GeraMond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 23</ref>\n\nUnimogs are equipped with high visibility driving cabs to enable the operator to see the terrain and more easily manipulate mounted tools. The newest Unimog models can be changed from left-hand drive to right-hand drive in the field to permit operators to work on the more convenient side of the truck. The ability to operate on highways enables the Unimog to be returned to a home garage or yard to thwart vandalism.\n\n=== Equipment ===\nUnimogs can be equipped with front and rear tool mounting brackets and [[hydraulic]] connections to allow bucket loaders and hydraulic arms to be used. Most units have a [[power takeoff]] (PTO) connection to operate rotary equipment such as snow brooms, [[snow blower]]s, brush mowers, loaders or stationary [[conveyor belts]].\n\n=== Variants ===\nUnimogs are available with short wheelbases for implement carrier operations or long wheelbases for all-terrain cargo carrying operations. Currently, Daimler offers the 437.4 heavy series and the 405 implement carrier series. Starting in 1951 having purchased the traditional Unimog from Boehringer, Daimler-Benz started making the Unimog S series in the mid-1950s and added light, medium and heavy series to the model lineup in the 1960s and 1970s, before they successively reduced the available models during the 1990s to end up with the modern implement carrier and the heavy series today.\n\nOriginally, the traditional [[Unimog 70200]] was a rather small agricultural tractor, measuring just 3,520&nbsp;mm in length. It was only offered as a Cabrio with a canvas roof. The engine power output of 25&nbsp;DIN-PS (18.5&nbsp;kW) proved to be insufficient for many applications. To accommodate customer needs, a longer wheelbase version, a proper cab and more powerful engines (up to 34&nbsp;DIN-PS (25&nbsp;kW)) were introduced soon after Daimler-Benz took over Unimog manufacture; the traditional Unimog evolved into its final stage, the 411-series. Yet, Daimler-Benz decided that an entirely new, more powerful version of the Unimog would be required to meet future customer expecations. This Unimog version would later be known as 406-series.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}, p. 12-14</ref>\n\nThe military Unimog&nbsp;S&nbsp;series is the first Unimog designed to be an offroad truck rather than a tractor, and it is the only series production Unimog that has an Otto engine.<ref group=\"N\">In this article, the terms Otto cycle engine and Diesel cycle engine are used to differentiate between a traditional petrol engine and a traditional Diesel engine. This is because the original Unimog does not only have a Diesel engine that can burn petrol (precombustion chamber design), but also used to require petrol as a fuel additive in winter to prevent the fuel from gelling. Furthermore, many German military vehicles (such as the Unimog S) have petrol engines, but several military petrol engines use the Diesel principle.</ref> Daimler-Benz designed a new frame for it, but it still shares its drivetrain with the 411-series.\n\nWith the introduction of the 406-series in 1962, Daimler-Benz laid the foundation for a completely new Unimog model family, the 406-based medium series (in the 1960s known as ''heavy'' series). It was produced until 1994. Unimogs belonging to the medium series are the series 403, 413, 406, 416, 426, and 419. These models were offered with three different wheelbases (2,380&nbsp;mm, 2,900&nbsp;mm, 3,400&nbsp;mm) and two engines, the straight-four and straight-six direct injected Diesel engines OM&nbsp;314 and OM&nbsp;352, ranging from 54&nbsp;DIN-PS to 110&nbsp;DIN-PS (40&nbsp;kW \u2013 81&nbsp;kW). The light series 421 and 431 share their frame design with the 411-series, but borrow their drivetrain and cab design from the 406-series, which is why they also count as 406-related Unimogs.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}, p. 11</ref>\n\nThe heavy series Unimogs were introduced in 1974, and first featured the edgy cab, which is still a design feature of the Unimog today. The first heavy series Unimog was the 425-series, which was available from 1976.<ref group=\"N\">Mercedes-Benz presented the 425 in 1974, and the 435 in 1975.

New models introduced with this programme were the new light series 407 and medium series 417, which ought to replace all Unimog 406-related series.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog.

The short bonnet allows good visibility]]\n\n=== Chassis ===\nLike other trucks, but unlike agricultural tractors, the Unimog is a body-on-frame vehicle with short overhangs. The original Unimog was made with a plane ladder frame<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond-Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 82</ref> and a wheelbase of 1720&nbsp;mm. Later, the wheelbase was extended several times to accommodate customer needs. Starting in the mid-1950s, with the introduction of the Unimog 404, the frame received a drop. Originally, this was done to make space for a spare tyre, but soon engineers found out that the new frame would improve the torsion performance, which is why all following Unimog series also received a frame with a drop.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}, p. 45</ref> Several mounting brackets, additional cross members and tool boards were offered as factory options for the frame.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond-Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 79</ref>\n\n=== Suspension ===\nThe Unimog has live front and rear axles that have portal gears ([[portal axle]]s). Such axles have a lifted axle centre, but the wheels' centre remains unchanged, meaning that a high ground clearance can be achieved with small wheels and tyres. Unlike \"regular\" trucks, the Unimog has [[coil spring]]s with hydraulic [[shock absorber]]s rather than [[leaf spring]]s, as coil springs provide more spring travel. The axles themselves have only one longitudinal pivot point each, the so-called [[torque tube]]s. The torque tubes contain the drive shafts and connect the axles' differential gearboxes to the Unimog gearbox, but being also parts of the suspension system, the torque tubes prevent longitudinal movement of the axles, whilst still allowing limited vertical movement. Lateral axle movement is prevented by [[panhard rod]]s and [[transverse link]]s. This design results in extreme axle angle offsets of up to 30\u00b0 possible.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 36\u201340</ref>\n\nA wide variety of wheels and tyres were available for the Unimog. Originally, the first Unimog was equipped with 6.5\u201318&nbsp;in tyres designed for both on- and offroad use.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: ''Typengeschichte und Technik''. GeraMond, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 48 and 49</ref> Later, bigger wheels and tyres with different tread patterns were available, reaching from agricultural tractor tread patterns to massive bar tyre treads to low pressure ballon tyre treads. Until 1973, drum brakes were standard for all Unimogs, until they were replaced by disc brakes, however, until 1989, drum brakes remained an option for Unimogs of the 406-family.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 78</ref> The steering system used to be a screw-and-nut system until 1970. Then it was replaced by a power assisted ball-and-nut system for the 406-series.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406 \u2013 Typengeschichte und Technik. Geramond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 77</ref>\n\n=== Drivetrain ===\nThe classical Unimog is rear-wheel drive vehicle, meaning that the rear axle is directly connected to the gearbox. Turning on front wheel drive automatically locks both axles, without torque compensation. The mechanical lever that turns on all wheel drive has a third position that locks front- and rear differentials. As of 1963, a pneumatic power switch was used instead of a lever. Due to the reduction gears inside the portal axles, the rotational frequency of the driveshafts inside the torque tubes is relatively high, meaning that the amount of torque they have to withstand is fairly low.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 406: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond, M\u00fcnchen 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-576-8}}. p. 23</ref>\n\n=== Gearbox ===\nTraditionally, the Unimog has a splitter gearbox. Over the years, three different ''base gearbox'' designs were used, all following the same principle, and having four gears and two ranges (called ''groups'') and an additional direction gear. Those designs were ''UG-1/xx'', ''UG-2/xx'', and ''UG-3/xx''. UG is an abbreviation for ''Unimog-Getriebe (Unimog-Gearbox)'', the number after the slash resembles the input torque in [[Kilopondmetre|kp\u00b7m]] (=9.80665&nbsp;N\u00b7m).<ref group=\"N\">The kilopondmetre (kp\u00b7m) is the traditional technical unit of torque used in many European countries until the early 1980s. It equals the force that a mass of 1 kilogram applies. If the acceleration is exactly 9.80665&nbsp;m\u00b7s<sup>&minus;2</sup> (default gravitational acceleration), this equals 9.80665&nbsp;N\u00b7m.</ref> Until 1955, the Unimog ''base gearbox'' UG-1 was a constant-mesh countershaft gearbox, it was then upgraded with synchroniser rings to a synchromesh gearbox. However, the synchromesh-version was only used for the [[Unimog 404|404-series]], and the constant-mesh version remained the standard gearbox for the 411-series. In 1957, the synchromesh-version became an option for the 411-series, before it became the standard gearbox for all Unimogs in 1959.<ref name=\"Carl-Heinz Vogler 2014\">Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik. GeraMond-Verlag, M\u00fcnchen 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-86245-605-5}}. p. 38 and 39</ref> The following gearbox versions UG-2 and UG-3 were made as synchromesh versions only.\n\nThere are different ''layouts'' of the gearbox, namely ''F-layout'' and ''G-layout'' as well as their upgraded layouts, not having particular names. The F-layout is the original gearbox layout and is limited to the first two gears in the first range as it does not have selector sleeves, meaning that in total there are six forward gears. Instead of a reverse gear, the gearbox has its direction gear, which, in therory, can be used to reverse any gear. Due to the lacking shifting sleeves however, the reverse direction can only be used in the first range, which itself is limited to the first two gears, resulting in only two reverse gears (resulting in 6 forward and 2 reverse gears). To operate the gearbox, there is only one shift lever with a 6-speed H-layout, the gearbox shifts its ranges automatically. An additional shift lever is used for shifting into reverse. The ''G-layout'' has an additional reduction gearbox, which can be used in all gears. This effectively doubles the number of gears (12 forward and 4 reverse gears). This reduction gearbox was also available with an additional crawler gear, which can only be used in the first range (20 forward and 8 reverse gears). As of 1976, shifting sleeves were added and a 4-speed-H-layout replaced the 6-speed-H-layout, which allows using all gears in all ranges.<ref name=\"Gearbox\">Helmut Schmitz: ''[https://www.unimog-community.de/2012/08/20/getriebevarianten-u-406u-421/ Getriebevarianten U 406/U 421]''. August 20th, 2012. Retrieved May 19th, 2017 (in German)</ref> With the introduction of the UG-3-gearbox, the standard gearbox-shifter-layout was changed to an 8-speed-H-H-layout, with 8 gears on one lever, without any additional switches. When shifting from \"4th\" into \"5th\" gear, the gearbox automatically shifts into range 2 and back into gear 1. Crawler gearboxes were offered as a factory option for the UG-3 gearbox as well, resulting in 24 gears. The design with the additional direction gear was kept, which means that all 24 gears can also be used in reverse mode. Since the highest final gear ratio allows top speeds of up to 110&nbsp;km/h, and the reverse gear only comes with a small reduction of 1:1.03, the top speed in reverse mode is more than 100&nbsp;km/h. To prevent such high reverse speeds, a lock for the second range was available as a factory option, allowing only the first range (gears \"1\" to \"4\") in reverse mode.<ref>Oldtimer Traktor Heft 11-12/2012</ref>\n\n=== Engine ===\nThe initial Unimogs were equipped with passenger car engines, the first Unimog series to receive a truck engine was the 406-series in 1963. All engines use the [[Diesel engine|Diesel principle]], except for engines used for the Unimog 404-series and the first four Unimog prototypes, which use the [[Otto cycle|Otto principle]]. The following engines were used as of 1947, with ''M'' being Otto and ''OM'' being Diesel engines (the list is incomplete):\n\n* [[Mercedes-Benz M136 engine|M&nbsp;136]]<ref name=\"Carl-Heinz Vogler 1993\">Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog.

Because the Unimog was designed to be a better agricultural tractor, its original design did not include a closed cab (as agricultural tractors in Germany usually did not have a closed cab in the 1940s). The first Unimog series to be officially offered with a cab was the 401-series. However, the first cabs were made by Westfalia in Rheda-Wiedenbr\u00fcck and then shipped to the Unimog plant in Gaggenau for assembly. These cabs are known as ''Westfalia type B'' or simply ''Froschauge'' (frog's eye). Starting in 1957, a new cab with 30% more volume, called ''Westfalia type DvF'', Typ D, verbreitertes Fahrerhaus (Type D, widened cab), was used. Both Westfalia cabs were fairly narrow and came with the problem of engine heat causing high cabin temperatures.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Unimog 411: Typengeschichte und Technik.

Soon after, the French army purchased Unimogs of the series 2010 and 401. The Unimog proved to be so successful, that Daimler-Benz was ordered to develop an entirely new Unimog just for military purposes. This new model was supposed to be a small 1.5-tonne truck, capable of carrying 10 to 12 soldiers on its bed, at a speed of up to 90&nbsp;km/h, rather than being an agricultural tractor. Being a NATO member state, France demanded that the military Unimog would have an engine running on petrol.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog. Alle Unimog-Klassiker seit 1946 bis 1993.

Most Unimog models found in North America have been imported by individual dealers or independent enthusiasts.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1980 the [[Case Corporation]] (now merged into [[CNH Industrial#CNH Global|CNH Global]]) imported the U-900 model into the United States and sold it through Case tractor dealerships as the MB4/94.\n\nIn 2002 DaimlerChrysler tried to re-enter the North American market and engaged in four years of aggressive marketing, such as truck and trade shows, exposure on the television show ''[[Modern Marvels]]'', numerous magazine articles and extensive demonstrations (both touring and on an individual basis).

High-powered factory-sponsored entries of truck companies aiming for the overall win have since taken the laurels, with Unimogs used mainly for service purposes.\n\n== Derivatives ==\n=== MB Trac ===\nIn 1973 the Unimog department in Gaggenau also designed the [[MB Trac]], a more tractor-like version. It was produced by Daimler-Benz until 1991, when the product line was sold to '''Werner Forst- und Industrietechnik''', who continues to produce it as the '''[[WF trac]]'''. It is sold and maintained by Mercedes Unimog dealers.\n\n=== Military derivatives ===\n[[File:UR-416.jpg|thumb|UR-416, a police vehicle based on an Unimog 416 chassis.]]\nThe Unimog also serves as a technical platform for armoured vehicles like the [[ATF Dingo]], a mine-protected utility and reconnaissance vehicle used by the German and other European Armed Forces (e.g. Belgium) for territorial defence purposes as well as in international missions.\n\nIn late Autumn 1956, Daimler-Benz started developing a new military version of the Unimog, the ''Unimog SH''. It was based on the [[Unimog S]] and had a rear engine (German: Heckmotor), hence the name Unimog ''SH''.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog. Alle Unimog-Klassiker seit 1946 bis 1993.

Initially, the Belgian Army intended to purchase these vehicle for their police forces in the [[Belgian Congo]], but only 9 vehicles were actually sold to the Belgian forces; the 15 remaining vehicles were purchased by the [[Irish Army]] in 1972.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog.

The type had excellent off-road capability but poor on-road handling due to a high centre of gravity and several accidents occurred as a result. A four-man dismountable squad was carried, but space was cramped, and in any case a four-man detachment was far too small for any sort of realistic military purpose. Other considerations were that the [[FN MAG]] gunner's position was too exposed. Eventually the Unimog Scout Cars arrived in Ireland in February 1972, their departure having been delayed by a local peace group who thought they were destined for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA). By mid-1978 all had been transferred to the [[Irish Army Reserve]], the FCA. All were withdrawn by 1984, and two are preserved; one in the transport museum in [[Howth]] Co Dublin and one in the [[Muckleburgh Collection]], England.\n\nAn updated version of the Unimog SH, the Unimog T was made for the German Bundeswehr in 1962. The German defence ministry decided not to purchase the Unimog T, which is why it was never put into series production.<ref>Carl-Heinz Vogler: Typenatlas Unimog.

The Unimog was designed with equal-sized wheels, a mounting bracket in front, a hitch in the rear, and loading space in the center. This was to make it a multi-purpose vehicle that farmers could use in the field and on the highway.<ref name=\"Nellinger_7\" />\n\nAlbert Friedrich was granted permission to develop the Unimog in November 1945,<ref name=\"Vogler_p6\" /> and entered a production agreement with Erhard und S\u00f6hne (Erhard and Sons) in [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]] on 1 December 1945.<ref name=\"Nellinger_7\" /> Development began on 1 January 1946. Soon after, Heinrich R\u00f6\u00dfler, the Unimog lead designer, joined the development team. The first prototype was ready by the end of 1946.

To actually serve the agricultural market, Daimler-Benz designed a completely new agricultural tractor in 1972, the [[MB Trac]]. It is a body-on-frame design ''trac''-tractor, has four big wheels of the same size, and all-wheel-drive, a slim bonnet, and an angular driver cab. In contrast to conventional tractors the cab is situated between the axles, similar to comparable four-wheel-drive tractors. There is no articulation between the front and rear sections, instead, the MB Trac has conventional steering.\n\nA wide range of MB Trac tractors were offered, ranging from the entry model MB-trac 65 to the top model MB Trac 1800 intercooler. Daimler-Benz later merged the MB-trac with the agricultural machinery activities of [[Deutz AG]]. The manufacturing of the MB Trac series was ceased in 1991.\n\n==== 1974 \u2013 Heavy series ====\n{{Main article|Unimog 425}}\nIn 1974, Mercedes-Benz presented the new Unimog U 120. It was the first model of the \"heavy duty\" Unimog series 425. The heavy duty series, or simply \"heavy\" series, extended the Unimog model lineup. The characteristic \"edgy\" bonnet introduced with the heavy Unimog series remains am Unimog style element to this day.\n\nThe series 425 have a {{Convert|2810|mm|in|abbr=on}} wheelbase, 9&nbsp;t permissible maximum mass and an OM 352 Diesel engine producing {{Convert|120|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (shortly thereafter {{Convert|125|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} as U 125).\n\n==== 1975 \u2013 Series 435 ====\n{{Main|Unimog 435}}\nManufacture of the series 435 for the [[Bundeswehr]] began in 1975, as a successor of the Unimog S&nbsp;404. The 435 was characterized by a long wheelbase of {{Convert|3250|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|3700|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} or {{Convert|3850|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} and shares its cab with the series 425.\n\n==== 1976 \u2013 Unimog models renamed ====\n[[File:Unimog U1300.jpg|thumb|right|Unimog U 1300 municipal truck in [[R\u0113zekne]], [[Latvia]]]]\nThe new 424 \"middle\" series of Unimogs was produced starting from 1976. They share the cab with the series-425 and are designated U 1000, U 1300/L, U 1500, and U 1700/L with {{Convert|124|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} engine performance.\n\nIn the same period Daimler-Benz re-ordered the type designations for the older series. The classical round form series of the Unimog were now designated U 600/L, U 800/L, U 900 and U 1100/L. (The letter L stands for a long wheelbase, because most models were available in two wheelbase variants.)\n\nThe Unimog with the rounded driving cab became known as the ''light'' series. The new series with angular cab was divided by payload into a ''middle'' and ''heavy'' series. Some engines overlap \u2013 the Unimog nomenclature is not simple to understand (see below for notes on series names).\n\nThe long-proven Unimog-S (404), although with clearly decreasing production figures, was the only Unimog with an Otto cycle engine in the lineup.\n\nWith the exception of the entry-level model, all Unimogs for 1976 were equipped with four wheel [[disc brakes]].\n\n==== 1977 \u2013 200,000th Unimog ====\nThe 200,000th Unimog, a 424.121, was produced in 1977.<ref name=\"Unimog 1976 bis 1985\" />\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1980, production of the U 404 (Unimog S) ended.\n\nThe light and medium series 407 and 427 were introduced in 1985.\n\nProduction of the 406 and 416 ceased in 1988 and the 437-series was introduced the same year.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n==== 1992 \u2013 New light models ====\n[[File:Blue Unimog 408 or 418 pickup truck.jpg|thumb|Unimog 408 [[dump truck]]]]\nIn the early 1990s, the new light models 408 (U 90) and 418 (U 110-U 140) with newly designed cabins were introduced to replace the predecessor models. The new very diagonal front portion gives the operator a good overview forward. The 408 features an asymmetric front bonnet, which is lower on the driver's side. This is supposed to permit the driver a good overview. A new ladder frame and progressively working coil springs to improve the Unimog's handling were implemented. In addition to that, the Unimog received a new tyre pressure adjustment system that can be operated whilst driving, an anti-skid system, new engines, and a \"Servolock\" mechanism for the hydraulic connection of implements.\n\n==== 1994 \u2013 The \"Funmog\" ====\nIn March 1994, Mercedes-Benz presented the design concept \"Funmog\", a luxury version of the Unimog, on the International Off-Road-Exhibition in K\u00f6ln, Germany.

It is a similar luxury offering comparable to the Funmog.\n\nStarting from June 2006 the UGN series was produced with \"BlueTec\" technology so that the future exhaust limit [[Euro IV]] requirements would be met. With that a new packaging of the vehicle and new design designations are connected (old design +1, e.g. from 405.100 becomes 405.101)\n\nAt the IAA 2006 commercial vehicle show in Hanover a new Unimog'' U&nbsp;20 '' was presented, which was to be available at the end of 2007. The most striking feature is the [[cab over]] design with no vestigial front bonnet characteristic of the traditional Unimog. It has a total mass of 7,500&nbsp;kg up to 8,500&nbsp;kg. The underlying technology comes from the U 300. The driving cab is from the new Brazilian Accelo light truck (Caminh\u00f5es Leves) series.

It is obtained from the dried [[rhizome]] and [[root]]s of ''[[Carapichea ipecacuanha]]'' from which it derives its name. \n\nIn particular, the rapidly induced [[projectile vomiting|forceful vomiting]] produced by ipecac was considered for many years to be an important [[first aid|front-line]] treatment for orally ingested [[poisons]]. However, subsequent studies (including a comprehensive 2005 meta-study) revealed the stomach purging produced by ipecac to be far less effective at lowering total body poison concentrations than the absorption effect of oral [[Activated charcoal (medication)|activated charcoal]] (which is effective through the entire gastrointestinal tract and is often coupled with [[whole bowel irrigation]]). Ipecac also presents a small risk of [[overdose]] (being a mild poison itself) and a major risk of [[esophagitis]] and [[aspiration pneumonia]] if used to purge [[corrosive]] poisons. Having long been replaced (even in the emetic role) by more effective medications, the [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] now advises that \"Ipecac syrup is no longer recommended for routine management of outpatient ingestions of medications or other chemicals.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ashp.org/menu/DrugShortages/DrugsNoLongerAvailable/Bulletin.aspx?id=468 | work = Discontinued Drug Bulletin | title = Ipecac Syrup }}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\nThe commercial preparation of ipecac consists of 1/14 of an alcoholic extract of the roots and [[rhizome]]s of [[Carapichea ipecacuanha]].

It is obtained from the dried [[rhizome]] and [[root]]s of ''[[Carapichea ipecacuanha]]'' from which it derives its name. \n\nIn particular, the rapidly induced [[projectile vomiting|forceful vomiting]] produced by ipecac was considered for many years to be an important [[first aid|front-line]] treatment for orally ingested [[poisons]]. However, subsequent studies (including a comprehensive 2005 meta-study) revealed the stomach purging produced by ipecac to be far less effective at lowering total body poison concentrations than the absorption effect of oral [[Activated charcoal (medication)|activated charcoal]] (which is effective through the entire gastrointestinal tract and is often coupled with [[whole bowel irrigation]]). Ipecac also presents a small risk of [[overdose]] (being a mild poison itself) and a major risk of [[esophagitis]] and [[aspiration pneumonia]] if used to purge [[corrosive]] poisons. Having long been replaced (even in the emetic role) by more effective medications, the [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] now advises that \"Ipecac syrup is no longer recommended for routine management of outpatient ingestions of medications or other chemicals.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ashp.org/menu/DrugShortages/DrugsNoLongerAvailable/Bulletin.aspx?id=468 | work = Discontinued Drug Bulletin | title = Ipecac Syrup }}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\nThe commercial preparation of ipecac consists of 1/14 of an alcoholic extract of the roots and [[rhizome]]s of [[Carapichea ipecacuanha]].

In English-speaking areas, the series has been licensed by [[Funimation]] for distribution in North America, and [[Manga Entertainment]] for the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"release\"/>\n\n==Story==\nThe show revolves around the exploits of the Anarchy sisters, Panty and Stocking, angels who were kicked out of [[Heaven]] due to their bad behavior. They are sent to Daten City\u2014a pun on the Japanese word {{nihongo|''datenshi''|\u5815\u5929\u4f7f||lit. \"fallen angel\"}}\u2014a place on the border between Heaven and [[Hell]], which is besieged by evil spirits referred to as \"Ghosts\". The sisters take refuge under the care of the reverend Garterbelt; under his watchful eyes, the sisters are tasked with using their ability to transform their [[lingerie]] into weapons, and using them to destroy malicious Ghosts. By doing so, the sisters earn \"Heaven Coins\" with which they intend to one day buy their way back into Heaven. However, Panty and Stocking are constantly sidetracked by their respective interests in men and sugary sweets.\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the broadcast of Imaishi's previous project, ''[[Gurren Lagann]]'', the show's staff went on a trip for rest and relaxation. At that time, they aired their opinions to each other under drunken and humorous circumstances, saying such things as \"Next time, I want to try this\" in approaches to animation. Almost all of the concepts for the anime was made during the initial trip; the names of main characters, \"Panty\" and \"Stocking\", were coined at the very first meeting.<ref name=\"Young Ace interview\">{{cite interview|title=Young Ace interview|subject=[[Hiroyuki Imaishi]]|interviewer=''[[Young Ace]]''|date=November 2010}}</ref> Hiromi Wakabayashi, who provided the initial idea for the series, cited American [[adult animation]], such as ''[[Drawn Together]]'', as inspiration for the show's crudeness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grantalexander.blogspot.com/2011/02/gainax-at-pixar.html|title=Gainax at Pixar|publisher=Grant Alexander|access-date=November 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218144620/https://grantalexander.blogspot.com/2011/02/gainax-at-pixar.html|archive-date=December 18, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Heroes===\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Panty}}|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3|Panti}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Arisa Ogasawara]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name=\"funicast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/04/28/funimation-announces-panty-stocking-with-garterbelt-english-cast-and-debut-trailer |title=FUNimation Announces \"Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt\" English Cast and Debut Trailer |publisher=Crunchyroll |first=Humberto|last=Saabedra | date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>}}\n:Panty is a blonde-haired pale-skinned angel whose only interests are looking for men to sleep with and basking in the popularity of being an Anarchy sister. She does not take her Ghost-hunting duties as seriously as her sister Stocking, instead preferring to fulfill her personal goal of having sex with 1,000 men on Earth before returning to Heaven. She is generally rude and aggressive to the people around her (including Garterbelt, Brief, Stocking, the men she sleeps with, and most prominently Chuck), and is fond of living the celebrity lifestyle of being an Anarchy sister because it brings her closer to the men and fame she craves. However, she does occasionally exhibit affection toward Stocking and a deep desire for what she believes is best for her, despite their frequent arguing. Although she frequently insults Brief, she sometimes shows a less shallow side to her personality with others. She has the ability to transform her panties into a pistol called {{Nihongo|Backlace|\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Bakkur\u0113su}}. She occasionally wields a second Backlace using Stocking's panties, doubling her firepower and allowing her to combine them into more advanced firearms such as a [[submachine gun]] or [[sniper rifle]]. She can weaponize male underwear, though the weapon's size and usefulness depends on the size of the original wearer's penis.\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Stocking}}|\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Sutokkingu}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mariya Ise]]|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name=\"funicast\"/>}}\n:Stocking is a pink-and-violet-haired [[Goth subculture|goth]] angel with pale skin and a gluttonous appetite for sugary foods. She doesn't gain weight from consuming sugar, saying that the fat goes to her breasts, allowing her to eat to her heart's content. Although she is generally more level-headed than Panty, she can be just as rude as her sister when angry, particularly when people tamper with her sweets or call her overweight. Whilst she doesn't have the same level of interest in sex as her sister, she does show sexual urges and interests and is generally more interested in masochistic activities, such as [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] and electrocution. Like Panty, Stocking houses more tender feelings than what she usually lets on. For example, despite finding most human men disgusting, she fell deeply in love with a morbid ghost, going so far as attempting to turn her back on Heaven to be with him. She has forgiven Panty on occasions of mistreatment. Her stockings transform into a pair of katanas called {{Nihongo|Stripe I|\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7I|Sutoraipu Wan}} and {{Nihongo|Stripe II|\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7II|Sutoraipu Ts\u016b}}.

He relays missions from Heaven to Panty and Stocking, and is constantly annoyed by their erratic behavior and lack of commitment to tasks at hand. Though vocal about keeping order in Daten City, he practices bondage and displays [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|interest in young males]], particularly Brief, and uses a masked alias called \"Master G\" to disguise himself while undertaking such hobbies. In his youth, he was a brutal thug who committed a wide array of crimes including robbery, prostitution, selling drugs and murder. When he is gunned down and sent to Heaven, God tasks him with finding the blood kin of Hell's Monkey, who possesses the key to unlocking Hell's Gate. Because of his initial refusal of the task, he is cursed with [[immortality]] and forbidden from dying until he fulfills his given task. Despite his efforts to guide and care for Panty and Stocking, they take very little interest in him or his job and do not appear moved at all when he is seemingly killed by his archenemy Corset.\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Chuck}}|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Chakku}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takashi Nakamura]]|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]<ref name=\"funicast\"/>}}\n:Panty and Stocking's sidekick, a [[green]] [[dog]]-like creature, actually a restrained Bull Ghost, with zippers on his body, who closely resembles the character [[GIR (Invader Zim)|GIR]] from ''[[Invader Zim]]''.<ref name=\"gir\">{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-10-05/invader-zim-creator-comments-on-panty-and-stocking|title=Invader Zim Creator Comments on Panty & Stocking|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Chuck is subject to mortal injuries throughout the course of the series, along with often unprovoked abuse from Panty and Stocking, quickly recovering each time.

Despite this, he has a crush on Panty, who is impassive to his advances.

Panty and Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and try to live peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts killing each other or peacefully accomplishing what they wanted to achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever Panty and Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a [[paper-mache]] model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Scanty}}|\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3|Sukyanti}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yuka Komatsu]]|[[Colleen Clinkenbeard]]<ref name=\"funicast\"/>}}\n:The older of the Demon sisters, Corset's minion and Panty's arch rival, who oversee the creation of Ghosts in Daten City while acting as the mayor's daughter in public.

She speaks and dresses formally, and is normally well-mannered, but easily loses her temper whenever her plans fall apart. With her sister Kneesocks, Scanty comes up with schemes to kill or otherwise humiliate the Anarchy sisters, though they are often foiled by her excitable nature. Scanty wears two pairs of panties that transform into [[revolver]]s called {{nihongo|Double Gold Lacytanga|\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30ac|Daburu G\u014drudo R\u0113sh\u012btanga}}, which she can combine into a [[shotgun]].

She shares her sister's formality and obsession with rules, but is calmer and more composed than Scanty whenever the Anarchy sisters derail their plans. She is prone to blushing whenever she does get excited, which causes her face to turn a lighter shade of red.

The series ran from October 1 to December 24, 2010 on BS Nittele (a free-to-air satellite service of [[Nippon Television]]). In English-speaking areas, the series has been licensed by [[Funimation]] for distribution in North America, and [[Manga Entertainment]] for the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"release\"/>\n\n==Story==\nThe show revolves around the exploits of the Anarchy sisters, Panty and Stocking, angels who were kicked out of [[Heaven]] due to their bad behavior. They are sent to Daten City\u2014a pun on the Japanese word {{nihongo|''datenshi''|\u5815\u5929\u4f7f||lit. \"fallen angel\"}}\u2014a place on the border between Heaven and [[Hell]], which is besieged by evil spirits referred to as \"Ghosts\". The sisters take refuge under the care of the reverend Garterbelt; under his watchful eyes, the sisters are tasked with using their ability to transform their [[lingerie]] into weapons, and using them to destroy malicious Ghosts. By doing so, the sisters earn \"Heaven Coins\" with which they intend to one day buy their way back into Heaven. However, Panty and Stocking are constantly sidetracked by their respective interests in men and sugary sweets.\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the broadcast of Imaishi's previous project, ''[[Gurren Lagann]]'', the show's staff went on a trip for rest and relaxation. At that time, they aired their opinions to each other under drunken and humorous circumstances, saying such things as \"Next time, I want to try this\" in approaches to animation. Almost all of the concepts for the anime was made during the initial trip; the names of main characters, \"Panty\" and \"Stocking\", were coined at the very first meeting.<ref name=\"Young Ace interview\">{{cite interview|title=Young Ace interview|subject=[[Hiroyuki Imaishi]]|interviewer=''[[Young Ace]]''|date=November 2010}}</ref> Hiromi Wakabayashi, who provided the initial idea for the series, cited American [[adult animation]], such as ''[[Drawn Together]]'', as inspiration for the show's crudeness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grantalexander.blogspot.com/2011/02/gainax-at-pixar.html|title=Gainax at Pixar|publisher=Grant Alexander|access-date=November 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218144620/https://grantalexander.blogspot.com/2011/02/gainax-at-pixar.html|archive-date=December 18, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Heroes===\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Panty}}|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3|Panti}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Arisa Ogasawara]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name=\"funicast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/04/28/funimation-announces-panty-stocking-with-garterbelt-english-cast-and-debut-trailer |title=FUNimation Announces \"Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt\" English Cast and Debut Trailer |publisher=Crunchyroll |first=Humberto|last=Saabedra | date=2012-04-28 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>}}\n:Panty is a blonde-haired pale-skinned angel whose only interests are looking for men to sleep with and basking in the popularity of being an Anarchy sister. She does not take her Ghost-hunting duties as seriously as her sister Stocking, instead preferring to fulfill her personal goal of having sex with 1,000 men on Earth before returning to Heaven. She is generally rude and aggressive to the people around her (including Garterbelt, Brief, Stocking, the men she sleeps with, and most prominently Chuck), and is fond of living the celebrity lifestyle of being an Anarchy sister because it brings her closer to the men and fame she craves. However, she does occasionally exhibit affection toward Stocking and a deep desire for what she believes is best for her, despite their frequent arguing. Although she frequently insults Brief, she sometimes shows a less shallow side to her personality with others. She has the ability to transform her panties into a pistol called {{Nihongo|Backlace|\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Bakkur\u0113su}}. She occasionally wields a second Backlace using Stocking's panties, doubling her firepower and allowing her to combine them into more advanced firearms such as a [[submachine gun]] or [[sniper rifle]]. She can weaponize male underwear, though the weapon's size and usefulness depends on the size of the original wearer's penis.\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Stocking}}|\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Sutokkingu}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Mariya Ise]]|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name=\"funicast\"/>}}\n:Stocking is a pink-and-violet-haired [[Goth subculture|goth]] angel with pale skin and a gluttonous appetite for sugary foods. She doesn't gain weight from consuming sugar, saying that the fat goes to her breasts, allowing her to eat to her heart's content. Although she is generally more level-headed than Panty, she can be just as rude as her sister when angry, particularly when people tamper with her sweets or call her overweight. Whilst she doesn't have the same level of interest in sex as her sister, she does show sexual urges and interests and is generally more interested in masochistic activities, such as [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] and electrocution. Like Panty, Stocking houses more tender feelings than what she usually lets on. For example, despite finding most human men disgusting, she fell deeply in love with a morbid ghost, going so far as attempting to turn her back on Heaven to be with him. She has forgiven Panty on occasions of mistreatment. Her stockings transform into a pair of katanas called {{Nihongo|Stripe I|\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7I|Sutoraipu Wan}} and {{Nihongo|Stripe II|\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d7II|Sutoraipu Ts\u016b}}.

He relays missions from Heaven to Panty and Stocking, and is constantly annoyed by their erratic behavior and lack of commitment to tasks at hand. Though vocal about keeping order in Daten City, he practices bondage and displays [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|interest in young males]], particularly Brief, and uses a masked alias called \"Master G\" to disguise himself while undertaking such hobbies. In his youth, he was a brutal thug who committed a wide array of crimes including robbery, prostitution, selling drugs and murder. When he is gunned down and sent to Heaven, God tasks him with finding the blood kin of Hell's Monkey, who possesses the key to unlocking Hell's Gate. Because of his initial refusal of the task, he is cursed with [[immortality]] and forbidden from dying until he fulfills his given task. Despite his efforts to guide and care for Panty and Stocking, they take very little interest in him or his job and do not appear moved at all when he is seemingly killed by his archenemy Corset.\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Chuck}}|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Chakku}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Takashi Nakamura]]|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]<ref name=\"funicast\"/>}}\n:Panty and Stocking's sidekick, a [[green]] [[dog]]-like creature, actually a restrained Bull Ghost, with zippers on his body, who closely resembles the character [[GIR (Invader Zim)|GIR]] from ''[[Invader Zim]]''.<ref name=\"gir\">{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-10-05/invader-zim-creator-comments-on-panty-and-stocking|title=Invader Zim Creator Comments on Panty & Stocking|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Chuck is subject to mortal injuries throughout the course of the series, along with often unprovoked abuse from Panty and Stocking, quickly recovering each time.

He carries a backpack-like device capable of detecting Ghosts and blowing smokescreen, which occasionally helps the Anarchy sisters in their duties.

Panty and Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and try to live peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts killing each other or peacefully accomplishing what they wanted to achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever Panty and Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a [[paper-mache]] model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.\n;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Scanty}}|\u30b9\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3|Sukyanti}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yuka Komatsu]]|[[Colleen Clinkenbeard]]<ref name=\"funicast\"/>}}\n:The older of the Demon sisters, Corset's minion and Panty's arch rival, who oversee the creation of Ghosts in Daten City while acting as the mayor's daughter in public.

She speaks and dresses formally, and is normally well-mannered, but easily loses her temper whenever her plans fall apart. With her sister Kneesocks, Scanty comes up with schemes to kill or otherwise humiliate the Anarchy sisters, though they are often foiled by her excitable nature.

The improved 412 ran from 1985 to 1989, bringing to an end Ferrari's longest-ever production series.\n\nAlthough the option of an automatic transmission indicates it may have been designed for the American market, no version of these grand tourers was ever officially imported there as [[Enzo Ferrari]] believed that constantly evolving environmental and safety regulations of the '70s and early '80s meant it wasn't worth federalizing and then continuously keeping the cars updated to US-spec for the limited market of a top of the line expensive GT.  It was decided the company's 8 cylinder cars would suffice in the US market.<ref name=yang>{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Tom|title=How the Boxer came to America|journal=Forza|date=May 2011|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>  Many, however, entered as [[Grey import vehicle|grey import]]s.\n{{TOC left}}{{clear}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Ferrari 365 GT4 2+2 in North London - 1974.jpg|thumbnail|The 365 GT4 2+2 followed a [[three-box]] design]]\nFerrari turned to frequent styling partner [[Leonardo Fioravanti (engineer)|Leonardo Fioravanti]] at [[Pininfarina]],  whose [[three-box]] design for the 365 GT4 2+2 was a clear departure from its [[fastback]] predecessor, the 365 GTC/4. It followed Fioravanti's [[Ferrari Daytona|Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona]] as the second Ferrari to feature the characteristic ''swage line'' dividing the body into upper and lower halves.\n\nVarious coachbuilders, such as [[Carrozzeria Pavesi]] and [[Straman]], offered [[convertible]] conversions of the 400 series. Switzerland's Felber also showed a [[shooting brake]] version on 400 GT basis called the Felber Croisette at the 1981 [[Geneva Motor Show|Geneva Salon de l'Auto]].<ref>[[#AK82|''Auto Katalog 1982'']], p. 138</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Specifications==\nThe tubular steel [[chassis]] was based on that of the GTC/4, but the wheelbase was lengthened {{convert|200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The bodies were [[steel]], with a [[fiberglass]] floor; they were manufactured by Pininfarina at its [[Turin]] plant, then shipped fully finished to Modena where Ferrari assembled the cars. \nSuspension consisted of [[double wishbone]]s, [[coil spring]]s coaxial with the [[shock absorber]]s, and [[anti-roll bar]]s all around; the rear axle featured a [[hydraulic]] [[Self-levelling suspension|self-levelling system]].\nUnder the bonnet there was a ''Tipo F 101'' [[Ferrari Colombo engine|Colombo]] V12 that underwent many changes through the years. It was an [[Aluminium alloy|alloy]] [[Cylinder head|head]] and [[Engine block|block]], [[DOHC|four overhead cam]]s, 24-valve unit using [[wet sump]] lubrication.\nThe [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was conventionally coupled directly to the engine, as on the GTC/4, with a [[driveshaft]] connecting it to the rear [[limited slip differential]]. The [[steering]] was [[Power steering|servo-assisted]]. Brakes were [[Disc brake|disc]]s on all four wheels.\n\n{|class=wikitable width=100%\n|-\n! Model !! Engine type !! Displacement !!
