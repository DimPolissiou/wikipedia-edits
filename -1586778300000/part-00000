Thus Blake is able to show the cyclical monotony that the protagonists are suffering, while at the same time giving a forward note of impetus and hope to the movement of the lines.\n\nThe rhyme scheme is abab, cdcd; all the rhymes are masculine.\n\nThe ambiguous use of the word \"Ah,\" (a note of delight, surprise, pity?) and the repetition of the word \"where\" are noteworthy - these are discussed by Grant;<ref name=\"Grant\">{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=John E.|title=The fate of Blake's Sunflower : a forecast and some conclusions|journal=Blake studies|year=1974|volume=5 | issue = 2|pages=7\u201364}}</ref> the disturbance of the anapaestic rhythm in line three by Edwards.<ref name=\"Edwards\">{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Thomas R.|title=Imagination and power : a study of poetry on public themes|year=1971|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/imaginationpower00edwa/page/232 232.

Grant<ref name=\"Grant\"/> gives the most comprehensive overview of the poem.\n\nNorthrop Frye believed that the \"merging of imagination and time is the axis on which all Blake's thought turns.\"<ref name=\"Frye\">{{cite book|last=Frye|first=Northrop|title=Fearful symmetry : a study of William Blake|url=https://archive.org/details/fearfulsymmetrys0000frye_7|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=462. p.299}}</ref>\"Ah! Sun-flower\" (with its constrictions of space-time and its hint at creative, energetic imagination as a potential way out) seems to be an example of this dialectic, as the various responses of critics outlined below show. Another key to Blake's thought mentioned by Frye is that for \"Blake,...the fall of man\" (see:[[Fall of Man]]) \"and the creation of the physical world were the same event.\" The world we see and live in is therefore a \"fallen\" natural world (a world of \"[[Generation]]\") in which, since \"God is Man\", humans are \"miserable in the state of nature.\"<ref>Frye, 1969, p.41</ref>\n\nThe poem has three main (ambiguous) elements of interest: the \"sweet, golden clime,\" the Sunflower, and the Youth and Virgin. The poem's ambiguities concerning the speaker's (not necessarily Blake's) stance on the attainability or otherwise, and on the nature, of the \"sweet golden clime\" (the West, Heaven, Eden?), have led to different, sometimes conflicting views of the poem. Leader<ref>Leader, 1981, p.166-167</ref> notes the \"critical controversy surrounding 'Ah! Sun-flower' and 'The Lilly'...\", but thinks that the ambiguities are part of Blake's deliberate strategy - perhaps to put doubts in our minds about the speaker of the poem (whom Leader calls \"the Bard\"). He says: \"...our inability to accept either a pessimistic-sardonic reading of the sort advocated by Bloom or Wagenknecht (one in which the 'poem's sweet golden clime' is an illusion, and 'aspire' means 'fail to attain'), or a more straightforward, unironic interpretation such as Hirsch's, again seems part of a larger plan.\" (See below for these critics' thoughts).\n\nIn the discussion that follows, it is worth bearing in mind Leader's reminder that Blake did not have a fixed system of [[symbol]]ism. \"Many of the plants, flowers, birds and beasts in ''Songs'' are [[iconographic]] in nature, but their meanings, whether traditional or not, change and develop from plate to plate.\"<ref>Leader, 1981, p.57</ref>\n\n=== Sun-flower and other flowers ===\n\nThe Sunflower is obviously not just a plant, but, of what is it a [[symbol]] - a \"fallen\" human, as above, or persistent love, or frustrated love, or lost innocence, or corrupted love, or poetic imagination, or spiritual yearning, or all of these? The sub-headings below disguise the fact that they are actually intermingled in Blake's thought.\n\n==== Persistent and frustrated love ====\n\nThe poem may allude to the myth of Clytie and Hyperion (as described in Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'') .<ref name=\"Metamorphoses1\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses : Books 1-8|year=1977|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674990463|pages=Book iv, lines 190\u2013283}}</ref> [[Clytie (Oceanid)|Clytie]], a girl or nymph,  was in love with [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]], (in some classical writers also identified with [[Helios]] or [[Apollo]]), the Sun god, who in turn was in love with Leucothoe (or [[Leucothea]]). Hyperion/Helios and Leucothoe met in secret, but Clytie, possessed by jealousy, betrayed the lovers and Leucothoe was killed by her angry father. As a result, Hyperion scorned Clytie, who, still a virgin, pined away, went mad, sat rooted to the ground and turned (i.e.: metamorphosed) into a [[Sunflower]] or possibly a [[Heliotropium]], condemned, or fated, by her love, to always turn her face to the Sun (Hyperion/Helios) as it/he moves across the sky.<ref>Blake, 1972, p.221, footnote xx in part</ref>(Note that, in actuality, there is no evidence for Sunflower heliotropism. See: [[Sunflower#Heliotropism misconception|Heliotropism misconception]]).\n\nThe [[Sunflower]] (originally the Heliotrope), ever since the myth of Clytie, has \"been an [[emblem]] of the faithful subject\". It has been an emblem of this in three or four ways: 1) the \"image of a soul devoted to the god or God, originally a [[Plato]]nic concept\" (see below); 2) \"an image of the Virgin devoted to Christ\"; or 3) \"an image - in the strictly [[Ovidian]] sense - of the lover devoted to the beloved\". (The authors of these quotes have pointed out that it has also stood as an emblem for the art of painting).<ref name=\"Bruyn\">{{cite journal|last=Bruyn|first=J.|author2=Emmens, J.

Bloom points out that \"Blake does not prefer Innocence ''or'' Experience\" and that, \"without the simultaneous presence of both states, human existence would cease.\"<ref>Bloom, 1971, pp.33,34</ref> The \"two contrary states of the human soul\" (the sub-title of the ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'') are therefore being explored in this small poem.\n\nThe link to the Clytie myth also points to two other major themes that run throughout the ''Songs of Experience'' and which feature in \"Ah! Sun-flower\" in particular: \"the blighting effect victimization has on victimizers as well as victims\"; and \"problems...about transcendence versus transformation...\".<ref>Leader, 1981, p.165, 167</ref>\n\n==== Corrupted love ====\n\nKeith,<ref name=\"Keith\">{{cite book|last=Keith|first=William J|chapter=The complexities of Blake's \"Sunflower\" : an archetypal speculation|editor=Northrop Frye|title=Blake : a collection of critical essays|url=https://archive.org/details/blakecollectiono00frye|url-access=registration|year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blakecollectiono00frye/page/56 56\u201364]}}</ref> as well as suggesting a tie to the myth of Clytie, also points to that of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] (to be found, amongst other ancient sources, in the ''Metamorphoses'' of Ovid, like the Clytie tale).<ref name=\"Metamorphoses3\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses : Books 1-8|year=1977|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674990463|pages=Book iii, lines 345\u2013510}}</ref> The Narcissus story tells of love corrupted by inward-looking selfishness, rather than by jealousy.

The positioning of this poem after that of \"[[My Pretty Rose Tree]]\", a poem suggestive of love corrupted by (undeserved?) jealousy, and before that of \"[[The Lilly (poem)|The Lilly]]\", which might advocate an open, pure, if not innocent, love, free of possessive defences, could support this interpretation.\n\n==== Poetic imagination ====\n\nGrant<ref name=\"Rosenfeld\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John E.|chapter=Two flowers in the garden of experience|editor=Rosenfeld, A.

Antal says: \"In his ''[[Songs of Experience]]'' Blake relies on the rich symbolism of the rose and the lily so as to find his central flower-figure in the 'spiritual' Sunflower.\"<ref>Antal, 2008, p.28</ref> Grant thinks that \"in the ''[[Songs of Experience]]'', flowers represent different aspects of love.\"<ref>Grant, 1969, p.334.

Quoted by Antal</ref> There may well be a movement from the innocence of the ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' (what Blake called \"unorganized\", i.e.: ignorant innocence), on to the tragic and fateful desire of earthly love (\"[[My Pretty Rose Tree]]\"), and then through to the pure, divinely human love of \"[[The Lilly (poem)|The Lilly]]\" via the creative, poetic imagination of \"Ah! Sun-flower\". \"Here in his ''Songs'' sexual desire is shown sinful, but only experience can lead man to insight, only through experience man is able to reach a higher state of innocence\",<ref>Antal, 2008, p.38</ref> (what Blake called \"organized innocence.\")\n\n==== Spiritual yearning ====\n\nGeorge Mills Harper<ref name=\"Harper\">{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=George Mills|title=The Source of Blake's \"Ah! Sunflower\"|journal=The Modern Language Review|date=April 1953|volume=48|issue=2|pages=139\u2013142|doi=10.2307/3719808|jstor=3719808}}</ref> suggests that the impetus for Blake's creation of \"Ah! Sun-flower\" came from his reading of [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s introduction to and translation of ''The Hymns of Orpheus'' (1792). Through the words of [[Plotinus]], everything in the universe participates in the \"first good\", symbolized by the Sun. Blake said that \"every natural effect has a spiritual cause\":<ref name=\"Blake\">{{cite book|last=Blake|first=William|title=Milton : a poem in two books|year=1804\u20131810|pages=book 1, plate 27 (26 in some copies), line 44}}</ref> the Sunflower's apparent following of the movement of the Sun is not just a natural effect, but is also the result of divine nature attracting the souls of plants and, as with the Youth and Virgin, human beings. For Taylor and Blake (who may have known Taylor as well as read him), material life is like a prison: the Sunflower and the humans, who are literally and figuratively rooted to and buried within the materialistic earth, wish to escape to divine eternity.\n\nIn addition, in the context of Blake's poem, the Sunflower may \"represent\" the Church of England (corrupted, repressive and earthbound in Blake's view){{citation needed|date=January 2013}}; or the yearning of the human spirit for the liberty of Eternity;<ref name=\"Damon\">{{cite book|last=Damon|first=S.

They are dead, unlike the Sunflower, and yet have the same aspirations towards what might be the \"unfallen world, called Paradise in the Bible and the Golden Age in the Classics.\"<ref>Frye, 1969, p.40</ref>\n\n====Frustrated desire or aspiration====\n\nHowever, rather than a desire for Heaven, the poem may be a meditation on (frustrated) desire or aspiration itself.<ref name=\"Landry\">{{cite journal|last=Landry|first=Hilton|title=The symbolism of Blake's Sunflower|journal=Bulletin of the New York Public Library|year=1962|volume=66|pages=613\u2013616. Quoted by Kozlowski}}</ref>  Perhaps the figures of the Youth and Virgin depict repressed morality, as suggested by Harold Bloom.<ref>Bloom, 1971, p.46</ref> \"The Youth and the Virgin have denied their sexuality to win the allegorical abode of the conventionally visualized heaven\", he says. Arriving there, they find themselves \"merely at the sunset.\" The lovers \"trap themselves in the limitations of the natural world by refusing the generative aspects of their state.\" (See article on [[generation]]). Their \"minds are bound as the Sunflower is literally bound.\" Bloom also read the poem as saying that \"to aspire only as the vegetative world aspires is to suffer a metamorphosis into the vegetative existence\".<ref name=\"Bloom1\">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Blake's apocalypse : a study in poetic argument|year=1963|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=9780801405686|pages=454.  p.140}}</ref> Ryan says that \"the premium placed on virginity seemed to him [i.e.: Blake] particularly wrongheaded and he showed his disdain for it on many occasions...and offered no consolation to the 'Youth pined away with desire,/ And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow' (E25) who remain unfulfilled even after their repressed lives are over.\"<ref name=\"Ryan\">{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Robert|chapter=Blake and religion|editor=Morris Eaves|title=The Cambridge companion to William Blake|year=2003|publisher=CUP|location=Cambridge|pages=xix, 302 p.157}}</ref>\"The 'sweet, golden clime', then, \"can be seen as a symptom of repressed desire rather than an alternative to it,\"<ref name=\"Blake, 1998, p.190\"/> says Lincoln, who also thinks that \"like the youth and maiden, the speaker may be a victim of frustration\"<ref>Blake , 1998, pp.189-190</ref>(the speaker might possess \"my Sun-flower\" who \"wishes to go.\")\n\nKeith, meanwhile, as well as linking the Youth to the Narcissus myth, points to the [[Persephone]], (also known as [[Proserpina]]) myth, as applicable to the Virgin character, where the \"soul's descent into the material world of generation\" leads to a yearning to escape. He points to a connection between Persephone, who might have been gathering Daffodils (confused with the Asphodel in English tradition), before being taken under the Earth by Pluto. When Persephone was captured, the Daffodils, originally white in colour, turned yellow. \nSo, the 'shrouded in snow' phrase may refer to the \"coldness and frigidity of the situation in which she is trapped\"; to the white flowers that covered her head as she was being dragged off; to the covering of snow on the ground during Winter prior to the re-appearance of the flowers. The aspiration of whiteness towards 'golden' yellowness is also in play here.<ref>Keith, 1966, pp.60-62</ref>\n\n====Lack of creative energy====\n\nA theme related to this concerns creative energy (both generative and imaginative). Or, rather, the lack of creative energy that is depicted in the poem - both visually and aurally. Bloom,<ref>Bloom, 1971, p.66</ref> referring to Blake's ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', says that \"the Human, standing still, becomes the wholly natural\", and is, quoting Blake, \"unable to do other than to repeat the same dull round over again\" (just like the Sunflower). Only when the \"contraries\" (including \"Reason and Energy\") in the human condition are married together in \"creative strife\", will a way out of repeating the same dull round over again (towards \"Eden\") be found. (Keith points to the repetition of the word 'sunflower' in the first and last lines. He says that this \"helps to draw attention to the fact that no progression is made in the course of the poem at all.\")<ref name=\"Keith, 1966, p.64\">Keith, 1966, p.64</ref>\n\n====Misplaced asceticism====\n\nOthers also think that maybe the two humans are [[symbol]]s of misplaced [[asceticism]] - perhaps as much \"conceptual and imaginative\" as \"actual denial of the flesh.\"<ref name=\"Wagenknecht\">{{cite book|last=Wagenknecht|first=David|title=Blake's night :William Blake and the idea of pastoral|year=1973|publisher=Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=106. Quoted by Kozlowski. }}</ref><ref>Frye, 1969, p.74</ref> It is quite possible that Blake is criticizing the New Testament view of a life of self-denial: the stinting of earthly desires in order to gain entrance to an after-life of bliss. The Sunflower, the Youth and the Virgin may be all mis-spending their lives, instead of living them in the here and now (what Blake called the \"eternal Now\").\n\nJohnson<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Mary Lynn|title=Emblem and symbol in Blake|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|date=February 1974|volume=37|issue=2|pages=151\u2013170|jstor=3817031}}</ref> discusses [[emblem]] collections (in particular, those of [[Otto van Veen]]) in which the Clytie myth (see above) features, as a background to Blake's work. She believes that the speaker of the poem knows that the \"sweet golden clime\" that the Sunflower yearns for \"is known to be a land of eternal aspiration, not of fulfillment, where even the resurrected dead who have never found \"Eternity's sunrise\" in the present moment continue to \"aspire.\"\" Blake is emphasizing, she thinks,  \"that aspiration itself (if it is present-hating and future-loving) is a form of confinement\". For Johnson, Blake is turning the emblem convention around and criticizing the \"frustrated desire, deferred pleasure, and preoccupation with the hereafter that rack the characters\" in his poem.\n\n====Spiritual yearning====\n\nOr, again, as Kremen suggests, perhaps he is pitting the Christian notion of the resurrection (free of [[generation]]) against \"the prophetic regeneration within Nature\".<ref name=\"Kremen\">{{cite book|last=Kremen|first=Kathryn R.|title=The imagination of the Resurrection : the poetic continuity of a religious motif in Donne, Blake and Yeats|year=1972|publisher=Bucknell Univ.

However, Hirsch sees a \"spiritual balance\" in the poem - \"to seek the golden clime beyond is also to follow the golden sun here and now.\" The Youth and Virgin both desire each other (in an earthly way) and aspire (in a heavenly one).<ref>Hirsch, 1975, p.256</ref>\n\n=== Towards the \"sweet golden clime\"? ===\n\n====Spiritual transformation====\n\nThe poem is set after two events : the metamorphosis of the Sunflower, and the deaths of the two humans. It may be argued, as by Antal<ref>Antal, 2008, p.34-35</ref> that, despite these constrictive transformations, the soul, or love, remains or persists. This, again, might be an echoing of Ovid. That is, his use of the Pythagorean view<ref name=\"Metamorphoses2\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses : Books 9-15|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674990470|pages=Book xv, lines 60\u2013478}}</ref> that, although everything else changes, the individual soul is unchanged until, perhaps, it undergoes the supreme transformation that Blake (and St. Paul)<ref>1 Corinthians, 15: 51,52</ref> hints at. That is,  the soul \"might ultimately shake off the body altogether... and attain the final bliss of losing itself in the universal, eternal and divine soul to which by its own nature it belonged.\"<ref name=\"Guthrie\">{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=W.K.C.|title=A history of Greek philosophy I|year=1962|location=Cambridge|pages=202\u2013203, quoted by Kenney, below, p. xvii}}</ref><ref name=\"Ovid\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses, translated by Melville, A.D., intro and notes by Kenney,E.J.|year=1987|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford:New York|isbn=0192816918|pages=[https://archive.org/details/metamorphoses00ovid_0/page/ xxxvii, 480]|url=https://archive.org/details/metamorphoses00ovid_0/page/}}</ref>\n\nAntal notes that, \"besides the Ovidian references, the poem has strong spiritual connotations,\" and that the \"possibility of an afterlife\" is being held out. She also points out that  \"in ''Metamorphoses'' the source of the transformed figures is always an outside divinity while Blake internalises it, emphasising that the source of spiritual transformation should be looked [for] and found inside man.\"<ref>Antal, 2008, p.35</ref>\n\n====Natural and moral law questions====\n\nThe Sunflower, the \"hot\" Youth and the emotionally \"frozen\" Virgin, might, then, (assuming a reading contrary to the one of Bloom, Johnson and others), be finally free to love in Heaven or Eden. Or, at least, they might be finally free of the shackles of [[natural law]] that afflict the world- and time-weary Sunflower and the Moral Law that afflicts the humans.

Grant<ref name=\"Grant\"/> gives the most comprehensive overview of the poem.\n\nNorthrop Frye believed that the \"merging of imagination and time is the axis on which all Blake's thought turns.\"<ref name=\"Frye\">{{cite book|last=Frye|first=Northrop|title=Fearful symmetry : a study of William Blake|url=https://archive.org/details/fearfulsymmetrys0000frye_7|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=462. p.299}}</ref>\"Ah! Sun-flower\" (with its constrictions of space-time and its hint at creative, energetic imagination as a potential way out) seems to be an example of this dialectic, as the various responses of critics outlined below show. Another key to Blake's thought mentioned by Frye is that for \"Blake,...the fall of man\" (see:[[Fall of Man]]) \"and the creation of the physical world were the same event.\" The world we see and live in is therefore a \"fallen\" natural world (a world of \"[[Generation]]\") in which, since \"God is Man\", humans are \"miserable in the state of nature.\"<ref>Frye, 1969, p.41</ref>\n\nThe poem has three main (ambiguous) elements of interest: the \"sweet, golden clime,\" the Sunflower, and the Youth and Virgin. The poem's ambiguities concerning the speaker's (not necessarily Blake's) stance on the attainability or otherwise, and on the nature, of the \"sweet golden clime\" (the West, Heaven, Eden?), have led to different, sometimes conflicting views of the poem. Leader<ref>Leader, 1981, p.166-167</ref> notes the \"critical controversy surrounding 'Ah! Sun-flower' and 'The Lilly'...\", but thinks that the ambiguities are part of Blake's deliberate strategy - perhaps to put doubts in our minds about the speaker of the poem (whom Leader calls \"the Bard\"). He says: \"...our inability to accept either a pessimistic-sardonic reading of the sort advocated by Bloom or Wagenknecht (one in which the 'poem's sweet golden clime' is an illusion, and 'aspire' means 'fail to attain'), or a more straightforward, unironic interpretation such as Hirsch's, again seems part of a larger plan.\" (See below for these critics' thoughts).\n\nIn the discussion that follows, it is worth bearing in mind Leader's reminder that Blake did not have a fixed system of [[symbol]]ism. \"Many of the plants, flowers, birds and beasts in ''Songs'' are [[iconographic]] in nature, but their meanings, whether traditional or not, change and develop from plate to plate.\"<ref>Leader, 1981, p.57</ref>\n\n=== Sun-flower and other flowers ===\n\nThe Sunflower is obviously not just a plant, but, of what is it a [[symbol]] - a \"fallen\" human, as above, or persistent love, or frustrated love, or lost innocence, or corrupted love, or poetic imagination, or spiritual yearning, or all of these? The sub-headings below disguise the fact that they are actually intermingled in Blake's thought.\n\n==== Persistent and frustrated love ====\n\nThe poem may allude to the myth of Clytie and Hyperion (as described in Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'') .<ref name=\"Metamorphoses1\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses : Books 1-8|year=1977|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674990463|pages=Book iv, lines 190\u2013283}}</ref> [[Clytie (Oceanid)|Clytie]], a girl or nymph,  was in love with [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]], (in some classical writers also identified with [[Helios]] or [[Apollo]]), the Sun god, who in turn was in love with Leucothoe (or [[Leucothea]]). Hyperion/Helios and Leucothoe met in secret, but Clytie, possessed by jealousy, betrayed the lovers and Leucothoe was killed by her angry father. As a result, Hyperion scorned Clytie, who, still a virgin, pined away, went mad, sat rooted to the ground and turned (i.e.: metamorphosed) into a [[Sunflower]] or possibly a [[Heliotropium]], condemned, or fated, by her love, to always turn her face to the Sun (Hyperion/Helios) as it/he moves across the sky.<ref>Blake, 1972, p.221, footnote xx in part</ref>(Note that, in actuality, there is no evidence for Sunflower heliotropism. See: [[Sunflower#Heliotropism misconception|Heliotropism misconception]]).\n\nThe [[Sunflower]] (originally the Heliotrope), ever since the myth of Clytie, has \"been an [[emblem]] of the faithful subject\". It has been an emblem of this in three or four ways: 1) the \"image of a soul devoted to the god or God, originally a [[Plato]]nic concept\" (see below); 2) \"an image of the Virgin devoted to Christ\"; or 3) \"an image - in the strictly [[Ovidian]] sense - of the lover devoted to the beloved\". (The authors of these quotes have pointed out that it has also stood as an emblem for the art of painting).<ref name=\"Bruyn\">{{cite journal|last=Bruyn|first=J.|author2=Emmens, J.

Bloom points out that \"Blake does not prefer Innocence ''or'' Experience\" and that, \"without the simultaneous presence of both states, human existence would cease.\"<ref>Bloom, 1971, pp.33,34</ref> The \"two contrary states of the human soul\" (the sub-title of the ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'') are therefore being explored in this small poem.\n\nThe link to the Clytie myth also points to two other major themes that run throughout the ''Songs of Experience'' and which feature in \"Ah! Sun-flower\" in particular: \"the blighting effect victimization has on victimizers as well as victims\"; and \"problems...about transcendence versus transformation...\".<ref>Leader, 1981, p.165, 167</ref>\n\n==== Corrupted love ====\n\nKeith,<ref name=\"Keith\">{{cite book|last=Keith|first=William J|chapter=The complexities of Blake's \"Sunflower\" : an archetypal speculation|editor=Northrop Frye|title=Blake : a collection of critical essays|url=https://archive.org/details/blakecollectiono00frye|url-access=registration|year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|pages=[https://archive.org/details/blakecollectiono00frye/page/56 56\u201364]}}</ref> as well as suggesting a tie to the myth of Clytie, also points to that of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] (to be found, amongst other ancient sources, in the ''Metamorphoses'' of Ovid, like the Clytie tale).<ref name=\"Metamorphoses3\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses : Books 1-8|year=1977|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674990463|pages=Book iii, lines 345\u2013510}}</ref> The Narcissus story tells of love corrupted by inward-looking selfishness, rather than by jealousy.

The positioning of this poem after that of \"[[My Pretty Rose Tree]]\", a poem suggestive of love corrupted by (undeserved?) jealousy, and before that of \"[[The Lilly]]\", which might advocate an open, pure, if not innocent, love, free of possessive defences, could support this interpretation.\n\n==== Poetic imagination ====\n\nGrant<ref name=\"Rosenfeld\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John E.|chapter=Two flowers in the garden of experience|editor=Rosenfeld, A.

Antal says: \"In his ''[[Songs of Experience]]'' Blake relies on the rich symbolism of the rose and the lily so as to find his central flower-figure in the 'spiritual' Sunflower.\"<ref>Antal, 2008, p.28</ref> Grant thinks that \"in the ''[[Songs of Experience]]'', flowers represent different aspects of love.\"<ref>Grant, 1969, p.334. Quoted by Antal</ref> Also, in noting the positioning of the three flower poems on one plate, he believes that,\"as a group, the poems evidently present a threefold vision of love...earthly love, poetic love and Human love.\"<ref>Grant, 1969, p. 333. Quoted by Antal</ref> There may well be a movement from the innocence of the ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' (what Blake called \"unorganized\", i.e.: ignorant innocence), on to the tragic and fateful desire of earthly love (\"[[My Pretty Rose Tree]]\"), and then through to the pure, divinely human love of \"[[The Lilly]]\" via the creative, poetic imagination of \"Ah! Sun-flower\". \"Here in his ''Songs'' sexual desire is shown sinful, but only experience can lead man to insight, only through experience man is able to reach a higher state of innocence\",<ref>Antal, 2008, p.38</ref> (what Blake called \"organized innocence.\")\n\n==== Spiritual yearning ====\n\nGeorge Mills Harper<ref name=\"Harper\">{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=George Mills|title=The Source of Blake's \"Ah!

Sun-flower\" came from his reading of [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s introduction to and translation of ''The Hymns of Orpheus'' (1792). Through the words of [[Plotinus]], everything in the universe participates in the \"first good\", symbolized by the Sun. Blake said that \"every natural effect has a spiritual cause\":<ref name=\"Blake\">{{cite book|last=Blake|first=William|title=Milton : a poem in two books|year=1804\u20131810|pages=book 1, plate 27 (26 in some copies), line 44}}</ref> the Sunflower's apparent following of the movement of the Sun is not just a natural effect, but is also the result of divine nature attracting the souls of plants and, as with the Youth and Virgin, human beings. For Taylor and Blake (who may have known Taylor as well as read him), material life is like a prison: the Sunflower and the humans, who are literally and figuratively rooted to and buried within the materialistic earth, wish to escape to divine eternity.\n\nIn addition, in the context of Blake's poem, the Sunflower may \"represent\" the Church of England (corrupted, repressive and earthbound in Blake's view){{citation needed|date=January 2013}}; or the yearning of the human spirit for the liberty of Eternity;<ref name=\"Damon\">{{cite book|last=Damon|first=S.

They are dead, unlike the Sunflower, and yet have the same aspirations towards what might be the \"unfallen world, called Paradise in the Bible and the Golden Age in the Classics.\"<ref>Frye, 1969, p.40</ref>\n\n====Frustrated desire or aspiration====\n\nHowever, rather than a desire for Heaven, the poem may be a meditation on (frustrated) desire or aspiration itself.<ref name=\"Landry\">{{cite journal|last=Landry|first=Hilton|title=The symbolism of Blake's Sunflower|journal=Bulletin of the New York Public Library|year=1962|volume=66|pages=613\u2013616.

Arriving there, they find themselves \"merely at the sunset.\" The lovers \"trap themselves in the limitations of the natural world by refusing the generative aspects of their state.\" (See article on [[generation]]). Their \"minds are bound as the Sunflower is literally bound.\" Bloom also read the poem as saying that \"to aspire only as the vegetative world aspires is to suffer a metamorphosis into the vegetative existence\".<ref name=\"Bloom1\">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Blake's apocalypse : a study in poetic argument|year=1963|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=9780801405686|pages=454.  p.140}}</ref> Ryan says that \"the premium placed on virginity seemed to him [i.e.: Blake] particularly wrongheaded and he showed his disdain for it on many occasions...and offered no consolation to the 'Youth pined away with desire,/ And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow' (E25) who remain unfulfilled even after their repressed lives are over.\"<ref name=\"Ryan\">{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Robert|chapter=Blake and religion|editor=Morris Eaves|title=The Cambridge companion to William Blake|year=2003|publisher=CUP|location=Cambridge|pages=xix, 302 p.157}}</ref>\"The 'sweet, golden clime', then, \"can be seen as a symptom of repressed desire rather than an alternative to it,\"<ref name=\"Blake, 1998, p.190\"/> says Lincoln, who also thinks that \"like the youth and maiden, the speaker may be a victim of frustration\"<ref>Blake , 1998, pp.189-190</ref>(the speaker might possess \"my Sun-flower\" who \"wishes to go.\")\n\nKeith, meanwhile, as well as linking the Youth to the Narcissus myth, points to the [[Persephone]], (also known as [[Proserpina]]) myth, as applicable to the Virgin character, where the \"soul's descent into the material world of generation\" leads to a yearning to escape. He points to a connection between Persephone, who might have been gathering Daffodils (confused with the Asphodel in English tradition), before being taken under the Earth by Pluto. When Persephone was captured, the Daffodils, originally white in colour, turned yellow. \nSo, the 'shrouded in snow' phrase may refer to the \"coldness and frigidity of the situation in which she is trapped\"; to the white flowers that covered her head as she was being dragged off; to the covering of snow on the ground during Winter prior to the re-appearance of the flowers. The aspiration of whiteness towards 'golden' yellowness is also in play here.<ref>Keith, 1966, pp.60-62</ref>\n\n====Lack of creative energy====\n\nA theme related to this concerns creative energy (both generative and imaginative). Or, rather, the lack of creative energy that is depicted in the poem - both visually and aurally. Bloom,<ref>Bloom, 1971, p.66</ref> referring to Blake's ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', says that \"the Human, standing still, becomes the wholly natural\", and is, quoting Blake, \"unable to do other than to repeat the same dull round over again\" (just like the Sunflower). Only when the \"contraries\" (including \"Reason and Energy\") in the human condition are married together in \"creative strife\", will a way out of repeating the same dull round over again (towards \"Eden\") be found. (Keith points to the repetition of the word 'sunflower' in the first and last lines. He says that this \"helps to draw attention to the fact that no progression is made in the course of the poem at all.\")<ref name=\"Keith, 1966, p.64\">Keith, 1966, p.64</ref>\n\n====Misplaced asceticism====\n\nOthers also think that maybe the two humans are [[symbol]]s of misplaced [[asceticism]] - perhaps as much \"conceptual and imaginative\" as \"actual denial of the flesh.\"<ref name=\"Wagenknecht\">{{cite book|last=Wagenknecht|first=David|title=Blake's night :William Blake and the idea of pastoral|year=1973|publisher=Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=106. Quoted by Kozlowski. }}</ref><ref>Frye, 1969, p.74</ref> It is quite possible that Blake is criticizing the New Testament view of a life of self-denial: the stinting of earthly desires in order to gain entrance to an after-life of bliss. The Sunflower, the Youth and the Virgin may be all mis-spending their lives, instead of living them in the here and now (what Blake called the \"eternal Now\").\n\nJohnson<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Mary Lynn|title=Emblem and symbol in Blake|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|date=February 1974|volume=37|issue=2|pages=151\u2013170|jstor=3817031}}</ref> discusses [[emblem]] collections (in particular, those of [[Otto van Veen]]) in which the Clytie myth (see above) features, as a background to Blake's work. She believes that the speaker of the poem knows that the \"sweet golden clime\" that the Sunflower yearns for \"is known to be a land of eternal aspiration, not of fulfillment, where even the resurrected dead who have never found \"Eternity's sunrise\" in the present moment continue to \"aspire.\"\" Blake is emphasizing, she thinks,  \"that aspiration itself (if it is present-hating and future-loving) is a form of confinement\". For Johnson, Blake is turning the emblem convention around and criticizing the \"frustrated desire, deferred pleasure, and preoccupation with the hereafter that rack the characters\" in his poem.\n\n====Spiritual yearning====\n\nOr, again, as Kremen suggests, perhaps he is pitting the Christian notion of the resurrection (free of [[generation]]) against \"the prophetic regeneration within Nature\".<ref name=\"Kremen\">{{cite book|last=Kremen|first=Kathryn R.|title=The imagination of the Resurrection : the poetic continuity of a religious motif in Donne, Blake and Yeats|year=1972|publisher=Bucknell Univ.

However, Hirsch sees a \"spiritual balance\" in the poem - \"to seek the golden clime beyond is also to follow the golden sun here and now.\" The Youth and Virgin both desire each other (in an earthly way) and aspire (in a heavenly one).<ref>Hirsch, 1975, p.256</ref>\n\n=== Towards the \"sweet golden clime\"? ===\n\n====Spiritual transformation====\n\nThe poem is set after two events : the metamorphosis of the Sunflower, and the deaths of the two humans. It may be argued, as by Antal<ref>Antal, 2008, p.34-35</ref> that, despite these constrictive transformations, the soul, or love, remains or persists. This, again, might be an echoing of Ovid. That is, his use of the Pythagorean view<ref name=\"Metamorphoses2\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses : Books 9-15|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674990470|pages=Book xv, lines 60\u2013478}}</ref> that, although everything else changes, the individual soul is unchanged until, perhaps, it undergoes the supreme transformation that Blake (and St. Paul)<ref>1 Corinthians, 15: 51,52</ref> hints at. That is,  the soul \"might ultimately shake off the body altogether... and attain the final bliss of losing itself in the universal, eternal and divine soul to which by its own nature it belonged.\"<ref name=\"Guthrie\">{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=W.K.C.|title=A history of Greek philosophy I|year=1962|location=Cambridge|pages=202\u2013203, quoted by Kenney, below, p. xvii}}</ref><ref name=\"Ovid\">{{cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses, translated by Melville, A.D., intro and notes by Kenney,E.J.|year=1987|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford:New York|isbn=0192816918|pages=[https://archive.org/details/metamorphoses00ovid_0/page/ xxxvii, 480]|url=https://archive.org/details/metamorphoses00ovid_0/page/}}</ref>\n\nAntal notes that, \"besides the Ovidian references, the poem has strong spiritual connotations,\" and that the \"possibility of an afterlife\" is being held out. She also points out that  \"in ''Metamorphoses'' the source of the transformed figures is always an outside divinity while Blake internalises it, emphasising that the source of spiritual transformation should be looked [for] and found inside man.\"<ref>Antal, 2008, p.35</ref>\n\n====Natural and moral law questions====\n\nThe Sunflower, the \"hot\" Youth and the emotionally \"frozen\" Virgin, might, then, (assuming a reading contrary to the one of Bloom, Johnson and others), be finally free to love in Heaven or Eden. Or, at least, they might be finally free of the shackles of [[natural law]] that afflict the world- and time-weary Sunflower and the Moral Law that afflicts the humans. (See: [[Moral absolutism#Moral absolutism and religion|moral absolutism and religion]]). Blake regarded natural desire as \"vegetated\", like the Sunflower - the word \"vegetated\" being used by Blake \"in other contexts to mean \"bound by natural law\"\".<ref name=Diggory>{{cite journal|last=Diggory|first=Terence|title=Allen Ginsberg's urban pastoral|journal=College literature|date=Winter 2000|volume=27|issue=1|pages=103\u2013118. p.107}}</ref> Such a reading would refer to Blake's possible notions of free love, breaking earthbound (both natural and societal) conventions (see: [[William Blake#Sexuality]]), and/or refer to ideas of generative, divine sex.\n\nThese two constrictive laws (natural and moral) are linked. In the fourfold levels of imagination in which Blake believed, the Sunflower is currently living in the second state - what Frye<ref>Frye, 1969, p. 49</ref> describes as \"a double world of subject and object, of organism and environment, which Blake calls Generation.\" Only \"plants are completely adjusted to this world,\" and above it lies the \"imaginative world.\"  With \"sexual love... we may proceed up a ladder of love\" (clime/climb?) \"to an imaginative awakening...\" which will \"...lift us from a world of subject and object to a world of lover and beloved.\" This, in turn, will lead the lovers to the triple \"world of lover, beloved and mutual creation; the father the mother and the child.\"<ref>Frye, 1969, p.50</ref> The fourth and final stage is the one of Eden, of \"unified imagination.\" The critics seem to be unsure as to whether it is too late or not for the Sunflower, Youth and Virgin to achieve this goal.\nAs Keith says, \" it is possible to read the poem as confident and optimistic or, on the contrary, as pessimistic and even hopeless.\" He adds that, perhaps, \"a full response to the poem will be able to hold both possibilities in suspension\"<ref name=\"Keith, 1966, p.64\"/>\n\n== Influence on artists ==\n\nThe British painter, [[Paul Nash (artist)]], influenced by Blake,<ref name=\"Nash\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Paul|title=Outline : an autobiography and other writings|year=1949|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|pages=271. p.76}}</ref> painted a series of Sunflower works towards the end of his life: ''Sunflower and Sun'' (1942), ''Solstice of the Sunflower'' (1945) and ''Eclipse of the Sunflower'' (1945). Nash apparently referred specifically to \"Ah! Sun-flower\" and felt an affinity with what he thought was the Sunflower's seemingly imminent death (like his own).<ref name=\"Seddon\">{{cite journal|last=Seddon|first=Richard|title=Paul Nash|journal=Studio|date=March 1948|volume=135|issue=600|pages=74|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/paul-nash-sunflower-and-sun-5369929-details.aspx|accessdate=22 January 2013}} (expand \"View lot notes\")</ref>\n\n[[Allen Ginsberg]] was one of the poets who admired this poem. In 1948 he had the hallucinatory experience of hearing Blake reading \"Ah, Sun-flower\" and two other works (see : [[Allen Ginsberg#The Blake Vision|Allen Ginsberg : the Blake vision]]). Ginsberg wrote his own \"Sunflower sutra\"<ref name=\"Ginsberg\">{{cite book|last=Ginsberg|first=Allen|title=Howl and other poems|year=1956|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco}}</ref> in 1955, descriptive, perhaps, of love persisting amidst moral and physical devastation. He also regularly performed readings of the poem.\n\nAs befits a song, there have been many musical settings of \"Ah! Sun-flower\".<ref name=\"Lied\">{{cite web|title=The Lied, art song and choral texts archive|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=2741|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> The following are the most notable.\n\n[[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] included \"Ah! Sun-flower\" in his 1958 [[song cycle]] ''[[Ten Blake Songs]]''.\n\n[[Benjamin Britten]]'s [[song cycle]] ''[[Songs and Proverbs of William Blake]]'' (1965) includes a setting of \"Ah! Sun-flower\".\n\n[[Ed Sanders]] of [[The Fugs]] set the poem to music and recorded it on ''[[The Fugs First Album]]'' in 1965.\n\nFor the passing of the 2nd millennium, British composer [[Jonathan Dove]] set the text of \"Ah, Sun-flower\" and two other poems by Blake (\"Invocation\" and \"The Narrow Bud Opens Her Beauties To The Sun\") in his piece ''The Passing of the Year'' (2000), a song cycle for double chorus and piano.\n\nIn 2002, the Canadian sisters [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]] wanted to record Ed Sanders' setting in French; they asked [[Philippe Tatartcheff]] to translate the poem, only to find the words no longer scanned with the tune. So they composed a new tune which accommodated both languages. That appeared the following year on their album ''[[La vache qui pleure]]'' in both English and French recordings.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053919/http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/comparison.xq?selection=compare&copies=all&bentleynum=B43&copyid=songsie.b&java=no A comparison of 13 copies of Ah!

{"title_page": "The Blossom", "text_new": "\n\n[[File:Blake The Blossom.jpg|thumb|''The Blossom'', Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy C, 1789, 1794 (Library of Congress) object 10]]\n\n\"'''The Blossom'''\" is a poem by [[William Blake]], published in ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' in 1789.\n\n==Analysis==\nThis poem is full of cheerful images of life, such as the \"leaves so green\", and \"happy blossom\". The poem tells the tale of two different birds: a sparrow and a robin. The former is clearly content with its existence, whereas the latter is distraught with it, meaning the second stanza becomes full of negative, depressing images. \"The Blossom\" is based on actual experience and situations rather than general symbols such as the sparrow representing the upper class and the robin representing the lower class. The infant in the poem is at the mother's breast but most likely it was a nurse's breast; the sparrow represents the child's happiness while the robin represents desolation as robins traditionally appear during the winter, one could assume that it is upset at having the miss the exciting, lively critiques that occur with summer \u2013 such as blossoms.\n\nBlake lived in St. Paul's parish, which in 1782 decided to take care of its poor especially its poor children. Thus, Blake wrote in Songs of Innocence about how the parish sent foundling children to the country to be cared for by nurses--foster mothers. He also observed the parish starting charity day schools for poor children in which the students got better education than their more prosperous peers, the children of tradesmen. Unfortunately, in just a few years the benevolence became tainted with little care or money given to the poor, complaints about poor children being better educated than other children and so schools changed to become harsh with children being sent to work (Gardner 30-33; 54-55). \n\n\n\nAnother possible interpretation is a sexual one, where the poem represents the joy that can be found through innocent sexual love. The sparrow, seeking his cradle \"swift as an arrow\", has been interpreted in a phallic sense, and demonstrates the innocence and joy of free love. The \"happy blossom\" in this sense is therefore the female sexual organs, which is happy upon seeing the arrival of the sparrow. The \"sobbing, sobbing\" robin has been interpreted in several different ways. Either it is the opposite to the sparrow's open love, a creature who has been harmed through love or possibly violated, or it is another creature rejoicing in the joy of sexual love, in which case its sobbing could be orgasmic. Whilst this does sound a rather strange interpretation for a poem in the ''Songs of Innocence'', Blake himself believed greatly in the joys of free love. Many of his poems, such as \"[[The Little Girl Lost]]\" and \"[[The Little Girl Found|Found]]\", \"[[The Lilly (poem)|The Lilly]]\" or \"[[The Angel (Songs of Experience)|The Angel]]\", also follow this theme of giving in to desires and sexual love.\n\n==Gallery==\nScholars agree that \"The Blossom\" is the 11th object in the order of the original printings of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience.

The poem tells the tale of two different birds: a sparrow and a robin. The former is clearly content with its existence, whereas the latter is distraught with it, meaning the second stanza becomes full of negative, depressing images. \"The Blossom\" is based on actual experience and situations rather than general symbols such as the sparrow representing the upper class and the robin representing the lower class. The infant in the poem is at the mother's breast but most likely it was a nurse's breast; the sparrow represents the child's happiness while the robin represents desolation as robins traditionally appear during the winter, one could assume that it is upset at having the miss the exciting, lively critiques that occur with summer \u2013 such as blossoms.\n\nBlake lived in St. Paul's parish, which in 1782 decided to take care of its poor especially its poor children. Thus, Blake wrote in Songs of Innocence about how the parish sent foundling children to the country to be cared for by nurses--foster mothers. He also observed the parish starting charity day schools for poor children in which the students got better education than their more prosperous peers, the children of tradesmen. Unfortunately, in just a few years the benevolence became tainted with little care or money given to the poor, complaints about poor children being better educated than other children and so schools changed to become harsh with children being sent to work (Gardner 30-33; 54-55). \n\n\n\nAnother possible interpretation is a sexual one, where the poem represents the joy that can be found through innocent sexual love. The sparrow, seeking his cradle \"swift as an arrow\", has been interpreted in a phallic sense, and demonstrates the innocence and joy of free love. The \"happy blossom\" in this sense is therefore the female sexual organs, which is happy upon seeing the arrival of the sparrow. The \"sobbing, sobbing\" robin has been interpreted in several different ways. Either it is the opposite to the sparrow's open love, a creature who has been harmed through love or possibly violated, or it is another creature rejoicing in the joy of sexual love, in which case its sobbing could be orgasmic. Whilst this does sound a rather strange interpretation for a poem in the ''Songs of Innocence'', Blake himself believed greatly in the joys of free love.
