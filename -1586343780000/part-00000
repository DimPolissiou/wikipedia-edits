The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines.

The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters.

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]].

NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The KSC was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|kPa|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, which was reduced to {{convert|3010|psi|kPa|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} on the Block II RS-25 engine, which had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways. Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of [[African nationalism]] and [[Pan-Africanism]], some have seen Rastafari as a political movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=502|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=4|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=218|4a1=Williams|4y=2017|4p=477}} a \"politico-religious\" movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=189|3a1=Ifekwe|3y=2008|3p=106}} or a protest movement.{{sfn|Watson|1974|p=329}} It has alternatively been labelled a [[social movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Watson|1y=1973|1p=189|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=501|3a1=King|3y=2002|3p=136}} or more specifically as a [[new social movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the idea of Rastafari as a \"movement\".{{sfn|Lake|1994|p=253}} In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that\u2014for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]\u2014Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158\u2013160}}\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} it is neither monolithic nor homogenous.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=240|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=77|3a1=Hansing|3y=2006|3pp=62\u201363}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history,{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=75}} It is not a unified movement,{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=291}} and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastas.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=881}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=961}} Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of \"a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''\" displaying a \"shifting eclecticism\",{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} while William F.

paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11, 70}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to undergo [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's

die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=75|3a1=Barnett|3y=2005|3p=72}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional

Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}}\n\nRastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political

activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many Rastas joined the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which was formed in 1979.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=205}}\n\n====Gender roles and

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while

public.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=889}} Rasta discourse insists this female dress code is necessary to prevent women attracting men and presents it as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari did not promote monogamy.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted multiple female sex partners,{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=252|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies but is a [[common law marriage|common law]] affair,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=38|2a1=Kitzinger|2y=1969|2p=253|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=88|4a1=Semaj|4y=2013|4p=106}} although there are many Rastas who are legally

relationships are known as \"kingmen\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=245|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87\u201388}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=504|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=103\u2013104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at

have called for greater gender equity in the movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=107}} The scholar Terisa E. Turner for instance encountered Kenyan feminists who were appropriating Rastafari content to suit their political agenda.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=86}} Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}}\n\nRastafari regards procreation as the purpose of sex, and thus [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] are usually considered forbidden.{{sfn|Sabelli|2006|p=141}} Both [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] are usually censured by Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=253|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=79|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=88|4a1=Barrett|4y=1997|4p=209|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=99}} and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth-rate.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=37|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=100|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=192}} Rastas typically express hostile attitudes to homosexuality, regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural;{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Kitzinger|2y=1969|2pp=254\u2013255|3a1=Cashmore|3y=1983|3p=79|4a1=Barnett|4y=2006|4p=879|5a1=Sibanda|5y=2016|5pp=180, 181, 191}} this attitude derives from [[The Bible and homosexuality|references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible]].{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} Homosexual Rastas probably conceal their sexual orientation because of these attitudes.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}} Rastas typically see the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in Western society as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon as it approaches its apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Practices==\n{{Main|Livity (spiritual concept)}}\n\nRastas refer to their cultural and religious practices as \"livity\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=503|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=32}} Rastafari does not place emphasis on hierarchical structures,{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} and has no professional priesthood,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=53}} It nevertheless has \"Elders\", an honorific title bestowed upon those with a good reputation among the community.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} When they do oversee ritual meetings, they are often responsible for helping to interpret current events in terms of Biblical scripture.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1969|p=262}} Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}}\n\n===Grounding===\n\n[[File:Rastafarians celebrate Marcus Garvey.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A group of Rastas in [[Liberia]] celebrating Marcus Garvey's birthday]]\nThe term \"grounding\" is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} The elder is charged with keeping discipline in the group, and can ban certain individuals from attending.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Most groundings contain only men, with women being excluded.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}} Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}}\n\nOne of the central activities at groundings is \"[[reasoning (Rastafari)|reasoning]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=505|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=234}} This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1pp=505\u2013506|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=234}} These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments presented.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=56\u201357}} Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=57}} In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}} Rastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers.

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}\n\nAs Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to Rasta socio-political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like \"Another Moses\" and \"Babylon Gone\" reflecting Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as \"Reincarnation\" and \"Tribute to Marcus Garvey\".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}\n\n1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than were previously present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' \"[[African Herbsman]]\" and [[Peter Tosh]]'s \"Legalize It\" referenced cannabis use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\" and [[Junior Byles]]' \"Beat Down Babylon\" referenced Rasta beliefs in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two are widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} and reggae has also been utilised by other religious groups, such as evangelical Protestants.{{sfn|Rommen|2006|pp=235\u2013236}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]]; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}\n\n===Language and symbolism===\n\n{{Main|Rastafari vocabulary}}\nIn the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as \"dreadtalk\", developed among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=92\u201393}} They believe that by formulating their own language they are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the [[English language]], which they view as a tool of Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=46, 47}} The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish and separate themselves from non-Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509}} for whom\u2014according to Barrett\u2014Rasta rhetoric can be \"meaningless babbling\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975\u20131987).svg|thumb|left|Rastas regularly use the three colours of the Ethiopian flag for their movement, although often add black to this tricolour, symbolising the black skin of the African people]]\nRastas make wide use of the pronoun \"I\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=92|3a1=Chevannes|3y=1994|3p=167|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=509|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=45}} The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=2, 38}} It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} For instance, Rastas use \"I\" in place of \"me\", \"I and I\" in place of \"we\", \"I-ceive\" in place of \"receive\", \"I-sire\" in place of \"desire\", \"I-rate\" in place of \"create\", and \"I-men\" in place of \"[[Amen]]\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas refer to this process as \"InI Consciousness\" or \"Isciousness\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as \"Haile Selassie I\", thus indicating their belief in his divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} Rastas also typically believe that the [[phonetics]] of a word should be linked to its meaning.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} For instance, Rastas often use the word \"downpression\" in place of \"oppression\" because oppression bears ''down'' on people rather than lifting them ''up'', with \"up\" being phonetically akin to the \"opp-\".{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=xx|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} Similarly, they often favour \"livicate\" over \"dedicate\" because \"ded-\" is phonetically akin to the word \"dead\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} In its early decades, Rastas often said \"Peace and Love\" as a greeting, although the use of this declined as the religion aged.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=269|2a1=Semaj|2y=2013|2p=108}}\n\nRastas often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Red, gold, and green were used in the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] while, prior to the development of Rastafari, the Jamaican [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] activist Marcus Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his [[United Negro Improvement Association]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=159|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143|3a1=White|3y=2010|3p=307}} According to Garvey, the red symbolised the blood of martyrs, the black symbolised the skin of Africans, and the green represented the vegetation of the land.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=160|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143}} Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom. Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41\u201342}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}\n\nA rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \"look to Africa\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38\u201339}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was \"legendary\".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as \"a great coward\" who rules a \"country where black men are chained and flogged.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem,{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} with many regarding him as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7|3a1=Semaj|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=221}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}\n\n===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930\u20131949===\n\nHaile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Jamaica's Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2\u20135; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132|3a1=Loadenthal|3y=2013|3p=10}} Over the following years, a number of street preachers\u2014most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]\u2014began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=2|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=81|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=9}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=2}} Clarke stated that \"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=46}}\n\n[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by many Rastas to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.]]\n\nHowell has been described as the \"leading figure\" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85\u201386|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary

prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George

exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile

employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international

Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Rubenstein|2a2=Suarez|2y=1994|2p=4}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America.

Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems;

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E.

I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.\"{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=70}} His grandson [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] has said that there is \"no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement\".{{sfn|MacLeod|2014|p=71}} Critics of Rastafari have used this as evidence that Rasta theological beliefs are incorrect,{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}} however for some Rastas, Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God, based on their reading of the [[Gospel of Luke]] 14:11.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=108|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=511}}\n\n===Afrocentrism, Babylon, and Zion===\n\n[[File:Ethiopia (Africa orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|The eastern African nation of Ethiopia is given great prominence in Rasta doctrine]]\nAccording to Clarke, Rastafari is \"concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica while creating a new identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}} Its emphasis is on purging any belief in the inferiority of black people, and the superiority of white people, from the minds of its followers.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=864}} Rastafari is therefore Afrocentric,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2006|1p=882|2a1=Wittmann|2y=2011|2p=152}} equating blackness with the African continent,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} and thus endorsing a form of Pan-Africanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Soumahoro|1y=2007|1p=39|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2p=311}}\n\nPractitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient [[Israelites]]\u2014God's [[chosen people]] in the Old Testament\u2014and believe that black Africans broadly or Rastas more specifically are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=168|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=129|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=17|4a1=Barrett|4y=1997|4p=111|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=38}} This is similar to beliefs in [[Judaism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} although many Rastas believe that modern Jews' claims to be the descendants of the ancient Israelites are false.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1969|p=240}} Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's chosen people, meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=81|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=885}} Rastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of any feelings of inferiority.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}\n\nThere is no uniform Rasta view on race.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Many Rastas endorse [[black supremacy]], believing in [[Scientific racism|the existence of a distinct black African race]] that is superior to other racial groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1955|1p=169|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=191|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=113|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=504}} This has opened the religion up to accusations of [[racism]] from its critics, including black Jamaicans.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=149|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=81}} Cashmore noted that there was an \"implicit potential\" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not \"intrinsic\" to the religion.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=150}} Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European can ever be a legitimate Rasta.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Others believe that an \"African\" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African \"attitude\" or \"spirit\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}}\n\n====Babylon and Zion====\n\nRastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in \"Babylon\", a term applied to [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eyre|1y=1985|1p=145|2a1=Pereira|2y=1998|2p=31|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=40}} For Rastas, European [[colonialism]] and global [[capitalism]] are regarded as manifestations of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=38\u201340}} while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=175\u2013176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=40}} The term \"Babylon\" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas compare the exile of the Israelites in Mesopotamia with the exile of the African diaspora outside Africa.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In the [[New Testament]], \"Babylon\" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}\n\nRastas regard Babylon as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} They perceive the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term \"suffering\" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism \"Chant down Babylon\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, regarding this as a Babylonian development,{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} and are often hostile to Western resource extraction from the continent.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Rastas often expect white-dominant society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens they see it as confirmation of the correctness of their faith.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Ethiopia - Location Map (2013) - ETH - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|left|A map of Ethiopia, the \"Zion\" of the Rastas]]\n\nRastas view \"[[Zion]]\" as an ideal to which they aspire.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} As with \"Babylon\", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas usually use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse;{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=77|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=41}} many Rastas use the term \"Ethiopia\" synonymously with \"Africa\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=163}} Other Rastas apply the term \"Zion\" to Jamaica or use it to describe a state of mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change was influenced by observation of the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=294}}

may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of \"Ethiopia\"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within \"Ethiopia\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}\n\n====Salvation and

paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11, 70}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to undergo [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=75|3a1=Barnett|3y=2005|3p=72}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional

Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}}\n\nRastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political

activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while

Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in

By the 8th century, Arab traders had introduced cannabis to Central and Southern Africa.{{sfn|Hamid|2002|p=xxxii}} In the 19th century, enslaved [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] people arrived in Jamaica, where they established the religion of [[Kumina]].

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism;

The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=98\u201399|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=19\u201320}} One of the most prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}}\n\n===International spread and decline: 1970\u2013present===\n[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rasta vendor plies his wares in the U.S. city of [[Washington D.C.]] in 2013]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, reggae's international popularity exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=1998|2p=41|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=91\u201392|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n===Mansions of Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of

\"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta

mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the

Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nThrough reggae's popularity, Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s, where its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2,000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}\n\nBy the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}} Rastafari groups have also appeared in Zimbabwe,{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}} and in South Africa;{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=220}} in 2008, there were at least 12,000 Rastas in the country.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|p=234}} At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=225}}\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Benjamin Zephaniah University of Hull.jpg|thumb|right|The poet [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] is a prominent British Rasta]]\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Rastas were among the [[British African-Caribbean people|thousands of Caribbean migrants settling in the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=72}} In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in [[Brixton]], South London,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=54}} and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture;

This was the first commercial PCS network in the United States. Although the current Sprint PCS service is [[CDMA2000|CDMA]], the original Washington-area network used [[GSM]]. Eventually, Sprint launched its new nationwide CDMA network, then in 1999 sold the decommissioned GSM infrastructure to Omnipoint which re-launched in May 2000.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October. Alamosa PCS, which Sprint Nextel acquired on February 2, 2006, was the largest of its affiliate carriers. Other acquired affiliates include Ubiquitel, iPCS, Enterprise, and Northern.

SPG's branded products and services are sold via web and available at retailers nationwide, including [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and other independent dealers.\n\n==== Boost Mobile ====\n{{Main|Boost Mobile}}\nBoost Worldwide, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint that provides nationwide, prepaid wireless voice, messaging and broadband data products and services to customers in the [[contiguous United States]] under the Boost Mobile brand. The services are provided as an MVNO hosted on the Sprint-owned [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EVDO]], [[WiMAX]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and [[LTE Advanced]] networks.\n\n===Sprint Smart Velocity===\nSprint Velocity was Sprint Corporation's Connected Vehicle Platform, announced in 2012 in partnership with Chrysler.\n\n== Wireless wholesale operations and affiliates==\nSprint Corporation provides services using both its own spectrum and network equipment through affiliate agreements. Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.

Later in 1995, the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint Spectrum brand in the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]]. This was the first commercial PCS network in the United States. Although the current Sprint PCS service is [[CDMA2000|CDMA]], the original Washington-area network used [[GSM]]. Eventually, Sprint launched its new nationwide CDMA network, then in 1999 sold the decommissioned GSM infrastructure to Omnipoint which re-launched in May 2000. Omnipoint was later acquired by VoiceStream Wireless, which eventually became part of [[T-Mobile USA]].\n\n===Partnerships and more consolidation===\nIn September 1996, Sprint announced a deal with [[RadioShack]], and in 1997, Sprint stores opened at RadioShack to offer communications services and products across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/RadioShack-Sprint-Team-Up-Phone-outlets-to-2805441.php|title=RadioShack, Sprint Team Up / Phone outlets to open today inside retailer|last=Marshall|first=Jonathan|date=September 24, 1997|website=SFGate|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 5, 1999, Sprint and [[MCI WorldCom]] announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/1999/10/05/worldbiz/sprint_mci/|title=MCI buys Sprint for $129B - Oct. 5, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October. Alamosa PCS, which Sprint Nextel acquired on February 2, 2006, was the largest of its affiliate carriers. Other acquired affiliates include Ubiquitel, iPCS, Enterprise, and Northern.

Sprint is in the process of upgrading these services from a TDM network to an IP based network<ref>http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0824/DA-16-963A1.pdf</ref>\n\n==Wireless operations==\n[[File:Sprint store on TV Highway - Hillsboro, Oregon.JPG|thumb|This \"Sprint Store by ccComm\" located in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]] sells Sprint-branded wireless products and services exclusively.]]\n\n===Sprint branded services===\nSprint Corporation offers postpaid wireless voice and data services primarily under the Sprint brand.\n\n=== Sprint Prepaid Group ===\nThe Sprint Prepaid Group is a division of the company formed in May 2010 that is responsible for the operations of Sprint's pre-pay subsidiaries. SPG's branded products and services are sold via web and available at retailers nationwide, including [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and other independent dealers.\n\n==== Boost Mobile ====\n{{Main|Boost Mobile}}\nBoost Worldwide, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint that provides nationwide, prepaid wireless voice, messaging and broadband data products and services to customers in the [[contiguous United States]] under the Boost Mobile brand. The services are provided as an MVNO hosted on the Sprint-owned [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EVDO]], [[WiMAX]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and [[LTE Advanced]] networks.\n\n===Sprint Smart Velocity===\nSprint Velocity was Sprint Corporation's Connected Vehicle Platform, announced in 2012 in partnership with Chrysler.\n\n== Wireless wholesale operations and affiliates==\nSprint Corporation provides services using both its own spectrum and network equipment through affiliate agreements. Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.
