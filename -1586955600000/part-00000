It was first described by the French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in 1756 and visualized by him as a clock with a pendulum and a second hand. In 1922 the constellation was redefined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a region of the celestial sphere containing Lacaille's stars, and has since been an [[IAU designated constellations|IAU designated constellation]]. Horologium's associated region is wholly visible to observers south of [[23rd parallel north|23\u00b0N]].\n\nThe constellation's brightest [[star]]\u2014and the only one brighter than an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4\u2014is [[Alpha Horologii]] (at 3.85), an ageing orange [[giant star]] that has swollen to around 11 times the diameter of the Sun. The [[Mira variable|long-period variable-brightness]] star, [[R Horologii]] (4.7 to 14.3), has one of the largest variations in brightness known for stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye. Four star systems in the constellation are known to have [[exoplanet]]s; one\u2014[[Gliese 1061]]\u2014contains an exoplanet in its [[circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]].\n\n==History==\nThe French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] first described the [[constellation]] <!-- in French (obviously)--> as ''l'Horloge \u00e0 pendule & \u00e0 secondes'' (Clock with pendulum and seconds hand) in 1756,<ref name=ridpathlac>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |title=Lacaille's Southern Planisphere of 1756 |work=Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |publisher=Self-published |accessdate=19 March 2016 |author-link=Ian Ridpath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193222/http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacaille, Nicolas Louis |year=1756 |title=Relation abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Voyage fait par ordre du Roi au cap de Bonne-esp\u00e9rance |journal=M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences |pages=519\u2013592 [588] |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f786 |language=French |access-date=2016-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119115952/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f786 |archive-date=2016-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

It was first described by the French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in 1756 and visualized by him as a clock with a pendulum and a second hand. In 1922 the constellation was redefined by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a region of the celestial sphere containing Lacaille's stars, and has since been an [[IAU designated constellations|IAU designated constellation]].

The [[Mira variable|long-period variable-brightness]] star, [[R Horologii]] (4.7 to 14.3), has one of the largest variations in brightness known for stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye. Four star systems in the constellation are known to have [[exoplanet]]s; one\u2014[[Gliese 1061]]\u2014contains an exoplanet in its [[circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]].\n\n==History==\nThe French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] first described the [[constellation]] <!-- in French (obviously)--> as ''l'Horloge \u00e0 pendule & \u00e0 secondes'' (Clock with pendulum and seconds hand) in 1756,<ref name=ridpathlac>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |title=Lacaille's Southern Planisphere of 1756 |work=Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |publisher=Self-published |accessdate=19 March 2016 |author-link=Ian Ridpath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193222/http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacaille, Nicolas Louis |year=1756 |title=Relation abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Voyage fait par ordre du Roi au cap de Bonne-esp\u00e9rance |journal=M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences |pages=519\u2013592 [588] |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f786 |language=French |access-date=2016-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119115952/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f786 |archive-date=2016-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

He first came to international prominence with his performances for the [[Georgia national football team|Georgian national team]] against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in 1994 and 1995.\n\nKinkladze transferred from Dinamo Tbilisi to English [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1995, where his dribbling ability and spectacular goals made him a cult hero, winning the club's Player of the Year award in two consecutive seasons. Kinkladze stayed with Manchester City despite [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[Football League First Division]] in 1996, but the club continued to decline, and after a second relegation in 1998 he joined Dutch champions [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].

Kinkladze made his professional debut aged 16, and immediately became a first team regular.

He then trained with [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]'s reserves, where he caught the eye of [[Boca Juniors]] scouts, who took him to [[Argentina]] for a month's loan. Kinkladze met his childhood hero [[Diego Maradona]], but did not gain a permanent contract, as manager [[Silvio Marzolini]] regarded him as too similar to Boca's Argentine international playmaker [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10?, p. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nIn September 1994, Kinkladze was part of the [[Georgia national football team|Georgian]] team that played [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] in Tbilisi.

In Georgia he won three league titles and two cups with [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], and was named national player of the year twice. He first came to international prominence with his performances for the [[Georgia national football team|Georgian national team]] against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in 1994 and 1995.\n\nKinkladze  transferred from Dinamo Tbilisi to English [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1995, where his dribbling ability and spectacular goals made him a cult hero, winning the club's Player of the Year award in two consecutive seasons. Kinkladze stayed with Manchester City despite [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[Football League First Division]] in 1996, but the club continued to decline, and after a second relegation in 1998 he joined Dutch champions [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. With his national team won [[Malta International Football Tournament]]1998 <ref> https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=11055 </ref>\n\nKinkladze was unable to settle in the Netherlands, and returned to England with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] a little over a year later. He spent four years at Derby, making nearly 100 appearances.

Citing safety issues, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] has since stopped accepting new entries, so the record will stand.\n\nOn December 4, 1958, Robert Timm and John Cook took off from [[McCarran International Airport|McCarran Airfield]] in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B. They landed back at McCarran Airfield on February 7, 1959, after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in flight.  The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the [[Damon Runyon]] Cancer Fund.\n\n===Process===\nFood and water were transferred by matching speeds with a chase car on a straight stretch of road in the desert and hoisting the supplies aboard with a rope and bucket.  Fuel was taken on by hoisting a hose from a fuel truck up to the aircraft, filling an auxiliary belly tank installed for the flight, pumping that fuel into the aircraft's regular tanks and then filling the belly tank again.  The drivers steered while a second person matched speeds with the aircraft with his foot on the vehicle's accelerator pedal.\n\n===Modifications===\n# Engine oil was pumped from the cabin through a tube in the firewall.\n# Only the pilot's seat was installed. The remaining space was used for a pad on which the relief pilot slept.\n# The right cabin door was replaced with an easy-opening, accordion-type door to allow supplies and fuel to be hoisted aboard.\n# Early in the flight, the engine-driven electric generator failed.  A Champion wind-driven generator (turned by a small propeller) was hoisted aboard, taped to the wing support strut, and plugged into the cigarette lighter socket; it served as the aircraft's source of electricity for the rest of the flight.\n\n===Ending the flight===\nThe pilots decided to end the record-setting flight after running the engine 1,558 hours continuously (in addition to several hundred hours already on the engine beforehand, putting it considerably in excess of its normal overhaul interval), deteriorating the engine's power output to the point at which they were barely able to climb away after refuelling. The aircraft is on display in the passenger terminal at [[McCarran International Airport]].

The \"L\" also had a plastic fairing between the dorsal fin and vertical fin to introduce a greater family resemblance to the [[Cessna 182|182]]'s vertical fin.\n\nThe 1971 model sold for US$13,425 in the 172 version and US$14,995 in the Skyhawk version. 827 172Ls were sold in 1971 and 984 in 1972.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n<div id=\"14\"></div>\n;{{Visible anchor|172M}}\n[[File:Cessna 172 C-GDQG.jpg|thumb|1977 Cessna 172M]]\n[[File:C172M-76panel.jpg|thumb|1976 Cessna 172M instrument panel]]\n\nThe 172M of 1973\u201376 gained a drooped wing leading edge for improved low-speed handling.

The \"100\" designation indicated that it was powered by a Lycoming O-320-H2AD, {{convert|160|hp|kW|0}} engine designed to run on 100-octane fuel, whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel. But this engine proved troublesome, and it was replaced by the similarly rated O-320-D2J to create the 1981 172P.\n\nThe 1977 \"N\" model 172 also introduced rudder trim as an option and standard \"pre-selectable\" flaps. The price was US$22,300, with the {{nowrap|Skyhawk/100 II}} selling for US$29,950.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\nThe 1978 model brought a 28-volt electrical system to replace the previous 14-volt system.

Citing safety issues, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] has since stopped accepting new entries, so the record will stand.\n\nOn December 4, 1958, Robert Timm and John Cook took off from [[McCarran International Airport|McCarran Airfield]] in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B. They landed back at McCarran Airfield on February 7, 1959, after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in flight.  The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the [[Damon Runyon]] Cancer Fund.\n\n===Process===\nFood and water were transferred by matching speeds with a chase car on a straight stretch of road in the desert and hoisting the supplies aboard with a rope and bucket.  Fuel was taken on by hoisting a hose from a fuel truck up to the aircraft, filling an auxiliary belly tank installed for the flight, pumping that fuel into the aircraft's regular tanks and then filling the belly tank again.  The drivers steered while a second person matched speeds with the aircraft with his foot on the vehicle's accelerator pedal.\n\n===Modifications===\n# Engine oil was pumped from the cabin through a tube in the firewall.\n# Only the pilot's seat was installed. The remaining space was used for a pad on which the relief pilot slept.\n# The right cabin door was replaced with an easy-opening, accordion-type door to allow supplies and fuel to be hoisted aboard.\n# Early in the flight, the engine-driven electric generator failed.  A Champion wind-driven generator (turned by a small propeller) was hoisted aboard, taped to the wing support strut, and plugged into the cigarette lighter socket; it served as the aircraft's source of electricity for the rest of the flight.\n\n===Ending the flight===\nThe pilots decided to end the record-setting flight after running the engine 1,558 hours continuously (in addition to several hundred hours already on the engine beforehand, putting it considerably in excess of its normal overhaul interval), deteriorating the engine's power output to the point at which they were barely able to climb away after refuelling. The aircraft is on display in the passenger terminal at [[McCarran International Airport]].

However, as time for model introduction neared, those dealers who were aware of the change began applying pressure on the factory to continue the previous configuration. They felt the new model would be less usable as a trainer.  Consequently, and at the last minute, the decision was made to continue the 172 in its original configuration. The planned 172J configuration would be introduced as a new model, the 177. The deluxe option would become the [[Cessna 177|177 Cardinal]].

The new gear had a width that was increased by {{convert|12|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>  The new tubular gear was lighter, but required aerodynamic fairings to maintain the same speed and climb performance as experienced with the flat steel design. The \"L\" also had a plastic fairing between the dorsal fin and vertical fin to introduce a greater family resemblance to the [[Cessna 182|182]]'s vertical fin.\n\nThe 1971 model sold for US$13,425 in the 172 version and US$14,995 in the Skyhawk version. 827 172Ls were sold in 1971 and 984 in 1972.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n<div id=\"14\"></div>\n;{{Visible anchor|172M}}\n[[File:Cessna 172 C-GDQG.jpg|thumb|1977 Cessna 172M]]\n[[File:C172M-76panel.jpg|thumb|1976 Cessna 172M instrument panel]]\n\nThe 172M of 1973\u201376 gained a drooped wing leading edge for improved low-speed handling. This was marketed as the \"camber-lift\" wing.\n\nThe 1974 172M was also the first to introduce the optional 'II' package which offered higher standard equipment, including a second nav/comm radio, an ADF and [[transponder (aviation)|transponder]].

The \"100\" designation indicated that it was powered by a Lycoming O-320-H2AD, {{convert|160|hp|kW|0}} engine designed to run on 100-octane fuel, whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel. But this engine proved troublesome, and it was replaced by the similarly rated O-320-D2J to create the 1981 172P.\n\nThe 1977 \"N\" model 172 also introduced rudder trim as an option and standard \"pre-selectable\" flaps. The price was US$22,300, with the {{nowrap|Skyhawk/100 II}} selling for US$29,950.<ref name=\"Clarke\"/>\n\nThe 1978 model brought a 28-volt electrical system to replace the previous 14-volt system.

In the US in the early 1930s, adventure serials such as ''[[Little Orphan Annie (radio)|Little Orphan Annie]]'' began to emerge, becoming a staple of children's afternoon radio listening.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Little-Orphan-Annie-radio-program|publisher=britannica.com|title=Little Orphan Annie &#124; radio program &#124; Britannica.com|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===History in the United States===\n[[File:Bert and Ernie (2841396233).jpg|thumb|right|240px|Bert and Ernie from ''[[Sesame Street]]'']]\nEarly children's shows included ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'' (1947), ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', and ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''. Many of the earliest [[Westerns on television|Westerns]] were targeted at a children's audience, stemming back to when children's radio serials often were set in a Western setting. ''[[Ding Dong School]]'', which aired from 1952 to 1965, was one of the first attempts to produce educational programming for very young children; its creator and host, [[Frances Horwich]], would sit in front of the camera and simulate small talk with the viewing audience at home, demonstrating basic skills for the camera. Later shows for very young children include ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Electric Company]]'', and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.\n\n====Role of advertising====\nIn the United States, early children's television was often a marketing branch of a larger corporate product and it rarely contained any educational elements (for instance, ''[[The Magic Clown]]'', a popular early children's program, was primarily an advertisement for Bonomo's [[Turkish taffy]] product).\n\nThis practice continued, albeit in a much toned-down manner, through the 1980s in the United States, when the [[Federal Communications Commission]] prohibited tie-in advertising on broadcast television. These regulations do not apply to cable, which is out of the reach of the FCC's content regulations.\n\nThe effect of [[Advertising to children#How Children react to TV advertisement|advertising to children]] remains heavily debated and extensively studied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hardman|first1=Jeremy|title=Advertising to Children: According to a new report, children are far from vulnerable when it comes to advertising|journal=Admap|date=1998|url=http://www.warc.com./Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=8d0fd247-8c85-4374-9e76-975c2d9f7966&q=advertising+to+kids&CID=A5823&PUB=ADMAP}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carruthers|first1=Brian|title=Television vs digital: the battle for children's (and mums') attention|journal=Event Reports: MRS Kids and Youth Research Conference|date=2016|url=http://www.warc.com/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=13f66892-57c8-4497-9257-9a1eb23b93b7&q=advertising+to+children&CID=A106706&PUB=EVENT-REPORTS}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Marvin|last2=Gorn|first2=Gerald|title=Some Unintended Consequences of TV Advertising to Children|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=1978|volume=5|issue=1|page=22|doi=10.1086/208710}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Tom|title=Principles of advertising & IMC|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0072537741|edition=2nd ed., international|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofadve0000dunc}}</ref>\n\nLater non-educational children's [[television program]]s included the [[science fiction]] programmes of [[Irwin Allen]] (most notably ''[[Lost in Space]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}), the fantasy series of [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], the extensive cartoon empire of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions|Hanna-Barbera]] and the numerous sitcoms that aired as part of [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] in the 1990s, many of these programs fit a broader description of [[family-friendly]] television, targeting a broad demographic that includes adults without excluding children.\n\nCommercial free children television debuted with ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on the Public Broadcasting Service [[PBS]] in the United States November 1969, produced by what is today the [[Sesame Workshop]].\n\n====Saturday morning cartoon blocks====\n{{main|Saturday morning cartoon}}\nIn the United States, Saturday mornings were generally scheduled with cartoon from the 1960s to 1980s as viewership with that programming would pull in 20 million watchers which dropped to 2 million in 2003. In 1992, teen comedies and a \"Today\" show weekend edition were first to displace the cartoon blocks on NBC.<ref name=wp>{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Gail|title=Saturday morning cartoons are no more|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/30/saturday-morning-cartoons-are-no-more/|accessdate=October 2, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=September 30, 2014}}</ref> Starting in September 2002, the networks turned to their affiliated cable cartoon channels or outside programmers for their blocks.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Paula|title=Kid skeds tread on joint strategy|url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/news/kid-skeds-tread-on-joint-strategy-1117873477/|accessdate=October 2, 2014|work=Variety|date=September 29, 2002}}</ref> The other two [[Big Three television networks]] soon did the same. Infomercials replaced the cartoon on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 2008.<ref name=wp/>\n\nThe Saturday cartoons were less of a draw due to the various cable cartoon channels ([[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]] and [[Cartoon Network]], etc.) being available all week starting in the 1990s. Recordable options became more prevalent in the 1990s with [[Videocassette recorder]] and then its 21st-century replacements of DVDs, DVRs and streaming services. FCC rule changes in the 1990s regarding the E/I programming and limitation on kid-focus advertising made the cartoons less profitable. Another possible contributor is the rising divorce rate and the following children's visitation pushed more \"quality time\" with the kids instead of TV watching.<ref name=wp/>\n\nOn September 27, 2014, the last traditional Saturday network morning cartoon block, ''[[Vortexx]]'', ended and was replaced the following week by the syndicated ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' on [[The CW]].<ref name=wp/>\n\n====Demographics====\nChildren's television series can target a wide variety of [[key demographic]]s; the programming used to target these demographics varies by age and gender. Few television networks target infants and toddlers under two years of age, in part due to widespread opposition to the practice. Children's programming can be targeted toward persons 2 to 11 years of age;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-18/nickelodeon-retakes-kids-ratings-crown-with-paw-patrol-|title=Nickelodeon Retakes Kids\u2019 Ratings Crown With \u2018Paw Patrol\u2019|date=18 December 2013|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> in practice, this is further divided into the ''preschool'' demographic (2 to 6 years old) and the older children or ''preteen/tween'' demographic (6 to 11 years old).\n\nPreschool-oriented programming is generally more overtly educational. In a number of cases, such shows are produced in consultation with educators and child psychologists in an effort to teach [[age-appropriate]] lessons (the series ''[[Sesame Street]]'' pioneered this approach when it debuted in 1969).<ref name=\"truglio-234\">{{cite book | last = Fisch | first = Shalom M. | author2 = Rosemarie T.

A format that has increased in popularity since the 1990s (see, for example, ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'') is the \"pseudo-interactive\" program, in which the action of the show stops and breaks the [[fourth wall]] to give a young viewer the opportunity to answer a question or dilemma put forth on the show, with the action continuing as if the viewer answered \n\n''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise), and many often specifically target boys (especially in the case of action series), girls or sometimes both. Efforts to create educational programming for this demographic have had a mixed record of success; although such series made up the bulk of educational programming on broadcast television in the first decade of the 2000s, they also tend to have very low viewership. [[PBS]] had somewhat greater success with its now defunct educational programming block, [[PBS Kids GO!]], that targets this demographic.\n\nThe teen demographic targets viewers 11 to 17 years of age. Live-action series that target this demographic are more dramatic and developed, including [[teen drama]]s and [[teen sitcom]]s. In some cases, they may contain more mature content that is usually not permissible on shows targeting younger viewers, and can include some profanity or suggestive dialogue. Animated programming is not generally targeted at this demographic; cartoons that are aimed at teenagers generally feature more [[crude humor]] than those oriented toward younger children. Educational programming targeted at this demographic has historically been rare, other than on [[NASA TV]]'s education block; this has somewhat changed with [[Litton Entertainment]]'s entry into educational television in the early 2010s, as Litton's programs exploited a loophole in U.S. regulations that allows teen-oriented programs to be counted as educational but not be subject to restrictions on advertising for children's programs. However, some programming aimed at the demographic has had some tangenital educational value in regards to social issues, such as the now-defunct [[T-NBC]] block of sitcoms, which often tackled issues such as underage drinking or drug use.\n\n====Gender targeting====\nA growing issue is the occurrence of gendered stereotypes within children's television. Certain demographics are assigned to different shows. Mainly, there are \"boy\" shows and \"girl\" shows that shows will try to aim their content towards. These shows will have mainly male characters as leads because statistics show that girls are more likely to watch boy shows than boys are to watch girl shows. As far as viewership is concerned, this means producers will make more from airing shows with leads that are male, so they have stuck with that formula, despite the changing times.\n\nIn a study titled \"Four-Year-Olds\u2019 Beliefs About How Others Regard Males and Females,\" researcher May Ling Halim observed how television viewing and interactions of parents within a household may affect a child's perception on gender. She had about 250 four-year-olds interviewed and she asked them questions about their parents, the opposite gender, how much TV they watched and about their feelings on their own gender. The study used four-year-olds because at age four, children are able to make distinctions concerning gender and concerning how two people may view the same thing in different ways. The results of the study showed that for the most part, children were shielded from society's gender hierarchy. Each seemed to favor their own gender which is typical of little kids. Household hierarchy as well as exposure to TV increased children's awareness of the gender hierarchies that are present in the adult world. Halim also observed how society's higher valuing of males could affect how children approach pathways to academics and occupations later in their lives.\n\nWhether the shows are from Nickelodeon or from the Disney Channel, there are many instances where boys and girls are cast in typical roles that are recognized widely by society and a large percentage of the world. While there are many studies that have been done exploring the topic of children's perceptions of gender through television, there are few pieces of concrete evidence that tell people that what children are watching is actually harmful to them.<ref>Meyer, Nicole. 2015.

All three also operate secondary services with specialized scopes drawing upon their respective libraries, such as a focus on specific demographics, or a focus upon classic programming that fall within their scope and demographics.\n* [[Nickelodeon]], the first children's television channel, launched in 1979 (though its history traces back to the 1977 launch of The Pinwheel Network);<ref>http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/mtvnetworks/Pages/nickelodeon.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> it consists largely of original series aimed at children, pre-teens and young teenagers, including animated series, to live-action comedy and action series, as well as series aimed at preschoolers, and appeals to adult and adolescent audiences with a lineup of mainly live-action sitcom reruns and a limited amount of original programming on [[Nick at Nite]].\n** Nickelodeon operates four digital cable and satellite channels separate from the main service: [[Nick Jr.]], a channel devoted to preschool programming;  [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]], which primarily (although not exclusively) runs animated programming; [[NickMusic]], a pop [[music video]] service branded as \"[[MTV]] Hits\" prior to 2016; and a channel space that is split between teenager-oriented [[TeenNick]] during the day and 1990s-centered rerun service [[NickRewind]] at night. This is in addition to a flexible number of free digital channels under the Nickelodeon brand on parent company [[ViacomCBS]]'s over-the-top service [[Pluto TV]].\n* [[Cartoon Network]], launched in 1992, primarily broadcasts children's shows, mostly animated programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It is primarily aimed at children and young teenagers between the ages of 7-16 and targets older teens and adults with mature content during its late night/overnight daypart [[Adult Swim]].\n** Cartoon Network also operates [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], a channel that specializes in programs centered around classic brands that parent company Time Warner owns, along with some imported programs.\n* [[Disney Channel]] launched in 1983 as a [[pay television|premium channel]]; it consists of original first-run television series, theatrically released and original made-for-cable movies and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel \u2013 which formerly operated as a premium service \u2013 originally marketed its programs towards families during the 1980s, and later at younger children by the 1990s, and primarily at [[Teenybopper]] females aged 13\u201316 between 2006 and 2017, before returning to families.\n** Disney Channel operates two digital channels separate from the main service: [[Disney Junior]], which launched in 2012 and primarily broadcasts animated series catered towards a preschool audience, and [[Disney XD]], which caters primarily to an older youth audience with an action-oriented focus. Disney Channel does not have an outlet for its archive programming. Disney also operates [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], a channel primarily carrying live-action programming catered towards a teenage/young adult audience. Although its [[Television networks preceding Freeform|previous incarnations]] under different owners had family-oriented formats and children's programming, they have since been phased out in favor of series such as [[teen drama]]s, some coming from Disney Channel.\n\nUnder current mandates, all [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]]s in the United States must show a minimum of three hours per week of [[E/I|educational children's programming]], regardless of format. Until 2019, this rule also applied to [[digital subchannels]]; as a result, digital multicast networks whose formats should not fit children's programming, such as [[Live Well Network]] and [[TheCoolTV]], were required to carry educational programs to fit the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandates. (The rule for digital subchannels was repealed in July 2019;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/fcc-vote-to-ease-kid-vid-rules-draws-pushback-and-democrats-dissent-1202644411/|title=FCC's Vote To Ease \"Kid Vid\" Rules Draws Pushback And Democrats' Dissent|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=July 10, 2019|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fcc-gives-broadcasters-more-kidvid-flexibility|title=FCC Gives Broadcasters More KidVid Flexibility|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=July 10, 2019|website=Broadcasting & Cable|language=en-us|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> in practice, most still carry educational programs anyway.) In 2017, there was a programming block that aired on syndication called [[KidsClick]]; it was notable as a concerted effort to program children's shows on television without regard to their educational content, one of the first such efforts since the E/I rule took effect. The transition to digital television has allowed for the debut of whole subchannels that air children's programming 24/7; examples include [[Universal Kids]], [[Qubo]], [[Discovery Family]] and [[Smile (TV network)|Smile]]. [[PBS]], the United States' main [[public television]] network, devotes over eight hours of its weekday schedule, and several hours of its weekend schedule, to educational children's programs, and the country's only directly nationally operated TV service for public consumption, [[NASA TV]], also includes educational programs in its schedule for use in schools.\n\n===Canada===\n\nEnglish-language children's specialty channels in Canada are primarily owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] and [[DHX Media]]. Corus operates [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]], and [[Teletoon]], as well as localized versions of the [[Cartoon Network (Canada)|Cartoon Network]], [[Disney Channel (Canada)|Disney Channel]], [[Disney Junior (Canada)|Disney Junior]], [[Disney XD (Canada)|Disney XD]], and [[Nickelodeon (Canada)|Nickelodeon]] brands. DHX operates [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], as well as the spin-off services [[Chrgd]] and [[Family Jr.]] [[BBC Kids]] was the only English-language children's television channel in Canada that is not owned by Corus or DHX; since 2011 to its close in December 2018, it has been majority owned and operated by British Columbia's public broadcaster [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn [[French language|French]], Corus operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon]] and [[La cha\u00eene Disney]], DHX operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9magino]] (a French version of Family Jr.), [[TVA Group]] operates the preschool-oriented [[Yoopa]], and [[Bell Media]] runs the teen-oriented [[Vrak]].  Via its majority-owned subsidiary [[Telelatino]], Corus also operates two children and family-oriented networks in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], [[TeleNi\u00f1os]] and [[Telebimbi]] respectively.\n\nOn broadcast television and satellite to cable undertakings, children's television content is relegated to the country's public and designated provincial educational broadcasters, including [[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]], as well as [[City Saskatchewan]], [[CTV Two Alberta]] (formerly Access), [[Knowledge Network]], [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]], [[TFO]], and [[TVOntario]] ([[TVOKids]].\n\nAided by the cultural similarities between Canada and the United States, along with film credits and subsidies available from the Canadian government, a large number of animated children's series have been made in Canada with the intention of exporting them to the United States. Such programs carry [[:File:Canada wordmark.svg|a prominent Government of Canada wordmark]] in their closing credits.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe [[BBC]] and [[ITV plc]] both operate children's oriented television networks on digital terrestrial television: the BBC runs [[CBBC]] as well as the preschool-oriented [[CBeebies]], while ITV runs [[CITV]]. Both channels were spun off from children's television strands on their respective flagship channels ([[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]). BBC and ITV have largely phased out children's programming from their main channels in order to focus on the dedicated services; in 2012, as part of the \"Delivering Quality First\" initiative, the BBC announced that it would end the broadcast of CBBC programmes on BBC One following the completion of the transition to digital terrestrial television, citing low viewership in comparison to broadcasts of the programmes on the CBBC channel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178|title=Children's shows to leave BBC One|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2012 | date=16 May 2012}}</ref> [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also broadcasts a preschool-oriented block known as ''[[Milkshake!]]'', while its owner, [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]], also runs versions of [[Nickelodeon UK|Nickelodeon]] and its sister networks [[Nicktoons (UK and Ireland)|Nicktoons]] and [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr.]]\n\n[[Sony Pictures Television]]-owned [[Pop (UK and Ireland)|Pop]], which formerly operated as a pay television channel, launched on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] on 20 March 2014.

Since 1998 [[RT\u00c92]] has provided children's programming from 07:00 to 17:30 each weekday, original titled [[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]], the service was renamed [[TRT\u00c9]] and RT\u00c9jr in 2010. Irish Language service [[TG4]] provide two strands of Children's programming C\u00fala 4 Na n\u00d3g and [[C\u00fala 4]] during the day. Commercial broadcaster [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] broadcast a children's strand called ''Gimme 3'' from 1998 - 1999. And Broadcast a new strand called [[3Kids]]\n\n===Australia===\nChildren's channels that exist in Australia are [[ABC Me]], [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]], [[KidsCo]], [[Disney Channel (Australia)|Disney Channel]] and its spin-off [[Disney Junior (Australia and New Zealand)|Disney Junior]], [[CBeebies]], [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]] and its spin-off [[Nick Jr. (Australia)|Nick Jr.]], and [[Cartoon Network (Australia)|Cartoon Network]] and its spin-off [[Boomerang (Australian TV channel)|Boomerang]].\n\n===Japan===\nChildren's channels that exist in Japan are [[NHK Educational TV]], [[Kids Station]], [[Disney XD (Japan)|Disney XD]], [[Nickelodeon (Japan)|Nickelodeon]] (now under a block on [[Animax]], known as \"Nick Time\") and [[Cartoon Network Japan|Cartoon Network]] (Cartoon Network's age demographic is moving towards older viewers with shows such as ''[[Regular Show]]'' and ''[[Adventure Time]]'').\n\n===Iceland===\nOne of the most well-known children's TV programs comes from Iceland, [[LazyTown]], was created by [[Magn\u00fas Scheving|Magnus Scheving]], European Gymnastics Champion and CEO of [[Lazytown Entertainment|LazyTown Entertainment]]. The show has aired in over 180 countries, been dubbed into more than 32 languages and is the most expensive children's show of all time.\n\n===India===\n[[Cartoon Network]] was the first channel for children launched in India in 1995. Subsequently, Disney and [[Nickelodeon]] Channel arrived. [[Hungama TV]] (2004) was first channel for kids that had local content. [[Pogo (TV channel)|Pogo]] and [[BabyTV]] came later by 2006. By 2018, 23 channels were aired in India.\n\n===Romania===\n[[Nickelodeon (Central & Eastern Europe)|Nickelodeon]] was the first children's channel in Romania, launched in December 1998. Afterwards, [[Minimax]] became the first Romanian children's channel to air locally produced content, launched on [[Children's Day]] in 2001.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050217093201/http://www.minimaxtv.ro/min20.php?&l=1</ref> Since then, channels like [[BabyTV]] and [[Disney Channel (Romanian TV channel)|Disney Channel]] have arrived.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of local children's television series (United States)]]\n* [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] for an in-depth history of children's television in the United States\n* [[Advertising to children]]\n* [[List of children's television series by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/childrens/tourchildrens1.html Children's Television], online exhibition from [[screenonline]], a website of the [[British Film Institute]]\n* [http://www.pophistorynow.com The 1950s\u20132000s Week-By-Week - includes listings and factoids for local/national children's shows.]\n* [http://www.lasarletter.net/drupal/node/14 The future of children's digital television - an interview with Gloria Tristani]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Children's Television Series}}\n[[Category:Children's television series| ]]\n[[Category:Television by interest]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Children's television|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|educational television|instructional television|non-commercial educational}}\n'''Children's television series''' are television programs designed for and marketed to [[kindergarteners]], [[preschooler]]s, and [[toddler]]s normally scheduled for broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake.

In the US in the early 1930s, adventure serials such as ''[[Little Orphan Annie (radio)|Little Orphan Annie]]'' began to emerge, becoming a staple of children's afternoon radio listening.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Little-Orphan-Annie-radio-program|publisher=britannica.com|title=Little Orphan Annie &#124; radio program &#124; Britannica.com|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===History in the United States===\n[[File:Bert and Ernie (2841396233).jpg|thumb|right|240px|Bert and Ernie from ''[[Sesame Street]]'']]\nEarly children's shows included ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'' (1947), ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', and ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''. Many of the earliest [[Westerns on television|Westerns]] were targeted at a children's audience, stemming back to when children's radio serials often were set in a Western setting. ''[[Ding Dong School]]'', which aired from 1952 to 1965, was one of the first attempts to produce educational programming for very young children; its creator and host, [[Frances Horwich]], would sit in front of the camera and simulate small talk with the viewing audience at home, demonstrating basic skills for the camera. Later shows for very young children include ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Electric Company]]'', and ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.\n\n====Role of advertising====\nIn the United States, early children's television was often a marketing branch of a larger corporate product and it rarely contained any educational elements (for instance, ''[[The Magic Clown]]'', a popular early children's program, was primarily an advertisement for Bonomo's [[Turkish taffy]] product).\n\nThis practice continued, albeit in a much toned-down manner, through the 1980s in the United States, when the [[Federal Communications Commission]] prohibited tie-in advertising on broadcast television. These regulations do not apply to cable, which is out of the reach of the FCC's content regulations.\n\nThe effect of [[Advertising to children#How Children react to TV advertisement|advertising to children]] remains heavily debated and extensively studied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hardman|first1=Jeremy|title=Advertising to Children: According to a new report, children are far from vulnerable when it comes to advertising|journal=Admap|date=1998|url=http://www.warc.com./Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=8d0fd247-8c85-4374-9e76-975c2d9f7966&q=advertising+to+kids&CID=A5823&PUB=ADMAP}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carruthers|first1=Brian|title=Television vs digital: the battle for children's (and mums') attention|journal=Event Reports: MRS Kids and Youth Research Conference|date=2016|url=http://www.warc.com/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=13f66892-57c8-4497-9257-9a1eb23b93b7&q=advertising+to+children&CID=A106706&PUB=EVENT-REPORTS}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Marvin|last2=Gorn|first2=Gerald|title=Some Unintended Consequences of TV Advertising to Children|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=1978|volume=5|issue=1|page=22|doi=10.1086/208710}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Tom|title=Principles of advertising & IMC|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0072537741|edition=2nd ed., international|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofadve0000dunc}}</ref>\n\nLater non-educational children's [[television program]]s included the [[science fiction]] programmes of [[Irwin Allen]] (most notably ''[[Lost in Space]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}), the fantasy series of [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], the extensive cartoon empire of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions|Hanna-Barbera]] and the numerous sitcoms that aired as part of [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] in the 1990s, many of these programs fit a broader description of [[family-friendly]] television, targeting a broad demographic that includes adults without excluding children.\n\nCommercial free children television debuted with ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on the Public Broadcasting Service [[PBS]] in the United States November 1969, produced by what is today the [[Sesame Workshop]].\n\n====Saturday morning cartoon blocks====\n{{main|Saturday morning cartoon}}\nIn the United States, Saturday mornings were generally scheduled with cartoon from the 1960s to 1980s as viewership with that programming would pull in 20 million watchers which dropped to 2 million in 2003.

Recordable options became more prevalent in the 1990s with [[Videocassette recorder]] and then its 21st-century replacements of DVDs, DVRs and streaming services. FCC rule changes in the 1990s regarding the E/I programming and limitation on kid-focus advertising made the cartoons less profitable. Another possible contributor is the rising divorce rate and the following children's visitation pushed more \"quality time\" with the kids instead of TV watching.<ref name=wp/>\n\nOn September 27, 2014, the last traditional Saturday network morning cartoon block, ''[[Vortexx]]'', ended and was replaced the following week by the syndicated ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' on [[The CW]].<ref name=wp/>\n\n====Demographics====\nChildren's television series can target a wide variety of [[key demographic]]s; the programming used to target these demographics varies by age and gender. Few television networks target infants and toddlers under two years of age, in part due to widespread opposition to the practice. Children's programming can be targeted toward persons 2 to 11 years of age;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-18/nickelodeon-retakes-kids-ratings-crown-with-paw-patrol-|title=Nickelodeon Retakes Kids\u2019 Ratings Crown With \u2018Paw Patrol\u2019|date=18 December 2013|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> in practice, this is further divided into the ''preschool'' demographic (2 to 6 years old) and the older children or ''preteen/tween'' demographic (6 to 11 years old).\n\nPreschool-oriented programming is generally more overtly educational.

A format that has increased in popularity since the 1990s (see, for example, ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'') is the \"pseudo-interactive\" program, in which the action of the show stops and breaks the [[fourth wall]] to give a young viewer the opportunity to answer a question or dilemma put forth on the show, with the action continuing as if the viewer answered correctly.\n\nShows that target the demographic of persons 6 to 11 years old focus primarily on entertainment and can range from comedic cartoons (with an emphasis on [[slapstick]]) to action series. Most children's television series targeting this age range are animated (with a few exceptions, perhaps the best-known being the long-running ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise), and many often specifically target boys (especially in the case of action series), girls or sometimes both. Efforts to create educational programming for this demographic have had a mixed record of success; although such series made up the bulk of educational programming on broadcast television in the first decade of the 2000s, they also tend to have very low viewership.

In some cases, they may contain more mature content that is usually not permissible on shows targeting younger viewers, and can include some profanity or suggestive dialogue. Animated programming is not generally targeted at this demographic; cartoons that are aimed at teenagers generally feature more [[crude humor]] than those oriented toward younger children. Educational programming targeted at this demographic has historically been rare, other than on [[NASA TV]]'s education block; this has somewhat changed with [[Litton Entertainment]]'s entry into educational television in the early 2010s, as Litton's programs exploited a loophole in U.S. regulations that allows teen-oriented programs to be counted as educational but not be subject to restrictions on advertising for children's programs. However, some programming aimed at the demographic has had some tangenital educational value in regards to social issues, such as the now-defunct [[T-NBC]] block of sitcoms, which often tackled issues such as underage drinking or drug use.\n\n====Gender targeting====\nA growing issue is the occurrence of gendered stereotypes within children's television. Certain demographics are assigned to different shows. Mainly, there are \"boy\" shows and \"girl\" shows that shows will try to aim their content towards. These shows will have mainly male characters as leads because statistics show that girls are more likely to watch boy shows than boys are to watch girl shows. As far as viewership is concerned, this means producers will make more from airing shows with leads that are male, so they have stuck with that formula, despite the changing times.\n\nIn a study titled \"Four-Year-Olds\u2019 Beliefs About How Others Regard Males and Females,\" researcher May Ling Halim observed how television viewing and interactions of parents within a household may affect a child's perception on gender. She had about 250 four-year-olds interviewed and she asked them questions about their parents, the opposite gender, how much TV they watched and about their feelings on their own gender. The study used four-year-olds because at age four, children are able to make distinctions concerning gender and concerning how two people may view the same thing in different ways. The results of the study showed that for the most part, children were shielded from society's gender hierarchy. Each seemed to favor their own gender which is typical of little kids. Household hierarchy as well as exposure to TV increased children's awareness of the gender hierarchies that are present in the adult world. Halim also observed how society's higher valuing of males could affect how children approach pathways to academics and occupations later in their lives.\n\nWhether the shows are from Nickelodeon or from the Disney Channel, there are many instances where boys and girls are cast in typical roles that are recognized widely by society and a large percentage of the world. While there are many studies that have been done exploring the topic of children's perceptions of gender through television, there are few pieces of concrete evidence that tell people that what children are watching is actually harmful to them.<ref>Meyer, Nicole. 2015.

All three also operate secondary services with specialized scopes drawing upon their respective libraries, such as a focus on specific demographics, or a focus upon classic programming that fall within their scope and demographics.\n* [[Nickelodeon]], the first children's television channel, launched in 1979 (though its history traces back to the 1977 launch of The Pinwheel Network);<ref>http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/mtvnetworks/Pages/nickelodeon.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> it consists largely of original series aimed at children, pre-teens and young teenagers, including animated series, to live-action comedy and action series, as well as series aimed at preschoolers, and appeals to adult and adolescent audiences with a lineup of mainly live-action sitcom reruns and a limited amount of original programming on [[Nick at Nite]].\n** Nickelodeon operates four digital cable and satellite channels separate from the main service: [[Nick Jr.]], a channel devoted to preschool programming;  [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]], which primarily (although not exclusively) runs animated programming; [[NickMusic]], a pop [[music video]] service branded as \"[[MTV]] Hits\" prior to 2016; and a channel space that is split between teenager-oriented [[TeenNick]] during the day and 1990s-centered rerun service [[NickRewind]] at night. This is in addition to a flexible number of free digital channels under the Nickelodeon brand on parent company [[ViacomCBS]]'s over-the-top service [[Pluto TV]].\n* [[Cartoon Network]], launched in 1992, primarily broadcasts children's shows, mostly animated programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It is primarily aimed at children and young teenagers between the ages of 7-16 and targets older teens and adults with mature content during its late night/overnight daypart [[Adult Swim]].\n** Cartoon Network also operates [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], a channel that specializes in programs centered around classic brands that parent company Time Warner owns, along with some imported programs.\n* [[Disney Channel]] launched in 1983 as a [[pay television|premium channel]]; it consists of original first-run television series, theatrically released and original made-for-cable movies and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel \u2013 which formerly operated as a premium service \u2013 originally marketed its programs towards families during the 1980s, and later at younger children by the 1990s, and primarily at [[Teenybopper]] females aged 13\u201316 between 2006 and 2017, before returning to families.\n** Disney Channel operates two digital channels separate from the main service: [[Disney Junior]], which launched in 2012 and primarily broadcasts animated series catered towards a preschool audience, and [[Disney XD]], which caters primarily to an older youth audience with an action-oriented focus. Disney Channel does not have an outlet for its archive programming. Disney also operates [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], a channel primarily carrying live-action programming catered towards a teenage/young adult audience. Although its [[Television networks preceding Freeform|previous incarnations]] under different owners had family-oriented formats and children's programming, they have since been phased out in favor of series such as [[teen drama]]s, some coming from Disney Channel.\n\nUnder current mandates, all [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]]s in the United States must show a minimum of three hours per week of [[E/I|educational children's programming]], regardless of format. Until 2019, this rule also applied to [[digital subchannels]]; as a result, digital multicast networks whose formats should not fit children's programming, such as [[Live Well Network]] and [[TheCoolTV]], were required to carry educational programs to fit the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandates. (The rule for digital subchannels was repealed in July 2019;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/fcc-vote-to-ease-kid-vid-rules-draws-pushback-and-democrats-dissent-1202644411/|title=FCC's Vote To Ease \"Kid Vid\" Rules Draws Pushback And Democrats' Dissent|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=July 10, 2019|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fcc-gives-broadcasters-more-kidvid-flexibility|title=FCC Gives Broadcasters More KidVid Flexibility|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=July 10, 2019|website=Broadcasting & Cable|language=en-us|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> in practice, most still carry educational programs anyway.) In 2017, there was a programming block that aired on syndication called [[KidsClick]]; it was notable as a concerted effort to program children's shows on television without regard to their educational content, one of the first such efforts since the E/I rule took effect. The transition to digital television has allowed for the debut of whole subchannels that air children's programming 24/7; examples include [[Universal Kids]], [[Qubo]], [[Discovery Family]] and [[Smile (TV network)|Smile]]. [[PBS]], the United States' main [[public television]] network, devotes over eight hours of its weekday schedule, and several hours of its weekend schedule, to educational children's programs, and the country's only directly nationally operated TV service for public consumption, [[NASA TV]], also includes educational programs in its schedule for use in schools.\n\n===Canada===\n\nEnglish-language children's specialty channels in Canada are primarily owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] and [[DHX Media]]. Corus operates [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]], and [[Teletoon]], as well as localized versions of the [[Cartoon Network (Canada)|Cartoon Network]], [[Disney Channel (Canada)|Disney Channel]], [[Disney Junior (Canada)|Disney Junior]], [[Disney XD (Canada)|Disney XD]], and [[Nickelodeon (Canada)|Nickelodeon]] brands. DHX operates [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], as well as the spin-off services [[Chrgd]] and [[Family Jr.]] [[BBC Kids]] was the only English-language children's television channel in Canada that is not owned by Corus or DHX; since 2011 to its close in December 2018, it has been majority owned and operated by British Columbia's public broadcaster [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn [[French language|French]], Corus operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9toon]] and [[La cha\u00eene Disney]], DHX operates [[T\u00e9l\u00e9magino]] (a French version of Family Jr.), [[TVA Group]] operates the preschool-oriented [[Yoopa]], and [[Bell Media]] runs the teen-oriented [[Vrak]].  Via its majority-owned subsidiary [[Telelatino]], Corus also operates two children and family-oriented networks in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], [[TeleNi\u00f1os]] and [[Telebimbi]] respectively.\n\nOn broadcast television and satellite to cable undertakings, children's television content is relegated to the country's public and designated provincial educational broadcasters, including [[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]], as well as [[City Saskatchewan]], [[CTV Two Alberta]] (formerly Access), [[Knowledge Network]], [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]], [[TFO]], and [[TVOntario]] ([[TVOKids]].\n\nAided by the cultural similarities between Canada and the United States, along with film credits and subsidies available from the Canadian government, a large number of animated children's series have been made in Canada with the intention of exporting them to the United States. Such programs carry [[:File:Canada wordmark.svg|a prominent Government of Canada wordmark]] in their closing credits.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe [[BBC]] and [[ITV plc]] both operate children's oriented television networks on digital terrestrial television: the BBC runs [[CBBC]] as well as the preschool-oriented [[CBeebies]], while ITV runs [[CITV]]. Both channels were spun off from children's television strands on their respective flagship channels ([[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], and [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]). BBC and ITV have largely phased out children's programming from their main channels in order to focus on the dedicated services; in 2012, as part of the \"Delivering Quality First\" initiative, the BBC announced that it would end the broadcast of CBBC programmes on BBC One following the completion of the transition to digital terrestrial television, citing low viewership in comparison to broadcasts of the programmes on the CBBC channel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178|title=Children's shows to leave BBC One|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2012 | date=16 May 2012}}</ref> [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also broadcasts a preschool-oriented block known as ''[[Milkshake!]]'', while its owner, [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]], also runs versions of [[Nickelodeon UK|Nickelodeon]] and its sister networks [[Nicktoons (UK and Ireland)|Nicktoons]] and [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr.]]\n\n[[Sony Pictures Television]]-owned [[Pop (UK and Ireland)|Pop]], which formerly operated as a pay television channel, launched on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] on 20 March 2014.

Since 1998 [[RT\u00c92]] has provided children's programming from 07:00 to 17:30 each weekday, original titled [[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]], the service was renamed [[TRT\u00c9]] and RT\u00c9jr in 2010. Irish Language service [[TG4]] provide two strands of Children's programming C\u00fala 4 Na n\u00d3g and [[C\u00fala 4]] during the day. Commercial broadcaster [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] broadcast a children's strand called ''Gimme 3'' from 1998 - 1999. And Broadcast a new strand called [[3Kids]]\n\n===Australia===\nChildren's channels that exist in Australia are [[ABC Me]], [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]], [[KidsCo]], [[Disney Channel (Australia)|Disney Channel]] and its spin-off [[Disney Junior (Australia and New Zealand)|Disney Junior]], [[CBeebies]], [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]] and its spin-off [[Nick Jr. (Australia)|Nick Jr.]], and [[Cartoon Network (Australia)|Cartoon Network]] and its spin-off [[Boomerang (Australian TV channel)|Boomerang]].\n\n===Japan===\nChildren's channels that exist in Japan are [[NHK Educational TV]], [[Kids Station]], [[Disney XD (Japan)|Disney XD]], [[Nickelodeon (Japan)|Nickelodeon]] (now under a block on [[Animax]], known as \"Nick Time\") and [[Cartoon Network Japan|Cartoon Network]] (Cartoon Network's age demographic is moving towards older viewers with shows such as ''[[Regular Show]]'' and ''[[Adventure Time]]'').\n\n===Iceland===\nOne of the most well-known children's TV programs comes from Iceland, [[LazyTown]], was created by [[Magn\u00fas Scheving|Magnus Scheving]], European Gymnastics Champion and CEO of [[Lazytown Entertainment|LazyTown Entertainment]]. The show has aired in over 180 countries, been dubbed into more than 32 languages and is the most expensive children's show of all time.\n\n===India===\n[[Cartoon Network]] was the first channel for children launched in India in 1995. Subsequently, Disney and [[Nickelodeon]] Channel arrived. [[Hungama TV]] (2004) was first channel for kids that had local content. [[Pogo (TV channel)|Pogo]] and [[BabyTV]] came later by 2006. By 2018, 23 channels were aired in India.\n\n===Romania===\n[[Nickelodeon (Central & Eastern Europe)|Nickelodeon]] was the first children's channel in Romania, launched in December 1998.
