As a consequence of a head injury he received during [[World War II|the war]], Gore suffers from occasional lapses of memory.  His sole confidante and 'Privy Counsellor', to whom he speaks every day, is the cottage's ancient and majestic [[elm]].\n\nUnknown to Gore, his godfather has left him the sum of \u00a310,000 in his will provided that he is found to be 'up ''and'' dressed' when his executors call at exactly half past nine. When the executors arrive unannounced, they find Gore in his shirtsleeves and they fraudulently intend to withhold the inheritance. They are thwarted by Gore's good friend and family solicitor Pompey Colbourne.\n\nOne morning, while Gore is communing with the elm, a young woman who is holidaying nearby walks past the gate. They fall into conversation, although without exchanging names. A few days later, Gore receives in the post an unsigned card with an exquisite drawing of him and the elm.  Meeting again at [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]], Gore learns that she is Niobe Coke, aged 26. The pair rapidly fall in love. Two days before their intended wedding, while Gore is staying in London, the elm is brought down by an overnight storm, a disaster that the family fear will affect his fragile mind. But even before the news can be broken to him, Gore suffers an attack of [[amnesia]] while walking down [[Bond Street]] and completely forgets who he is. Gore is identified by the tailor's label in his suit, and his sister Cleopatra is informed.\n\nNiobe and Cleopatra seek advice from the eminent physician Dr Berserk. He tells them that Gore should recover provided that he continues to live very quietly for the next six months, but that he will need a close companion of his own class. Niobe decides to live with him under the pretence that their marriage did in fact take place as planned. Although unable to remember any of his friends and family, Gore readily accepts Niobe as his wife, and grows to love her anew. He does not realise that the elm is gone, and to avoid distressing him the family do not mention it.\n\nAfter some months, the family decide that Gore really must be told that he is as yet unmarried. He is horrified but, deeply in love, readily agrees to marry straight away. Niobe arranges to have some of her drawings commercially published, Pompey taking on the role of her agent.\n\nOne sultry day, exactly a year after they first met, the couple visit Ascot again. Gore gets a headache, and as they are driving home his lost memories suddenly return \u2013 though he does not know it. Niobe is beside herself with worry about the shock he must experience when he realises that the elm is gone.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman|Sam Gelfman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books? It's easier to film The Odyssey'|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He had recieved a lot of fanmail on the matter, some proposing to adapt the works to film and some encouraging him to refuse such proposals.<ref name=\":15\" /> Tolkien and his publishers, [[Allen & Unwin|Allen and Unwin]], were willing to play along with film proposals, under the conditions of having a veto on creative decisions or relinquishing those for a hefty sum of money.<ref name=\":2\" /> Materials pertaining to the treatments of Ackerman, Boorman and Bakshi are stored in the Tolkien papers collection of [[Marquette University]].<ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> \n\n=== Walt Disney ===\nIn 1938, just as Tolkien began to work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Walt Disney]] considered adapting ''The Hobbit'' to animation. An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956,  animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax appearantly wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the US to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Uproduced attempts to film dune involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]] and [[Pierre Morel]].\n</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project.

The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success.

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman|Sam Gelfman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books? It's easier to film The Odyssey'|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He had recieved a lot of fanmail on the matter, some proposing to adapt the works to film and some encouraging him to refuse such proposals.<ref name=\":15\" /> Tolkien and his publishers, [[Allen & Unwin|Allen and Unwin]], were willing to play along with film proposals, under the conditions of having a veto on creative decisions or relinquishing those for a hefty sum of money.<ref name=\":2\" /> Materials pertaining to the treatments of Ackerman, Boorman and Bakshi are stored in the Tolkien papers collection of [[Marquette University]].<ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> \n\n=== Walt Disney ===\nIn 1938, just as Tolkien began to work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Walt Disney]] considered adapting ''The Hobbit'' to animation. An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956,  animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax appearantly wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J.

Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project.

While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the US to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Uproduced attempts to film dune involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]] and [[Pierre Morel]].\n</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

Rankin thought adapting the whole ''Lord of the Rings'' was impossible and that the audience \"wouldn't sit still for it.\"<ref name=\":24\" /> He decided \"that the Tolkien property that I could handle was 'The Hobbit',\"<ref name=\":1\" /> although portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' were optioned as a sequel given pressure from the network.

Some cell animation was produced by the time Goeff Dunbar and Oscar Grillo of Euronimation bowed out. Rankin then outsourced the animation to Japan's Topcraft (later [[Studio Ghibli|Studio Ghilbi]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intanibase.com/forum/posts/m25152findunread-Middle-Earth-in-Animation|title=Middle Earth in Animation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe designs were done  by Rankin, Bass and several Japanese animators working the US.

His first draft tried to encompass the whole of the story, plus a setup for The Lord of the Rings at the end.

While Rankin wanted it to be released in theaters if it was successful enough, this did not come to pass, making Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'' the only theatrical feature based on Tolkien's works to appear before the WingNut films productions.\n\nThe TV Special received mixed reactions. In 1978, [[Romeo Muller]] won a [[Peabody Award]] for his teleplay.

R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

S. Johar]] and his elder brother, [[B.R. Chopra]]. He made directorial debut with ''[[Dhool Ka Phool]]'' in 1959, a melodrama about illegitimacy, and followed it with the social drama ''[[Dharmputra]]'' (1961). Chopra rose to prominence after directing the commercially and critically successful drama, ''[[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]]'' (1965), which pioneered the concept of ensemble casts in Bollywood. In 1971, he founded his own production company, Yash Raj Films, whose first production was ''[[Daag (1973 film)|Daag]]'' (1973), a successful melodrama about a polygamous man. His success continued in the seventies, with some of Indian cinema's most successful and iconic films, including the action thriller ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), which established [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as the leading actor in Bollywood; the ensemble romantic drama ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhie Kabhie]]'' (1976) and the ensemble drama ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978). This was followed by a period of professional setback from the late 1970s to 1989.\n\nChopra collaborated with [[Sridevi]] in two of what has been considered to be his finest films; the romantic  musical ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989), which became instrumental in ending the era of violent films in Bollywood and returning to musicals, and the intergenerational romantic drama ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991), considered by critics and Chopra himself to be his best work, but underperformed at the domestic box office although brought profits overseas. After  helming the critically panned ''[[Parampara (1993 film)|Parampara]]'' (1993), Chopra directed the commercially successful psychological thriller ''[[Darr]]'' (1993), the first of his films to star [[Shah Rukh Khan]]. Chopra directed three more romantic films, all starring Khan; ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'' (1997), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jab Tak Hai Jaan]]'' (2012), before announcing his retirement from direction in 2012.

Theatrical screenings of the film were disrupted by violent demonstrations in response to its raw depiction of the partition riots and related sloganeering and hence became a box office flop.

Chopra won another [[Filmfare]] Best Director Award for ''Deewaar''. Chopra produced, directed and scripted two more films starring Bachchan. Unlike his earlier action-oriented films, these two were musical romantic dramas: ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhi Kabhie]]'' (1976)<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" /><ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> followed by ''[[Silsila]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" /> Yash Chopra suggested [[Javed Akhtar]] to become a lyricist, starting from this film.<ref name=\"10 things you didn't know about Yash Chopra\" />\n\nThe eighties marked a professional setback in Chopra's career, as several films he directed and produced in that period failed to leave a mark at the Indian box office. His film ''[[Mashaal]]'' (1984) was his first collaboration with the legendary actor, [[Dilip Kumar]]. The action-oriented film, which was based on the well-known Marathi play titled ''Ashroonchi Zhali Phule'', won critical acclaim, but fared only average at the box office. A year later, he made ''[[Faasle]]''. The romantic drama starring [[Sunil Dutt]], [[Rekha]], [[Rohan Kapoor]] and [[Farah (actress)|Farah]] was a critical and commercial failure.<ref name=\"Face of romance in Bollywood: Iconic filmmaker Yash Chopra's five-decade long illustrious career\" /> He and critics consider it his worst film. ''[[Vijay (1988 film)|Vijay]]'' (1988)<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> was also a box office failure.<ref name=\"Face of romance in Bollywood: Iconic filmmaker Yash Chopra's five-decade long illustrious career\" /> The film received mixed reviews from critics and was dubbed a remake of ''Trishul''.\n\nChopra's lean phase ended in 1989 with the highly successful cult classic ''[[Chandni]]'',<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> a film with all the hallmarks of what has come to be known as the \"Yash Chopra style\": heroine-oriented, romantic, emotional, depicting the lifestyle of the super elite, with melodic music used in songs picturised in foreign locations. It marked the first collaboration between Chopra and [[Sridevi]]. The huge success of its music was instrumental in ending the era of violence in Bollywood films and bringing back music into Hindi films. After a string of critically and commercially movies, the success of Chandni consolidated Sridevi's position as the top female [[Bollywood]] star of the era. Though it was not the first time Chopra shot a film in [[Switzerland]], the extensive scenes shot there made it a popular tourist destination for Indians. The film won the [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]] for Best Popular Film of that year.<ref name=\"Bollywood movie mogul Chopra dies at 80\">{{cite news|title=Bollywood movie mogul Chopra dies at 80|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-10-22/news/34660131_1_elder-son-aditya-chopra-uday-chopra-yash-raj-films|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=22 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe followed it with ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991),<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> starring frequent collaborators [[Anil Kapoor]] and Sridevi. The film was critically acclaimed, had exceptional music, and was one of the biggest Bollywood hits in the overseas market. However it was not a box office success in India due to its controversial storyline. The film won five [[Filmfare awards]], including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Movie]]. Over the years, the film has been hailed as a cult classic; it is regarded as a modern masterpiece and possibly his finest film to date. It was featured in ''Outlook'' magazine's list of All-Time Great Indian films.<ref name=\"Outlook Bollywood's best films\">{{cite web|title=Outlook Bollywood's best films|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?220089|publisher=Outlook|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> It has been cited by Chopra as his personal favourite of his films.<ref name=\"10 things you didn't know about Yash Chopra\">{{cite news|title=10 things you didn't know about Yash Chopra|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/yashchopratrivia/1/225747.html|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=India Today|date=22 October 2012}}</ref> In 1992, Chopra directed [[Parampara (1993 film)|Parampara]]. Despite an all-star cast of [[Ramya Krishnan]], [[Aamir Khan]], [[Raveena Tandon]], [[Sunil Dutt]], [[Anupam Kher]], [[Vinod Khanna]], [[Ashwini Bhave]] and [[Saif Ali Khan]] (In his film debut), the film was a commercial flop and was panned by critics for its weak storyline, music and direction.\n\n=== 1993\u20132012 ===\n[[File:Yash Chopra and Shahrukh Khan.jpg|thumb|200px|Yash Chopra and [[Shahrukh Khan]] (left). Chopra was responsible for shaping Khan's career.<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" />]]\nIn 1993, Yash Chopra directed the newcomer [[Shah Rukh Khan]] along with [[Juhi Chawla]] and [[Sunny Deol]] in the musical psychological thriller ''[[Darr]]''.<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" /><ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> The movie was the story of an obsessed lover (Khan) and the lengths to which he goes to get the girl (Chawla) who is already happily engaged to another man (Deol). The film was a runaway success and is considered a cult classic today. It also established Khan as a bankable star. Four years later, Chopra then directed, produced and co-wrote the highly successful 1997 musical romantic drama  ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'',<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> starring yet again Shahrukh Khan in a love triangle with [[Madhuri Dixit]] and [[Karisma Kapoor]]. It also starred [[Akshay Kumar]] in an extended guest appearance. It was the first Bollywood movie to be shot in Germany. The film became the highest grosser for the year. It won many awards, including seven [[Filmfare Awards]] and three National Awards, notably for Best Film, providing popular and wholesome entertainment yet again. Chopra then took a sabbatical from directing and focused solely on producing films for over seven years.\n\nIn 2004, he returned to direction with the epic love saga ''[[Veer-Zaara]]''.<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> Starring Shahrukh Khan again, [[Preity Zinta]] and [[Rani Mukerji]] in the leading roles, the film was the biggest hit of 2004 in both India and overseas, with a worldwide gross of over {{Indian Rupee}}940 million and was screened at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] to critical appreciation. The film which narrated the love story of an Indian air-force officer Veer Pratap Singh (Khan) and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Hayaat Khan (Zinta) was appreciated by critics. Rama Sharma from ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' wrote: \"Giving love its due, Yash Chopra has understandably linked the script to the life of a common man. The pace is exacting. Drawing from the best of the two countries, the story is made more colourful by a spray of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]i culture\u2014 be it celebrating Lohri in [[India]] or visiting a ''Dargah'' in [[Pakistan]]. He has handled the script cleverly. Whenever the pace begins to slacken, he introduces a new character and a twist.\"\n\nIn September 2012, in a special interview with actor [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, Chopra announced that ''[[Jab Tak Hai Jaan]]'' (2012)<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> would be his last directorial venture and that he would opt to focus on his production company and his personal life. For the shoot of the last remaining song in ''Jab Tak Hai Jaan'', director Yash Chopra wanted to shoot a scene of a sari-clad [[Katrina Kaif]] romancing [[Shah Rukh Khan]] in the lush meadows of the Swiss Alps. But his illness, caused by a bout of [[dengue]], stymied the plan for the song, which would have reflected his trademark directorial style. Chopra's trip to [[Switzerland]] with Shahrukh and Katrina had to be cancelled after his death.\n\nYash Raj Films (YRF) is the most dominant production company in Hindi filmmaking. Yash Raj Chopra has continuously featured in the top five hit Indian movies of the year since 2000. The Indian film director and producer used a range of directors. He repetitively used the star power of Bollywood's most popular actors, Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nYash Raj Films is a highlight of India's post-colonial identity. It has grown to be the forefront of the global rise of Bollywood cinema. Yash Raj Films have expanded their company from locally based Hindi films to global achievements.

S. Johar]] and his elder brother, [[B.R. Chopra]]. He made directorial debut with ''[[Dhool Ka Phool]]'' in 1959, a melodrama about illegitimacy, and followed it with the social drama ''[[Dharmputra]]'' (1961). Chopra rose to prominence after directing the commercially and critically successful drama, ''[[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]]'' (1965), which pioneered the concept of ensemble casts in Bollywood. In 1971, he founded his own production company, Yash Raj Films, whose first production was ''[[Daag (1973 film)|Daag]]'' (1973), a successful melodrama about a polygamous man. His success continued in the seventies, with some of Indian cinema's most successful and iconic films, including the action thriller ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), which established [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as the leading actor in Bollywood; the ensemble romantic drama ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhie Kabhie]]'' (1976) and the ensemble drama ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978). This was followed by a period of professional setback from the late 1970s to 1989.\n\nChopra collaborated with [[Sridevi]] in two of what has been considered to be his finest films; the romantic  musical ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989), which became instrumental in ending the era of violent films in Bollywood and returning to musicals, and the intergenerational romantic drama ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991), considered by critics and Chopra himself to be his best work, but underperformed at the domestic box office although brought profits overseas. After  helming the critically panned ''[[Parampara (1993 film)|Parampara]]'' (1993), Chopra directed the commercially successful psychological thriller ''[[Darr]]'' (1993), the first of his films to star [[Shah Rukh Khan]]. Chopra directed three more romantic films, all starring Khan; ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'' (1997), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jab Tak Hai Jaan]]'' (2012), before announcing his retirement from direction in 2012.

Theatrical screenings of the film were disrupted by violent demonstrations in response to its raw depiction of the partition riots and related sloganeering and hence became a box office flop.

Chopra won another [[Filmfare]] Best Director Award for ''Deewaar''. Chopra produced, directed and scripted two more films starring Bachchan. Unlike his earlier action-oriented films, these two were musical romantic dramas: ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhi Kabhie]]'' (1976)<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" /><ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> followed by ''[[Silsila]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" /> Yash Chopra suggested [[Javed Akhtar]] to become a lyricist, starting from this film.<ref name=\"10 things you didn't know about Yash Chopra\" />\n\nThe eighties marked a professional setback in Chopra's career, as several films he directed and produced in that period failed to leave a mark at the Indian box office. His film ''[[Mashaal]]'' (1984) was his first collaboration with the legendary actor, [[Dilip Kumar]]. The action-oriented film, which was based on the well-known Marathi play titled ''Ashroonchi Zhali Phule'', won critical acclaim, but fared only average at the box office. A year later, he made ''[[Faasle]]''. The romantic drama starring [[Sunil Dutt]], [[Rekha]], [[Rohan Kapoor]] and [[Farah (actress)|Farah]] was a critical and commercial failure.<ref name=\"Face of romance in Bollywood: Iconic filmmaker Yash Chopra's five-decade long illustrious career\" /> He and critics consider it his worst film. ''[[Vijay (1988 film)|Vijay]]'' (1988)<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> was also a box office failure.<ref name=\"Face of romance in Bollywood: Iconic filmmaker Yash Chopra's five-decade long illustrious career\" /> The film received mixed reviews from critics and was dubbed a remake of ''Trishul''.\n\nChopra's lean phase ended in 1989 with the highly successful cult classic ''[[Chandni]]'',<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> a film with all the hallmarks of what has come to be known as the \"Yash Chopra style\": heroine-oriented, romantic, emotional, depicting the lifestyle of the super elite, with melodic music used in songs picturised in foreign locations. It marked the first collaboration between Chopra and [[Sridevi]]. The huge success of its music was instrumental in ending the era of violence in Bollywood films and bringing back music into Hindi films. After a string of critically and commercially movies, the success of Chandni consolidated Sridevi's position as the top female [[Bollywood]] star of the era. Though it was not the first time Chopra shot a film in [[Switzerland]], the extensive scenes shot there made it a popular tourist destination for Indians. The film won the [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]] for Best Popular Film of that year.<ref name=\"Bollywood movie mogul Chopra dies at 80\">{{cite news|title=Bollywood movie mogul Chopra dies at 80|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-10-22/news/34660131_1_elder-son-aditya-chopra-uday-chopra-yash-raj-films|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=22 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe followed it with ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991),<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> starring frequent collaborators [[Anil Kapoor]] and Sridevi. The film was critically acclaimed, had exceptional music, and was one of the biggest Bollywood hits in the overseas market. However it was not a box office success in India due to its controversial storyline. The film won five [[Filmfare awards]], including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Movie]]. Over the years, the film has been hailed as a cult classic; it is regarded as a modern masterpiece and possibly his finest film to date. It was featured in ''Outlook'' magazine's list of All-Time Great Indian films.<ref name=\"Outlook Bollywood's best films\">{{cite web|title=Outlook Bollywood's best films|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?220089|publisher=Outlook|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> It has been cited by Chopra as his personal favourite of his films.<ref name=\"10 things you didn't know about Yash Chopra\">{{cite news|title=10 things you didn't know about Yash Chopra|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/yashchopratrivia/1/225747.html|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=India Today|date=22 October 2012}}</ref> In 1992, Chopra directed [[Parampara (1993 film)|Parampara]]. Despite an all-star cast of [[Ramya Krishnan]], [[Aamir Khan]], [[Raveena Tandon]], [[Sunil Dutt]], [[Anupam Kher]], [[Vinod Khanna]], [[Ashwini Bhave]] and [[Saif Ali Khan]] (In his film debut), the film was a commercial flop and was panned by critics for its weak storyline, music and direction.\n\n=== 1993\u20132012 ===\n[[File:Yash Chopra and Shahrukh Khan.jpg|thumb|200px|Yash Chopra and [[Shahrukh Khan]] (left). Chopra was responsible for shaping Khan's career.<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" />]]\nIn 1993, Yash Chopra directed the newcomer [[Shah Rukh Khan]] along with [[Juhi Chawla]] and [[Sunny Deol]] in the musical psychological thriller ''[[Darr]]''.<ref name=\"Yash Chopra King of Romance\" /><ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> The movie was the story of an obsessed lover (Khan) and the lengths to which he goes to get the girl (Chawla) who is already happily engaged to another man (Deol). The film was a runaway success and is considered a cult classic today. It also established Khan as a bankable star. Four years later, Chopra then directed, produced and co-wrote the highly successful 1997 musical romantic drama  ''[[Dil To Pagal Hai]]'',<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> starring yet again Shahrukh Khan in a love triangle with [[Madhuri Dixit]] and [[Karisma Kapoor]]. It also starred [[Akshay Kumar]] in an extended guest appearance. It was the first Bollywood movie to be shot in Germany. The film became the highest grosser for the year. It won many awards, including seven [[Filmfare Awards]] and three National Awards, notably for Best Film, providing popular and wholesome entertainment yet again. Chopra then took a sabbatical from directing and focused solely on producing films for over seven years.\n\nIn 2004, he returned to direction with the epic love saga ''[[Veer-Zaara]]''.<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> Starring Shahrukh Khan again, [[Preity Zinta]] and [[Rani Mukerji]] in the leading roles, the film was the biggest hit of 2004 in both India and overseas, with a worldwide gross of over {{Indian Rupee}}940 million and was screened at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] to critical appreciation. The film which narrated the love story of an Indian air-force officer Veer Pratap Singh (Khan) and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Hayaat Khan (Zinta) was appreciated by critics. Rama Sharma from ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' wrote: \"Giving love its due, Yash Chopra has understandably linked the script to the life of a common man. The pace is exacting. Drawing from the best of the two countries, the story is made more colourful by a spray of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]i culture\u2014 be it celebrating Lohri in [[India]] or visiting a ''Dargah'' in [[Pakistan]]. He has handled the script cleverly. Whenever the pace begins to slacken, he introduces a new character and a twist.\"\n\nIn September 2012, in a special interview with actor [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, Chopra announced that ''[[Jab Tak Hai Jaan]]'' (2012)<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\" /> would be his last directorial venture and that he would opt to focus on his production company and his personal life. For the shoot of the last remaining song in ''Jab Tak Hai Jaan'', director Yash Chopra wanted to shoot a scene of a sari-clad [[Katrina Kaif]] romancing [[Shah Rukh Khan]] in the lush meadows of the Swiss Alps. But his illness, caused by a bout of [[dengue]], stymied the plan for the song, which would have reflected his trademark directorial style. Chopra's trip to [[Switzerland]] with Shahrukh and Katrina had to be cancelled after his death.\n\nYash Raj Films (YRF) is the most dominant production company in Hindi filmmaking. Yash Raj Chopra has continuously featured in the top five hit Indian movies of the year since 2000. The Indian film director and producer used a range of directors. He repetitively used the star power of Bollywood's most popular actors, Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nYash Raj Films is a highlight of India's post-colonial identity. It has grown to be the forefront of the global rise of Bollywood cinema. Yash Raj Films have expanded their company from locally based Hindi films to global achievements. They have managed to attract home based and diasporic Indians. Yash Raj Films have used a smart technique by incorporating foreign locations as a site which succeeded.\n\n=== Frequent collaborations ===\n\nChopra was known to often cast the same actors in his films, his most famous collaborations being with [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Raakhee]], [[Waheeda Rehman]] and more recently, [[Shah Rukh Khan]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn 1970, Chopra married Pamela Singh and together they have two sons [[Aditya Chopra]] and [[Uday Chopra]],<ref name=\"The life and times of Yash Chopra\">{{cite news|title=The life and times of Yash Chopra|url=http://www.punemirror.in/article/19/20121022201210220903242644ce0d31b/The-life-and-times-of-Yash-Chopra.html|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=Pune Mirror|date=22 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213061754/http://www.punemirror.in/article/19/20121022201210220903242644ce0d31b/The-life-and-times-of-Yash-Chopra.html|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> born in 1971 and 1973, respectively.

In 1751, de Ulloa was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\nIn 1758 he returned to South America as governor of [[Huancavelica]] in Peru and the general manager of the [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] mines there. He held this position until 1764.\n\nAfter France was defeated by the English in the Seven Years' War, it ceded its territories west of the Mississippi River to Spain. Ulloa was appointed by the Spanish Crown to serve as the first Spanish governor of West [[Louisiana]], and reached [[New Orleans]], the major city and port, on 5 March 1766.

He published an account of the people and countries he had encountered during the French Geodesic Mission (1748), which was translated into English and published as ''A Voyage to South America'' (1758).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/avoyagetosoutha00ullogoog/page/n343 <!-- quote=\"a voyage to south america\". -->]</ref>\n\n[[File:Antonio Ulloa y de la Torre-Guiral.jpg|thumb|Portrait by unknown artist, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]\n\nUlloa became prominent as a scientist and was appointed to serve on various important scientific commissions. He is credited with the establishment of the first museum of natural history, the first [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] laboratory in Spain, and the observatory of [[Cadiz]]. In 1751, de Ulloa was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\nIn 1758 he returned to South America as governor of [[Huancavelica]] in Peru and the general manager of the [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] mines there. He held this position until 1764.\n\nAfter France was defeated by the English in the Seven Years' War, it ceded its territories west of the Mississippi River to Spain. Ulloa was appointed by the Spanish Crown to serve as the first Spanish governor of West [[Louisiana]], and reached [[New Orleans]], the major city and port, on 5 March 1766. The French colonists refused to recognize Spanish rule, and expelled Ulloa from Louisiana by a [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] uprising during the [[Louisiana Rebellion of 1768]]. On 28 October, as riots broke out in New Orleans, the governor and his pregnant wife were taken to a Spanish vessel.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Whitaker| first=Arthur P.| date=May 1935| title=Antonio de Ulloa| journal=Hispanic American Historical Review| volume=15| issue=2| pages=155\u2013194| jstor=2506293| doi=10.2307/2506293}}</ref> The Superior Council voted that the governor leave within three days.

(It was published in English in 1806.)\n\nIn collaboration with Jorge Juan mentioned above, he also wrote ''Noticias secretas de Am\u00e9rica'', giving valuable information regarding the early religious orders in Spanish America.
