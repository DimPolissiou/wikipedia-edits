There are 31 alphaviruses, which infect various [[vertebrate]]s such as humans, rodents, fish, birds, and larger mammals such as horses, as well as [[invertebrate]]s. Transmission between species and individuals occurs mainly via mosquitoes, making the alphaviruses a member of the collection of [[arbovirus]]es \u2013 or [[arthropod]]-borne viruses.

The total genome length ranges between 11,000 and 12,000 nucleotides, and has a 5\u2019 cap and a 3\u2019 [[poly-A tail]]. The four non-structural protein genes are encoded in the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome, while the three structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mRNA colinear with the 3\u2032 one-third of the genome.\n\nThere are two [[open reading frames]] (ORFs) in the genome, nonstructural and structural. The first is non-structural and encodes proteins (nsP1\u2013nsP4) necessary for transcription and replication of viral RNA. The second encodes three [[secondary structure|structural]] proteins: the core [[nucleocapsid]] [[protein]] C, and the envelope [[protein]]s P62 and E1, which associate as a [[heterodimer]]. The viral membrane-anchored surface [[glycoproteins]] are responsible for [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] recognition and entry into target [[cell (biology)|cell]]s through [[membrane fusion]].\n\n===Structural proteins===\nThe [[proteolytic]] maturation of P62 into E2 and E3 causes a change in the viral surface.

Most alphaviruses lose the peripheral protein E3, but in Semliki viruses it remains associated with the viral surface.\n\n===Nonstructural proteins===\nFour nonstructural proteins (nsP1\u20134) which are produced as a single polyprotein constitute the virus' replication machinery.<ref name=Shin2012>Shin G, Yost SA, Miller MT, Elrod EJ, Grakoui A, Marcotrigiano J (2012) Structural and functional insights into alphavirus polyprotein processing and pathogenesis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</ref> The processing of the polyprotein occurs in a highly regulated manner, with cleavage at the P2/3 junction influencing RNA template use during genome replication. This site is located at the base of a narrow cleft and is not readily accessible. Once cleaved nsP3 creates a ring structure that encircles nsP2. These two proteins have an extensive interface.\n\nMutations in nsP2 that produce noncytopathic viruses or a temperature sensitive phenotypes cluster at the P2/P3 interface region. P3 mutations opposite the location of the nsP2 noncytopathic mutations prevent efficient cleavage of P2/3. This in turn affects RNA infectivity altering viral RNA production levels.\n\n==Virology==\n\nThe virus has a 60\u201370 [[nanometer]] diameter. It is enveloped, spherical and has a positive-strand RNA genome of ~12 kilobases. The genome encodes two polyproteins. The first polyprotein consists of four non-structural units: in order from the N terminal to the C terminal - nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4. The second is a structural polyprotein composed of five expression units: from the N terminal to the C terminal - Capsid, E3, E2, 6K and E1. A sub genomic positive strand RNA - the 26S RNA - is replicated from a negative-stranded RNA intermediate. This serves as template for the synthesis of viral structural proteins. Most alphaviruses have conserved domains involved in regulation of viral RNA synthesis. \n\nThe nucleocapsid, 40 nanometers in diameter, contains 240 copies of the capsid protein and has a T = 4 icosahedral symmetry. The E1 and E2 viral glycoproteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer. Single E1 and E2 molecules associate to form heterodimers. The E1\u2013E2 heterodimers form one-to-one contacts between the E2 protein and the nucleocapsid monomers. The E1 and E2 proteins mediate contact between the virus and the host cell. \n\nSeveral receptors have been identified. These include [[prohibitin]], [[phosphatidylserine]], [[glycosaminoglycan]]s and [[ATP synthase]] \u03b2 subunit. \n\nReplication occurs within the cytoplasm and virions mature by budding through the plasma membrane, where virus-encoded surface glycoproteins E2 and E1 are assimilated.\n\nThese two glycoproteins are the targets of numerous serologic reactions and tests including neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition. The alphaviruses show various degrees of antigenic cross-reactivity in these reactions and this forms the basis for the seven antigenic complexes, 30 species and many subtypes and varieties. The E2 protein is the site of most neutralizing epitopes, while the E1 protein contains more conserved, cross-reactive epitopes.\n\n==Evolution==\nA study of this taxon suggests that this group of viruses had a marine origin\u2014specifically the Southern Ocean\u2014and that they have subsequently spread to both the Old and New World.<ref name=\"pmid22190718\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Forrester NL, Palacios G, Tesh RB, Savji N, Guzman H, Sherman M, Weaver SC, Lipkin WI | title = Genome scale phylogeny of the Alphavirus genus suggests a marine origin | journal = J Virol | volume = 86| issue = 5| pages = 2729\u201338|date=December 2011 | pmid = 22190718 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.05591-11 | pmc = 3302268}}</ref>\n\nThere are three subgroups in this genus: the Semliki Forest virus subgroup (Semliki Forest, O'nyong-nyong and Ross River viruses); the eastern equine encephalitis virus subgroup (eastern equine encephalitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses) and the Sindbis virus subgroup.<ref name=Levinson1990>{{cite journal |vauthors=Levinson RS, Strauss JH, Strauss EG | year = 1990 | title = Complete sequence of the genomic RNA of O'nyong-nyong virus and its use in the construction of alphavirus phylogenetic trees | url = | journal = Virology | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 110\u2013123 | doi=10.1016/0042-6822(90)90191-s}}</ref> Sindbis virus, geographically restricted to the Old World, is more closely related to the eastern equine encephalitis subgroup, which are New World viruses, than it is to the Semliki Forest virus subgroup which is also found in the Old World.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n<big>'''Group: ssRNA(+)'''</big>\n{{Collapsible list|title= <big>Order: Unassigned</big>\n|1={{Collapsible list| framestyle=border:none; padding:1.0em;|title=Family: [[Togaviridae]]\n|1={{hidden begin|title=<small>Genus: Alphavirus</small>}}\n*<small>[[Aura virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Barmah Forest virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Bebaru virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Cabassou virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Chikungunya virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Eilat virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Everglades virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Fort Morgan virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Getah virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Highlands J virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Madariaga virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Mayaro virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Middelburg virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Mosso das Pedras virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Mucambo virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Ndumu virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[O'nyong-nyong virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Pixuna virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Rio Negro virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Ross River virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Salmon pancreas disease virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Semliki Forest virus]]</small>\n*<small>'''''[[Sindbis virus]]'''''</small>\n*<small>[[Southern elephant seal virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Tonate virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Trocara virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Una virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Western equine encephalitis virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Whataroa virus]]</small>\n{{hidden end}}\n}}\n}}<ref>{{cite web |title=ICTV Report Togaviridae |url=https://ictv.global/report/togaviridae}}</ref>\n\nThe seven complexes are:\n\n:'''Barmah Forest virus complex'''\n::[[Barmah Forest virus]]\n\n:'''Eastern equine encephalitis complex'''\n::[[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] (seven antigenic types)\n\n:'''Middelburg virus complex'''\n::[[Middelburg virus]]\n\n:'''Ndumu virus complex'''\n::Ndumu virus\n\n:'''[[Semliki Forest virus complex]]'''\n::[[Bebaru virus]]<!--species of its own, not just subtype of Ross River virus, due to ICTV MSL (#33) Fall 2018-->\n::[[Chikungunya virus]]\n::[[Getah virus]]\n::[[Mayaro virus]]<!--same as Bebaru virus-->\n:::Subtype: [[Una virus]]\n::[[O'nyong'nyong virus]]\n:::Subtype: Igbo-Ora virus\n::[[Ross River virus]]\n:::Subtype: [[Sagiyama virus]]\n::[[Semliki Forest virus]]\n:::Subtype: Me Tri virus\n\n:'''Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex'''\n::Cabassou virus\n::[[Everglades virus]]\n::Mosso das Pedras virus\n::[[Mucambo virus]]\n::Paramana virus\n::Pixuna virus\n::[[R\u00edo Negro (Chaco Province)|Rio Negro]] virus\n::Trocara virus\n:::Subtype: Bijou Bridge virus\n::[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]]\n\n:'''Western equine encephalitis complex'''\n::[[Aura virus]]\n::[[Babanki virus]]\n::[[Kyzylagach virus]]\n::[[Sindbis virus]]\n::[[Ockelbo]] virus\n::[[Whataroa]] virus\n\n:::'''Recombinants within this complex'''\n:::Buggy Creek virus\n:::[[Fort Morgan (Colorado)|Fort Morgan]] virus\n:::[[Highlands J virus]]\n:::[[Western equine encephalitis virus]]\n\n:'''Unclassified'''\n::[[Eilat virus]]\n::[[Mwinilunga]] alphavirus\n::Salmon pancreatic disease virus\n::Rainbow trout sleeping disease virus\n::Southern elephant seal virus\n<!--::[[Ta\u00ef Forest virus]] 'close relative of ''Ebola virus''.

Infectious [[arthritis]], [[encephalitis]], [[rashes]] and [[fever]] are the most commonly observed symptoms. Larger mammals such as humans and horses are usually dead-end hosts or play a minor role in viral transmission; however, in the case of [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]] the virus is mainly amplified in horses. In most other cases the virus is maintained in nature in mosquitoes, rodents and birds.\n\nAlphavirus infections are spread by insect vectors such as mosquitoes. Once a human is bitten by the infected mosquito, the virus can gain entry into the bloodstream, causing [[viremia]]. The alphavirus can also get into the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] where it is able to grow and multiply within the neurones. This can lead to [[encephalitis]], which can be fatal.\n\nWhen an individual is infected with this particular virus, its immune system can play a role in clearing away the virus particles. Alphaviruses are able to cause the production of [[interferons]]. Antibodies and T cells are also involved. The neutralizing antibodies also play an important role to prevent further infection and spread.\n\n==Diagnosis, prevention, and control==\nDiagnoses is based on clinical samples from which the virus can be easily isolated and identified.  There are no alphavirus vaccines currently available.  Vector control with repellents, protective clothing, breeding site destruction, and spraying are the preventive measures of choice.\n\n==Research==\nAlphaviruses are of interest to [[gene therapy]] researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, [[Sindbis virus]], [[Semliki Forest virus]], and [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]] virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for gene delivery. Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and retroviral capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses.  Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to [[retroviral integration|integrate]] the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the retroviral interiors of these vectors. There are limitations to the use of alphaviruses in the field of [[gene therapy]] due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of Sindbis virus envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by Sindbis virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death.  The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create [[replicon (genetics)|replicon]] vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Viruses}}\n* [[Alphavirus infection]]\n\n==Sources==\n*http://virology-online.com/viruses/Arboviruses2.htm\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20060212195722/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/73010000.htm\n*Alphavirus vectors: from protein production to gene therapy, C Smerdou & P Liljestrom, Gene Therapy and Regulation Vol 1 No 1 2000 pp.&nbsp;33\u201363\n*{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/rmv.360|pmid=12211042|title=Alphavirus vectors and vaccination|journal=Reviews in Medical Virology|volume=12|issue=5|pages=279\u2013296|year=2002|last1=Rayner|first1=Jonathan O|last2=Dryga|first2=Sergey A|last3=Kamrud|first3=Kurt I}}\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20070302184833/http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/content/full/90/1/45\n*https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7633/\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://ictv.global/report/togaviridae '''ICTV Report <i>Togaviridae</i>''']\n* [http://www.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/625.html '''Viralzone''': Alphavirus]\n* [http://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.do?decorator=toga Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR): Togaviridae]\n{{InterPro content|IPR000936}}\n\n{{InterPro content|IPR002533}}\n\n{{InterPro content|IPR002548}}\n\n{{Baltimore classification}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1111605}}\n\n[[Category:Togaviruses]]\n[[Category:Alphaviruses]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|alphaherpesvirus}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Virusbox\n| image = Alphavirus.png\n| image_alt = A computer-generated model of the surface of an \"Alphavirus\" derived by cryoelectron microscopy.

Alphavirus particles are enveloped, have a 70&nbsp;nm diameter, tend to be spherical (although slightly [[Pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]]), and have a 40&nbsp;nm isometric [[nucleocapsid]].<ref name= ICTV >{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=R |last2=Mukhopadhyay |first2=S |last3=Merits |first3=A |last4=Bolling |first4=B |last5=Nasar |first5=F |last6=Coffey |first6=LL |last7=Powers |first7=A |last8=Weaver |first8=SC |last9=Ictv Report |first9=Consortium |title=ICTV Virus Taxonomy Profile: Togaviridae. |journal=The Journal of General Virology |date=June 2018 |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=761-762 |doi=10.1099/jgv.0.001072 |pmid=29745869}}</ref>\n\n==Genome==\n{{Infobox protein family\n| Symbol = Alpha_E1_glycop\n| Name = Alpha_E1_glycop\n| image = PDB 1rer EBI.jpg\n| width = \n| caption = Crystal structure of the [[homotrimer]] of fusion glycoprotein E1 from Semliki Forest virus\n| Pfam = PF01589\n| Pfam_clan =  \n| InterPro = IPR002548\n| SMART = \n| PROSITE = \n| MEROPS = \n| SCOP = 1rer\n| TCDB = 1.G\n| OPM family = 109\n| OPM protein = 1rer\n| CAZy = \n| CDD = \n}}\n{{Infobox protein family\n| Symbol = Alpha_E2_glycop\n| Name = Alpha_E2_glycop\n| image = PDB 1z8y EBI.jpg\n| width = \n| caption = Mapping the E2 glycoprotein of alphaviruses\n| Pfam = PF00943\n| Pfam_clan =  \n| InterPro = IPR000936\n| SMART = \n| PROSITE = \n| MEROPS = \n| SCOP = \n| TCDB = 1.G\n| OPM family = 109\n| OPM protein = 2yew\n| CAZy = \n| CDD = \n}}\n{{Infobox protein family\n| Symbol = Alpha_E3_glycop\n| Name = Alpha_E3_glycop\n| image = \n| width = \n| caption = \n| Pfam = PF01563\n| Pfam_clan =  \n| InterPro = IPR002533\n| SMART = \n| PROSITE = \n| MEROPS = \n| SCOP = \n| TCDB = 1.G\n| OPM family = 109\n| OPM protein = \n| CAZy = \n| CDD = \n}}\nThe alphaviruses are small, spherical, enveloped viruses with a genome of a single strand of positive-sense RNA. The total genome length ranges between 11,000 and 12,000 nucleotides, and has a 5\u2019 cap and a 3\u2019 [[poly-A tail]]. The four non-structural protein genes are encoded in the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome, while the three structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mRNA colinear with the 3\u2032 one-third of the genome.\n\nThere are two [[open reading frames]] (ORFs) in the genome, nonstructural and structural. The first is non-structural and encodes proteins (nsP1\u2013nsP4) necessary for transcription and replication of viral RNA. The second encodes three [[secondary structure|structural]] proteins: the core [[nucleocapsid]] [[protein]] C, and the envelope [[protein]]s P62 and E1, which associate as a [[heterodimer]]. The viral membrane-anchored surface [[glycoproteins]] are responsible for [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] recognition and entry into target [[cell (biology)|cell]]s through [[membrane fusion]].\n\n===Structural proteins===\nThe [[proteolytic]] maturation of P62 into E2 and E3 causes a change in the viral surface. Together the E1, E2, and sometimes E3, [[glycoprotein]] \"spikes\" form an E1/E2 [[protein dimer|dimer]] or an E1/E2/E3 trimer, where E2 extends from the centre to the vertices, E1 fills the space between the vertices, and E3, if present, is at the distal end of the spike.<ref name=\"pmid8107141\">{{cite journal | author = V\u00e9nien-Bryan C, Fuller SD | title = The organization of the spike complex of Semliki Forest virus | journal = J.

Most alphaviruses lose the peripheral protein E3, but in Semliki viruses it remains associated with the viral surface.\n\n===Nonstructural proteins===\nFour nonstructural proteins (nsP1\u20134) which are produced as a single polyprotein constitute the virus' replication machinery.<ref name=Shin2012>Shin G, Yost SA, Miller MT, Elrod EJ, Grakoui A, Marcotrigiano J (2012) Structural and functional insights into alphavirus polyprotein processing and pathogenesis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA</ref> The processing of the polyprotein occurs in a highly regulated manner, with cleavage at the P2/3 junction influencing RNA template use during genome replication. This site is located at the base of a narrow cleft and is not readily accessible. Once cleaved nsP3 creates a ring structure that encircles nsP2. These two proteins have an extensive interface.\n\nMutations in nsP2 that produce noncytopathic viruses or a temperature sensitive phenotypes cluster at the P2/P3 interface region. P3 mutations opposite the location of the nsP2 noncytopathic mutations prevent efficient cleavage of P2/3. This in turn affects RNA infectivity altering viral RNA production levels.\n\n==Virology==\n\nThe virus has a 60\u201370 [[nanometer]] diameter. It is enveloped, spherical and has a positive-strand RNA genome of ~12 kilobases. The genome encodes two polyproteins. The first polyprotein consists of four non-structural units: in order from the N terminal to the C terminal - nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4. The second is a structural polyprotein composed of five expression units: from the N terminal to the C terminal - Capsid, E3, E2, 6K and E1. A sub genomic positive strand RNA - the 26S RNA - is replicated from a negative-stranded RNA intermediate. This serves as template for the synthesis of viral structural proteins. Most alphaviruses have conserved domains involved in regulation of viral RNA synthesis. \n\nThe nucleocapsid, 40 nanometers in diameter, contains 240 copies of the capsid protein and has a T = 4 icosahedral symmetry. The E1 and E2 viral glycoproteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer. Single E1 and E2 molecules associate to form heterodimers. The E1\u2013E2 heterodimers form one-to-one contacts between the E2 protein and the nucleocapsid monomers. The E1 and E2 proteins mediate contact between the virus and the host cell. \n\nSeveral receptors have been identified. These include [[prohibitin]], [[phosphatidylserine]], [[glycosaminoglycan]]s and [[ATP synthase]] \u03b2 subunit. \n\nReplication occurs within the cytoplasm and virions mature by budding through the plasma membrane, where virus-encoded surface glycoproteins E2 and E1 are assimilated.\n\nThese two glycoproteins are the targets of numerous serologic reactions and tests including neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition. The alphaviruses show various degrees of antigenic cross-reactivity in these reactions and this forms the basis for the seven antigenic complexes, 30 species and many subtypes and varieties. The E2 protein is the site of most neutralizing epitopes, while the E1 protein contains more conserved, cross-reactive epitopes.\n\n==Evolution==\nA study of this taxon suggests that this group of viruses had a marine origin\u2014specifically the Southern Ocean\u2014and that they have subsequently spread to both the Old and New World.<ref name=\"pmid22190718\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Forrester NL, Palacios G, Tesh RB, Savji N, Guzman H, Sherman M, Weaver SC, Lipkin WI | title = Genome scale phylogeny of the Alphavirus genus suggests a marine origin | journal = J Virol | volume = 86| issue = 5| pages = 2729\u201338|date=December 2011 | pmid = 22190718 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.05591-11 | pmc = 3302268}}</ref>\n\nThere are three subgroups in this genus: the Semliki Forest virus subgroup (Semliki Forest, O'nyong-nyong and Ross River viruses); the eastern equine encephalitis virus subgroup (eastern equine encephalitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses) and the Sindbis virus subgroup.<ref name=Levinson1990>{{cite journal |vauthors=Levinson RS, Strauss JH, Strauss EG | year = 1990 | title = Complete sequence of the genomic RNA of O'nyong-nyong virus and its use in the construction of alphavirus phylogenetic trees | url = | journal = Virology | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 110\u2013123 | doi=10.1016/0042-6822(90)90191-s}}</ref> Sindbis virus, geographically restricted to the Old World, is more closely related to the eastern equine encephalitis subgroup, which are New World viruses, than it is to the Semliki Forest virus subgroup which is also found in the Old World.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n<big>'''Group: ssRNA(+)'''</big>\n{{Collapsible list|title= <big>Order: Unassigned</big>\n|1={{Collapsible list| framestyle=border:none; padding:1.0em;|title=Family: [[Togaviridae]]\n|1={{hidden begin|title=<small>Genus: Alphavirus</small>}}\n*<small>[[Aura virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Barmah Forest virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Bebaru virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Cabassou virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Chikungunya virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Eilat virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Everglades virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Fort Morgan virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Getah virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Highlands J virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Madariaga virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Mayaro virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Middelburg virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Mosso das Pedras virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Mucambo virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Ndumu virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[O'nyong-nyong virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Pixuna virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Rio Negro virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Ross River virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Salmon pancreas disease virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Semliki Forest virus]]</small>\n*<small>'''''[[Sindbis virus]]'''''</small>\n*<small>[[Southern elephant seal virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Tonate virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Trocara virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Una virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Western equine encephalitis virus]]</small>\n*<small>[[Whataroa virus]]</small>\n{{hidden end}}\n}}\n}}<ref>{{cite web |title=ICTV Report Togaviridae |url=https://ictv.global/report/togaviridae}}</ref>\n\nThe seven complexes are:\n\n:'''Barmah Forest virus complex'''\n::[[Barmah Forest virus]]\n\n:'''Eastern equine encephalitis complex'''\n::[[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] (seven antigenic types)\n\n:'''Middelburg virus complex'''\n::[[Middelburg virus]]\n\n:'''Ndumu virus complex'''\n::Ndumu virus\n\n:'''[[Semliki Forest virus complex]]'''\n::[[Bebaru virus]]<!--species of its own, not just subtype of Ross River virus, due to ICTV MSL (#33) Fall 2018-->\n::[[Chikungunya virus]]\n::[[Getah virus]]\n::[[Mayaro virus]]<!--same as Bebaru virus-->\n:::Subtype: [[Una virus]]\n::[[O'nyong'nyong virus]]\n:::Subtype: Igbo-Ora virus\n::[[Ross River virus]]\n:::Subtype: [[Sagiyama virus]]\n::[[Semliki Forest virus]]\n:::Subtype: Me Tri virus\n\n:'''Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex'''\n::Cabassou virus\n::[[Everglades virus]]\n::Mosso das Pedras virus\n::[[Mucambo virus]]\n::Paramana virus\n::Pixuna virus\n::[[R\u00edo Negro (Chaco Province)|Rio Negro]] virus\n::Trocara virus\n:::Subtype: Bijou Bridge virus\n::[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]]\n\n:'''Western equine encephalitis complex'''\n::[[Aura virus]]\n::[[Babanki virus]]\n::[[Kyzylagach virus]]\n::[[Sindbis virus]]\n::[[Ockelbo]] virus\n::[[Whataroa]] virus\n\n:::'''Recombinants within this complex'''\n:::Buggy Creek virus\n:::[[Fort Morgan (Colorado)|Fort Morgan]] virus\n:::[[Highlands J virus]]\n:::[[Western equine encephalitis virus]]\n\n:'''Unclassified'''\n::[[Eilat virus]]\n::[[Mwinilunga]] alphavirus\n::Salmon pancreatic disease virus\n::Rainbow trout sleeping disease virus\n::Southern elephant seal virus\n<!--::[[Ta\u00ef Forest virus]] 'close relative of ''Ebola virus''.

Infectious [[arthritis]], [[encephalitis]], [[rashes]] and [[fever]] are the most commonly observed symptoms. Larger mammals such as humans and horses are usually dead-end hosts or play a minor role in viral transmission; however, in the case of [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]] the virus is mainly amplified in horses. In most other cases the virus is maintained in nature in mosquitoes, rodents and birds.\n\nAlphavirus infections are spread by insect vectors such as mosquitoes. Once a human is bitten by the infected mosquito, the virus can gain entry into the bloodstream, causing [[viremia]]. The alphavirus can also get into the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] where it is able to grow and multiply within the neurones. This can lead to [[encephalitis]], which can be fatal.\n\nWhen an individual is infected with this particular virus, its immune system can play a role in clearing away the virus particles. Alphaviruses are able to cause the production of [[interferons]]. Antibodies and T cells are also involved. The neutralizing antibodies also play an important role to prevent further infection and spread.\n\n==Diagnosis, prevention, and control==\nDiagnoses is based on clinical samples from which the virus can be easily isolated and identified.  There are no alphavirus vaccines currently available.  Vector control with repellents, protective clothing, breeding site destruction, and spraying are the preventive measures of choice.\n\n==Research==\nAlphaviruses are of interest to [[gene therapy]] researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, [[Sindbis virus]], [[Semliki Forest virus]], and [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]] virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for gene delivery. Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and retroviral capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses.  Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to [[retroviral integration|integrate]] the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the retroviral interiors of these vectors. There are limitations to the use of alphaviruses in the field of [[gene therapy]] due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of Sindbis virus envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by Sindbis virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death.  The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create [[replicon (genetics)|replicon]] vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Viruses}}\n* [[Alphavirus infection]]\n\n==Sources==\n*http://virology-online.com/viruses/Arboviruses2.htm\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20060212195722/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/73010000.htm\n*Alphavirus vectors: from protein production to gene therapy, C Smerdou & P Liljestrom, Gene Therapy and Regulation Vol 1 No 1 2000 pp.&nbsp;33\u201363\n*{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/rmv.360|pmid=12211042|title=Alphavirus vectors and vaccination|journal=Reviews in Medical Virology|volume=12|issue=5|pages=279\u2013296|year=2002|last1=Rayner|first1=Jonathan O|last2=Dryga|first2=Sergey A|last3=Kamrud|first3=Kurt I}}\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20070302184833/http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/content/full/90/1/45\n*https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7633/\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://ictv.global/report/togaviridae '''ICTV Report <i>Togaviridae</i>''']\n* [http://www.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/625.html '''Viralzone''': Alphavirus]\n* [http://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.do?decorator=toga Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR): Togaviridae]\n{{InterPro content|IPR000936}}\n\n{{InterPro content|IPR002533}}\n\n{{InterPro content|IPR002548}}\n\n{{Baltimore classification}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1111605}}\n\n[[Category:Togaviruses]]\n[[Category:Alphaviruses]]\n", "name_user": "Martian-2008", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphavirus"}

He is the lead singer and lyricist of the band [[Travis (band)|Travis]], having written nearly all of the songs on their first six studio albums, with the 7th and 8th being more of a co-written work. He is based in [[Berlin]]. Healy released his debut solo album titled ''[[Wreckorder]]'' in October 2010, which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass.\n\n==Early life==\nAlthough born in [[Stafford]], [[England]], Healy grew up in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] \u2013 his parents' hometown. His mother had moved back to Scotland after divorcing her husband. Healy has said that both his mother and his grandmother were major influences on him as a child. Healy attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]] in Glasgow.\n\nAs a young child at primary school, he was awarded a book of [[Robert Burns]] poems and a certificate \"For Outstanding Singing Abilities\" after singing the old Scottish song \"Westering Home\" while dressed in a kilt. However, Healy showed no further interest in singing until his teens. His obsession with songwriting began to take shape when he got his first guitar in 1986 at the age of 13, having seen [[Roy Orbison]] perform his hit [[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]] on ''[[The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross]]''. First songs played on the guitar were old rock'n'roll numbers like \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" and \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]]. His first complete song was written about the headmaster of his school, Peter Mullen, entitled \"Mr. Mullen Blues\", with a sample lyric: ''\"...and there was Pete Mullen, with his pie and beans. It was then I smelled it, it filled the room. Then some wee bugger lit a match and the whole place went Ka-BOOM...Where's your tie boy? Pick up that can. Get in line girl, do you understand...Cause his name is big Pete Mullen...And he's a man\"''. He performed it at the school talent show but failed to move the judges. He then played in several school bands.\n\n==Travis==\n{{Main|Travis (band)}}\n[[File:Travis 2007 II.jpg|thumb|right|Healy Performing With Travis.]]\nIn 1991,  [[Neil Primrose (musician)|Neil Primrose]], the drummer of Glasgow band Glass Onion, asked Healy if he would like to audition for the band; their previous singer, Catherine Maxwell, had just left the band. Healy joined the band on the same day he enrolled at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. This band soon changed their name to [[Travis (band)|Travis]], named after the main character in the [[Wim Wenders]] movie ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''.\n\nTravis' first single, \"[[All I Want to Do Is Rock]]\", was written by Healy while on a visit to [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] on Great [[Cumbrae]], a small island in the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Going there with the sole intention of composing the best song he had ever written, Healy surprised even himself when the track was born.

He is the lead singer and lyricist of the band [[Travis (band)|Travis]], having written nearly all of the songs on their first six studio albums, with the 7th and 8th being more of a co-written work. He is based in [[Berlin]]. Healy released his debut solo album titled ''[[Wreckorder]]'' in October 2010, which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass.\n\n==Early life==\nAlthough born in [[Stafford]], [[England]], Healy grew up in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] \u2013 his parents' hometown. His mother had moved back to Scotland after divorcing her husband. Healy has said that both his mother and his grandmother were major influences on him as a child. Healy attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]] in Glasgow.\n\nAs a young child at primary school, he was awarded a book of [[Robert Burns]] poems and a certificate \"For Outstanding Singing Abilities\" after singing the old Scottish song \"Westering Home\" while dressed in a kilt. However, Healy showed no further interest in singing until his teens. His obsession with songwriting began to take shape when he got his first guitar in 1986 at the age of 13, having seen [[Roy Orbison]] perform his hit [[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]] on ''[[The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross]]''. First songs played on the guitar were old rock'n'roll numbers like \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" and \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]]. His first complete song was written about the headmaster of his school, Peter Mullen, entitled \"Mr. Mullen Blues\", with a sample lyric: ''\"...and there was Pete Mullen, with his pie and beans. It was then I smelled it, it filled the room. Then some wee bugger lit a match and the whole place went Ka-BOOM...Where's your tie boy? Pick up that can. Get in line girl, do you understand...Cause his name is big Pete Mullen...And he's a man\"''. He performed it at the school talent show but failed to move the judges. He then played in several school bands.\n\n==Travis==\n{{Main|Travis (band)}}\n[[File:Travis 2007 II.jpg|thumb|right|Healy Performing With Travis.]]\nIn 1991,  [[Neil Primrose (musician)|Neil Primrose]], the drummer of Glasgow band Glass Onion, asked Healy if he would like to audition for the band; their previous singer, Catherine Maxwell, had just left the band. Healy joined the band on the same day he enrolled at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. This band soon changed their name to [[Travis (band)|Travis]], named after the main character in the [[Wim Wenders]] movie ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''.\n\nTravis' first single, \"[[All I Want to Do Is Rock]]\", was written by Healy while on a visit to [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] on Great [[Cumbrae]], a small island in the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Going there with the sole intention of composing the best song he had ever written, Healy surprised even himself when the track was born. In spite of Healy's success as a songwriter since, he is without formal musical training. As the band has risen to prominence, Healy has continued to be [[Travis (band)|Travis]]' main songwriter, as well as the band's main spokesman and most recognisable member.\n\nTravis has twice been awarded British album of the year at the annual [[BRIT Awards]], and is credited as having paved the way for British bands such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Keane (band)|Keane]].

{"title_page": "Geza csosz", "text_new": "\n\n'''Geza Csosz''' is a Hungarian-born English photographer. Even though he learned his lesson well in composing the accidental moment with precision, in manner of Cartier-Bresson or Josef Koudelka; he uses this knowledge from a rather original perspective. As often his children are the subject of his art, it is inevitably filled with love and intimacy. He does not force the style well learned, and the quasi spontaneity lends his pictures a unique aura, a differentiating feature. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThings will work out just fine, if you let go.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 These moments of his, in addition to being spontaneous, are incredibly intense, at times even mysterious, or grim at others. They bear, however, no symbolism whatsoever: his abstractions are absolutely photogenic, and the message is the complex ambiguity of the reality behind these pictures. Geza completely trusts viewers to decipher it.\n\nThe key momentum of the aesthetic value is the density of the reference network of analogies within the work of art, i.e. only stylistic fiction can lend meaning to the documented reality in any form of art. Dave\u2019s style has some banality and a touch of irony to it. These elevate what we see and scrape the ultimate questions. \u00a0 \u201cHe who has a sense of humour knows everything, he who does not is capable of anything. \u00a0 \u00a0 His \u201cgenre scenes\u201d remind me of the world of Hrabal and Jindrich Streit, of the bitter irony that by the time we die, we could be quite good at living\u2026 I trust you to decide if this is the resigned scepticism against a petty, vulnerable life, or if it\u2019s a way of posing wise and deeply critical questions. A speculative humanist is someone who, in theory and generally speaking, loves people, but does not love anyone in specific.\u00a0 In Geza\u2019s pictures I sense genuine attention and empathy towards others.\n\nOrdinary existence, in terms of art, is a rather thin medium, with a seemingly limited number of possibly aesthetic moments. Dave\u2019s \u00a0''faux na\u00eff'' attitude led to surprisingly dense pictures, which have a total lack of academic tedium and boredom, pretentious surreal fantasies, or meaninglessness. Often, he entrusts everything on the atmosphere, at other times he just goes with the flow and leaves space for coincidence. It\u2019s as if his attitude as an artist has a complete lack of intention. Actually, he is just very good at hiding it. \u00a0\n\nGeza is definitely not a fundamentalist artist. His humility, intelligence, strong sense of aesthetics and his passionate commitment would make for an ideal combination in a perfect world\u2026 \n\nArt does help you live, but what it doesn\u2019t do is tell you how you can and should lead your life. Any artist is extremely vulnerable to isolation and loneliness, as there is no such thing as understanding, only misunderstanding. \u00a0You spring back from the concept of art, just like that of God. We think we know the meaning, but we have no idea, and yet this is our only refuge, our only chance of immortality: only art is more powerful than death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.photocsosz.net/2016/05/16/pszeudoprivat/|title=PseudoPrivat \u2013 GEZA CSOSZ|last=Csosz|first=Geza|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\u00a0 \u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phoo.hu/2016/04/29/pszeudoprivat-csosz-geza-fotoi/|title=PszeudoPriv\u00e1t - Cs\u0151sz G\u00e9za fot\u00f3i|language=hu|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\n\n== About ==\nGeza Csosz was introduced to photo labs at primary school by Istv\u00e1n Schlachta.

In addition to science competitions, he has won several photos and short films.

Even though he learned his lesson well in composing the accidental moment with precision, in manner of Cartier-Bresson or Josef Koudelka; he uses this knowledge from a rather original perspective. As often his children are the subject of his art, it is inevitably filled with love and intimacy. He does not force the style well learned, and the quasi spontaneity lends his pictures a unique aura, a differentiating feature. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThings will work out just fine, if you let go.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 These moments of his, in addition to being spontaneous, are incredibly intense, at times even mysterious, or grim at others. They bear, however, no symbolism whatsoever: his abstractions are absolutely photogenic, and the message is the complex ambiguity of the reality behind these pictures. Geza completely trusts viewers to decipher it.\n\nThe key momentum of the aesthetic value is the density of the reference network of analogies within the work of art, i.e. only stylistic fiction can lend meaning to the documented reality in any form of art. Dave\u2019s style has some banality and a touch of irony to it. These elevate what we see and scrape the ultimate questions. \u00a0 \u201cHe who has a sense of humour knows everything, he who does not is capable of anything. \u00a0 \u00a0 His \u201cgenre scenes\u201d remind me of the world of Hrabal and Jindrich Streit, of the bitter irony that by the time we die, we could be quite good at living\u2026 I trust you to decide if this is the resigned scepticism against a petty, vulnerable life, or if it\u2019s a way of posing wise and deeply critical questions. A speculative humanist is someone who, in theory and generally speaking, loves people, but does not love anyone in specific.\u00a0 In Geza\u2019s pictures I sense genuine attention and empathy towards others.\n\nOrdinary existence, in terms of art, is a rather thin medium, with a seemingly limited number of possibly aesthetic moments. Dave\u2019s \u00a0''faux na\u00eff'' attitude led to surprisingly dense pictures, which have a total lack of academic tedium and boredom, pretentious surreal fantasies, or meaninglessness. Often, he entrusts everything on the atmosphere, at other times he just goes with the flow and leaves space for coincidence. It\u2019s as if his attitude as an artist has a complete lack of intention. Actually, he is just very good at hiding it. \u00a0\n\nGeza is definitely not a fundamentalist artist. His humility, intelligence, strong sense of aesthetics and his passionate commitment would make for an ideal combination in a perfect world\u2026 \n\nArt does help you live, but what it doesn\u2019t do is tell you how you can and should lead your life. Any artist is extremely vulnerable to isolation and loneliness, as there is no such thing as understanding, only misunderstanding. \u00a0You spring back from the concept of art, just like that of God. We think we know the meaning, but we have no idea, and yet this is our only refuge, our only chance of immortality: only art is more powerful than death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.photocsosz.net/2016/05/16/pszeudoprivat/|title=PseudoPrivat \u2013 GEZA CSOSZ|last=Csosz|first=Geza|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\u00a0 \u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phoo.hu/2016/04/29/pszeudoprivat-csosz-geza-fotoi/|title=PszeudoPriv\u00e1t - Cs\u0151sz G\u00e9za fot\u00f3i|language=hu|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\n\n== About ==\nGeza Csosz was introduced to photo labs at primary school by Istv\u00e1n Schlachta. During his high school years, he used his daily photo lab in the basement. During his tedious high school years, he took more and more photos and films. In addition to science competitions, he has won several photos and short films. He began his photographic studies in Ecole des Beaux-Arts Sion in Switzerland, then completed his studies at UNI Vienna and finally at the Szellemk\u00e9p Szabadiskol\u00e1ban<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.szellemkep.hu/index.php?page=fotografusok&tag=41|title=Szellemk\u00e9p Szabadiskola {{!}} Fotogr\u00e1fusok|work=www.szellemkep.hu|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref>  in Budapest.\n\nNext to him, he became known as a enamel artist.
