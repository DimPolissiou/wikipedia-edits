He was the only Soviet politician who managed to remain at the highest levels of power within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], as that power oscillated between the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], from the latter days of Lenin's rule, throughout the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev, until his peaceful retirement after the first months of Brezhnev's rule.\n\nMikoyan became an early convert to the Bolshevik cause. He was a strong supporter of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of [[Minister of Foreign Trade]]. By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan began to lose favour with him, and in 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of minister of foreign trade. In October 1952 at the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]] Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his [[de-Stalinization]] policy and became [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.\n\nMikoyan made several key trips to communist [[Cuba]] and to the United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising [[soft power]] to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], the nominal Head of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Ordzhonikidze, Stalin and Mikoyan, 1925.jpg|245px|left|thumb|The Caucasus trio: From left to right, Mikoyan, [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]]]]\nMikoyan was born to [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents in the village of [[Sanahin]], then a part of the [[Yelizavetpol Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (currently a part of [[Alaverdi, Armenia|Alaverdi]] in [[Armenia]]'s [[Lori Province]]) in 1895.

However, in 1936 he enthusiastically supported the execution of [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], claiming it to be a \"just verdict.\" As with other leading officials in 1937, Mikoyan signed death-lists given to him by the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=256}} The purges were often accomplished by officials close to Stalin, giving them the assignment largely as a way to test their loyalty to the regime.\n\nIn September 1937 Stalin dispatched Mikoyan, along with [[Georgy Malenkov]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]], with a list of 300 names to [[Yerevan]], the capital of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks.

Mikoyan reported that Mao was proclaiming Stalin to be the supreme leader of world communism and 'teacher of the Chinese people', but in his report he added that Mao did not genuinely believe what he was saying.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chang |first1=Jung |last2=Halliday |first2=Jon |title=Mao, the Unknown Story |year=2007 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-950737-6 |oclc=774136780 |pages=416\u2013417 |ref=harv }}</ref> It was at Mikoyan's insistence that the Chinese communists arrested the US journalist [[Sidney Rittenberg]].{{sfn|Chang|Halliday|2007|page=418}}\n\n=== Czechoslovakia ===\nOn 11 November 1951, Mikoyan made a sudden visit to Prague to deliver a message from Stalin to President [[Klement Gottwald]] insisting that the [[Rudolf Slansky]], former Secretary-General of the Czechoslovak communist party, should be arrested. When Gottwald demurred, Mikoyan broke off the interview to ring Stalin, before repeating the demand, after which Gottwald capitulated. This was the biggest single step towards the preparation of the [[Slansky Trial]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Komunistick\u00e1 Strana C\u0306eskoslovenska.

As Khrushchev's primary emissary, Mikoyan visited the United States several times. Despite the volatility of the [[Cold War]] between the two superpowers, many Americans received Mikoyan amiably, including Minnesota Democrat [[Hubert Humphrey]], who characterized him as someone who showed a \"flexibility of attitude\" and [[New York (state)|New York]] governor [[Averell Harriman]], who described him as a \"less rigid\" Soviet politician.<ref name=\"Timemag2\">{{cite journal|author=Staff writer |title=Foreign Relations: Down to Hard Cases |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892066,00.html |accessdate=19 January 2011 |date=26 January 1959 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201082635/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C892066%2C00.html |archivedate=1 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring November 1958 Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of [[Berlin]] into an independent, demilitarized \"free city\", giving the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the [[East German]]s. Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev's actions, claiming they violated \"Party principle.\" Khrushchev had proposed the ultimatum to the West before discussing it with the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]. Ruud van Djik, a historian, believed Mikoyan was angry because Khrushchev didn't consult him about the proposal. When asked by Khrushchev to ease tension with the United States, Mikoyan responded, \"You started it, so you go!\"{{sfn|Taubman|2004|p=409}}\n\nHowever, Mikoyan eventually left for Washington, which was the first time a senior governing member of the USSR's [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] visited the United States on a diplomatic mission to its leadership. Furthermore, Mikoyan approached the mission with an unprecedented informality, beginning with phrasing his visa request to US Embassy as \"a fortnight's holiday\" to visit his friend, Mikhail Menshikov, the then Soviet Ambassador to the United States. While the White House was taken off guard by this seemingly impromptu diplomatic mission, Mikoyan was invited to speak to numerous elite American organizations such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and the [[Detroit Club]] in which he professed his hopes for the USSR to have a more peaceful relationship with the US. In addition to such well received engagements, Mikoyan indulged in more informal opportunities to meet the public such as having breakfast at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], visiting [[Macy's Department Store]] in [[New York City]] and meeting celebrities in [[Hollywood]] like [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Sophia Loren]] before having an audience with President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Fred|title=1959: The Year Everything Changed|year=2009|publisher=J.

Khrushchev realized the potential of a Soviet ally in the [[Caribbean]] and dispatched Mikoyan as one of the top diplomats in Latin America. He was the first Soviet official (discounting Soviet intelligence officers) to visit Cuba after the revolution, and secured important trade agreements with the new government.<ref name=\"CWV\"/> He left Cuba with a very positive impression, saying that the atmosphere there made him feel \"as though I had returned to my childhood.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2004|pp=532\u2013533}}\n\nKhrushchev told Mikoyan of his idea of shipping Soviet missiles to Cuba. Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles.<ref name=\"CWV\"/> In early November 1962, after the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a framework [[Cuban Missile Crisis|to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba]], Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to [[Havana]] to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal.<ref>See [[Sergo Mikoyan|Mikoyan, Sergo]]; Svetlana Savranskaya (ed.)

He told Castro, \"You know that not only in these letters but today also, we hold to the position that you will keep all the weapons and all the military specialists with the exception of the 'offensive' weapons and associated service personnel, which were promised to be withdrawn in Khrushchev's letter [of October 27].\"<ref>Savranskaya, Svetlana. \"[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB393/ The Soviet Cuban Missile Crisis: Castro, Mikoyan, Kennedy, Khrushchev, and the Missiles of November].\" [[George Washington University]].</ref> Castro balked at the idea of further concessions, namely the removal of the [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] bombers and tactical nuclear weapons still left in Cuba.

Alone among Khrushchev's colleagues, Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement, and he, alone, visited Khrushchev at his dacha a few years later.

He has been described as an intelligent man, understanding English, having learned [[German language|German]] on his own by translating the German version of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into [[Russian language|Russian]]. Unlike many others, Mikoyan was not afraid to get into a heated argument with Stalin. \"One was never bored with Mikoyan\", Artyom Sergeev notes, while Khrushchev called him a true [[cavalier]]. However, Khrushchev warned of trusting \"that shrewd fox from the east.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=83n}} In a close conversation with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], Stalin referred to Mikoyan as a \"duckling in politics\"; he noted, however, that if Mikoyan ever took a serious shot he would improve.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=52}} Mikoyan had so many children, five boys and the two sons of the late Bolshevik leader [[Stepan Shahumyan]], that he and his wife faced economic problems.

revolutionary, [[Old Bolshevik]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] statesman during the mandates of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]]. He was the only Soviet politician who managed to remain at the highest levels of power within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], as that power oscillated between the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], from the latter days of Lenin's rule, throughout the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev, until his peaceful retirement after the first months of Brezhnev's rule.\n\nMikoyan became an early convert to the Bolshevik cause. He was a strong supporter of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of [[Minister of Foreign Trade]]. By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan began to lose favour with him, and in 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of minister of foreign trade. In October 1952 at the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]] Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his [[de-Stalinization]] policy and became [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.\n\nMikoyan made several key trips to communist [[Cuba]] and to the United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising [[soft power]] to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], the nominal Head of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Ordzhonikidze, Stalin and Mikoyan, 1925.jpg|245px|left|thumb|The Caucasus trio: From left to right, Mikoyan, [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]]]]\nMikoyan was born to [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents in the village of [[Sanahin]], then a part of the [[Yelizavetpol Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (currently a part of [[Alaverdi, Armenia|Alaverdi]] in [[Armenia]]'s [[Lori Province]]) in 1895.

As Khrushchev's primary emissary, Mikoyan visited the United States several times. Despite the volatility of the [[Cold War]] between the two superpowers, many Americans received Mikoyan amiably, including Minnesota Democrat [[Hubert Humphrey]], who characterized him as someone who showed a \"flexibility of attitude\" and [[New York (state)|New York]] governor [[Averell Harriman]], who described him as a \"less rigid\" Soviet politician.<ref name=\"Timemag2\">{{cite journal|author=Staff writer |title=Foreign Relations: Down to Hard Cases |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892066,00.html |accessdate=19 January 2011 |date=26 January 1959 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201082635/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C892066%2C00.html |archivedate=1 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring November 1958 Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of [[Berlin]] into an independent, demilitarized \"free city\", giving the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the [[East German]]s. Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev's actions, claiming they violated \"Party principle.\" Khrushchev had proposed the ultimatum to the West before discussing it with the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]. Ruud van Djik, a historian, believed Mikoyan was angry because Khrushchev didn't consult him about the proposal. When asked by Khrushchev to ease tension with the United States, Mikoyan responded, \"You started it, so you go!\"{{sfn|Taubman|2004|p=409}}\n\nHowever, Mikoyan eventually left for Washington, which was the first time a senior governing member of the USSR's [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] visited the United States on a diplomatic mission to its leadership. Furthermore, Mikoyan approached the mission with an unprecedented informality, beginning with phrasing his visa request to US Embassy as \"a fortnight's holiday\" to visit his friend, Mikhail Menshikov, the then Soviet Ambassador to the United States. While the White House was taken off guard by this seemingly impromptu diplomatic mission, Mikoyan was invited to speak to numerous elite American organizations such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and the [[Detroit Club]] in which he professed his hopes for the USSR to have a more peaceful relationship with the US. In addition to such well received engagements, Mikoyan indulged in more informal opportunities to meet the public such as having breakfast at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], visiting [[Macy's Department Store]] in [[New York City]] and meeting celebrities in [[Hollywood]] like [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Sophia Loren]] before having an audience with President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Fred|title=1959: The Year Everything Changed|year=2009|publisher=J.

{"title_page": "Disadvantage", "text_new": "{{other uses|Disadvantaged}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2010}}\n{{Policy Debate}} \nIn [[policy debate]], a '''disadvantage''' (abbreviated as '''DA''', and sometimes referred to as:  '''Disad''') is an argument that a team brings up against a policy action that is being considered. This is why you don\u2019t use Wikipedia\n\n==Structure==\nA Disadvantage usually has four key elements. These four elements are not always necessary depending on the type of disadvantage run, and some are often combined into a single piece of evidence. A Unique Link card, for example, will include both a description of the status quo and the plan's effect on it. A traditional threshold DA, however, has a structure as follows:\n\n===Uniqueness===\n\nUniqueness shows why the Impacts haven't  occurred yet or to a substantial extent and will ''uniquely'' occur with the adoption of either the Affirmative's plan or the Negative's counterplan.\n\n Like an Example: If the negative team argues that the affirmative plan will result in nuclear proliferation, it would also argue that the status quo will avoid nuclear proliferation.  If the Affirmative claims that nuclear proliferation is already occurring, the negative team could argue that adoption of the plan would result in a ''unique'' increase in nuclear proliferation.  If the plan causes no net change in the rate of nuclear proliferation, the disadvantage is not unique to the plan, and therefore not relevant.\n\n===External links===\nFor the disadvantage to have relevance in the round, the negative team must show that the affirmative plan causes the disadvantage that is claimed.  If the DA stated that the plan takes money from the government, and the affirmative team shows that the plan does not increase governmental spending, then the DA would be considered to have \"no link\".\n\n===Internal link===\n\nThe internal link connects the link to the impact, or, it shows the steps the link causes to get to the impact. Not all DA's use an internal link but some have multiple internals. The internal link in our example would be that government spending leads to economic collapse.\n\n===Impact===\nThe impact is the result of the policy action that make it undesirable. These results are at the end of the chain of reasoning of your DA (starts with your link with internal links spanning over the Brink with Uniqueness and lead to the Impact), then continuing along with the example, an impact would be that economic collapse may cause [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. The Impact is the edge of the sword of your DA and is usually a significantly bad event caused by inertia evident through the internal links inside the link off over the brink and uniquely so.\n\nInternal links are often undesirable things by themselves, and could be considered impacts.  However, the worst of the consequences, or the final one in the chain of events, is usually given the label of \"impact\".  For example, nuclear war is probably worse than economic collapse, so nuclear war is given the \"impact\" label, even though economic collapse (the internal link) could itself be viewed as an impact.\n\nThe nuclear war impact is the terminal (i.e. final) impact in virtually every disadvantage today. While it appears outlandish to outsiders and even to some debaters now, it originated in the 1980s during the height of the [[nuclear freeze]] movement, specifically after the publication of ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'' by [[Jonathan Schell]]. Barring nuclear war, the terminal impact usually ends up as [[extinction]] anyway, either [[human extinction]] or the extinction of all life on Earth; the most common mechanisms for these are cataclysmic climatic change (in the style of ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''), or uncontrolled undiscovered uncurable disease. Most debate coaches use the nuclear war argument as  away of training young policy debaters.\n\nOther terminal impacts might include severe human rights abuses, such as near universal slavery or loss of individuality.  These types of impacts are usually argued under a [[deontological]] framework or as a turn to a human rights advantage\n\n==Types of disadvantages==\n\n===Traditional===\nA traditional DA follows the structure above.  Traditional DA's can include or exclude the internal link.\n\n===Linear===\nA linear disadvantage does not have uniqueness.  The negative concedes that the status quo has a problem but insists the plan increases that problem's severity. A commonly accepted theory holds that a sufficiently philosophical linear disadvantage with an alternative becomes a [[kritik]]. There is also much controversy over kritiks being linear disadvantages, due to the fact that most kritik argue the affirmative plan over a discursive level, while a disadvantage argues the affirmative's actions.\n\nNon-kritikal linear disadvantages frequently face attacks from the Affirmative on debate theory; the theory that linear disadvantages are abusive (i.e. unfair) to the affirmative team has much popularity.\n\n===Brink===\nA brink disadvantage is a special type of linear disadvantage which claims that the affirmative will aggravate the problem in the status quo to the extent that it passes a brink, at which time the impact happens all at once. The negative team claims that in the status quo, we are near the brink, but the affirmative team's plan will push us \"over the edge.\"\n\n===Politics disadvantage===\nA politics disadvantage is unique in the way that it links to affirmative plan . Rather than linking to the specific plan action, it links to the fact that a plan passes at all. Politics disadvantages typically will say that a plan will pass through Congress, thus causing a shift in the \"political capital\" of either the President, or a political party, which will affect\nthe ability of the affected group to pass other bills. An example of a politics disadvantage would be: Uniqueness: Immigration Reform will pass in the status quo. Link: Plan decreases the President's political capital, perhaps with a specific link that increasing civil liberties would be a flip-flop for President Obama. Thus, Obama has no political capital to pass his Immigration Reform. Impact elections cycles. For example, in a presidential election, it might argue that a certain Presidential candidate or his or her opponent is currently weak (or strong), but the affirmative plan will cause him or her to gain (or lose) popularity, and that either his or her election is undesirable or the election of his or her opponent is undesirable.  A midterms version could focus on particular races or the general balance of the Congress; an example of a single-race midterms disadvantage would be that the reelection of Senator [[Daniel Akaka]] is critical to [[free speech]], and plan prevents Akaka from winning; a \"balance of Congress\" disadvantage might hold that the plan is a credit to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], who would increase their grip on Congress and allow extensive drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n====Controversy====\nIn some sections of the country, politics disadvantages are frowned upon because they link to virtually every affirmative plan, destroying the on case debate and focusing solely on the disadvantage. Supporters, however, say the politics disadvantages are \"real world\" and provide education on how bills are passed and politics in general.\n\nOther debate theorists have recently created a model of [[fiat (policy debate)|fiat]] that appears to preclude the politics disadvantage; however, its use in any given debate round is entirely dependent on how well the affirmative argues that the judge should accept the model, a somewhat time-consuming process. Examples of these fiat arguments include Vote No and Intrinsicness. Vote No argues that the debate should be a simulation of the debate before Congress and thus the president has already exerted political capital, meaning there is no disadvantage. Intrinsicness, popularized by [[New Trier High School|New Trier]] Coach Michael Greenstein, says that there is no reason that Congress can't pass both the plan and the bill, meaning they aren't competitive.\n\n===Other types of D/As===\nTradeoff DA - plan takes money from more important things\n\nEconomy/Spending DA - plan leads to economy collapse/recession\n- Biscon: Plan actually or perceptually harms business\n- Spending: Plan costs too much money causing the dollar to lose value. A more nuanced version of this argument focuses on rather investors will buy our t-bills or if a credit agency will downgrade our credit.\n\nFederalism DA - aka the \"fism DA\" - says that plan = undermine federalism (balance of powers between USFG and states), and since most countries model their democracy on the US, if the US destroys their federalism, then wars will break out in other countries as a result\n\nConstitutionality DA - plan = unconstitutional, and creating it would set a bad precedent, causing other unconstitutional policies to be passed\n\nOverpopulation or \"Malthus DA\" DA - By the plan saving lives, it undermines natural death checks, which lead to overpopulation and a \"Malthusian\" catastrophe because of it\n\nRelation Disadvantages: Plan harms our relationship with another nation\n\n==Responding to disadvantages==\nDisadvantage responses can generally be classified into two categories: '''takeouts''', which simply seek to refute a claim made by the negative in the disadvantage, and '''[[Turn (policy debate)|turns]]''', which argue that the situation is somehow the reverse of the negative's claim.\n\n===Takeouts===\n\n====Non-unique====\n\nThe \"non-unique\" argument says that the impact will happen in the status quo with or without the passage of the plan or that it is happening in the status quo. The links and impacts (and thus the entire disadvantage) become largely irrelevant since the status quo is no different from the plan.\n\n====No link====\nA very simple argument. The affirmative simply claims that the plan does not cause the impact.\n\nAn example:\n\n*'''Uniqueness:''' The United States-India nuclear deal is likely to pass now, but just barely. It requires extensive expenditure of limited [[political capital]].\n*'''Link:''' The plan uses political capital that would otherwise be used for passage of the deal.\n*'''Internal Link:''' Failure to pass the deal will reduce American influence on the [[Indian subcontinent]].\n*'''Internal Link:''' Reduction of American influence on the Indian subcontinent will lead to nuclear war between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].\n*'''Impact''': India-Pakistan nuclear war will spiral out of control into a global nuclear conflict.\n\n'''No Link:''' The plan expends no political capital\n\n====No internal link====\nA variant on the No Link, it states that either the link or the previous internal link does not lead to another internal link.\n\nUsing the example above, a no-internal-link could either be that the failure to pass the deal will not reduce American influence on the Indian subcontinent, or that reduction of American influence on the Indian subcontinent will not lead to nuclear war between India and Pakistan.\n\n====Impact uniqueness====\nArguing the impact's uniqueness is an underused but effective argument. To prove that an impact is non-unique the affirmative must show that the link has already happened in the past but the impact didn't happen.\n\nFor example:\n\nUniqueness: American oil consumption high now!\n\nLink: Ethanol trades off with oil!\n\nInternal: OPEC will flood the market with cheap oil\n\nImpact: Destroys Russian and Canadian Economies\u2014global economic collapse\u2014Nuclear war!\n\nImpact Uniqueness\u2014OPEC flooded the market last year with really cheap oil and there was no nuclear war\n\n===Turns===\n\n====Link Turn====\nThe Link Turn is generally accepted to be a better attack on a disadvantage than the defensive take-out arguments, as it is an [[Offense and Defense (policy debate)|offensive argument]]. The link-turn is in two parts: a card that says the disadvantage is non-unique (the impact is going to happen in the status quo)--and reading a link-turn (a piece of evidence that states the plan does the opposite of what the negative link says).\n\nFor Example:\n\n'''Original DA'''\n\n'''Uniqueness:''' US Military Strong\n\n'''Link:''' Plan Decreases military power\n\n'''Impact:''' Weak military leads to nuclear conflict.\n\nA non-unique and a link turn would go something like this:\n\n'''Non-unique:''' Military weak now.\n\n'''Link Turn:''' Plan increases military power.\n\nThis strategy turns what was previously a \"disadvantage\" to the plan into a benefit or advantage of the plan. This helps the affirmative debaters prove that they should win on presumption(that the aff plan is proven to be the better policy option than the status quo).\n\n====Impact turn====\nAnother way to debate against a disadvantage is an impact turn, in which the affirmative team reads evidence stating that the disadvantages impact would actually be good or that the status quo creates a worse impact. If the impact to a disad was global nuclear war, an impact turn would say that death is good or that the status quo creates a bigger nuclear war.  Often impact turns function at the level above this.  The argument is then sometimes called an internal link turn.  For example, if the disadvantage argued that the plan hurt free trade, which was key to avoiding war, the affirmative might argue that in fact free trade caused war, environmental destruction, and other negative consequences.  This type of turn is often much harder to convince the judge of (in part because of the [[Structure of policy debate|structure]] of a debate round, in particular, the negative block), but some believe that it makes a round much more interesting.\n\n====Straight turn====\nOne strategy the affirmative may use in order to attack the Disadvantage is to \"straight turn it.\" To straight turn something means to run only offensive arguments against it. Such an example would be to run 3 impact turns against a Disadvantage. This forces the negative team to not kick the Disadvantage because it automatically becomes an extra advantage for the affirmative. If the affirmative did run defensive arguments such as non-unique and an impact turn, then the negative could concede that it is non-unique so the impact turn would be rendered useless thus the negative could kick out of the disadvantage.\n\nThe affirmative team should never run an impact turn and a link turn together\u2014this is called double turning. When the affirmative team double turns themself they claim that \"right now the status quo is doing something, and the affirmative plan stops it, but what the affirmative stops is a good thing.\" In simple terms, the affirmative runs a disadvantage on themselves.\n\n====Other ways to answer a disadvantage====\nIn answering the Link, an affirmative might argue that the link has '''no threshold''', i.e. that the link does not make clear when the impact will happen or even that the impact will happen solely based on what the affirmative plan causes. Or the aff may claim that '''uniqueness overwhelms the link'''; that conditions in the status quo are so far away from the threshold that the impact will not happen.  This second answer is rarely made however, because it is a strategic gamble.\n\nA disadvantage can also be answered by no longer doing a part of the plan that causes the aff to link into the disadvantage.  This is often referred to as a severance perm, because by making this claim the affirmative does all parts of the plan except the part that links to the disadvantage, thus severing out of part of their own plan.  This argument is also rarely made, due to the theory arguments it brings up on the affirmative changing its plan in the round in order to avoid the disadvantage.\n\nAlso if the negative runs a Counterplan in addition to the Disadvantage (which commonly occurs) the affirmative can make a permutation and say that the combination of the counterplan and plan shields the link to the disadvantage. For example: the plan repeals the Hyde Amendment to allow abortion funding through federal sources by using congress; the negative runs a courts counterplan that repels the hyde amendment and runs a politics disadvantage that says the plan will drain the political capital of the president which causes a certain bill not to be passed; the affirmative would claim that the \"perm shields the link\" because congress would claim that the courts made them repeal the hyde amendment, therefore no political capital would be lost.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Advantage (debate) | Advantage]]\n\n==References==\n*Cheshier, David. (2003). [http://debate.uvm.edu/NFL/rostrumlib/cx%20Cheshier%20for%20Feb%2003.pdf Politics, Politics, Politics]. ''Rostrum''.\n\n{{Off-case arguments}}\n\n[[Category:Policy debate]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Disadvantaged}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2010}}\n{{Policy Debate}} \nIn [[policy debate]], a '''disadvantage''' (abbreviated as '''DA''', and sometimes referred to as:  '''Disad''') is an argument that a team brings up against a policy action that is being considered.\n\n==Structure==\nA Disadvantage usually has four key elements. These four elements are not always necessary depending on the type of disadvantage run, and some are often combined into a single piece of evidence. A Unique Link card, for example, will include both a description of the status quo and the plan's effect on it. A traditional threshold DA, however, has a structure as follows:\n\n===Uniqueness===\n\nUniqueness shows why the Impacts haven't  occurred yet or to a substantial extent and will ''uniquely'' occur with the adoption of either the Affirmative's plan or the Negative's counterplan.\n\n Like an Example: If the negative team argues that the affirmative plan will result in nuclear proliferation, it would also argue that the status quo will avoid nuclear proliferation.  If the Affirmative claims that nuclear proliferation is already occurring, the negative team could argue that adoption of the plan would result in a ''unique'' increase in nuclear proliferation.  If the plan causes no net change in the rate of nuclear proliferation, the disadvantage is not unique to the plan, and therefore not relevant.\n\n===External links===\nFor the disadvantage to have relevance in the round, the negative team must show that the affirmative plan causes the disadvantage that is claimed.  If the DA stated that the plan takes money from the government, and the affirmative team shows that the plan does not increase governmental spending, then the DA would be considered to have \"no link\".\n\n===Internal link===\n\nThe internal link connects the link to the impact, or, it shows the steps the link causes to get to the impact. Not all DA's use an internal link but some have multiple internals. The internal link in our example would be that government spending leads to economic collapse.\n\n===Impact===\nThe impact is the result of the policy action that make it undesirable. These results are at the end of the chain of reasoning of your DA (starts with your link with internal links spanning over the Brink with Uniqueness and lead to the Impact), then continuing along with the example, an impact would be that economic collapse may cause [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. The Impact is the edge of the sword of your DA and is usually a significantly bad event caused by inertia evident through the internal links inside the link off over the brink and uniquely so.\n\nInternal links are often undesirable things by themselves, and could be considered impacts.  However, the worst of the consequences, or the final one in the chain of events, is usually given the label of \"impact\".  For example, nuclear war is probably worse than economic collapse, so nuclear war is given the \"impact\" label, even though economic collapse (the internal link) could itself be viewed as an impact.\n\nThe nuclear war impact is the terminal (i.e. final) impact in virtually every disadvantage today. While it appears outlandish to outsiders and even to some debaters now, it originated in the 1980s during the height of the [[nuclear freeze]] movement, specifically after the publication of ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'' by [[Jonathan Schell]]. Barring nuclear war, the terminal impact usually ends up as [[extinction]] anyway, either [[human extinction]] or the extinction of all life on Earth; the most common mechanisms for these are cataclysmic climatic change (in the style of ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''), or uncontrolled undiscovered uncurable disease. Most debate coaches use the nuclear war argument as  away of training young policy debaters.\n\nOther terminal impacts might include severe human rights abuses, such as near universal slavery or loss of individuality.  These types of impacts are usually argued under a [[deontological]] framework or as a turn to a human rights advantage\n\n==Types of disadvantages==\n\n===Traditional===\nA traditional DA follows the structure above.  Traditional DA's can include or exclude the internal link.\n\n===Linear===\nA linear disadvantage does not have uniqueness.  The negative concedes that the status quo has a problem but insists the plan increases that problem's severity. A commonly accepted theory holds that a sufficiently philosophical linear disadvantage with an alternative becomes a [[kritik]]. There is also much controversy over kritiks being linear disadvantages, due to the fact that most kritik argue the affirmative plan over a discursive level, while a disadvantage argues the affirmative's actions.\n\nNon-kritikal linear disadvantages frequently face attacks from the Affirmative on debate theory; the theory that linear disadvantages are abusive (i.e. unfair) to the affirmative team has much popularity.\n\n===Brink===\nA brink disadvantage is a special type of linear disadvantage which claims that the affirmative will aggravate the problem in the status quo to the extent that it passes a brink, at which time the impact happens all at once. The negative team claims that in the status quo, we are near the brink, but the affirmative team's plan will push us \"over the edge.\"\n\n===Politics disadvantage===\nA politics disadvantage is unique in the way that it links to affirmative plan . Rather than linking to the specific plan action, it links to the fact that a plan passes at all. Politics disadvantages typically will say that a plan will pass through Congress, thus causing a shift in the \"political capital\" of either the President, or a political party, which will affect\nthe ability of the affected group to pass other bills. An example of a politics disadvantage would be: Uniqueness: Immigration Reform will pass in the status quo. Link: Plan decreases the President's political capital, perhaps with a specific link that increasing civil liberties would be a flip-flop for President Obama. Thus, Obama has no political capital to pass his Immigration Reform. Impact elections cycles. For example, in a presidential election, it might argue that a certain Presidential candidate or his or her opponent is currently weak (or strong), but the affirmative plan will cause him or her to gain (or lose) popularity, and that either his or her election is undesirable or the election of his or her opponent is undesirable.  A midterms version could focus on particular races or the general balance of the Congress; an example of a single-race midterms disadvantage would be that the reelection of Senator [[Daniel Akaka]] is critical to [[free speech]], and plan prevents Akaka from winning; a \"balance of Congress\" disadvantage might hold that the plan is a credit to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], who would increase their grip on Congress and allow extensive drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n====Controversy====\nIn some sections of the country, politics disadvantages are frowned upon because they link to virtually every affirmative plan, destroying the on case debate and focusing solely on the disadvantage. Supporters, however, say the politics disadvantages are \"real world\" and provide education on how bills are passed and politics in general.\n\nOther debate theorists have recently created a model of [[fiat (policy debate)|fiat]] that appears to preclude the politics disadvantage; however, its use in any given debate round is entirely dependent on how well the affirmative argues that the judge should accept the model, a somewhat time-consuming process. Examples of these fiat arguments include Vote No and Intrinsicness. Vote No argues that the debate should be a simulation of the debate before Congress and thus the president has already exerted political capital, meaning there is no disadvantage. Intrinsicness, popularized by [[New Trier High School|New Trier]] Coach Michael Greenstein, says that there is no reason that Congress can't pass both the plan and the bill, meaning they aren't competitive.\n\n===Other types of D/As===\nTradeoff DA - plan takes money from more important things\n\nEconomy/Spending DA - plan leads to economy collapse/recession\n- Biscon: Plan actually or perceptually harms business\n- Spending: Plan costs too much money causing the dollar to lose value. A more nuanced version of this argument focuses on rather investors will buy our t-bills or if a credit agency will downgrade our credit.\n\nFederalism DA - aka the \"fism DA\" - says that plan = undermine federalism (balance of powers between USFG and states), and since most countries model their democracy on the US, if the US destroys their federalism, then wars will break out in other countries as a result\n\nConstitutionality DA - plan = unconstitutional, and creating it would set a bad precedent, causing other unconstitutional policies to be passed\n\nOverpopulation or \"Malthus DA\" DA - By the plan saving lives, it undermines natural death checks, which lead to overpopulation and a \"Malthusian\" catastrophe because of it\n\nRelation Disadvantages: Plan harms our relationship with another nation\n\n==Responding to disadvantages==\nDisadvantage responses can generally be classified into two categories: '''takeouts''', which simply seek to refute a claim made by the negative in the disadvantage, and '''[[Turn (policy debate)|turns]]''', which argue that the situation is somehow the reverse of the negative's claim.\n\n===Takeouts===\n\n====Non-unique====\n\nThe \"non-unique\" argument says that the impact will happen in the status quo with or without the passage of the plan or that it is happening in the status quo. The links and impacts (and thus the entire disadvantage) become largely irrelevant since the status quo is no different from the plan.\n\n====No link====\nA very simple argument. The affirmative simply claims that the plan does not cause the impact.\n\nAn example:\n\n*'''Uniqueness:''' The United States-India nuclear deal is likely to pass now, but just barely. It requires extensive expenditure of limited [[political capital]].\n*'''Link:''' The plan uses political capital that would otherwise be used for passage of the deal.\n*'''Internal Link:''' Failure to pass the deal will reduce American influence on the [[Indian subcontinent]].\n*'''Internal Link:''' Reduction of American influence on the Indian subcontinent will lead to nuclear war between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].\n*'''Impact''': India-Pakistan nuclear war will spiral out of control into a global nuclear conflict.\n\n'''No Link:''' The plan expends no political capital\n\n====No internal link====\nA variant on the No Link, it states that either the link or the previous internal link does not lead to another internal link.\n\nUsing the example above, a no-internal-link could either be that the failure to pass the deal will not reduce American influence on the Indian subcontinent, or that reduction of American influence on the Indian subcontinent will not lead to nuclear war between India and Pakistan.\n\n====Impact uniqueness====\nArguing the impact's uniqueness is an underused but effective argument. To prove that an impact is non-unique the affirmative must show that the link has already happened in the past but the impact didn't happen.\n\nFor example:\n\nUniqueness: American oil consumption high now!\n\nLink: Ethanol trades off with oil!\n\nInternal: OPEC will flood the market with cheap oil\n\nImpact: Destroys Russian and Canadian Economies\u2014global economic collapse\u2014Nuclear war!\n\nImpact Uniqueness\u2014OPEC flooded the market last year with really cheap oil and there was no nuclear war\n\n===Turns===\n\n====Link Turn====\nThe Link Turn is generally accepted to be a better attack on a disadvantage than the defensive take-out arguments, as it is an [[Offense and Defense (policy debate)|offensive argument]].

Among the founders of [[Cadillac]], Leland had sold the company to [[General Motors]] in 1909, remaining on as an executive until 1917, when he left over a dispute with GM President [[William C. Durant|William Durant]].  Naming Lincoln Motor Company after Abraham Lincoln, the first President for whom he ever voted (1864), Leland financed the company by securing a $10 million contract to build [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V12 aircraft engines]], breaking ground on the [[Lincoln Motor Company Plant]].  To build the Liberty engines, Lincoln sourced parts from other manufacturers; along with cylinders produced by Ford, other parts were sourced from [[Buick]], [[Cadillac]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], and [[Packard]].<ref name=\"lincolnbrief2\">{{cite book|url=http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|title=Lincoln Motor Company Briefing Book|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|quote=1917 August: After departing a management position at the Cadillac Division of General Motors, Henry Leland and his son Wilfred Leland form the Lincoln Motor Company, which produces aircraft engines to fill World War I government contracts.|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403124132/http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|archive-date=April 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|4}}<ref name=\"ocallaghan2\">{{cite book|title=The Aviation Legacy of Henry & Edsel Ford|last=O'Callaghan|first=Timothy J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-928623-01-4|location=Detroit}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013164}}  In total, 6,500 Liberty V12 engines were produced by Lincoln before the end of World War I ceased wartime production.\n\nFollowing a complete retooling for automobile production, Lincoln Motor Company developed its first automobile, the [[Lincoln L-Series|Lincoln Model L]] on September 16, 1920.  Intended as a rival for Cadillac and similar luxury car manufacturers, the Model L was powered by a [[L-head]] V8 engine, derived from the technology of the Liberty V12.\n\n==== Purchase by Ford Motor Company ====\nDuring the early 1920s, Lincoln Motor Company struggled with the shift from military to automobile production, with some customers having to wait nearly a year for their vehicles to be completed from the time of purchase.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z8865/lincoln-model-l.aspx|title=1917 Lincoln Model L Pictures, History, Value, Research, News - conceptcarz.com|work=conceptcarz.com|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}</ref>  By 1922, Lincoln fell on the verge of bankruptcy and was placed in receivership.

With the acquisition of Lincoln, Ford Motor Company produced a rival for Cadillac, [[Pierce-Arrow]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], [[Peerless]], [[Duesenberg]], and [[Packard]] alongside the [[Ford Model T]].\n\nIn addition to more closely competing against General Motors in different price segments, the purchase of Lincoln also held personal value within Ford management.  In 1902, Henry Ford had been forced out of his second company ([[Henry Ford Company]]) by a group of investors led by Leland.<ref name=\"bentley2\">{{cite book|title=The Old Car Book|last=Bentley|first=John|year=1952|volume=208}}</ref>{{rp|52\u201357}}  Henry Ford Company was renamed [[Cadillac|Cadillac Automobile Company]]; sold to General Motors in 1909, Cadillac has remained a chief competitor of Lincoln from 1920 to the present day.  While Henry and Wilfred Leland were initially retained to manage Lincoln, on June 10, 1922, both Lelands were removed, with [[Edsel Ford]] brought in to manage the company.\n\nFollowing the introduction of Edsel Ford to Lincoln management, the fortunes of Lincoln began to quickly improve.  For 1923, the Lincoln Model L underwent extensive changes.  While the chassis and drivetrain (including an L-head 60-degree V8) were largely left alone, several new bodystyles were introduced.  In line with a Duesenberg or a Rolls-Royce, customers could also purchase a Model L with coachbuilt bodywork.  For 1923, Lincoln produced 7,875 cars (nearly 45% higher than 1922), operating at a profit by the end of the year.\n<gallery>\nFile:1922 Lincoln touring automobile.jpg|1922 Lincoln Model L touring sedan\nFile:1925 Lincoln - Greta Garbo Car - fvl.jpg|1925 Lincoln Model L sedan (of [[Greta Garbo]])\nFile:1926 Lincoln - fvl.jpg|1926 Lincoln Model L town car\nFile:1930 Lincoln (5960260288).jpg|1930 Lincoln Model L sedan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1930s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln K-series|Lincoln-Zephyr}}During the early 1920s, Lincoln steered away from the common American automotive industry practice of yearly model changes.  While used to market fresh designs to customers, Lincoln found that its customers had begun to purchase multiple Lincolns (or other luxury vehicles) in different bodystyles; yearly styling changes would not properly accommodate its customer base.  Following the 1930 model year, however, Lincoln chose to withdraw the Model L in favor of a more modern vehicle.  For 1931, the Lincoln Model K was introduced as a competitor to the [[Cadillac Series 355|Cadillac 355]], [[Chrysler Imperial]], [[Duesenberg Model J]], and [[Packard Eight]].\n\nFor 1932, Lincoln became an American manufacturer to produce a \"multi-cylinder\" engine as it introduced its first V12 engine.  While not the first to produce a V12 engine in an American-produced car, in 1933, Lincoln became the first manufacturer to produce vehicles exclusively with V12 engines, as it retired the L-head V8 engine.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Lincoln expanded to two model lines for the first time.  As Lincoln shifted the Model K upwards in price, Edsel Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Zephyr]] as a sub-marque within Lincoln for 1936.<ref name=\"dammann4\">{{cite book|title=The Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|last1=Dammann|first1=George H.|last2=Wagner|first2=James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263}}</ref>{{rp|155}}  Designed to compete against the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]] and [[Chrysler Airstream]], the Lincoln Zephyr introduced an all-new body and chassis, along with its [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|own V12 engine]].

In late 1938, to develop a European-style car for his next Florida vacation, he commissioned Ford Chief Stylist [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|E. T. Gregorie]] to design a [[Bespoke|one-off]]  body design, using a 1939 Lincoln Zephyr Convertible Coupe chassis.  After [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]] the body {{convert|4|in|0}}, the running boards were deleted and a spare tire was mounted behind the trunklid.\n\nAfter Edsel Ford received the car and vacationed in Florida with the one-off vehicle, it attracted a high amount of interest from potential buyers, often referring to its \"European\" or \"Continental\" exterior design.  From the latter term, the one-off vehicle became known as the [[Lincoln Continental]].\n\n=== 1940s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln H-series|Lincoln Custom|Lincoln EL-series}}Following the Great Depression, a number of American luxury car manufacturers were either forced into closure or reorganization; by 1940, alongside Lincoln, the American luxury-car segment largely consisted of Cadillac (who ended production of the LaSalle and V16 in 1940), the Chrysler Imperial (reduced to 8-passenger sedans and limousines), and Packard.  To further secure the future for Lincoln, on April 30, 1940, Ford Motor Company reorganized Lincoln Motor Company as the Lincoln Division of Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|199}}  While previously operating as an autonomous entity, as a division, Lincoln structurally became similar to its major competitor Cadillac (within General Motors).\n\nAs part of the change, several changes were made to the Lincoln model line.  Following the positive feedback of the 1939 Lincoln Continental one-off convertible built for Edsel Ford, the Lincoln Continental was introduced as a Lincoln-Zephyr production model for 1940.  For 1941, Lincoln revised its branding; the hyphen was removed from Lincoln-Zephyr, making it a Lincoln.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|206}}  As a replacement for the expensive Model K, an extended-wheelbase [[Lincoln Custom]] variant of the Lincoln Zephyr was developed.  Following the development of proper tooling, the Lincoln Continental began production on the assembly line, replacing hand-built construction.\n\nAfter the entry of the United States into World War II, as with all U.S. auto manufacturers, Lincoln ended automobile production as Ford Motor Company concentrated on wartime manufacturing.  Following the conclusion of the war in 1945, the structure of Lincoln within Ford changed again, as the Lincoln-Mercury Division was created, pairing Mercury and Lincoln together; from 1945 to the 2010 closure of Mercury, the two divisions were paired together within Ford.\n\nFor 1946, Lincoln returned to production, ending the use of the Zephyr name.  Code-named the [[Lincoln H-series|H-series]], non-Continental Lincolns were identified by their body style.  Using slightly updated exteriors from 1942, the 1946 Lincolns continued the use of the Zephyr chassis.  1948 marked the final year of the Zephyr chassis (dating to 1936)  and (as of 2018) the use of a V12 engine in an American mass-produced automobile.  After 5,322 were produced (as both a Lincoln-Zephyr and Lincoln), Lincoln ended production of the Continental.\n\nFor 1949, all three Ford Motor Company divisions debuted their first postwar designs.  Sharing its body structure with the [[Mercury Eight]], the redesigned Lincoln model line (code-named the [[Lincoln EL-series|EL-series]]) marked the first use of a V8 in a Lincoln since 1932. An all-new V12 intended for Lincoln was stillborn in development, leading the division to adapt a [[Ford flathead V8]] (from the Ford F-8 conventional truck).  As with the previous Lincoln Continental, the 1949 Lincoln dispensed with running boards completely, moving on to abandon [[Ponton (car)|pontoon styling]] entirely, with a straight fender line (and low hoodline) from headlamp to taillamp.  In a carryover from Zephyr-based Lincolns, the 1949 Lincolns retained rear-hinged passenger doors.  As a flagship model of Lincoln, the [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] was styled with its own rear roofline.\n<gallery>\nFile:1940 Lincoln Zephyr (7810992862).jpg|1940 Lincoln Zephyr\nFile:1942 Lincoln Continental Coupe (32768154751).jpg|1942 Lincoln Continental coupe\nFile:1946 Lincoln (4214298318).jpg|1946 Lincoln (coupe)\nFile:'48 Lincoln V12 (A&W St. Leonard).JPG|1948 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Continental Coupe 1948.jpg|1948 Lincoln Continental\nFile:Lincoln Convertible Coupe.jpg|1949 Lincoln (convertible)\nFile:Lincoln Cosmopolitan 1949.jpg|1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1950s, Ford Motor Company sought to increase the differentiation between the Mercury and Lincoln model lines.  For 1952, to add interest to the brand, Lincoln returned to model names for the first time since 1942, with the Lincoln Cosmopolitan becoming the standard Lincoln model, with the [[Lincoln Capri]] becoming the flagship model line.  In a return to (small) pontoon rear fenders, Lincolns shared a body with the Mercury Monterey.  Mechanically, Lincoln differed from Mercury, as the Ford truck V8 was replaced by the [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|Lincoln Y-block V8]] with a [[Hydramatic]] transmission.  For the first time since the discontinuation of the Model K, Lincolns were produced with front-hinged rear doors.\n\nFor 1956, the shared Lincoln-Mercury body underwent a redesign for the final time, with Lincoln adopting elements from the [[Mercury XM-800]] and [[Lincoln Futura]] concept cars. Slotted above the Lincoln Capri, the [[Lincoln Premiere]] adapted features of the Continental Mark II, including its ducted air conditioning.\n\nDuring 1956, Lincoln-Mercury was reorganized slightly, following the creation of the free-standing Edsel and Continental divisions, Lincoln-Mercury was changed to Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (MEL), with Edsel slotted alongside/below Mercury and Continental above Lincoln, as the flagship of all of Ford Motor Company. By the end of 1959, Continental was integrated into Lincoln and Edsel was withdrawn.\n\nThe Lincoln Motor Company Plant, built in Detroit, Michigan, by Henry Leland in 1917, was closed after 1952; subsequent Lincolns were produced alongside Mercury Montereys and Mercury Montclairs. For the 1957 model year, Ford opened [[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]] in [[Wixom, Michigan]], as a facility to specialize in Lincoln production. From 1957 to 2007, the facility produced Lincoln vehicles nearly exclusively, along with the [[Ford GT]] and several generations of the [[Ford Thunderbird]].\n<gallery>\nFile:1950 Lincoln standard four-door sedan, Lime Rock.jpg|1950 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Capri Sedan 1953.jpg|1953 Lincoln Capri\nFile:1955 Lincoln Capri (7867895468).jpg|1955 Lincoln Capri\nFile:Lincoln Premiere 1956.jpg|1956 Lincoln Premiere\nFile:1957 Lincoln Premiere 4 door Hardtop Landau (33112700972).jpg|1957 Lincoln Premiere Landau (4-door hardtop)\nFile:1959 Lincoln Premier 2-door hardtop.JPG|1959 Lincoln Premiere \n</gallery>\n\n====Continental Division (1956\u20131959)====\n{{main|Continental Mark II}}\n[[File:1956_Continental_Mark_II_-_midnight_blue_-_fvr.jpg|thumb|1956 Continental Mark II]]\nFor the 1956 model year, Ford Motor Company created the Continental Division, slotted above Lincoln as the flagship marque of Ford Motor Company. At its launch, Continental introduced the [[Continental Mark II]] as its model line, intended as a successor to the 1940\u20131948 Lincoln Continental personal luxury car. Offered as a two-door hardtop coupe, the Mark II broke from a number of American styling precedents of the time. While fitted with whitewall tires, the exterior was fitted with minimal chrome trim on the body sides; tailfins were left off of the body completely. In place of the bumper-mounted spare tire of the original Lincoln Continental, the trunklid of the Mark II showcased the design element, with a large imitation spare tire bulge (which fit over the actual spare tire inside the trunk). The Mark II was largely hand-built, with extensive quality testing done to each engine and transmission before leaving the factory.\n\nIn place of establishing a separate sales and service network for Continental, the Mark II was marketed through Lincoln (the Mark II used a Lincoln engine and transmission). At  $10,000 in 1956 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|10,000|1956}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}), the Mark II was the most expensive car produced by an American automaker at the time, rivaling the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud]] in price.\n\nOn July 18, 1956, the Continental Division was integrated into Lincoln which continued to manage the Continental brand as a separate marque.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|281}}  During the 1957 model year, the Mark II was withdrawn, largely as a consequence of its hand-built construction; each unit was sold at a loss of over $1,000. Subsequently, the 1957 [[Cadillac Eldorado#Third generation (1957\u20131960)|Cadillac Eldorado Brougham]] overtook the Mark II as the most expensive American-produced vehicle.\n\nFor 1958, as part of a mandated $4000 reduction in price, Continental adopted the body of Lincoln, expanding into multiple body styles for the Mark III (the nomenclature indicating the transition). Adding a feature of the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], Continental adopted a retractable rear window across every bodystyle (including convertibles) with a reverse-slant rear roofline. For 1959, the Mark III was renamed the Mark IV, becoming the Mark V for 1960.<ref name=\"dammann4\" />{{rp|331,337,414, 582\u2013583}}\n\nIn 1959, the Continental marque was formally brought to an end within Lincoln; for 1960, the Mark V was brought to production as the ''Lincoln Continental Mark V'', ending the model cycle alongside the standard Lincoln model line.\n\n====Unibody vehicles====\n[[File:1959 Lincoln Continental.JPG|thumb|1959 Continental Mark IV Town Car formal-roof sedan]]\nFor the 1958 model year, the Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) division adapted new bodies across its vehicle lines. In addition to Mercury sharing its bodies with the premium Edsels (prior to the latter's demise), Lincoln and Continental adopted a common body structure, shifting to unibody construction. With a 131-inch wheelbase, the new platform would be among the largest vehicles ever built by Ford Motor Company; they are the longest Lincolns ever built without [[5 mph bumper]]s, a [[Bumper (car)#First standards 1971|regulatory mandate]] which went into effect in September 1972.\n\nAs a replacement for the Y-block V8, Ford developed a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|\"MEL\"]] V8 as standard equipment for Lincolns (which was also available in Ford Thunderbirds and some Mercury vehicles).\n\nFor 1959, Continental developed Town Car and Limousine variants of the standard four-door sedan. In place of extending the wheelbase, the reverse-slant roofline was replaced by a formal notchback configuration, allowing the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches. Among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever produced, the Town Car and Limousines were only offered painted in black.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nFrom 1958 to 1960, Lincoln would lose over $60 million.  Following the recession economy of the late 1950s (a factor that would play into the demise of Edsel), Ford Motor Company was forced to recoup the development costs of a vehicle platform that Lincoln shared with neither Ford nor Mercury (with the lone exception of the engine and transmission).  By 1958, the future of Lincoln-Mercury was at risk, with Ford President [[Robert McNamara]] considering the reduction of Ford to its namesake brand.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental7.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}</ref>  As a condition of allowing Lincoln to continue production, McNamara required the Lincoln model line to undergo a reduction in size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor 1961, Lincoln consolidated its model lineup to a single model line, with the Lincoln Continental replacing the Lincoln Capri and Lincoln Premiere; as the Continental marque was withdrawn, the Mark V saw no successor.  While only nominally lighter than the 1960 Lincoln, the 1961 Lincoln Continental adapted a far smaller exterior footprint, shedding 15 inches in length and 8 inches of wheelbase.  In an effort to streamline production, only four-door body styles were produced, with the Continental becoming the sole mass-produced four-door convertible sold in North America; to maximize rear-seat egress, Lincoln returned to the use of rear [[suicide doors]].\n\nIn another requirement to ensure its survival, the model cycle of Lincoln was extended from three years to nine years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental1.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  While largely dispensing with major yearly model changes, the decision established design consistency and shifting resources towards quality control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1966-1969-lincoln-continental.htm|title=1966-1969 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-09-04|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  For 1966, to better compete with the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Imperial Crown/LeBaron Coupe, Lincoln added a two-door hardtop to the Continental model line.

While the Lincoln Continental served as a close competitor to the Cadillac de Ville series and Chrysler Imperial, as Cadillac shifted the [[Cadillac Eldorado]] to the personal luxury segment in 1967, a segment that Ford exited in 1957 after the withdrawal of the Continental Mark II.  As a response, in April 1968, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]] was released as a 1969 model.  While not officially a Lincoln, the Continental Mark III was marketed through the Lincoln-Mercury dealer network, who would service the vehicle. Over a number of various names considered for the vehicle, Continental Mark III was chosen, as Henry Ford II felt the Continental Mark II did not have a proper successor (thus restarting the nomenclature).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars9.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the 1968 Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark III marked the debut of the (then-new) 460 cubic-inch V8 and became the first Ford vehicle to be fitted with anti-lock brakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldorado-seville.com/MarkIII/MarkIII/history.html|title=The History of my Mark III|last=Loidl|first=Gerald|website=www.eldorado-seville.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref>  As standard equipment, the Mark III was fitted with power door locks, power seats, and power windows.  In an effort to control its development and production costs, the Mark III was offered only as a two-door hardtop derived from the chassis underpinnings of the four door [[Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].  While sharing many styling elements from Lincoln, the Continental Mark III debuted many elements of its own, including hidden headlights and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid (the spare tire laid flat in the front of the trunk).\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (26724699464).jpg|1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (27298635266).jpg|Rear view showing trunklid, 1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1970 Lincoln Continental Mark III (37118465116).jpg|Interior view, 1970 Continental Mark III\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nWhile the Continental Mark III would bring Lincoln into the decade on a high note, for the American luxury car segment, the 1970s would prove tumultuous. Along with the introduction of federal safety regulations for American-market automobiles (which brought features such as 5-mph bumpers and the end of hardtop body styles), the 1973 fuel crisis would play a significant role in the engineering of American automobiles, forcing Lincoln to develop a compact-size sedan and redesign smaller full-size sedans for the 1980s. As Chrysler withdrew its Imperial brand after 1975, Cadillac became the sole domestic competitor of Lincoln.\n\nFor the 1970 model year, Lincoln made good on its 1958 plan to commit to a nine-year design cycle, giving the Continental its first complete redesign for the first time since 1961. During the 1960s, while sales of the Continental had remained relatively steady throughout its production, the engineering of luxury cars had begun to change among its competitors; to increase design commonality (and lower production costs), Cadillac and Imperial shifted away from brand-specific platforms (with the latter adapting to shared bodyshells with Chrysler). For the redesign of the Lincoln model line, the Continental grew in size. While sharing no visible body panels, Lincoln adapted the chassis of the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis (shifting to body-on-frame construction for the first time since 1957). In another effort to maintain design consistency, the 1970 Continental was produced through 1979 with only gradual updates. Along with the mandated addition of 5-mph bumpers, in 1975, the roofline was redesigned (to visually differentiate the Continental from the Mercury Marquis).\n\nThe 1970s saw the introduction of several naming traditions within Lincoln. For 1970, the Town Car nameplate was revived on a permanent basis as a submodel of the Lincoln Continental. Following the use of a Cartier-brand clock on the Continental Mark III, in 1976, the Continental Mark IV began the use of Designer Editions, which saw use on subsequent Continental Mark series models and Lincolns.<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:Lincoln (9831715645).jpg|1971 Lincoln Continental 2-door\nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car (35466763535).jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe (27331656355).jpg|1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe\nFile:Lincoln Continental 1978 6600cc sic dvla.JPG|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Car\n</gallery>\n\n====Lincoln Versailles====\n[[File:'78 Lincoln Versailles (Les chauds vendredis '10) & '09-'10 Nissan Murano.jpg|thumb|1978 Lincoln Versailles]]\nDeveloped as a response to the popularity of the 1976 [[Cadillac Seville]], Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Versailles]] for the 1977 model year. Thirty inches shorter and 1500 pounds&nbsp;lighter than a Lincoln Continental, the Versailles was based on the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]]/[[Mercury Monarch]] (as the Seville was based on the Chevrolet Nova). Outsold by the Seville by a significant margin, the Versailles was discontinued in early 1980.\n\nWith a smaller design and engineering budget than General Motors, Lincoln stylists were unable to give the Versailles the distinct body that was given to the Cadillac Seville. Adopting many features from the 1975\u20131976 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the Lincoln Versailles was given a [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]]-style \"radiator\" grille, quad rectangular headlights (the first Lincoln since 1969 with exposed headlights), and a [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental Mark]]-style trunklid with simulated spare tire bulge. The Versailles introduced two notable features to American-market cars: halogen headlights and clearcoat paint. The Versailles was later criticized for being one of the worst examples of badge engineering.\n\n==== Continental Mark IV and Mark V ====\nFollowing the success of the Continental Mark III, Ford chose to develop a successor personal luxury coupe.  For 1972, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Continental Mark IV]] made its debut, redesigned alongside the [[Ford Thunderbird (sixth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. While sharing a common roofline with the Thunderbird, from the window line down, the Mark IV wore distinct exterior sheetmetal, with the return of a radiator-style grille, hidden headlights, and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid. To distinguish itself from the Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark IV wore full-height rear-wheel openings, precluding the use of fender skirts.\n\nFor 1976, the Continental Mark IV debuted a new tradition, called the Designer Editions, which later spread to other models in the Lincoln model range. Introduced as four special-edition models, each edition was an option package with color, trim, and interior choices specified by notable fashion designers ([[Bill Blass]], [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]]). Each edition carried the designer's signature on the opera windows and were fitted with a 22 karat (92%) gold-plated plaque on the instrument panel which could be engraved with the original owner's name. The concept was successful and would continue on other Lincolns until the end of the 2003 model year.\n\nFor 1977, Lincoln-Mercury replaced the Continental Mark IV with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]], a substantial exterior and interior revision of the Mark IV. At over 19 feet long, Mark V is one of the largest \"coupes\" ever sold in North America. In what would become a design theme for Lincolns into the 1990s, the Mark V used sharp-edged exterior styling with a center radiator grille. Following their 1976 success, the Mark IV adopted the Designer Editions option packages.\n\nWhile introduced following the beginning of downsizing among American vehicles, the Continental Mark V would go on to become the most successful of all the Mark series vehicles, with over 228,000 sold across three model years.\n<gallery>\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV front left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV rear left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV, rear view\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (36414930055).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (35579789634).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V, rear view\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1980s, the American auto industry remained in the \"[[Malaise era]]\", struggling to balance fuel efficiency, emissions controls, and [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]]; the industry also found itself competing against European and Japanese manufacturers entering segments once dominated by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.\n\nThe entry of the Lincoln into the 1980s was marked with struggle.  As a high point, after a ten-year model cycle, the Lincoln Continental underwent a complete redesign (downsizing for the first time), becoming the lightest Lincoln since World War II.  Again sharing chassis underpinnings with Mercury and Ford, the Continental used the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis.  Coupled with a shift to a 302 cubic-inch V8, the fuel economy of the Lincoln model line rose nearly 40% in a single year.  In contrast, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn early in the 1980 model year.  As a result, by the end of 1980, Lincoln was marketing three versions of one vehicle.  As a response, Lincoln split its two product lines, with the Continental becoming the [[Lincoln Town Car]].  After a short hiatus, for 1982, the Lincoln Continental shifted size into the mid-size segment (using the [[Ford Fox platform]]).  While Lincoln would again compete against the Cadillac Seville (and to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz), the division completely erased any visual evidence of badge engineering.\n\nInitially planned for withdrawal in the mid-1980s until stabilization of fuel prices mitigated fuel-economy concerns, the Lincoln Town Car progressed through the decade largely unchanged.  As its design began to age, the model line began to increase in sales, as transitions of Cadillac to front-wheel drive and further downsizing of its full-size model lines were poorly received by both buyers and automotive industry critics. While the Town Car retained its traditional layout and large size, fuel prices dropped to a contemporary new low at the time, and operating economy became less of a concern to buyers than a decade prior.  Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements in late 1985 titled ''\"The Valet\"'' which depicted parking attendants having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser [[Buick]]s (Electras) and [[Oldsmobile]]s (Ninety-Eights), with the question \"Is that a Cadillac?\" answered by the response \"No, it's an Oldsmobile...or Buick.\" At the end, the owner of a Lincoln would appear with the line \"The Lincoln Town Car please.\" The commercial campaign saw the emergence of the new advertising line for the brand, \"''Lincoln. What a Luxury Car Should Be.''\" which was used into the 1990s.<ref name=\"Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJSXyTnOhI|title=Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFor 1988, the Lincoln Continental underwent a second redesign.  Splitting from the Mark VII, the Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln, as it became an extended-wheelbase version of the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]; the 3.8L V6 engine also marked the first time in a Lincoln that no 8-cylinder (or V12) engine was offered.  In an effort to further reduce model overlap, the front-wheel drive Continental was developed for vehicles that neither Cadillac nor the Lincoln Town Car were marketed against: European and Japanese-produced luxury sedans.  Following the debut of a driver-side airbag in the [[Ford Tempo]], the 1989 Lincoln Continental became the first sedan sold in the United States equipped with standard [[Airbag|dual airbags]].\n<gallery>\nFile:Lincoln Versailles, 1980.png|1980 Lincoln Versailles\nFile:82LincolnContinental.jpg|1982 Lincoln Continental Givenchy Edition\nFile:1984 Lincoln Towncar.jpg|1984 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:Lincoln Continental (4282945959).jpg|1986\u20131987 Lincoln Continental\nFile:88-91 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1988\u20131991 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1989 Lincoln Town Car -- 06-16-2011.jpg|1989 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\n</gallery>\n\n==== Continental Mark VI and Mark VII ====\nFor 1980, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VI|Continental Mark VI]] made its debut, replacing the Mark V.  Originally slated to adopt the Ford Thunderbird chassis as part of downsizing, the Mark VI remained a full-size car, adopting the Ford Panther platform.  Following the departure of Lee Iaccoca from Ford, the development of the Mark VI shifted from stand-alone model range to a four-door sedan and two-door coupe.  Following its marketplace success, many design elements of the Mark V were carried onto the Mark VI, including its sharp-edged sheetmetal, hidden headlamps, opera windows, and fender louvers (now non-functional).  The Mark VI coupe shared the same exact 114\u201d Ford/Mercury wheelbase of the Panther chassis, with its own distinct roofline, while the four-door Mark VI shared its body with the Lincoln Continental/Town Car-Town Coup\u00e9, on a 3\u201d longer wheelbase (at 117\u201d).\n\nThe Mark VI continued the use of the Designer Series (for coupes); in 1982, the option packages began a revision, as the Cartier Edition was moved to the Town Car and the Givenchy Edition was moved to the Continental. In early-1982, the Givenchy Edition was re-introduced to the Mark VI lineup, (via a single-page insert to the showroom brochure) but would last only that year. In another tradition, in 1980, the Mark VI launched the Signature Series trim level.  Initially intended as a direct replacement for the 1979 Collector's Series, the Signature Series designation would also be utilized by the Town Car beginning in 1981; in various forms, it would be used to its 2011 discontinuation...as well as the mid-size bustle-back Continental (for 1982 only). The heavily feature-equipped 1980\u20131981 Mark VI Signature Series (padded vinyl trunk lid tire bulge, color-keyed bumper guards and rub strips, color-keyed trunk carpeting, color-keyed turbine wheels, tool kit, etc.), received a de-contenting of many of these exclusive features for 1982-on, but now offered more colors and options. This ultimately became more of a parallel replacement of the former (1976\u20131981) \u201cLuxury Group\u201d offerings, which was absent from the option list for 1982-on.\n\nFor 1984, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] replaced the Mark VI, again becoming a counterpart of the [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].   The most technically advanced vehicle sold by Lincoln-Mercury at the time, the Mark VII represented a major market shift, becoming the smallest version of the Mark series.  From the 1979 Mark V to the 1984 Mark VII, Ford engineers shed 27 inches of length and over 1,200 pounds of curb weight.  While slightly less performance-oriented than a [[Grand tourer|grand-touring car]], in its development, the Mark VII placed a far greater emphasis on handling capability than any previous Mark-series vehicle, with four-wheel disc brakes, anti-lock brakes, four-wheel air suspension; its 5.0L V8 was shared with the [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]].\n\nFor 1986, to eliminate the long-running nameplate confusion, the Continental Mark VII (marketed, sold and serviced by Lincoln) was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII, dropping the Continental nameplate.  The Mark VII would be the final generation of the Mark series sold with a Designer Series name, with a Bill Blass Edition being sold through its production (a Gianni Versace edition was sold from 1984 to 1985), eventually becoming the standard model.  As a sport-oriented model, Lincoln sold the Mark VII LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) from 1984 to 1992.\n<gallery>\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811333464).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811337194).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:Lincoln-Continental-Mark-VII.jpg|1984\u20131985 Continental Mark VII LSC \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nWhile Lincoln exited the struggles of the Malaise era by 1990, the division found itself in a different struggle.  While largely catching up to rival Cadillac in sales, the brand did so with only three model lines (in place of the seven of Cadillac and four of Mercedes-Benz).  After following the traditional Lincoln model cycle, the Town Car underwent a full redesign.  While mandated by both passive-restraint requirements and fuel-economy improvements, a redesign to the Town Car proved risky, as the model line itself accounted for over half of all Lincoln sales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars14.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo meet federal requirements, Lincoln marked the debut of several safety features within Ford Motor Company and within the American luxury segment.  Following the 1989 debut of dual airbags in the Lincoln Continental (1990 in the Town Car), antilock brakes (ABS) made their return on the Continental (1988) and on the Town Car (1992).\n\nIn line with the Lincoln Mark VII, the exterior of the Lincoln Town Car shed many of its sharp-edged lines to allow for a far sleeker body design; other elements remained, including a formal rear roofline, chrome trim, radiator-style grille, and C-pillar quarter windows.  In line with the Lincoln Continental, the 1990 Town Car adopted dual airbags.  Delayed to 1991, the Lincoln Town Car marked the debut of the 210&nbsp;hp 4.6L [[Ford Modular engine|Ford Modular V8 engine]], the first overhead-cam eight-cylinder used in an American car since the [[Duesenberg Model J]].  Built on a revision of the Panther platform, the 1990 Lincoln Town Car shared its underpinnings (but no exterior panels) with the 1992 [[Ford Crown Victoria]] (dropping the LTD prefix) and [[Mercury Grand Marquis]].\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Mark VIII (see below), for 1995, the Lincoln Continental underwent a redesign, introducing a new version of the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]] chassis.  Retaining the use of front-wheel drive, to better compete with Japanese-produced luxury sedans, the Continental was equipped with a 4.6L V8 engine (shared with the Mark VIII, tuned for front-wheel drive).\n\n1998 marked a significant transition for the Lincoln model line.  The [[Lincoln Navigator]] (see below) made its debut as the first Lincoln SUV; the Mark VIII ended its production run (becoming the final Mark-series vehicle).  While the Continental underwent a mid-cycle update, the Town Car received an extensive redesign.  The tallest Lincoln sedan in 40 years, the 1998 Town Car adopted the rounded exterior of the Mark VIII and the Continental with a completely redesigned interior.  Following the success of the Navigator in the marketplace, 1998 marked the first year Lincoln outsold Cadillac (by over 4,500 vehicles).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/06/business/fi-34467|title=Cadillac Apologizes to Lincoln for Inflating Sales Numbers|last=O'DELL|first=JOHN|date=1999-05-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>   \n<gallery>\nFile:90-92 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1990\u20131992 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:95-97 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:LTC Signature 1998-2002.png|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:92-94 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1994 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1995-1997 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental\nFile:98-02 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Continental\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Mark VIII ====\nAfter a nine-year production run (matching the Mark IV and Mark V combined), the Lincoln Mark VII was replaced by the Lincoln Mark VIII, remaining a variant of the [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar]].  This was the first generation of the Mark series originally branded as a Lincoln. Further emphasis was placed on handling, with the Mark VIII (and Thunderbird/Cougar) becoming the only American-produced four-seat cars of the time with rear-wheel drive and four-wheel independent suspension.  While the Mark VIII adopted the coupe profile of its predecessor, in an effort to modernize its styling, much of the body was radically streamlined (relegating the spare-tire hump to vestigial status).  In massive contrast from its 1970s predecessors, the Mark VIII was given a cockpit-style interior, with all controls oriented towards the driver.  In various forms, elements of the Mark VIII would be featured in other Lincoln models (the 1995 Lincoln Continental and the 1995 Town Car interior), and other Ford Motor Company products (the interior of the [[Ford Windstar]] minivan).\n\nWhile Designer Editions were discontinued, the LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) made its return as the flagship Mark VIII model.  During the 1990s, the Mark VIII competed in the mid-size luxury coupe segment, which was in overall decline.  Though positively received by critics and buyers, the Mark VIII was withdrawn after the 1998 model year, outliving the Thunderbird and Cougar by a year.  As of the 2019 model year, the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII is currently the final version of Lincoln Mark series.\n<gallery>\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9674876061).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9678105220).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, front left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, rear left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Navigator ====\n[[File:1st Lincoln Navigator -- 07-11-2012.JPG|thumb|1998-2000 Lincoln Navigator]]\nFor 1998, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Navigator]] full-size SUV, its first new nameplate since the Versailles (outside of the Mark series).  While sharing no common bodywork forward of the windshield, the Navigator was a counterpart of the [[Ford Expedition]]; both model lines were  mechanically derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]].  Developed as a competitor to the [[Range Rover (P38A)|Range Rover]], [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]], and [[Toyota Land Cruiser#J80 (1990\u20132008)|Toyota Land Cruiser]]/[[Lexus LX|Lexus LX450]], the truck-based design offered increased cargo and towing capability (raised to 8,500 pounds in 1999) over its competitors.  The Navigator also offered standard third-row seating (offered only on the Land Cruiser/LX)\n\nTo distinguish its exterior from the Expedition, stylists adopted several design elements from the 1998 Town Car, including its use of body-color bumpers, chrome license-plate surround (the only chrome on the rear liftgate) and reduced use of chrome window trim (largely to distinguish it from the Expedition); the grille design would later be used on the 2000 Lincoln LS.\n\nIn an extended debut model year, the Navigator became the second-most popular Lincoln behind the Town Car, selling 71,000 examples.  In response, General Motors launched two full-size luxury SUVs marketed against the Navigator, both derived from the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]: the [[GMC Denali|GMC Yukon Denali]] and the [[Cadillac Escalade]]; both model lines introduced third-row seating in 2001.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAs the division entered the 21st century, Lincoln began a period of major transition.  In addition to ending production of the long-running Mark series, the Lincoln Navigator SUV had entered production, nearly unchallenged by European and Japanese manufacturers.  As buyers of mid-size coupes in the luxury segments had shifted towards sports sedans, Lincoln developed an entry for the segment in the place of the Mark VIII.  For 2000, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln LS]] mid-size sports sedan; coinciding with Premier Automotive Group (see below), the LS was developed alongside the [[Jaguar S-Type]].  Though the two vehicles shared a common chassis and related powertrain, no body panels were common between the two vehicles.  The shortest Lincoln ever produced at the time, the LS was developed to compete with European and Japanese-produced counterparts, in line with the [[Cadillac Catera]].  While the Catera was imported from Germany (as a rebadged Opel Omega), the LS was produced alongside the Town Car and Continental in Wixom Assembly.\n\nFor 2002, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first pickup truck produced by the brand and the first Lincoln manufactured outside of Michigan since 1958 (along with the Versailles).  Derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the Blackwood was fitted with the front bodywork of the Lincoln Navigator and a model-specific pickup bed (with imitation wood exterior trim).  In line with its name, all examples were painted black.  The Lincoln Blackwood met with poor reception, due to its limited cargo capability (its pickup bed was effectively a carpeted trunk) and lack of four-wheel drive, leading Lincoln to discontinue the model after a single year of production.\n\n2003 marked a period of transition of the Lincoln model line, as both the Town Car and LS underwent mid-cycle updates (with the Town Car receiving a full chassis redesign), with Lincoln introducing the second generation of the Navigator.  As a complement to the Navigator, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Aviator]] mid-size SUV.  Sharing the body of the Ford Explorer with the [[Mercury Mountaineer]], the Aviator adopted many styling elements from the Navigator, with a nearly identical interior design.  While priced higher than its Mercury Mountaineer counterpart to avoid model overlap, the Aviator struggled to sell, as it competed closely against the Navigator sold in the same showroom.  After 52 years of production, the Continental was discontinued for 2003.\n\nFor 2005, Lincoln introduced a second pickup truck model line, the [[Lincoln Mark LT]].  Again based on the [[Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the design of the Mark LT was partially derived from the poor reception to the Lincoln Blackwood.  While still fitted with Lincoln Navigator bodywork and interior trim, the Mark LT was fitted with a standard pickup bed; all wheel drive was available as an option.  Following lower than expected sales, the Mark LT was withdrawn from the United States (in favor of Ford adding additional content to the Ford F-Series) in 2008; in Mexico (where the Mark LT was the highest-selling vehicle of the brand) Lincoln continued sales of the Mark LT through 2014.<ref name=\"MarkLT2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|title=El poder es producto de la superacion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106125056/http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|archivedate=January 6, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2006, The Way Forward restructuring plan (see below) began to take effect on Ford Motor Company, with the Lincoln LS ending production.  To replace the LS, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Zephyr for 2006.  In what would be the smallest Lincoln sedan ever, the Zephyr was derived from the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] mid-size sedan.  In an effort to distinguish itself from its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the Lincoln Zephyr adapted styling elements from Lincoln vehicles of the past, including a wide rectangular grille (1960s and 1970s Continentals), wraparound headlamps (late 1960s Continentals), and a twin-pod dashboard (early 1960s Continental).\n\nIn 2007, as another part of The Way Forward, Lincoln began a rebranding of its model line.  As Ford considered the Lincoln Mark series to have high nameplate recognition, Lincoln began to introduce similar \"MK\" branding across the model lineup.  For 2007, the Lincoln Zephyr was rebranded as the Lincoln MKZ (\"em-kay-zee\"), with the 2007 [[Lincoln MKX]] (\"em-kay-ex\") crossover SUV introduced.  Originally slated to become the second-generation Lincoln Aviator, the MKX was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Edge]].  Alongside the Lincoln Town Car, the Lincoln Navigator was not included with the MK rebranding; for 2007, it was redesigned alongside the Ford Expedition, marking the debut of the extended-length Navigator L.  For the last time, a Designer Series Lincoln was produced, as Lincoln discontinued the trim on the Town Car after 2007.  Produced only as a concept car, the 2007 [[Lincoln MKR]] marked the debut of the [[Ford EcoBoost engine|Ford EcoBoost V6]].\n\nFor 2009, Lincoln introduced its first all-new full-size sedan since 1980, the [[Lincoln MKS]].  Intended to be phased in as the replacement for the Lincoln Town Car, the MKS was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]].  Built on a Volvo-derived chassis, the MKS was the first full-size Lincoln with front-wheel drive (or optional all-wheel drive); shared with the Ford Taurus SHO, a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 was an option.  Derived from the 2007 MKR concept, the MKS marked the production debut of the \"split-wing\" grille, a design element similar to the 1930s Lincoln Zephyr.  A year later, the division introduced the [[Lincoln MKT]] crossover SUV, a counterpart of the [[Ford Flex]].  Sharing its chassis with the MKS, the MKT was sized between the MKX and standard-wheelbase Navigator.<gallery>\nFile:2002 Lincoln Blackwood 1.jpg|2002 Lincoln Blackwood\nFile:Lincoln Town Car Signature.JPG|2003\u20132007 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:2004 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|2004 Lincoln LS\nFile:LincolnAviator.jpg|2003-2005 Lincoln Aviator\nFile:Navigator L.jpg|2007 Lincoln Navigator L\nFile:2009 Lincoln MKZ.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln MKS -- 01-13-2010.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKS\n</gallery>\n\n==== Premier Automotive Group & The Way Forward ====\nAs Lincoln entered the 21st century, the brand underwent a major transition within the structure of Ford Motor Company.  As Ford expanded its global automotive holdings during the 1980s and 1990s, it acquired Jaguar, Aston Martin, Land Rover, and Volvo Cars.  To collectively manage its global luxury-vehicle holdings, in 1999, Ford organized Premier Automotive Group (PAG).  The same year, the management of Lincoln-Mercury was shifted to the American headquarters of PAG, largely in an effort to engineer and market more competitive vehicles for the brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars19.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe integration of Lincoln into PAG would lead to several product changes within the division.  Following the 2000 debut of the LS sports sedan, the Lincoln Continental was withdrawn in 2002.  To avoid the model overlap that plagued the division two decades before, Lincoln chose to focus production on the Lincoln Town Car, one of the highest-profit vehicles of Ford Motor Company. During 2002, as part of a change of management, Lincoln-Mercury was removed from PAG and relocated within Ford Motor Company headquarters.\n\nIn 2005, Ford developed [[The Way Forward]] restructuring plan in an effort to return to profitability.  Among the seven vehicle assembly facilities slated for closure, Wixom Assembly (home to all Lincoln assembly since 1957, with the exception of the Versailles, Navigator, Blackwood, and Mark LT) was placed third, with an announced June 2007 closure.  After a shortened 2006 model year, the Lincoln LS ended production.  Initially slated for discontinuation after 2007, production of the Lincoln Town Car was shifted to [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in Ontario, consolidated with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.  In 2011, all three vehicles ended production, coinciding with the closure of that facility.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nFor the Lincoln division, the beginning of the 2010s introduced a number of structural changes.  While Lincoln and Mercury were spared by The Way Forward, in 2010, Ford announced the closure of Mercury at the end of the year, with the final Mercury vehicle produced on January 4, 2011.       After 30 years of production as a distinct model line (and 41 years as a Lincoln nameplate), the Lincoln Town Car ended its production run in 2011, coinciding with the closure of St. Thomas Assembly in Ontario.  In contrast to the V8-engined Lincoln Town Car, for 2011, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln MKZ#MKZ Hybrid (2011)|MKZ Hybrid]], a counterpart of the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]].  The first Lincoln hybrid vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid was the first Lincoln equipped with a four-cylinder engine.  Following the discontinuation of the Town Car sedan, Lincoln continued use of the Town Car nameplate, adding it to limousine and livery variants of the Lincoln MKT.  Along with chassis modifications for heavy-duty use, the MKT Town Car features modified rear seating, with the third-row seat removed to create additional luggage space and second-row seat legroom.\n\nTo reflect the end of the Lincoln-Mercury division pairing (from 1945 to 2010), in December 2012, the formal name of Lincoln was changed to The Lincoln Motor Company (its name prior to 1940).<ref name=\"lincoln20122\">{{cite press release|title=Lincoln Forges Dynamic New Path with the Introduction of 'The Lincoln Motor Company' and All-New MKZ Luxury Vehicle|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|quote=The company, introduced as The Lincoln Motor Company, unveiled its all-new MKZ midsize luxury sedan and a strategic plan to reinvent the premium automotive marketplace|access-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206011208/http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|archive-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>  To help differentiate Lincoln vehicles from Ford counterparts, Ford established separate design, product development, and sales teams for Lincoln.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/automobiles/lincoln-strategy-well-try-anything.html|title=Lincoln Strategy: We\u2019ll Try Anything|last=Dyer|first=Ezra|date=December 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>   In a marketing shift, Lincoln began to target \"progressive luxury customers\". luxury buyers seeking a vehicle solely for their own interests and avoiding ostentation altogether.<ref name=\"valdes2\">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|title=Ford Restarts Lincoln Motor Co.|last=Dapena-Valdes|first=Peter|date=December 3, 2012|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203182033/http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|archive-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|publisher=[[CNN]]|quote=As it attempts to revive a once-great luxury brand, Ford's is renaming its Lincoln division as the Lincoln Motor Co., the automaker said Monday.}}</ref><ref name=\"lincoln20122\" />\n\nAs part of the 2012 rebranding, for 2013, the Lincoln model line underwent several design revisions, headed by the release of the second-generation MKZ.  Retaining commonality with the Ford Fusion (a rebadged [[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|Ford Mondeo]]), the MKZ adapted a distinct exterior from its Fusion/Mondeo counterparts (nearly unchanged from a Lincoln concept car released in 2012).<ref name=\"valdes2\" />  The MKS and MKT underwent exterior and interior revisions, adopting the \"bow-wing\" grille design of the MKZ.  Also during this time, Lincoln introduced new trim level nomenclatures Premiere, Select and Reserve on the MKZ.  Use of these trim names would eventually be expanded to other Lincoln models.  \n\nSince 2014, Lincoln has enlisted [[Matthew McConaughey]] as a brand spokesman; McConaughey has appeared in commercials for several Lincoln products in the past six years. \n\nFor 2015, Lincoln introduced two new SUVs, with the all-new [[Lincoln MKC]] compact crossover SUV (derived from the [[Ford Kuga]]/Ford Escape) becoming the first Lincoln produced solely with four-cylinder engines.  The Lincoln Navigator underwent an extensive revision, largely to preview buyers of its 2018 redesign.  Along with extensive exterior and interior updates, the Navigator adopted the 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 of the Ford F-150 as its standard engine, becoming the first version of the Navigator offered without a V8 engine.\n\nFollowing the positive reception to a 2015 concept car of the same name, Lincoln revived the Lincoln Continental nameplate for the 2017 model year (after a 15-year hiatus).  Slotted as a replacement for the Lincoln MKS, the Continental was adapted from a version of the Ford Taurus designed for China.  While slightly shorter than the MKS, the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln since the Town Car.  The revived model line introduced a new design language for Lincoln; shifting away from the split-wing grille, the Continental introduced a recessed rectangular grille.  The revived Continental marked the debut of the Lincoln \"Black Label\" program for all Lincoln vehicles.  As a flagship trim line, Black Label vehicles feature specially coordinated exterior and interior design themes (similar to the Designer Editions of the Mark series), along with highly personalized customer service.\n\nFor 2018, after an eleven-year production run of its predecessor, Lincoln released the fourth generation of the Navigator.  Integrating the recessed rectangular grille of the Continental into its exterior, the Navigator is distinguished from the Ford Expedition largely from its taillamps and its blacked-out roof pillars (sharing the \"floating roof\" design of the Ford Flex and Ford Explorer).  At a base price of $95,000, the Lincoln Navigator L Black Label is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the [[Ford GT]] supercars).  The Lincoln MKZ underwent a mid-cycle redesign, adopting the grille design and twin-turbocharged V6 engine of the Lincoln Continental.\n\nFor 2019, the retirement of the \"MK\" naming scheme was expanded, as the MKX underwent a mid-cycle update, becoming the [[Lincoln Nautilus]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/2019-lincoln-nautilus-first-look-review-mkx-replacement-gets-new-name/|title=2019 Lincoln Nautilus First Look: MKX Replacement Gets New Name|date=2017-11-28|magazine=Motor Trend}}</ref>  To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Continental nameplate, Lincoln unveiled the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition, marking the debut of a long-wheelbase Lincoln Continental.  The first factory produced Lincoln sold with a base price over $100,000, the variant marked the revival of the rear-hinged door configuration (after a 40-year absence).  The MKT (including the MKT Town Car livery version) was discontinued in 2019, marking the final use of the Town Car nameplate.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:2011 Lincoln MKX -- 03-09-2011 1.jpg|2011 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2013 Lincoln Mk T Town Car NYC.JPG|2013 Lincoln MKT Town Car\nFile:Lincoln MKC 01 China 2015-04-10.jpg|2015 Lincoln MKC\nFile:Lincoln MKX II 01 China 2016-04-18.jpg|2016 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2017 Lincoln MKZ 'Select' 2.0T front 5.19.19.jpg|2017 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln Continental P4220637.jpg|2018 Lincoln Continental\nFile:2018 Lincoln Navigator front 9.22.18.jpg|2018 Lincoln Navigator L Black Label\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2020s ===\nFor 2020, the Lincoln model line underwent further expansion, with the return of the Aviator mid-size SUV (again a counterpart of the Ford Explorer); the revived Aviator offers the first hybrid-electric system in a Lincoln SUV.

Roosevelt to George H. W. Bush.  Along with producing the first purpose-built presidential limousine, Lincoln produced two of the first armored vehicles for presidential use.\n\nA 1939 Lincoln Model K V12 convertible (with a Brunn body) was acquired by the government for the use of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  As a result of its convertible top (to allow the president to appear in crowds without exiting the vehicle), the Lincoln adapted the name \"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\".  In 1942, as a response to the beginning of World War II, the Sunshine Special adapted armor plating and bullet-proof glass; the retractable roof remained in use.  Following the result of the security upgrades, the Sunshine Special expanded to 9,300 pounds.  After traveling across the United States for the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the Sunshine Special was retired in 1948.  Today, the Sunshine Special is on display at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].\n\nAs a replacement for the Sunshine Special, in 1950, the White House leased 10 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitans (9 sedans and one convertible), bodied by [[Henney Motor Company]] with security upgrades from Hess & Eisenhardt.  For 1954, President Eisenhower ordered a removable [[Plexiglas]] roof fitted to the 20-foot-long Cosmopolitan convertible, with the vehicle adapting the \"Bubble Top\" nickname.  Along with the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, Lincoln Cosmopolitans would see use by Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (once), with the \"Bubble Top\" retired in 1965.\n\nIn 1961, President Kennedy began use of a modified 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible, bodied by [[Hess & Eisenhardt]] of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Code-named [[SS-100-X]], the Lincoln was an open car, designed with a set of interchangeable tops, including a black formal-profile top, plexiglass roof sections and a stainless-steel [[targa top]] for the driver's compartment.  In presidential parades and motorcades, the limousine was often used as an open car (to avoid stress on the cooling system).  In the open configuration, John F. Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in November 1963.  Following the Kennedy assassination, SS-100X was initially investigated for evidence; in early 1964, the vehicle was released to Hess & Eisenhardt, effectively becoming remanufactured.  Distinguished by a shift from navy blue to black paint and the permanent fitment of a roof, SS-100X underwent extensive security modifications, adding armor plating and bulletproof glass.  Retired from front-line service in 1967, the 1961 limousine remained in service until 1977, used by Presidents Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, and Jimmy Carter.  SS-100X is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, along with the Sunshine Special.\n\nDuring the 1960s, alongside SS-100X, the Johnson administration used several Lincolns: including three 1965 Lincoln Continental Executive limousines (two used by the President; one was used by Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]]) and a 1968 Lincoln stretch limousine, the latter is on display at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nFor the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, the White House commissioned a state limousine based upon a 1969 Lincoln Continental, bodied by Lehman-Peterson of Chicago, Illinois.  While again adopting the armor plating and bulletproof glass and other security features of SS-100X, to allow the President to stand upright and greet constituents from the motorcade, a sunroof was added to the vehicle above the rear passenger compartment.  Used by President Nixon until 1974, the car is located at the [[Nixon Library]] in Yorba Linda, California.\n\nDeveloped for the second term of the Nixon administration, in 1974, the [[Gerald Ford]] administration replaced the 1969 Continental with an armored 1972 Lincoln Continental limousine.  As a result of armor plating and security upgrades, the 1972 Continental was stretched to 22 feet in length, weighing nearly 13,000 pounds.  Used by Gerald Ford, [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[Ronald Reagan]], the 1972 Continental has notoriety similar to the SS-100X, with its presence at two presidential assassination attempts.  In 1975, the limousine rushed Gerald Ford away during the [[Sara Jane Moore#Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford|assassination attempt against him from Sarah Jane Moore]].  In 1981, Ronald Reagan was wounded in [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]'s [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]].  While not directly hit by a bullet from Hinckley, Reagan was wounded by a bullet that had struck the armor plating on the side of the car, richocheting off of the vehicle.  Today, the car is on display at the Henry Ford Museum alongside the Sunshine Special and SS-100-X.\n\nThe last Lincoln used as a [[Presidential state car]] is a 1989 Lincoln Town Car commissioned for [[George H. W. Bush]].  In line with its 1983 [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]] predecessor, the roofline of the Town Car was raised several inches to accommodate for the thickness of bulletproof glass (while preserving outward visibility).  To better handle the weight of armor plating and security upgrades, the powertrain was upgraded to that of an F-250 pickup truck, receiving a 7.5L V8 and a [[Ford C6 transmission#E4OD|E4OD]] 4-speed automatic transmission.  Today, the car is on display at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in College Station, Texas.  Since 1993, the Secret Service has used limousines derived from Cadillac vehicles as a presidential state car.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:1939 Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Sunshine Special (31609480232).jpg|\"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\", 1939 Lincoln Model K convertible/Brunn body\nFile:Inaugural Parade.

Among the founders of [[Cadillac]], Leland had sold the company to [[General Motors]] in 1909, remaining on as an executive until 1917, when he left over a dispute with GM President [[William C. Durant|William Durant]].  Naming Lincoln Motor Company after Abraham Lincoln, the first President for whom he ever voted (1864), Leland financed the company by securing a $10 million contract to build [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V12 aircraft engines]], breaking ground on the [[Lincoln Motor Company Plant]].  To build the Liberty engines, Lincoln sourced parts from other manufacturers; along with cylinders produced by Ford, other parts were sourced from [[Buick]], [[Cadillac]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], and [[Packard]].<ref name=\"lincolnbrief2\">{{cite book|url=http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|title=Lincoln Motor Company Briefing Book|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|quote=1917 August: After departing a management position at the Cadillac Division of General Motors, Henry Leland and his son Wilfred Leland form the Lincoln Motor Company, which produces aircraft engines to fill World War I government contracts.|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403124132/http://media.lincoln.com/images/10031/LMC_Briefing_Book.pdf|archive-date=April 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|4}}<ref name=\"ocallaghan2\">{{cite book|title=The Aviation Legacy of Henry & Edsel Ford|last=O'Callaghan|first=Timothy J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-928623-01-4|location=Detroit}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013164}}  In total, 6,500 Liberty V12 engines were produced by Lincoln before the end of World War I ceased wartime production.\n\nFollowing a complete retooling for automobile production, Lincoln Motor Company developed its first automobile, the [[Lincoln L-Series|Lincoln Model L]] on September 16, 1920.  Intended as a rival for Cadillac and similar luxury car manufacturers, the Model L was powered by a [[L-head]] V8 engine, derived from the technology of the Liberty V12.\n\n==== Purchase by Ford Motor Company ====\nDuring the early 1920s, Lincoln Motor Company struggled with the shift from military to automobile production, with some customers having to wait nearly a year for their vehicles to be completed from the time of purchase.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z8865/lincoln-model-l.aspx|title=1917 Lincoln Model L Pictures, History, Value, Research, News - conceptcarz.com|work=conceptcarz.com|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}</ref>  By 1922, Lincoln fell on the verge of bankruptcy and was placed in receivership.

With the acquisition of Lincoln, Ford Motor Company produced a rival for Cadillac, [[Pierce-Arrow]], [[Marmon Motor Car Company|Marmon]], [[Peerless]], [[Duesenberg]], and [[Packard]] alongside the [[Ford Model T]].\n\nIn addition to more closely competing against General Motors in different price segments, the purchase of Lincoln also held personal value within Ford management.  In 1902, Henry Ford had been forced out of his second company ([[Henry Ford Company]]) by a group of investors led by Leland.<ref name=\"bentley2\">{{cite book|title=The Old Car Book|last=Bentley|first=John|year=1952|volume=208}}</ref>{{rp|52\u201357}}  Henry Ford Company was renamed [[Cadillac|Cadillac Automobile Company]]; sold to General Motors in 1909, Cadillac has remained a chief competitor of Lincoln from 1920 to the present day.  While Henry and Wilfred Leland were initially retained to manage Lincoln, on June 10, 1922, both Lelands were removed, with [[Edsel Ford]] brought in to manage the company.\n\nFollowing the introduction of Edsel Ford to Lincoln management, the fortunes of Lincoln began to quickly improve.  For 1923, the Lincoln Model L underwent extensive changes.  While the chassis and drivetrain (including an L-head 60-degree V8) were largely left alone, several new bodystyles were introduced.  In line with a Duesenberg or a Rolls-Royce, customers could also purchase a Model L with coachbuilt bodywork.  For 1923, Lincoln produced 7,875 cars (nearly 45% higher than 1922), operating at a profit by the end of the year.\n<gallery>\nFile:1922 Lincoln touring automobile.jpg|1922 Lincoln Model L touring sedan\nFile:1925 Lincoln - Greta Garbo Car - fvl.jpg|1925 Lincoln Model L sedan (of [[Greta Garbo]])\nFile:1926 Lincoln - fvl.jpg|1926 Lincoln Model L town car\nFile:1930 Lincoln (5960260288).jpg|1930 Lincoln Model L sedan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1930s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln K-series|Lincoln-Zephyr}}During the early 1920s, Lincoln steered away from the common American automotive industry practice of yearly model changes.  While used to market fresh designs to customers, Lincoln found that its customers had begun to purchase multiple Lincolns (or other luxury vehicles) in different bodystyles; yearly styling changes would not properly accommodate its customer base.  Following the 1930 model year, however, Lincoln chose to withdraw the Model L in favor of a more modern vehicle.  For 1931, the Lincoln Model K was introduced as a competitor to the [[Cadillac Series 355|Cadillac 355]], [[Chrysler Imperial]], [[Duesenberg Model J]], and [[Packard Eight]].\n\nFor 1932, Lincoln became an American manufacturer to produce a \"multi-cylinder\" engine as it introduced its first V12 engine.  While not the first to produce a V12 engine in an American-produced car, in 1933, Lincoln became the first manufacturer to produce vehicles exclusively with V12 engines, as it retired the L-head V8 engine.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Lincoln expanded to two model lines for the first time.  As Lincoln shifted the Model K upwards in price, Edsel Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Zephyr]] as a sub-marque within Lincoln for 1936.<ref name=\"dammann4\">{{cite book|title=The Cars of Lincoln-Mercury|last1=Dammann|first1=George H.|last2=Wagner|first2=James K.|publisher=Crestline Publishing|year=1987|isbn=978-0912612263}}</ref>{{rp|155}}  Designed to compete against the [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]] and [[Chrysler Airstream]], the Lincoln Zephyr introduced an all-new body and chassis, along with its [[Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine|own V12 engine]].

In late 1938, to develop a European-style car for his next Florida vacation, he commissioned Ford Chief Stylist [[Eugene Turenne Gregorie|E. T. Gregorie]] to design a [[Bespoke|one-off]]  body design, using a 1939 Lincoln Zephyr Convertible Coupe chassis.  After [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]] the body {{convert|4|in|0}}, the running boards were deleted and a spare tire was mounted behind the trunklid.\n\nAfter Edsel Ford received the car and vacationed in Florida with the one-off vehicle, it attracted a high amount of interest from potential buyers, often referring to its \"European\" or \"Continental\" exterior design.  From the latter term, the one-off vehicle became known as the [[Lincoln Continental]].\n\n=== 1940s ===\n{{Main|Lincoln H-series|Lincoln Custom|Lincoln EL-series}}Following the Great Depression, a number of American luxury car manufacturers were either forced into closure or reorganization; by 1940, alongside Lincoln, the American luxury-car segment largely consisted of Cadillac (who ended production of the LaSalle and V16 in 1940), the Chrysler Imperial (reduced to 8-passenger sedans and limousines), and Packard.  To further secure the future for Lincoln, on April 30, 1940, Ford Motor Company reorganized Lincoln Motor Company as the Lincoln Division of Ford Motor Company.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|199}}  While previously operating as an autonomous entity, as a division, Lincoln structurally became similar to its major competitor Cadillac (within General Motors).\n\nAs part of the change, several changes were made to the Lincoln model line.  Following the positive feedback of the 1939 Lincoln Continental one-off convertible built for Edsel Ford, the Lincoln Continental was introduced as a Lincoln-Zephyr production model for 1940.  For 1941, Lincoln revised its branding; the hyphen was removed from Lincoln-Zephyr, making it a Lincoln.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|206}}  As a replacement for the expensive Model K, an extended-wheelbase [[Lincoln Custom]] variant of the Lincoln Zephyr was developed.  Following the development of proper tooling, the Lincoln Continental began production on the assembly line, replacing hand-built construction.\n\nAfter the entry of the United States into World War II, as with all U.S. auto manufacturers, Lincoln ended automobile production as Ford Motor Company concentrated on wartime manufacturing.  Following the conclusion of the war in 1945, the structure of Lincoln within Ford changed again, as the Lincoln-Mercury Division was created, pairing Mercury and Lincoln together; from 1945 to the 2010 closure of Mercury, the two divisions were paired together within Ford.\n\nFor 1946, Lincoln returned to production, ending the use of the Zephyr name.  Code-named the [[Lincoln H-series|H-series]], non-Continental Lincolns were identified by their body style.  Using slightly updated exteriors from 1942, the 1946 Lincolns continued the use of the Zephyr chassis.  1948 marked the final year of the Zephyr chassis (dating to 1936)  and (as of 2018) the use of a V12 engine in an American mass-produced automobile.  After 5,322 were produced (as both a Lincoln-Zephyr and Lincoln), Lincoln ended production of the Continental.\n\nFor 1949, all three Ford Motor Company divisions debuted their first postwar designs.  Sharing its body structure with the [[Mercury Eight]], the redesigned Lincoln model line (code-named the [[Lincoln EL-series|EL-series]]) marked the first use of a V8 in a Lincoln since 1932. An all-new V12 intended for Lincoln was stillborn in development, leading the division to adapt a [[Ford flathead V8]] (from the Ford F-8 conventional truck).  As with the previous Lincoln Continental, the 1949 Lincoln dispensed with running boards completely, moving on to abandon [[Ponton (car)|pontoon styling]] entirely, with a straight fender line (and low hoodline) from headlamp to taillamp.  In a carryover from Zephyr-based Lincolns, the 1949 Lincolns retained rear-hinged passenger doors.  As a flagship model of Lincoln, the [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan]] was styled with its own rear roofline.\n<gallery>\nFile:1940 Lincoln Zephyr (7810992862).jpg|1940 Lincoln Zephyr\nFile:1942 Lincoln Continental Coupe (32768154751).jpg|1942 Lincoln Continental coupe\nFile:1946 Lincoln (4214298318).jpg|1946 Lincoln (coupe)\nFile:'48 Lincoln V12 (A&W St. Leonard).JPG|1948 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Continental Coupe 1948.jpg|1948 Lincoln Continental\nFile:Lincoln Convertible Coupe.jpg|1949 Lincoln (convertible)\nFile:Lincoln Cosmopolitan 1949.jpg|1949 Lincoln Cosmopolitan \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1950s, Ford Motor Company sought to increase the differentiation between the Mercury and Lincoln model lines.  For 1952, to add interest to the brand, Lincoln returned to model names for the first time since 1942, with the Lincoln Cosmopolitan becoming the standard Lincoln model, with the [[Lincoln Capri]] becoming the flagship model line.  In a return to (small) pontoon rear fenders, Lincolns shared a body with the Mercury Monterey.  Mechanically, Lincoln differed from Mercury, as the Ford truck V8 was replaced by the [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine|Lincoln Y-block V8]] with a [[Hydramatic]] transmission.  For the first time since the discontinuation of the Model K, Lincolns were produced with front-hinged rear doors.\n\nFor 1956, the shared Lincoln-Mercury body underwent a redesign for the final time, with Lincoln adopting elements from the [[Mercury XM-800]] and [[Lincoln Futura]] concept cars. Slotted above the Lincoln Capri, the [[Lincoln Premiere]] adapted features of the Continental Mark II, including its ducted air conditioning.\n\nDuring 1956, Lincoln-Mercury was reorganized slightly, following the creation of the free-standing Edsel and Continental divisions, Lincoln-Mercury was changed to Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (MEL), with Edsel slotted alongside/below Mercury and Continental above Lincoln, as the flagship of all of Ford Motor Company. By the end of 1959, Continental was integrated into Lincoln and Edsel was withdrawn.\n\nThe Lincoln Motor Company Plant, built in Detroit, Michigan, by Henry Leland in 1917, was closed after 1952; subsequent Lincolns were produced alongside Mercury Montereys and Mercury Montclairs. For the 1957 model year, Ford opened [[Wixom Assembly Plant|Wixom Assembly]] in [[Wixom, Michigan]], as a facility to specialize in Lincoln production. From 1957 to 2007, the facility produced Lincoln vehicles nearly exclusively, along with the [[Ford GT]] and several generations of the [[Ford Thunderbird]].\n<gallery>\nFile:1950 Lincoln standard four-door sedan, Lime Rock.jpg|1950 Lincoln (sedan)\nFile:Lincoln Capri Sedan 1953.jpg|1953 Lincoln Capri\nFile:1955 Lincoln Capri (7867895468).jpg|1955 Lincoln Capri\nFile:Lincoln Premiere 1956.jpg|1956 Lincoln Premiere\nFile:1957 Lincoln Premiere 4 door Hardtop Landau (33112700972).jpg|1957 Lincoln Premiere Landau (4-door hardtop)\nFile:1959 Lincoln Premier 2-door hardtop.JPG|1959 Lincoln Premiere \n</gallery>\n\n====Continental Division (1956\u20131959)====\n{{main|Continental Mark II}}\n[[File:1956_Continental_Mark_II_-_midnight_blue_-_fvr.jpg|thumb|1956 Continental Mark II]]\nFor the 1956 model year, Ford Motor Company created the Continental Division, slotted above Lincoln as the flagship marque of Ford Motor Company. At its launch, Continental introduced the [[Continental Mark II]] as its model line, intended as a successor to the 1940\u20131948 Lincoln Continental personal luxury car. Offered as a two-door hardtop coupe, the Mark II broke from a number of American styling precedents of the time. While fitted with whitewall tires, the exterior was fitted with minimal chrome trim on the body sides; tailfins were left off of the body completely. In place of the bumper-mounted spare tire of the original Lincoln Continental, the trunklid of the Mark II showcased the design element, with a large imitation spare tire bulge (which fit over the actual spare tire inside the trunk). The Mark II was largely hand-built, with extensive quality testing done to each engine and transmission before leaving the factory.\n\nIn place of establishing a separate sales and service network for Continental, the Mark II was marketed through Lincoln (the Mark II used a Lincoln engine and transmission). At  $10,000 in 1956 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|10,000|1956}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}), the Mark II was the most expensive car produced by an American automaker at the time, rivaling the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud]] in price.\n\nOn July 18, 1956, the Continental Division was integrated into Lincoln which continued to manage the Continental brand as a separate marque.<ref name=\"dammann4\"/>{{rp|281}}  During the 1957 model year, the Mark II was withdrawn, largely as a consequence of its hand-built construction; each unit was sold at a loss of over $1,000. Subsequently, the 1957 [[Cadillac Eldorado#Third generation (1957\u20131960)|Cadillac Eldorado Brougham]] overtook the Mark II as the most expensive American-produced vehicle.\n\nFor 1958, as part of a mandated $4000 reduction in price, Continental adopted the body of Lincoln, expanding into multiple body styles for the Mark III (the nomenclature indicating the transition). Adding a feature of the [[Mercury Turnpike Cruiser]], Continental adopted a retractable rear window across every bodystyle (including convertibles) with a reverse-slant rear roofline. For 1959, the Mark III was renamed the Mark IV, becoming the Mark V for 1960.<ref name=\"dammann4\" />{{rp|331,337,414, 582\u2013583}}\n\nIn 1959, the Continental marque was formally brought to an end within Lincoln; for 1960, the Mark V was brought to production as the ''Lincoln Continental Mark V'', ending the model cycle alongside the standard Lincoln model line.\n\n====Unibody vehicles====\n[[File:1959 Lincoln Continental.JPG|thumb|1959 Continental Mark IV Town Car formal-roof sedan]]\nFor the 1958 model year, the Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) division adapted new bodies across its vehicle lines. In addition to Mercury sharing its bodies with the premium Edsels (prior to the latter's demise), Lincoln and Continental adopted a common body structure, shifting to unibody construction. With a 131-inch wheelbase, the new platform would be among the largest vehicles ever built by Ford Motor Company; they are the longest Lincolns ever built without [[5 mph bumper]]s, a [[Bumper (car)#First standards 1971|regulatory mandate]] which went into effect in September 1972.\n\nAs a replacement for the Y-block V8, Ford developed a 430 cubic-inch [[Ford MEL engine|\"MEL\"]] V8 as standard equipment for Lincolns (which was also available in Ford Thunderbirds and some Mercury vehicles).\n\nFor 1959, Continental developed Town Car and Limousine variants of the standard four-door sedan. In place of extending the wheelbase, the reverse-slant roofline was replaced by a formal notchback configuration, allowing the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches. Among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever produced, the Town Car and Limousines were only offered painted in black.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nFrom 1958 to 1960, Lincoln would lose over $60 million.  Following the recession economy of the late 1950s (a factor that would play into the demise of Edsel), Ford Motor Company was forced to recoup the development costs of a vehicle platform that Lincoln shared with neither Ford nor Mercury (with the lone exception of the engine and transmission).  By 1958, the future of Lincoln-Mercury was at risk, with Ford President [[Robert McNamara]] considering the reduction of Ford to its namesake brand.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental7.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}</ref>  As a condition of allowing Lincoln to continue production, McNamara required the Lincoln model line to undergo a reduction in size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor 1961, Lincoln consolidated its model lineup to a single model line, with the Lincoln Continental replacing the Lincoln Capri and Lincoln Premiere; as the Continental marque was withdrawn, the Mark V saw no successor.  While only nominally lighter than the 1960 Lincoln, the 1961 Lincoln Continental adapted a far smaller exterior footprint, shedding 15 inches in length and 8 inches of wheelbase.  In an effort to streamline production, only four-door body styles were produced, with the Continental becoming the sole mass-produced four-door convertible sold in North America; to maximize rear-seat egress, Lincoln returned to the use of rear [[suicide doors]].\n\nIn another requirement to ensure its survival, the model cycle of Lincoln was extended from three years to nine years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1961-lincoln-continental1.htm|title=1961 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-10-11|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  While largely dispensing with major yearly model changes, the decision established design consistency and shifting resources towards quality control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1966-1969-lincoln-continental.htm|title=1966-1969 Lincoln Continental|date=2007-09-04|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>  For 1966, to better compete with the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Imperial Crown/LeBaron Coupe, Lincoln added a two-door hardtop to the Continental model line.

While the Lincoln Continental served as a close competitor to the Cadillac de Ville series and Chrysler Imperial, as Cadillac shifted the [[Cadillac Eldorado]] to the personal luxury segment in 1967, a segment that Ford exited in 1957 after the withdrawal of the Continental Mark II.  As a response, in April 1968, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark III|Continental Mark III]] was released as a 1969 model.  While not officially a Lincoln, the Continental Mark III was marketed through the Lincoln-Mercury dealer network, who would service the vehicle. Over a number of various names considered for the vehicle, Continental Mark III was chosen, as Henry Ford II felt the Continental Mark II did not have a proper successor (thus restarting the nomenclature).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars9.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAlongside the 1968 Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark III marked the debut of the (then-new) 460 cubic-inch V8 and became the first Ford vehicle to be fitted with anti-lock brakes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldorado-seville.com/MarkIII/MarkIII/history.html|title=The History of my Mark III|last=Loidl|first=Gerald|website=www.eldorado-seville.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref>  As standard equipment, the Mark III was fitted with power door locks, power seats, and power windows.  In an effort to control its development and production costs, the Mark III was offered only as a two-door hardtop derived from the chassis underpinnings of the four door [[Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].  While sharing many styling elements from Lincoln, the Continental Mark III debuted many elements of its own, including hidden headlights and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid (the spare tire laid flat in the front of the trunk).\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (26724699464).jpg|1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1969 Lincoln Continetal Mark III (27298635266).jpg|Rear view showing trunklid, 1969 Continental Mark III\nFile:1970 Lincoln Continental Mark III (37118465116).jpg|Interior view, 1970 Continental Mark III\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nWhile the Continental Mark III would bring Lincoln into the decade on a high note, for the American luxury car segment, the 1970s would prove tumultuous. Along with the introduction of federal safety regulations for American-market automobiles (which brought features such as 5-mph bumpers and the end of hardtop body styles), the 1973 fuel crisis would play a significant role in the engineering of American automobiles, forcing Lincoln to develop a compact-size sedan and redesign smaller full-size sedans for the 1980s. As Chrysler withdrew its Imperial brand after 1975, Cadillac became the sole domestic competitor of Lincoln.\n\nFor the 1970 model year, Lincoln made good on its 1958 plan to commit to a nine-year design cycle, giving the Continental its first complete redesign for the first time since 1961. During the 1960s, while sales of the Continental had remained relatively steady throughout its production, the engineering of luxury cars had begun to change among its competitors; to increase design commonality (and lower production costs), Cadillac and Imperial shifted away from brand-specific platforms (with the latter adapting to shared bodyshells with Chrysler). For the redesign of the Lincoln model line, the Continental grew in size. While sharing no visible body panels, Lincoln adapted the chassis of the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis (shifting to body-on-frame construction for the first time since 1957). In another effort to maintain design consistency, the 1970 Continental was produced through 1979 with only gradual updates. Along with the mandated addition of 5-mph bumpers, in 1975, the roofline was redesigned (to visually differentiate the Continental from the Mercury Marquis).\n\nThe 1970s saw the introduction of several naming traditions within Lincoln. For 1970, the Town Car nameplate was revived on a permanent basis as a submodel of the Lincoln Continental. Following the use of a Cartier-brand clock on the Continental Mark III, in 1976, the Continental Mark IV began the use of Designer Editions, which saw use on subsequent Continental Mark series models and Lincolns.<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:Lincoln (9831715645).jpg|1971 Lincoln Continental 2-door\nFile:1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car (35466763535).jpg|1972 Lincoln Continental Town Car\nFile:1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe (27331656355).jpg|1974 Lincoln Continental Town Coupe\nFile:Lincoln Continental 1978 6600cc sic dvla.JPG|1978 Lincoln Continental Town Car\n</gallery>\n\n====Lincoln Versailles====\n[[File:'78 Lincoln Versailles (Les chauds vendredis '10) & '09-'10 Nissan Murano.jpg|thumb|1978 Lincoln Versailles]]\nDeveloped as a response to the popularity of the 1976 [[Cadillac Seville]], Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Versailles]] for the 1977 model year. Thirty inches shorter and 1500 pounds&nbsp;lighter than a Lincoln Continental, the Versailles was based on the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]]/[[Mercury Monarch]] (as the Seville was based on the Chevrolet Nova). Outsold by the Seville by a significant margin, the Versailles was discontinued in early 1980.\n\nWith a smaller design and engineering budget than General Motors, Lincoln stylists were unable to give the Versailles the distinct body that was given to the Cadillac Seville. Adopting many features from the 1975\u20131976 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the Lincoln Versailles was given a [[Lincoln Continental|Continental]]-style \"radiator\" grille, quad rectangular headlights (the first Lincoln since 1969 with exposed headlights), and a [[Lincoln Mark series|Continental Mark]]-style trunklid with simulated spare tire bulge. The Versailles introduced two notable features to American-market cars: halogen headlights and clearcoat paint. The Versailles was later criticized for being one of the worst examples of badge engineering.\n\n==== Continental Mark IV and Mark V ====\nFollowing the success of the Continental Mark III, Ford chose to develop a successor personal luxury coupe.  For 1972, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV|Continental Mark IV]] made its debut, redesigned alongside the [[Ford Thunderbird (sixth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. While sharing a common roofline with the Thunderbird, from the window line down, the Mark IV wore distinct exterior sheetmetal, with the return of a radiator-style grille, hidden headlights, and a redesigned spare-tire trunklid. To distinguish itself from the Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark IV wore full-height rear-wheel openings, precluding the use of fender skirts.\n\nFor 1976, the Continental Mark IV debuted a new tradition, called the Designer Editions, which later spread to other models in the Lincoln model range. Introduced as four special-edition models, each edition was an option package with color, trim, and interior choices specified by notable fashion designers ([[Bill Blass]], [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Emilio Pucci|Pucci]]). Each edition carried the designer's signature on the opera windows and were fitted with a 22 karat (92%) gold-plated plaque on the instrument panel which could be engraved with the original owner's name. The concept was successful and would continue on other Lincolns until the end of the 2003 model year.\n\nFor 1977, Lincoln-Mercury replaced the Continental Mark IV with the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]], a substantial exterior and interior revision of the Mark IV. At over 19 feet long, Mark V is among one of the largest \"coupes\" ever sold in North America. In what would become a design theme for Lincolns into the 1990s, the Mark V used sharp-edged exterior styling with a center radiator grille. Following their 1976 success, the Mark IV adopted the Designer Editions option packages.\n\nWhile introduced following the beginning of downsizing among American vehicles, the Continental Mark V would go on to become the most successful of all the Mark series vehicles, with over 228,000 sold across three model years.\n<gallery>\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV front left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV\nFile:1973 Lincoln Mark IV rear left.jpg|1973 Continental Mark IV, rear view\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (36414930055).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V\nFile:1977 Lincoln Continental Mark V (35579789634).jpg|1977 Continental Mark V, rear view\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAs Lincoln entered the 1980s, the American auto industry remained in the \"[[Malaise era]]\", struggling to balance fuel efficiency, emissions controls, and [[Downsize (automobile)|downsizing]]; the industry also found itself competing against European and Japanese manufacturers entering segments once dominated by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.\n\nThe entry of the Lincoln into the 1980s was marked with struggle.  As a high point, after a ten-year model cycle, the Lincoln Continental underwent a complete redesign (downsizing for the first time), becoming the lightest Lincoln since World War II.  Again sharing chassis underpinnings with Mercury and Ford, the Continental used the [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]] of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis.  Coupled with a shift to a 302 cubic-inch V8, the fuel economy of the Lincoln model line rose nearly 40% in a single year.  In contrast, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn early in the 1980 model year.  As a result, by the end of 1980, Lincoln was marketing three versions of one vehicle.  As a response, Lincoln split its two product lines, with the Continental becoming the [[Lincoln Town Car]].  After a short hiatus, for 1982, the Lincoln Continental shifted size into the mid-size segment (using the [[Ford Fox platform]]).  While Lincoln would again compete against the Cadillac Seville (and to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz), the division completely erased any visual evidence of badge engineering.\n\nInitially planned for withdrawal in the mid-1980s until stabilization of fuel prices mitigated fuel-economy concerns, the Lincoln Town Car progressed through the decade largely unchanged.  As its design began to age, the model line began to increase in sales, as transitions of Cadillac to front-wheel drive and further downsizing of its full-size model lines were poorly received by both buyers and automotive industry critics. While the Town Car retained its traditional layout and large size, fuel prices dropped to a contemporary new low at the time, and operating economy became less of a concern to buyers than a decade prior.  Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements in late 1985 titled ''\"The Valet\"'' which depicted parking attendants having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser [[Buick]]s (Electras) and [[Oldsmobile]]s (Ninety-Eights), with the question \"Is that a Cadillac?\" answered by the response \"No, it's an Oldsmobile...or Buick.\" At the end, the owner of a Lincoln would appear with the line \"The Lincoln Town Car please.\" The commercial campaign saw the emergence of the new advertising line for the brand, \"''Lincoln. What a Luxury Car Should Be.''\" which was used into the 1990s.<ref name=\"Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMJSXyTnOhI|title=Youtube, 1993 Lincoln Commercial|accessdate=August 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFor 1988, the Lincoln Continental underwent a second redesign.  Splitting from the Mark VII, the Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln, as it became an extended-wheelbase version of the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]; the 3.8L V6 engine also marked the first time in a Lincoln that no 8-cylinder (or V12) engine was offered.  In an effort to further reduce model overlap, the front-wheel drive Continental was developed for vehicles that neither Cadillac nor the Lincoln Town Car were marketed against: European and Japanese-produced luxury sedans.  Following the debut of a driver-side airbag in the [[Ford Tempo]], the 1989 Lincoln Continental became the first sedan sold in the United States equipped with standard [[Airbag|dual airbags]].\n<gallery>\nFile:Lincoln Versailles, 1980.png|1980 Lincoln Versailles\nFile:82LincolnContinental.jpg|1982 Lincoln Continental Givenchy Edition\nFile:1984 Lincoln Towncar.jpg|1984 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:Lincoln Continental (4282945959).jpg|1986\u20131987 Lincoln Continental\nFile:88-91 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1988\u20131991 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1989 Lincoln Town Car -- 06-16-2011.jpg|1989 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\n</gallery>\n\n==== Continental Mark VI and Mark VII ====\nFor 1980, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VI|Continental Mark VI]] made its debut, replacing the Mark V.  Originally slated to adopt the Ford Thunderbird chassis as part of downsizing, the Mark VI remained a full-size car, adopting the Ford Panther platform.  Following the departure of Lee Iaccoca from Ford, the development of the Mark VI shifted from stand-alone model range to a four-door sedan and two-door coupe.  Following its marketplace success, many design elements of the Mark V were carried onto the Mark VI, including its sharp-edged sheetmetal, hidden headlamps, opera windows, and fender louvers (now non-functional).  The Mark VI coupe shared the same exact 114\u201d Ford/Mercury wheelbase of the Panther chassis, with its own distinct roofline, while the four-door Mark VI shared its body with the Lincoln Continental/Town Car-Town Coup\u00e9, on a 3\u201d longer wheelbase (at 117\u201d).\n\nThe Mark VI continued the use of the Designer Series (for coupes); in 1982, the option packages began a revision, as the Cartier Edition was moved to the Town Car and the Givenchy Edition was moved to the Continental. In early-1982, the Givenchy Edition was re-introduced to the Mark VI lineup, (via a single-page insert to the showroom brochure) but would last only that year. In another tradition, in 1980, the Mark VI launched the Signature Series trim level.  Initially intended as a direct replacement for the 1979 Collector's Series, the Signature Series designation would also be utilized by the Town Car beginning in 1981; in various forms, it would be used to its 2011 discontinuation...as well as the mid-size bustle-back Continental (for 1982 only). The heavily feature-equipped 1980\u20131981 Mark VI Signature Series (padded vinyl trunk lid tire bulge, color-keyed bumper guards and rub strips, color-keyed trunk carpeting, color-keyed turbine wheels, tool kit, etc.), received a de-contenting of many of these exclusive features for 1982-on, but now offered more colors and options. This ultimately became more of a parallel replacement of the former (1976\u20131981) \u201cLuxury Group\u201d offerings, which was absent from the option list for 1982-on.\n\nFor 1984, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark VII|Continental Mark VII]] replaced the Mark VI, again becoming a counterpart of the [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]].   The most technically advanced vehicle sold by Lincoln-Mercury at the time, the Mark VII represented a major market shift, becoming the smallest version of the Mark series.  From the 1979 Mark V to the 1984 Mark VII, Ford engineers shed 27 inches of length and over 1,200 pounds of curb weight.  While slightly less performance-oriented than a [[Grand tourer|grand-touring car]], in its development, the Mark VII placed a far greater emphasis on handling capability than any previous Mark-series vehicle, with four-wheel disc brakes, anti-lock brakes, four-wheel air suspension; its 5.0L V8 was shared with the [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]].\n\nFor 1986, to eliminate the long-running nameplate confusion, the Continental Mark VII (marketed, sold and serviced by Lincoln) was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII, dropping the Continental nameplate.  The Mark VII would be the final generation of the Mark series sold with a Designer Series name, with a Bill Blass Edition being sold through its production (a Gianni Versace edition was sold from 1984 to 1985), eventually becoming the standard model.  As a sport-oriented model, Lincoln sold the Mark VII LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) from 1984 to 1992.\n<gallery>\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811333464).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:83 Lincoln Continental Mark VI (7811337194).jpg|1983 Continental Mark VI\nFile:Lincoln-Continental-Mark-VII.jpg|1984\u20131985 Continental Mark VII LSC \n</gallery>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nWhile Lincoln exited the struggles of the Malaise era by 1990, the division found itself in a different struggle.  While largely catching up to rival Cadillac in sales, the brand did so with only three model lines (in place of the seven of Cadillac and four of Mercedes-Benz).  After following the traditional Lincoln model cycle, the Town Car underwent a full redesign.  While mandated by both passive-restraint requirements and fuel-economy improvements, a redesign to the Town Car proved risky, as the model line itself accounted for over half of all Lincoln sales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars14.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo meet federal requirements, Lincoln marked the debut of several safety features within Ford Motor Company and within the American luxury segment.  Following the 1989 debut of dual airbags in the Lincoln Continental (1990 in the Town Car), antilock brakes (ABS) made their return on the Continental (1988) and on the Town Car (1992).\n\nIn line with the Lincoln Mark VII, the exterior of the Lincoln Town Car shed many of its sharp-edged lines to allow for a far sleeker body design; other elements remained, including a formal rear roofline, chrome trim, radiator-style grille, and C-pillar quarter windows.  In line with the Lincoln Continental, the 1990 Town Car adopted dual airbags.  Delayed to 1991, the Lincoln Town Car marked the debut of the 210&nbsp;hp 4.6L [[Ford Modular engine|Ford Modular V8 engine]], the first overhead-cam eight-cylinder used in an American car since the [[Duesenberg Model J]].  Built on a revision of the Panther platform, the 1990 Lincoln Town Car shared its underpinnings (but no exterior panels) with the 1992 [[Ford Crown Victoria]] (dropping the LTD prefix) and [[Mercury Grand Marquis]].\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Mark VIII (see below), for 1995, the Lincoln Continental underwent a redesign, introducing a new version of the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]] chassis.  Retaining the use of front-wheel drive, to better compete with Japanese-produced luxury sedans, the Continental was equipped with a 4.6L V8 engine (shared with the Mark VIII, tuned for front-wheel drive).\n\n1998 marked a significant transition for the Lincoln model line.  The [[Lincoln Navigator]] (see below) made its debut as the first Lincoln SUV; the Mark VIII ended its production run (becoming the final Mark-series vehicle).  While the Continental underwent a mid-cycle update, the Town Car received an extensive redesign.  The tallest Lincoln sedan in 40 years, the 1998 Town Car adopted the rounded exterior of the Mark VIII and the Continental with a completely redesigned interior.  Following the success of the Navigator in the marketplace, 1998 marked the first year Lincoln outsold Cadillac (by over 4,500 vehicles).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/06/business/fi-34467|title=Cadillac Apologizes to Lincoln for Inflating Sales Numbers|last=O'DELL|first=JOHN|date=1999-05-06|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>   \n<gallery>\nFile:90-92 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1990\u20131992 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:95-97 Lincoln Town Car.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Town Car\nFile:LTC Signature 1998-2002.png|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:92-94 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1994 Lincoln Continental\nFile:1995-1997 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1995\u20131997 Lincoln Continental\nFile:98-02 Lincoln Continental.jpg|1998\u20132002 Lincoln Continental\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Mark VIII ====\nAfter a nine-year production run (matching the Mark IV and Mark V combined), the Lincoln Mark VII was replaced by the Lincoln Mark VIII, remaining a variant of the [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar]].  This was the first generation of the Mark series originally branded as a Lincoln. Further emphasis was placed on handling, with the Mark VIII (and Thunderbird/Cougar) becoming the only American-produced four-seat cars of the time with rear-wheel drive and four-wheel independent suspension.  While the Mark VIII adopted the coupe profile of its predecessor, in an effort to modernize its styling, much of the body was radically streamlined (relegating the spare-tire hump to vestigial status).  In massive contrast from its 1970s predecessors, the Mark VIII was given a cockpit-style interior, with all controls oriented towards the driver.  In various forms, elements of the Mark VIII would be featured in other Lincoln models (the 1995 Lincoln Continental and the 1995 Town Car interior), and other Ford Motor Company products (the interior of the [[Ford Windstar]] minivan).\n\nWhile Designer Editions were discontinued, the LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) made its return as the flagship Mark VIII model.  During the 1990s, the Mark VIII competed in the mid-size luxury coupe segment, which was in overall decline.  Though positively received by critics and buyers, the Mark VIII was withdrawn after the 1998 model year, outliving the Thunderbird and Cougar by a year.  As of the 2019 model year, the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII is currently the final version of Lincoln Mark series.\n<gallery>\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9674876061).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:93 Lincoln Mark VIII (9678105220).jpg|1993 Lincoln Mark VIII\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, front left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\nFile:1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC in red, rear left.jpg|1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC\n</gallery>\n\n==== Lincoln Navigator ====\n[[File:1st Lincoln Navigator -- 07-11-2012.JPG|thumb|1998-2000 Lincoln Navigator]]\nFor 1998, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Navigator]] full-size SUV, its first new nameplate since the Versailles (outside of the Mark series).  While sharing no common bodywork forward of the windshield, the Navigator was a counterpart of the [[Ford Expedition]]; both model lines were  mechanically derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-Series]].  Developed as a competitor to the [[Range Rover (P38A)|Range Rover]], [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]], and [[Toyota Land Cruiser#J80 (1990\u20132008)|Toyota Land Cruiser]]/[[Lexus LX|Lexus LX450]], the truck-based design offered increased cargo and towing capability (raised to 8,500 pounds in 1999) over its competitors.  The Navigator also offered standard third-row seating (offered only on the Land Cruiser/LX)\n\nTo distinguish its exterior from the Expedition, stylists adopted several design elements from the 1998 Town Car, including its use of body-color bumpers, chrome license-plate surround (the only chrome on the rear liftgate) and reduced use of chrome window trim (largely to distinguish it from the Expedition); the grille design would later be used on the 2000 Lincoln LS.\n\nIn an extended debut model year, the Navigator became the second-most popular Lincoln behind the Town Car, selling 71,000 examples.  In response, General Motors launched two full-size luxury SUVs marketed against the Navigator, both derived from the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]: the [[GMC Denali|GMC Yukon Denali]] and the [[Cadillac Escalade]]; both model lines introduced third-row seating in 2001.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAs the division entered the 21st century, Lincoln began a period of major transition.  In addition to ending production of the long-running Mark series, the Lincoln Navigator SUV had entered production, nearly unchallenged by European and Japanese manufacturers.  As buyers of mid-size coupes in the luxury segments had shifted towards sports sedans, Lincoln developed an entry for the segment in the place of the Mark VIII.  For 2000, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln LS]] mid-size sports sedan; coinciding with Premier Automotive Group (see below), the LS was developed alongside the [[Jaguar S-Type]].  Though the two vehicles shared a common chassis and related powertrain, no body panels were common between the two vehicles.  The shortest Lincoln ever produced at the time, the LS was developed to compete with European and Japanese-produced counterparts, in line with the [[Cadillac Catera]].  While the Catera was imported from Germany (as a rebadged Opel Omega), the LS was produced alongside the Town Car and Continental in Wixom Assembly.\n\nFor 2002, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first pickup truck produced by the brand and the first Lincoln manufactured outside of Michigan since 1958 (along with the Versailles).  Derived from the [[Ford F-Series (tenth generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the Blackwood was fitted with the front bodywork of the Lincoln Navigator and a model-specific pickup bed (with imitation wood exterior trim).  In line with its name, all examples were painted black.  The Lincoln Blackwood met with poor reception, due to its limited cargo capability (its pickup bed was effectively a carpeted trunk) and lack of four-wheel drive, leading Lincoln to discontinue the model after a single year of production.\n\n2003 marked a period of transition of the Lincoln model line, as both the Town Car and LS underwent mid-cycle updates (with the Town Car receiving a full chassis redesign), with Lincoln introducing the second generation of the Navigator.  As a complement to the Navigator, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln Aviator]] mid-size SUV.  Sharing the body of the Ford Explorer with the [[Mercury Mountaineer]], the Aviator adopted many styling elements from the Navigator, with a nearly identical interior design.  While priced higher than its Mercury Mountaineer counterpart to avoid model overlap, the Aviator struggled to sell, as it competed closely against the Navigator sold in the same showroom.  After 52 years of production, the Continental was discontinued for 2003.\n\nFor 2005, Lincoln introduced a second pickup truck model line, the [[Lincoln Mark LT]].  Again based on the [[Ford F-Series (eleventh generation)|Ford F-150 SuperCrew]], the design of the Mark LT was partially derived from the poor reception to the Lincoln Blackwood.  While still fitted with Lincoln Navigator bodywork and interior trim, the Mark LT was fitted with a standard pickup bed; all wheel drive was available as an option.  Following lower than expected sales, the Mark LT was withdrawn from the United States (in favor of Ford adding additional content to the Ford F-Series) in 2008; in Mexico (where the Mark LT was the highest-selling vehicle of the brand) Lincoln continued sales of the Mark LT through 2014.<ref name=\"MarkLT2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|title=El poder es producto de la superacion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106125056/http://www.lincoln.mx/vehiculos/marklt|archivedate=January 6, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2006, The Way Forward restructuring plan (see below) began to take effect on Ford Motor Company, with the Lincoln LS ending production.  To replace the LS, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Zephyr for 2006.  In what would be the smallest Lincoln sedan ever, the Zephyr was derived from the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] mid-size sedan.  In an effort to distinguish itself from its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the Lincoln Zephyr adapted styling elements from Lincoln vehicles of the past, including a wide rectangular grille (1960s and 1970s Continentals), wraparound headlamps (late 1960s Continentals), and a twin-pod dashboard (early 1960s Continental).\n\nIn 2007, as another part of The Way Forward, Lincoln began a rebranding of its model line.  As Ford considered the Lincoln Mark series to have high nameplate recognition, Lincoln began to introduce similar \"MK\" branding across the model lineup.  For 2007, the Lincoln Zephyr was rebranded as the Lincoln MKZ (\"em-kay-zee\"), with the 2007 [[Lincoln MKX]] (\"em-kay-ex\") crossover SUV introduced.  Originally slated to become the second-generation Lincoln Aviator, the MKX was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Edge]].  Alongside the Lincoln Town Car, the Lincoln Navigator was not included with the MK rebranding; for 2007, it was redesigned alongside the Ford Expedition, marking the debut of the extended-length Navigator L.  For the last time, a Designer Series Lincoln was produced, as Lincoln discontinued the trim on the Town Car after 2007.  Produced only as a concept car, the 2007 [[Lincoln MKR]] marked the debut of the [[Ford EcoBoost engine|Ford EcoBoost V6]].\n\nFor 2009, Lincoln introduced its first all-new full-size sedan since 1980, the [[Lincoln MKS]].  Intended to be phased in as the replacement for the Lincoln Town Car, the MKS was the Lincoln counterpart of the [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)|Ford Taurus]].  Built on a Volvo-derived chassis, the MKS was the first full-size Lincoln with front-wheel drive (or optional all-wheel drive); shared with the Ford Taurus SHO, a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 was an option.  Derived from the 2007 MKR concept, the MKS marked the production debut of the \"split-wing\" grille, a design element similar to the 1930s Lincoln Zephyr.  A year later, the division introduced the [[Lincoln MKT]] crossover SUV, a counterpart of the [[Ford Flex]].  Sharing its chassis with the MKS, the MKT was sized between the MKX and standard-wheelbase Navigator.<gallery>\nFile:2002 Lincoln Blackwood 1.jpg|2002 Lincoln Blackwood\nFile:Lincoln Town Car Signature.JPG|2003\u20132007 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series\nFile:2004 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|2004 Lincoln LS\nFile:LincolnAviator.jpg|2003-2005 Lincoln Aviator\nFile:Navigator L.jpg|2007 Lincoln Navigator L\nFile:2009 Lincoln MKZ.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln MKS -- 01-13-2010.jpg|2009 Lincoln MKS\n</gallery>\n\n==== Premier Automotive Group & The Way Forward ====\nAs Lincoln entered the 21st century, the brand underwent a major transition within the structure of Ford Motor Company.  As Ford expanded its global automotive holdings during the 1980s and 1990s, it acquired Jaguar, Aston Martin, Land Rover, and Volvo Cars.  To collectively manage its global luxury-vehicle holdings, in 1999, Ford organized Premier Automotive Group (PAG).  The same year, the management of Lincoln-Mercury was shifted to the American headquarters of PAG, largely in an effort to engineer and market more competitive vehicles for the brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/lincoln-cars19.htm|title=How Lincoln Cars Work|date=2007-06-08|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe integration of Lincoln into PAG would lead to several product changes within the division.  Following the 2000 debut of the LS sports sedan, the Lincoln Continental was withdrawn in 2002.  To avoid the model overlap that plagued the division two decades before, Lincoln chose to focus production on the Lincoln Town Car, one of the highest-profit vehicles of Ford Motor Company. During 2002, as part of a change of management, Lincoln-Mercury was removed from PAG and relocated within Ford Motor Company headquarters.\n\nIn 2005, Ford developed [[The Way Forward]] restructuring plan in an effort to return to profitability.  Among the seven vehicle assembly facilities slated for closure, Wixom Assembly (home to all Lincoln assembly since 1957, with the exception of the Versailles, Navigator, Blackwood, and Mark LT) was placed third, with an announced June 2007 closure.  After a shortened 2006 model year, the Lincoln LS ended production.  Initially slated for discontinuation after 2007, production of the Lincoln Town Car was shifted to [[St. Thomas Assembly]] in Ontario, consolidated with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.  In 2011, all three vehicles ended production, coinciding with the closure of that facility.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nFor the Lincoln division, the beginning of the 2010s introduced a number of structural changes.  While Lincoln and Mercury were spared by The Way Forward, in 2010, Ford announced the closure of Mercury at the end of the year, with the final Mercury vehicle produced on January 4, 2011.       After 30 years of production as a distinct model line (and 41 years as a Lincoln nameplate), the Lincoln Town Car ended its production run in 2011, coinciding with the closure of St. Thomas Assembly in Ontario.  In contrast to the V8-engined Lincoln Town Car, for 2011, Lincoln introduced the [[Lincoln MKZ#MKZ Hybrid (2011)|MKZ Hybrid]], a counterpart of the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]].  The first Lincoln hybrid vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid was the first Lincoln equipped with a four-cylinder engine.  Following the discontinuation of the Town Car sedan, Lincoln continued use of the Town Car nameplate, adding it to limousine and livery variants of the Lincoln MKT.  Along with chassis modifications for heavy-duty use, the MKT Town Car features modified rear seating, with the third-row seat removed to create additional luggage space and second-row seat legroom.\n\nTo reflect the end of the Lincoln-Mercury division pairing (from 1945 to 2010), in December 2012, the formal name of Lincoln was changed to The Lincoln Motor Company (its name prior to 1940).<ref name=\"lincoln20122\">{{cite press release|title=Lincoln Forges Dynamic New Path with the Introduction of 'The Lincoln Motor Company' and All-New MKZ Luxury Vehicle|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Ford Motor Company|location=New York|url=http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|quote=The company, introduced as The Lincoln Motor Company, unveiled its all-new MKZ midsize luxury sedan and a strategic plan to reinvent the premium automotive marketplace|access-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206011208/http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/pr-lincoln-forges-dynamic-new-path-37463|archive-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>  To help differentiate Lincoln vehicles from Ford counterparts, Ford established separate design, product development, and sales teams for Lincoln.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/automobiles/lincoln-strategy-well-try-anything.html|title=Lincoln Strategy: We\u2019ll Try Anything|last=Dyer|first=Ezra|date=December 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>   In a marketing shift, Lincoln began to target \"progressive luxury customers\". luxury buyers seeking a vehicle solely for their own interests and avoiding ostentation altogether.<ref name=\"valdes2\">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|title=Ford Restarts Lincoln Motor Co.|last=Dapena-Valdes|first=Peter|date=December 3, 2012|access-date=December 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203182033/http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/03/autos/ford-lincoln-motor/index.html|archive-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|publisher=[[CNN]]|quote=As it attempts to revive a once-great luxury brand, Ford's is renaming its Lincoln division as the Lincoln Motor Co., the automaker said Monday.}}</ref><ref name=\"lincoln20122\" />\n\nAs part of the 2012 rebranding, for 2013, the Lincoln model line underwent several design revisions, headed by the release of the second-generation MKZ.  Retaining commonality with the Ford Fusion (a rebadged [[Ford Mondeo (fourth generation)|Ford Mondeo]]), the MKZ adapted a distinct exterior from its Fusion/Mondeo counterparts (nearly unchanged from a Lincoln concept car released in 2012).<ref name=\"valdes2\" />  The MKS and MKT underwent exterior and interior revisions, adopting the \"bow-wing\" grille design of the MKZ.  Also during this time, Lincoln introduced new trim level nomenclatures Premiere, Select and Reserve on the MKZ.  Use of these trim names would eventually be expanded to other Lincoln models.  \n\nSince 2014, Lincoln has enlisted [[Matthew McConaughey]] as a brand spokesman; McConaughey has appeared in commercials for several Lincoln products in the past six years. \n\nFor 2015, Lincoln introduced two new SUVs, with the all-new [[Lincoln MKC]] compact crossover SUV (derived from the [[Ford Kuga]]/Ford Escape) becoming the first Lincoln produced solely with four-cylinder engines.  The Lincoln Navigator underwent an extensive revision, largely to preview buyers of its 2018 redesign.  Along with extensive exterior and interior updates, the Navigator adopted the 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 of the Ford F-150 as its standard engine, becoming the first version of the Navigator offered without a V8 engine.\n\nFollowing the positive reception to a 2015 concept car of the same name, Lincoln revived the Lincoln Continental nameplate for the 2017 model year (after a 15-year hiatus).  Slotted as a replacement for the Lincoln MKS, the Continental was adapted from a version of the Ford Taurus designed for China.  While slightly shorter than the MKS, the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln since the Town Car.  The revived model line introduced a new design language for Lincoln; shifting away from the split-wing grille, the Continental introduced a recessed rectangular grille.  The revived Continental marked the debut of the Lincoln \"Black Label\" program for all Lincoln vehicles.  As a flagship trim line, Black Label vehicles feature specially coordinated exterior and interior design themes (similar to the Designer Editions of the Mark series), along with highly personalized customer service.\n\nFor 2018, after an eleven-year production run of its predecessor, Lincoln released the fourth generation of the Navigator.  Integrating the recessed rectangular grille of the Continental into its exterior, the Navigator is distinguished from the Ford Expedition largely from its taillamps and its blacked-out roof pillars (sharing the \"floating roof\" design of the Ford Flex and Ford Explorer).  At a base price of $95,000, the Lincoln Navigator L Black Label is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the [[Ford GT]] supercars).  The Lincoln MKZ underwent a mid-cycle redesign, adopting the grille design and twin-turbocharged V6 engine of the Lincoln Continental.\n\nFor 2019, the retirement of the \"MK\" naming scheme was expanded, as the MKX underwent a mid-cycle update, becoming the [[Lincoln Nautilus]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/2019-lincoln-nautilus-first-look-review-mkx-replacement-gets-new-name/|title=2019 Lincoln Nautilus First Look: MKX Replacement Gets New Name|date=2017-11-28|magazine=Motor Trend}}</ref>  To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Continental nameplate, Lincoln unveiled the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition, marking the debut of a long-wheelbase Lincoln Continental.  The first factory produced Lincoln sold with a base price over $100,000, the variant marked the revival of the rear-hinged door configuration (after a 40-year absence).  The MKT (including the MKT Town Car livery version) was discontinued in 2019, marking the final use of the Town Car nameplate.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:2011 Lincoln MKX -- 03-09-2011 1.jpg|2011 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2013 Lincoln Mk T Town Car NYC.JPG|2013 Lincoln MKT Town Car\nFile:Lincoln MKC 01 China 2015-04-10.jpg|2015 Lincoln MKC\nFile:Lincoln MKX II 01 China 2016-04-18.jpg|2016 Lincoln MKX\nFile:2017 Lincoln MKZ 'Select' 2.0T front 5.19.19.jpg|2017 Lincoln MKZ\nFile:Lincoln Continental P4220637.jpg|2018 Lincoln Continental\nFile:2018 Lincoln Navigator front 9.22.18.jpg|2018 Lincoln Navigator L Black Label\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2020s ===\nFor 2020, the Lincoln model line underwent further expansion, with the return of the Aviator mid-size SUV (again a counterpart of the Ford Explorer); the revived Aviator offers the first hybrid-electric system in a Lincoln SUV.

Roosevelt to George H. W. Bush.  Along with producing the first purpose-built presidential limousine, Lincoln produced two of the first armored vehicles for presidential use.\n\nA 1939 Lincoln Model K V12 convertible (with a Brunn body) was acquired by the government for the use of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  As a result of its convertible top (to allow the president to appear in crowds without exiting the vehicle), the Lincoln adapted the name \"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\".  In 1942, as a response to the beginning of World War II, the Sunshine Special adapted armor plating and bullet-proof glass; the retractable roof remained in use.  Following the result of the security upgrades, the Sunshine Special expanded to 9,300 pounds.  After traveling across the United States for the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the Sunshine Special was retired in 1948.  Today, the Sunshine Special is on display at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].\n\nAs a replacement for the Sunshine Special, in 1950, the White House leased 10 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitans (9 sedans and one convertible), bodied by [[Henney Motor Company]] with security upgrades from Hess & Eisenhardt.  For 1954, President Eisenhower ordered a removable [[Plexiglas]] roof fitted to the 20-foot-long Cosmopolitan convertible, with the vehicle adapting the \"Bubble Top\" nickname.  Along with the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, Lincoln Cosmopolitans would see use by Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (once), with the \"Bubble Top\" retired in 1965.\n\nIn 1961, President Kennedy began use of a modified 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible, bodied by [[Hess & Eisenhardt]] of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Code-named [[SS-100-X]], the Lincoln was an open car, designed with a set of interchangeable tops, including a black formal-profile top, plexiglass roof sections and a stainless-steel [[targa top]] for the driver's compartment.  In presidential parades and motorcades, the limousine was often used as an open car (to avoid stress on the cooling system).  In the open configuration, John F. Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in November 1963.  Following the Kennedy assassination, SS-100X was initially investigated for evidence; in early 1964, the vehicle was released to Hess & Eisenhardt, effectively becoming remanufactured.  Distinguished by a shift from navy blue to black paint and the permanent fitment of a roof, SS-100X underwent extensive security modifications, adding armor plating and bulletproof glass.  Retired from front-line service in 1967, the 1961 limousine remained in service until 1977, used by Presidents Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, and Jimmy Carter.  SS-100X is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, along with the Sunshine Special.\n\nDuring the 1960s, alongside SS-100X, the Johnson administration used several Lincolns: including three 1965 Lincoln Continental Executive limousines (two used by the President; one was used by Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]]) and a 1968 Lincoln stretch limousine, the latter is on display at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nFor the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, the White House commissioned a state limousine based upon a 1969 Lincoln Continental, bodied by Lehman-Peterson of Chicago, Illinois.  While again adopting the armor plating and bulletproof glass and other security features of SS-100X, to allow the President to stand upright and greet constituents from the motorcade, a sunroof was added to the vehicle above the rear passenger compartment.  Used by President Nixon until 1974, the car is located at the [[Nixon Library]] in Yorba Linda, California.\n\nDeveloped for the second term of the Nixon administration, in 1974, the [[Gerald Ford]] administration replaced the 1969 Continental with an armored 1972 Lincoln Continental limousine.  As a result of armor plating and security upgrades, the 1972 Continental was stretched to 22 feet in length, weighing nearly 13,000 pounds.  Used by Gerald Ford, [[Jimmy Carter]], and [[Ronald Reagan]], the 1972 Continental has notoriety similar to the SS-100X, with its presence at two presidential assassination attempts.  In 1975, the limousine rushed Gerald Ford away during the [[Sara Jane Moore#Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford|assassination attempt against him from Sarah Jane Moore]].  In 1981, Ronald Reagan was wounded in [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]'s [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]].  While not directly hit by a bullet from Hinckley, Reagan was wounded by a bullet that had struck the armor plating on the side of the car, richocheting off of the vehicle.  Today, the car is on display at the Henry Ford Museum alongside the Sunshine Special and SS-100-X.\n\nThe last Lincoln used as a [[Presidential state car]] is a 1989 Lincoln Town Car commissioned for [[George H. W. Bush]].  In line with its 1983 [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]] predecessor, the roofline of the Town Car was raised several inches to accommodate for the thickness of bulletproof glass (while preserving outward visibility).  To better handle the weight of armor plating and security upgrades, the powertrain was upgraded to that of an F-250 pickup truck, receiving a 7.5L V8 and a [[Ford C6 transmission#E4OD|E4OD]] 4-speed automatic transmission.  Today, the car is on display at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in College Station, Texas.  Since 1993, the Secret Service has used limousines derived from Cadillac vehicles as a presidential state car.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:1939 Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Sunshine Special (31609480232).jpg|\"[[Sunshine Special (automobile)|Sunshine Special]]\", 1939 Lincoln Model K convertible/Brunn body\nFile:Inaugural Parade.

Previously, it was known as the '''I Liga''' or '''Ekstraklasa''' from 1926\u20131999, and the '''Polska Liga Hokejowa''' from 1999\u20132013. In 2013, it was reorganized as a [[Limited liability company#Poland|limited liability company]] and renamed the '''[[Polska Hokej Liga]]'''.\n\n== History ==\nThe championship started in 1925-26. At first it was a non-league system composed of regional tournaments. The tournaments had two stages. The best teams qualified to the final tournament, of which the winner was declared champion. In 1938, the Polish Ice Hockey Federation decided to reorganise the championship, by creating a league system. Those plans were abandoned due to outbreak of [[World War II]].\n\nThe current structure of the league began in 1955.\n\nThe 2019-20 season was suspended on March 11th, 2020 due to health concerns with the spreading coronavirus. GKS Tychy was named league champions and will represent the league in the Champions Hockey League, Re-Plast Unia O\u015bwi\u0119cim was named the runner ups and earned a spot in the Continental Cup, third-place was shared by JKH GKS Jastrz\u0119bie and GKS Katowice \n\n== Medalists ==\n{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 style=\"border: 1px gray solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:

Previously, it was known as the '''I Liga''' or '''Ekstraklasa''' from 1926\u20131999, and the '''Polska Liga Hokejowa''' from 1999\u20132013. In 2013, it was reorganized as a [[Limited liability company#Poland|limited liability company]] and renamed the '''[[Polska Hokej Liga]]'''.\n\n== History ==\nThe championship started in 1925-26. At first it was a non-league system composed of regional tournaments. The tournaments had two stages. The best teams qualified to the final tournament, of which the winner was declared champion. In 1938, the Polish Ice Hockey Federation decided to reorganise the championship, by creating a league system. Those plans were abandoned due to outbreak of [[World War II]].\n\nThe current structure of the league began in 1955.\n\nThe 2019-20 season was suspended on March 11th, 2020 due to health concerns with the spreading coronavirus. GKS Tychy was named league champions and will represent the league in the Champions Hockey Leauge, Re-Plast Unia O\u015bwi\u0119cim was named the runner ups and earned a spot in the Continental Cup, third-place was shared by JKH GKS Jastrz\u0119bie and GKS Katowice \n\n== Medalists ==\n{| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 style=\"border: 1px gray solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:
