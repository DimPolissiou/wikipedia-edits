GALLERY CH. 8/CABLE 11 IN VANCOUVER]</ref> It acquired several programs from [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] upon that network's launch on October 1, 1961; it would eventually join the network formally in 1965.<ref>Gittins, Susan (1999).

Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7737-3125-3}}.</ref> \n\nThe station operated from a temporary studio housed at 1219 Richards Street in [[Downtown Vancouver]], until its full-time studio facility at 7850 Enterprise Street in Burnaby was opened in 1962<ref>[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/television/chan-dt]</ref> Soon after the station's launch, CHAN began installing relay transmitters across the province, and now reaches 96% of British Columbia. Through its over-the-air signal, CHAN also reaches an American audience in neighbouring [[Whatcom County, Washington]].\n\n[[Image:BCTV 1970s Logo.png|165px|thumb|left|BCTV's iconic original logo, used for more than 20 years from 1973\u20131994. The logo featured the [[pacific dogwood]] flower, the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial flower]] of British Columbia.<ref>[http://www3.telus.net/vanradiomuseum/bctv_dogwood.jpg]</ref>]]\nIn 1963, local entrepreneur [[Frank Griffiths]], owner of radio station [[CKNW]] (980 AM), purchased CHAN-TV from Vantel, along with nearby [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate [[CHEK-DT|CHEK-TV]] (channel 6) in the [[Vancouver Island]] city of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], from its original owner, David Armstrong. At that point, CHEK began airing a few CTV programs, usually scheduled at different times than when CHAN aired them. It would become a full-time CTV affiliate in January 1981, but maintained a shuffled schedule. Griffiths' Western Broadcasting Communications later sold a minority share of the station to [[Selkirk Communications]], before buying back full control in 1989.\n\nIn 1986, BCTV set up a fully functional broadcast studio [[Expo 86#Corporations and Non-Governmental Organizations|pavilion]] at the Vancouver [[Expo 86]], whose theme was transportation and communication. The BCTV pavilion allowed visitors to see, and participate, in every step of how a television station operates, as well as how newscasts and television shows were produced. The pavilion was also used by the station for coverage of the Expo, and by visiting journalists.<ref>http://bobbea.com/expo-86/bctv.html</ref><ref>http://www.bharch.ca/projects/cat/36/id/145</ref><ref>http://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2014/05/08/archie-goes-to-expo-86-the-full-comic-book-online-cc-sarahsaysstuff/</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WaUJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=expo+86+BCTV+pavilion#v=onepage&q=expo%2086%20BCTV%20pavilion&f=false | title=Vancouver's Expo '86| isbn=9781439642597| last1=Cotter| first1=Bill| date=2009-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 1971, CHAN unofficially began using the brand \"BCTV\".<ref>[http://www.bharch.ca/projects/cat/36/id/145]</ref><ref>[http://bobbea.com/expo-86/bctv.html]</ref> In 1973, BCTV became CHAN's official on-air branding, which remained in use until 2001, when it adopted the \"Global BC\" brand. The \"BCTV\" brand was retained for its local newscasts until February 2006. However, the \"BCTV\" brand became so firmly established in the province that many people still call the station by that name today.\n\n===Hostility to CTV===\nCHAN was CTV's third-largest affiliate, and by far the largest in [[Western Canada]]. As such, it was one of the backbones of the CTV network for many years and one of the network's most successful affiliates. However, it was always somewhat hostile toward CTV. Management believed that the network's flagship station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]] in [[Toronto]], had too much influence over the network. In particular, CHAN felt CFTO received favouritism in the production of CTV's Canadian programming in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n[[Image:BCTV 1990's Logo.svg|thumb|right|150px|CHAN's final \"BCTV\" logo. The stylized pacific dogwood was modernized in 1994 and was used until the affiliation switch on August 31, 2001.<ref>[http://hinto.tripod.com/newswatch/yvr-tv/station.html tv vancouver: station overview]</ref>]]\nNonetheless, until 1997, CHAN bought the provincial rights to several popular series from CFTO's parent company, [[Baton Broadcast System|Baton Broadcasting]]. However, tensions were exacerbated that year when Baton won a licence to operate a new television station in Vancouver, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]] (channel 32), and immediately moved much of CHAN's stronger programs there. Baton won controlling interest in CTV soon after channel 32's launch, and it became an open secret that CIVT would eventually replace CHAN as the CTV station for the Vancouver [[Media market|market]]. \n\nCHAN had signed a long-term contract with CTV several years earlier that would not expire until 1999, but was extended to 2001. However, outside of the 40 hours of programming per week that this allowed for, and CHAN's own local news programs, the station had to rely on lower-profile programming supplied by parent company Western International Communications. A small amount of [[CHUM Limited]]-produced programs also aired on CHAN at times during the period from 1997 to 2001, including ''[[CityLine]]''.\n\n===The affiliation shakeup of 2001===\n{{main|2001 Vancouver TV realignment}}\nOn June 6, 2000<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010125022000/http://vancouver.globaltv.com/bc/insidebctv/station/stories/station-20000928-171754.html]</ref> WIC's stations were purchased by [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications]], which owned the [[Global Television Network]]. As a result, CHAN was due to become the Global outlet for all of British Columbia. Although Global already owned a station in Vancouver, [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]] (channel 10), it opted to sell CKVU to CHUM Limited and move its affiliation to CHAN, evidently due to that station's significantly higher coverage and local news viewership. CHAN-TV's affiliation agreement with CTV expired on September 1, 2001, sparking a major shakeup in British Columbia television:\n*The CTV affiliation, jointly held by CHAN and sister station CHEK, moved to CIVT, which became a CTV O&O station that branded for a short time as \"BC CTV\" (later revised to \"CTV British Columbia\"). Both switches left CTV dependent on cable and satellite coverage to reach the rest of the province, as CTV has refused to set up rebroadcasters in the rest of the province. CHAN retained the rights to ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which was carried by CTV in all of its other O&O markets, until the talk show ended its run in [[2011 in American television|2011]].\n*The Global affiliation, held by CKVU, moved to CHAN, which became the network's new O&O under the \"Global BC\" brand. CKVU meanwhile adopted the \"ckvu13\" brand and briefly became an independent station carrying CHUM-supplied programming, some of which had aired the previous season on [[KVOS-TV]] (channel 12) in [[Bellingham, Washington]]. The station became a [[Citytv]] owned-and-operated station (the eventual [[television system]]-turned-network's first expansion outside of Toronto) several months later, after the sale to CHUM was approved.\n*Most of CHAN's former WIC-supplied programming, which migrated to Canwest's newly launched [[E! (Canadian TV system)|CH]] system, moved to CHEK (where other WIC programs already aired). The station was rebranded \"CH Vancouver Island\"; it was later renamed ''CHEK News'' in 2007 as part of CH's rebranding to E! and to simply \"CHEK\" in 2009 following the demise of the E! system.\n*Religious station [[CHNU-DT|CHNU]] (channel 10; later a [[Joytv]] station, now an independent station), launched two weeks later, and a CHUM-owned [[CTV Two|NewNet]] station in Victoria, [[CIVI-DT|CIVI]] (channel 53), launched just over two weeks after that.\n\n==Programming==\nFor the most part, CHAN does not deviate much from the Global schedule. Some programs carried on Global's daytime schedule in other markets \u2013 primarily library programs from Corus Entertainment's specialty channels \u2013 are not cleared on CHAN in order to make room for the station's various local news programs.\n\nIn February, the station broadcasts the annual [[Variety, the Children's Charity|Variety]] ''Show of Hearts'' [[telethon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abbynews.com/community/abbotsford-girl-to-appear-on-variety-show-of-hearts-telethon/|title=Abbotsford girl to appear on Variety Show of Hearts Telethon|last=Community|date=2019-02-07|website=Abbotsford News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n===Selected former non-network programs===\n* ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', aired weeknights at 12:37 a.m. from February 1994 to August 1995\n* ''280-JOCK'' followed ''News Hour Final'' at 12:05 a.m. until it was cancelled in late 1994, which pushed back ''Late Show'' to 12:37 a.m. for several months.\n* ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', aired weeknights at 12:07&nbsp;a.m. from August 1995 to August 2001\n*As [[CHUM Limited]] held the rights to this program throughout the rest of the country, when [[CIVI-DT|CIVI-TV]] launched in nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia]], the broadcast rights transferred over to that station.\n*''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' (1986\u20132011) aired at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. on CHAN because the station owned the provincial television rights to this show, dating back to its days as a CTV affiliate. In every other market in which CTV owned a station, that network owned the local rights to ''Oprah''.\n\n* ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' aired weekdays at 2:00 p.m. [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] from 1995 to 2001.\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:Global Vancouver News Hour (Vancouver 2010).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Global BC ''News Hour'' during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].]]\n[[File:Global BC van.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Global BC's microwave ENG vans.]]\nCHAN-DT presently broadcasts 47\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7\u00bd hours on weekdays and 5 hours on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among Global's television stations (either owned-and-operated or affiliated), as well as among all Canadian television stations (after the drastic reduction of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]'s [[CHCH-DT]] total weekly news programming due to budget cuts in December 2015). \n\nThe station's Burnaby studios also serve as the production facilities for Global's Vancouver-based English national evening newscast ''[[Global National]]'' and the [[Shaw Multicultural Channel]] [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] national evening newscast ''Global National Mandarin'' (2012\u20132016). Unlike most Global stations that carry midday newscasts, CHAN airs its noon newscast seven days a week. \n\nThe station's newscast schedule is very similar to that of an affiliate of the [[Big Three television networks]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]) in the United States, although as Global lacks a national morning news program, CHAN's weekday morning newscast runs a length similar to that of many [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and other news-producing non-Big Three U.S. stations.\n\nCHAN's news operation is well respected in the industry. Ever since the station first aired an hour-long newscast in the 1960s, a major part of the station's cash flow has gone into its news department, and it has garnered high ratings and major awards since then. The station's 6:00 p.m. ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|News Hour]]'' broadcast has been the highest-rated local [[newscast]] in the province for many years, as well as the most-watched in all of Canada.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Parsons+leave+Global+News+Hour+earlier+than+expected/2346590/story.html |title=Parsons to leave Global's News Hour earlier than expected \u2013 Vancouver Sun |access-date=2009-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220034105/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Parsons+leave+Global+News+Hour+earlier+than+expected/2346590/story.html |archive-date=2009-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n\nThe station's on-air news style was even used as an inspiration for [[Ted Turner]]'s [[CNN]], as both use the newsroom as a backdrop during the broadcast. The current newsroom was constructed in 1975; it was rebuilt in the early 1990s, moving the studio out of the newsroom, but keeping it as a backdrop, and was later remodeled in 2001 and 2006.\n\nStarting in the early 1990s, CHAN harboured ambitions of producing an early evening national newscast from its studios. In fact, several newscast pilots were produced at CHAN, suggesting the network was seriously considering such a move. However, that newscast never materialized; instead, CHAN began producing ''[[Canada Tonight]]'', which aired on most WIC-owned stations beginning in 1993. \n\nTwo versions were produced: one for British Columbia itself, hosted by CKNW radio commentator [[Bill Good]] (who later went to CTV's current Vancouver O&O station, CIVT-TV, and retired in December 2010) and a national version, hosted by [[Tony Parsons (Canadian journalist)|Tony Parsons]], who also anchored CHAN's nightly news program, the ''News Hour''. When Canwest purchased CHAN, the stories that were once sourced from CTV's other affiliates throughout the country were replaced by stories sourced from Global's affiliates.\n\nFrom 2001, when the station became \"Global BC\", the news department underwent a minor retitling as ''BCTV News on Global''. CHAN opted to keep the \"BCTV\" name for its newscasts, since that brand was still very well respected in the province; it also wanted to keep CIVT from using the name itself, as it contained the letters \"CTV.\" In addition, CHAN became the headquarters for Global's national news centre and the production facility for a new national newscast, ''Global National'' (which is currently anchored by former CTV and NBC correspondent [[Dawna Friesen]] on weeknights and on weekends by Robin Gill;<ref>http://globalnews.ca/bc/programme/weekend-news-hour-bc/personalities/{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> originally anchored beforehand by [[Kevin Newman (Canadian journalist)|Kevin Newman]]), thus fulfilling its longstanding dream of producing a national newscast. The program is broadcast live-to-tape from Vancouver at 5:30 p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone]]), airing locally prior to the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. ''News Hour'' broadcast.\n\nThe \"BCTV\" brand was finally discontinued when Global introduced its new logo and on-air identity on February 6, 2006; CHAN's newscasts were rebranded as ''Global News'' (with its overall branding changing to \"Global BC\") at this point. In 2006, Global struck an agreement with the Canadian Traffic Network to supply the station with a [[Robinson R44]] news [[helicopter]] with gyroscopic camera mounts. The helicopter is branded as \"Global 1\" \u2013 the same designation used for the news helicopters used by other Global stations \u2013 which is shared with CKNW, and is the second news helicopter in Vancouver (after that used by CIVT).{{Ref|http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.com%2Fvancouversun%2Fnews%2Fwestcoastnews%2Fstory.html%3Fid%3D0a1dbbb3-1adc-44ae-9985-6ee68b7ef9b1&ei=jcE8RfufN47-gwPeucmjBA&sig=__3JiUocgdd8Of27JWdbli78VCQPo=&sig2=Nji6pXM3skwBP5TNe95Pvg}}\n\nOn December 16, 2009, Tony Parsons anchored his final newscast at CHAN after 34 years as anchor of the ''News Hour''.<ref>[https://archive.is/20091217091630/http://www.vancouversun.com/Tony+Parsons+Global+News+part+ways/2344638/story.html Tony Parsons and Global News part ways \u2013 Vancouver Sun]</ref> It was expected that he would remain until after the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], but left much earlier than expected for unknown reasons.

Founded by Vantel Broadcasting, it originally operated as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]].<ref name=\"vrm\">[http://www3.telus.net/vanradiomuseum/BCTVGallery.html CHAN TV/BCTV/GLOBAL B.C. GALLERY CH. 8/CABLE 11 IN VANCOUVER]</ref> It acquired several programs from [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] upon that network's launch on October 1, 1961; it would eventually join the network formally in 1965.<ref>Gittins, Susan (1999). CTV: The Television Wars. Toronto: Stoddart Publishing Co. Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7737-3125-3}}.</ref> The station operated from a temporary studio housed at 1219 Richards Street in [[Downtown Vancouver]], until its full-time studio facility at 7850 Enterprise Street in Burnaby was opened in 1962<ref>[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/television/chan-dt]</ref> Soon after the station's launch, CHAN began installing relay transmitters across the province, and now reaches 96% of British Columbia. Through its over-the-air signal, CHAN also reaches an American audience in neighbouring [[Whatcom County, Washington]].\n\n[[Image:BCTV 1970s Logo.png|165px|thumb|left|BCTV's iconic original logo, used for more than 20 years from 1973\u20131994. The logo featured the [[pacific dogwood]] flower, the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial flower]] of British Columbia.<ref>[http://www3.telus.net/vanradiomuseum/bctv_dogwood.jpg]</ref>]]\nIn 1963, local entrepreneur [[Frank Griffiths]], owner of radio station [[CKNW]] (980 AM), purchased CHAN-TV from Vantel, along with nearby [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate [[CHEK-DT|CHEK-TV]] (channel 6) in the [[Vancouver Island]] city of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], from its original owner, David Armstrong. At that point, CHEK began airing a few CTV programs, usually scheduled at different times than when CHAN aired them. It would become a full-time CTV affiliate in January 1981, but maintained a shuffled schedule. Griffiths' Western Broadcasting Communications later sold a minority share of the station to [[Selkirk Communications]], before buying back full control in 1989.\n\nIn 1986, BCTV set up a fully functional broadcast studio [[Expo 86#Corporations and Non-Governmental Organizations|pavilion]] at the Vancouver [[Expo 86]], whose theme was transportation and communication. The BCTV pavilion allowed visitors to see, and participate, in every step of how a television station operates, as well as how newscasts and television shows were produced. The pavilion was also used by the station for coverage of the Expo, and by visiting journalists.<ref>http://bobbea.com/expo-86/bctv.html</ref><ref>http://www.bharch.ca/projects/cat/36/id/145</ref><ref>http://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2014/05/08/archie-goes-to-expo-86-the-full-comic-book-online-cc-sarahsaysstuff/</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=WaUJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=expo+86+BCTV+pavilion#v=onepage&q=expo%2086%20BCTV%20pavilion&f=false | title=Vancouver's Expo '86| isbn=9781439642597| last1=Cotter| first1=Bill| date=2009-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 1971, CHAN unofficially began using the brand \"BCTV\".<ref>[http://www.bharch.ca/projects/cat/36/id/145]</ref><ref>[http://bobbea.com/expo-86/bctv.html]</ref> In 1973, BCTV became CHAN's official on-air branding, which remained in use until 2001, when it adopted the \"Global BC\" brand. The \"BCTV\" brand was retained for its local newscasts until February 2006. However, the \"BCTV\" brand became so firmly established in the province that many people still call the station by that name today.\n\n===Hostility to CTV===\nCHAN was CTV's third-largest affiliate, and by far the largest in [[Western Canada]]. As such, it was one of the backbones of the CTV network for many years and one of the network's most successful affiliates. However, it was always somewhat hostile toward CTV. Management believed that the network's flagship station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]] in [[Toronto]], had too much influence over the network. In particular, CHAN felt CFTO received favouritism in the production of CTV's Canadian programming in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n[[Image:BCTV 1990's Logo.svg|thumb|right|150px|CHAN's final \"BCTV\" logo. The stylized pacific dogwood was modernized in 1994 and was used until the affiliation switch on August 31, 2001.<ref>[http://hinto.tripod.com/newswatch/yvr-tv/station.html tv vancouver: station overview]</ref>]]\nNonetheless, until 1997, CHAN bought the provincial rights to several popular series from CFTO's parent company, [[Baton Broadcast System|Baton Broadcasting]]. However, tensions were exacerbated that year when Baton won a licence to operate a new television station in Vancouver, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]] (channel 32), and immediately moved much of CHAN's stronger programs there. Baton won controlling interest in CTV soon after channel 32's launch, and it became an open secret that CIVT would eventually replace CHAN as the CTV station for the Vancouver [[Media market|market]]. CHAN had signed a long-term contract with CTV several years earlier that would not expire until 1999, but was extended to 2001. However, outside of the 40 hours of programming per week that this allowed for, and CHAN's own local news programs, the station had to rely on lower-profile programming supplied by parent company Western International Communications. A small amount of [[CHUM Limited]]-produced programs also aired on CHAN at times during the period from 1997 to 2001, including ''[[CityLine]]''.\n\n===The affiliation shakeup of 2001===\n{{main|2001 Vancouver TV realignment}}\nOn June 6, 2000<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010125022000/http://vancouver.globaltv.com/bc/insidebctv/station/stories/station-20000928-171754.html]</ref> WIC's stations were purchased by [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications]], which owned the [[Global Television Network]]. As a result, CHAN was due to become the Global outlet for all of British Columbia. Although Global already owned a station in Vancouver, [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]] (channel 10), it opted to sell CKVU to CHUM Limited and move its affiliation to CHAN, evidently due to that station's significantly higher coverage and local news viewership. CHAN-TV's affiliation agreement with CTV expired on September 1, 2001, sparking a major shakeup in British Columbia television:\n*The CTV affiliation, jointly held by CHAN and sister station CHEK, moved to CIVT, which became a CTV O&O station that branded for a short time as \"BC CTV\" (later revised to \"CTV British Columbia\"). Both switches left CTV dependent on cable and satellite coverage to reach the rest of the province, as CTV has refused to set up rebroadcasters in the rest of the province. CHAN retained the rights to ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which was carried by CTV in all of its other O&O markets, until the talk show ended its run in [[2011 in American television|2011]].\n*The Global affiliation, held by CKVU, moved to CHAN, which became the network's new O&O under the \"Global BC\" brand. CKVU meanwhile adopted the \"ckvu13\" brand and briefly became an independent station carrying CHUM-supplied programming, some of which had aired the previous season on [[KVOS-TV]] (channel 12) in [[Bellingham, Washington]]. The station became a [[Citytv]] owned-and-operated station (the eventual [[television system]]-turned-network's first expansion outside of Toronto) several months later, after the sale to CHUM was approved.\n*Most of CHAN's former WIC-supplied programming, which migrated to Canwest's newly launched [[E!

The station was rebranded \"CH Vancouver Island\"; it was later renamed ''CHEK News'' in 2007 as part of CH's rebranding to E! and to simply \"CHEK\" in 2009 following the demise of the E! system.\n*Religious station [[CHNU-DT|CHNU]] (channel 10; later a [[Joytv]] station, now an independent station), launched two weeks later, and a CHUM-owned [[CTV Two|NewNet]] station in Victoria, [[CIVI-DT|CIVI]] (channel 53), launched just over two weeks after that.\n\n==Programming==\nFor the most part, CHAN does not deviate much from the Global schedule. Some programs carried on Global's daytime schedule in other markets \u2013 primarily library programs from Corus Entertainment's specialty channels \u2013 are not cleared on CHAN in order to make room for the station's various local news programs.\n\nIn February, the station broadcasts the annual [[Variety, the Children's Charity|Variety]] ''Show of Hearts'' [[telethon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abbynews.com/community/abbotsford-girl-to-appear-on-variety-show-of-hearts-telethon/|title=Abbotsford girl to appear on Variety Show of Hearts Telethon|last=Community|date=2019-02-07|website=Abbotsford News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n===Selected former non-network programs===\n* ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', aired weeknights at 12:37 a.m. from February 1994 to August 1995\n* ''280-JOCK'' followed ''News Hour Final'' at 12:05 a.m. until it was cancelled in late 1994, which pushed back ''Late Show'' to 12:37 a.m. for several months.\n* ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', aired weeknights at 12:07&nbsp;a.m. from August 1995 to August 2001\n:As [[CHUM Limited]] held the rights to this program throughout the rest of the country, when [[CIVI-DT|CIVI-TV]] launched in nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia]], the broadcast rights transferred over to that station.\n* ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' (1986\u20132011) aired at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. on CHAN because the station owned the provincial television rights to this show, dating back to its days as a CTV affiliate. In every other market in which CTV owned a station, that network owned the local rights to ''Oprah''.\n* ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' aired weekdays at 2:00 p.m. [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] from 1995 to 2001.\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:Global Vancouver News Hour (Vancouver 2010).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Global BC ''News Hour'' during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].]]\n[[File:Global BC van.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Global BC's microwave ENG vans.]]\nCHAN-DT presently broadcasts 47\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7\u00bd hours on weekdays and 5 hours on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among Global's television stations (either owned-and-operated or affiliated), as well as among all Canadian television stations (after the drastic reduction of [[Hamilton, Ontario]]'s [[CHCH-DT]] total weekly news programming due to budget cuts in December 2015). The station's Burnaby studios also serve as the production facilities for Global's Vancouver-based English national evening newscast ''[[Global National]]'' and the [[Shaw Multicultural Channel]] [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] national evening newscast ''Global National Mandarin'' (2012\u20132016). Unlike most Global stations that carry midday newscasts, CHAN airs its noon newscast seven days a week. The station's newscast schedule is very similar to that of an affiliate of the [[Big Three television networks]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]) in the United States, although as Global lacks a national morning news program, CHAN's weekday morning newscast runs a length similar to that of many [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and other news-producing non-Big Three U.S. stations.\n\nCHAN's news operation is well respected in the industry. Ever since the station first aired an hour-long newscast in the 1960s, a major part of the station's cash flow has gone into its news department, and it has garnered high ratings and major awards since then. The station's 6:00 p.m. ''[[News Hour (Canadian news program)|News Hour]]'' broadcast has been the highest-rated local [[newscast]] in the province for many years, as well as the most-watched in all of Canada.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Parsons+leave+Global+News+Hour+earlier+than+expected/2346590/story.html |title=Parsons to leave Global's News Hour earlier than expected \u2013 Vancouver Sun |access-date=2009-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220034105/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Parsons+leave+Global+News+Hour+earlier+than+expected/2346590/story.html |archive-date=2009-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The station's on-air news style was even used as an inspiration for [[Ted Turner]]'s [[CNN]], as both use the newsroom as a backdrop during the broadcast. The current newsroom was constructed in 1975; it was rebuilt in the early 1990s, moving the studio out of the newsroom, but keeping it as a backdrop, and was later remodeled in 2001 and 2006.\n\nStarting in the early 1990s, CHAN harboured ambitions of producing an early evening national newscast from its studios. In fact, several newscast pilots were produced at CHAN, suggesting the network was seriously considering such a move. However, that newscast never materialized; instead, CHAN began producing ''[[Canada Tonight]]'', which aired on most WIC-owned stations beginning in 1993. Two versions were produced: one for British Columbia itself, hosted by CKNW radio commentator [[Bill Good]] (who later went to CTV's current Vancouver O&O station, CIVT-TV, and retired in December 2010) and a national version, hosted by [[Tony Parsons (Canadian journalist)|Tony Parsons]], who also anchored CHAN's nightly news program, the ''News Hour''. When Canwest purchased CHAN, the stories that were once sourced from CTV's other affiliates throughout the country were replaced by stories sourced from Global's affiliates.\n\nFrom 2001, when the station became \"Global BC\", the news department underwent a minor retitling as ''BCTV News on Global''. CHAN opted to keep the \"BCTV\" name for its newscasts, since that brand was still very well respected in the province; it also wanted to keep CIVT from using the name itself, as it contained the letters \"CTV.\" In addition, CHAN became the headquarters for Global's national news centre and the production facility for a new national newscast, ''Global National'' (which is currently anchored by former CTV and NBC correspondent [[Dawna Friesen]] on weeknights and on weekends by Robin Gill;<ref>http://globalnews.ca/bc/programme/weekend-news-hour-bc/personalities/{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> originally anchored beforehand by [[Kevin Newman (Canadian journalist)|Kevin Newman]]), thus fulfilling its longstanding dream of producing a national newscast. The program is broadcast live-to-tape from Vancouver at 5:30 p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone]]), airing locally prior to the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. ''News Hour'' broadcast.\n\nThe \"BCTV\" brand was finally discontinued when Global introduced its new logo and on-air identity on February 6, 2006; CHAN's newscasts were rebranded as ''Global News'' (with its overall branding changing to \"Global BC\") at this point. In 2006, Global struck an agreement with the Canadian Traffic Network to supply the station with a [[Robinson R44]] news [[helicopter]] with gyroscopic camera mounts. The helicopter is branded as \"Global 1\" \u2013 the same designation used for the news helicopters used by other Global stations \u2013 which is shared with CKNW, and is the second news helicopter in Vancouver (after that used by CIVT).{{Ref|http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.com%2Fvancouversun%2Fnews%2Fwestcoastnews%2Fstory.html%3Fid%3D0a1dbbb3-1adc-44ae-9985-6ee68b7ef9b1&ei=jcE8RfufN47-gwPeucmjBA&sig=__3JiUocgdd8Of27JWdbli78VCQPo=&sig2=Nji6pXM3skwBP5TNe95Pvg}}\n\nOn December 16, 2009, Tony Parsons anchored his final newscast at CHAN after 34 years as anchor of the ''News Hour''.<ref>[https://archive.is/20091217091630/http://www.vancouversun.com/Tony+Parsons+Global+News+part+ways/2344638/story.html Tony Parsons and Global News part ways \u2013 Vancouver Sun]</ref> It was expected that he would remain until after the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], but left much earlier than expected for unknown reasons.
