More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for [[food]], their [[fur]] or even their [[tusks]]; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as [[zoosadism]]. With approximately 65 billion animals killed annually for food, farm animals are the most numerous animals subjected to cruelty.<ref name=\"linzey\">{{cite book |last1=Linzey |first1=Andrew |last2=Linzey |first2=Clair |title=The Palgrave handbook of practical animal ethics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-36670-2 |page=445|date=12 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDivergent approaches to [[Animal rights by country or territory|laws concerning animal cruelty]] occur in different jurisdictions throughout the world. For example, some laws govern methods of killing animals for food, clothing, or other products, and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment, education, research, or pets. There are a number of conceptual approaches to the issue of cruelty to animals.\n\nSome think that the [[animal welfare]] position holds that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for human purposes, such as food, clothing, entertainment, fun and research, but that it should be done in a way that minimizes unnecessary [[Pain in animals|pain]] and suffering, sometimes referred to as \"humane\" treatment.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Others have argued that the definition of 'unnecessary' varies widely and could include virtually all current use of animals.\n\n[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] advocates argue from the position of [[costs and benefits]] and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals. Some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach which is closer to the animal welfare position, whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights. [[Animal rights]] theorists criticize these positions, arguing that the words \"unnecessary\" and \"humane\" are subject to widely differing interpretations, and that animals have basic rights. They say that most animal use itself is unnecessary and a cause of suffering, so the only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never used as a substance or as a non-living thing.\n\n== Definition and viewpoints ==\n{{Main|Animal welfare|Animal rights}}{{World laws pertaining to animal sentience}}[[File:Leashed pitbull, lunging.jpg|thumb|upright|Man beating a chained [[pitbull terrier]] with a strap.

Darwin believed that not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental and moral lives too.

Passive cruelty is typified by cases of neglect, in which the cruelty is a lack of action rather than the action itself. Oftentimes passive animal cruelty is accidental, born of ignorance. In many cases of neglect in which an investigator believes that the cruelty occurred out of ignorance, the investigator may attempt to educate the pet owner, then revisit the situation. In more severe cases, exigent circumstances may require that the animal be removed for veterinary care.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty.php |title=Pet-Abuse.Com \u2013 Animal Cruelty |publisher=Pet-abuse.com |accessdate=6 November 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211105757/http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty.php |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Industrial animal farming===\n{{Main|Intensive animal farming}}\n[[File:Killing - Harling Farm.webm|thumb|Footage of a 'Quality Assured' pig farm in England]]\n[[File:East Anglian Pig Co.

During this festival, balls of pitch are attached to a bull's horns and set on fire. The bull is then released into the streets and can do nothing but run around in pain, often smashing into walls in an attempt to douse the fire. These fiery balls can burn for hours, and they burn the bull's horns, body, and eyes \u2013 all while spectators cheer and run around the victim.

More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for [[food]], their [[fur]] or even their [[tusks]]; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as [[zoosadism]]. With approximately 65 billion animals killed annually for food, farm animals are the most numerous animals subjected to cruelty.<ref name=\"linzey\">{{cite book |last1=Linzey |first1=Andrew |last2=Linzey |first2=Clair |title=The Palgrave handbook of practical animal ethics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-36670-2 |page=445|date=12 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDivergent approaches to [[Animal rights by country or territory|laws concerning animal cruelty]] occur in different jurisdictions throughout the world. For example, some laws govern methods of killing animals for food, clothing, or other products, and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment, education, research, or pets. There are a number of conceptual approaches to the issue of cruelty to animals.\n\nSome think that the [[animal welfare]] position holds that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for human purposes, such as food, clothing, entertainment, fun and research, but that it should be done in a way that minimizes unnecessary [[Pain in animals|pain]] and suffering, sometimes referred to as \"humane\" treatment.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Others have argued that the definition of 'unnecessary' varies widely and could include virtually all current use of animals.\n\n[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] advocates argue from the position of [[costs and benefits]] and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals. Some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach which is closer to the animal welfare position, whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights. [[Animal rights]] theorists criticize these positions, arguing that the words \"unnecessary\" and \"humane\" are subject to widely differing interpretations, and that animals have basic rights. They say that most animal use itself is unnecessary and a cause of suffering, so the only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never used as a substance or as a non-living thing.\n\n== Definition and viewpoints ==\n{{Main|Animal welfare|Animal rights}}{{World laws pertaining to animal sentience}}[[File:Leashed pitbull, lunging.jpg|thumb|upright|Man beating a chained [[pitbull terrier]] with a strap.

Passive cruelty is typified by cases of neglect, in which the cruelty is a lack of action rather than the action itself. Oftentimes passive animal cruelty is accidental, born of ignorance. In many cases of neglect in which an investigator believes that the cruelty occurred out of ignorance, the investigator may attempt to educate the pet owner, then revisit the situation.

Provisions in the code discouraged \"apparent cruelty to children and animals\", and because the Hays Office had the power to enforce this clause, the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) often had access to sets to assess adherence to it. However, because the American Humane Association's Hollywood office depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor sets, the closure of the Hays Office in 1966 corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/73437045|title=27 Jun 1982, Page 14 - The Pantagraph at Newspapers.com|access-date=20 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827090907/http://www.newspapers.com/image/73437045/|archivedate=27 August 2016}}<sup>[subscription required]</sup></ref>\n\nIn addition, other animal welfare organizations worldwide, have also monitored the use of animals in film.\n\nBy 1977, a three-year contract was in place between the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] which specified that the [[American Humane Association]] should be \"consulted in the use of animals 'when appropriate'\", but the contract did not provide a structure for what \"appropriate\" meant, and had no enforcement powers.

Cimino allegedly killed chickens and bled horses from the neck to gather samples of their blood to smear on actors for ''Heaven's Gate'', and also allegedly had a horse blown up with [[dynamite]] while shooting a battle sequence, the shot of which made it into the film.

He is responsible for the overall military defense concept of the Bundeswehr, including the overall planning, preparation, as well as assessment of the whole Bundeswehr operations. <ref>https://www.bmvg.de/en/organisation/the-chief-of-defence</ref>\n\nSubordinate to the Inspector General are the commanders of the branches of the Bundeswehr, the [[Inspector of the Army]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], and [[Inspector of the Navy]], and the commanders of the [[Joint Support Service (Germany)|Joint Support Service]] and [[Joint Medical Service (Germany)|Joint Medical Service]].\n\n== Title and translations ==\nWhile official translations of the position is \"Chief of Defence\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chief of Defence|url=https://www.bmvg.de/en/organisation/the-chief-of-defence|website=bmvg.de|publisher=The German Government|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref> the German term \"''Generalinspekteur''\" \u2013 \"Inspector General\" \u2013 was specifically created to avoid the term of \"''Generalstabschef''\" (\"Chief of [[German General Staff|General Staff]]\") deemed historically compromised.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} When the Bundeswehr was created in 1955, many traditional military terms were considered inappropriate after the German [[Wehrmacht]]'s conduct in [[World War II]].

officially translated as '''Chief of Defence''', is the highest-ranking military post held by a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Bundeswehr]], the present-day armed forces of [[Germany]].\n\nAll Inspectors General have been of the rank of a ([[four-star rank|four-star]]) [[general]] or [[admiral]], and they head the ''F\u00fchrungsstab der Streitkr\u00e4fte'', the German Defence Staff within the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Defence]], and is the direct military advisor to the [[Federal Minister of Defence (Germany)|Federal Minister of Defence]] who is the peacetime [[Commander in chief#Germany|holder of the supreme command authority]] ({{lang-de|Inhaber der Befehls- und Kommandogewalt}}). He is responsible for the overall military defense concept of the Bundeswehr, including the overall planning, preparation, as well as assessment of the whole Bundeswehr operations. <ref>https://www.bmvg.de/en/organisation/the-chief-of-defence</ref>\n\nSubordinate to the Inspector General are the commanders of the branches of the Bundeswehr, the [[Inspector of the Army]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], and [[Inspector of the Navy]], and the commanders of the [[Joint Support Service (Germany)|Joint Support Service]] and [[Joint Medical Service (Germany)|Joint Medical Service]].\n\n== Title and translations ==\nWhile official translations of the position is \"Chief of Defence\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chief of Defence|url=https://www.bmvg.de/en/organisation/the-chief-of-defence|website=bmvg.de|publisher=The German Government|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref> the German term \"''Generalinspekteur''\" \u2013 \"Inspector General\" \u2013 was specifically created to avoid the term of \"''Generalstabschef''\" (\"Chief of [[German General Staff|General Staff]]\") deemed historically compromised.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} When the Bundeswehr was created in 1955, many traditional military terms were considered inappropriate after the German [[Wehrmacht]]'s conduct in [[World War II]]. Therefore, Federal German Bundeswehr has no \"General Staff\", but the \"[[Army Command (Germany)|Army Command]]\" (\"''Kommando Heer''\").\n\n== List of officeholders ==\n{{Officeholder table
