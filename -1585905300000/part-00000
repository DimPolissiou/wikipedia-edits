The role of operating the rail network was subsequently separated from that of the network's construction. From 1895 to 1993 there was a responsible Minister, the [[Minister of Railways (New Zealand)|Minister of Railways]]. He was often also the Minister of Public Works.\n\nApart from two experiments with independent boards, NZR remained under direct ministerial control for most of its history.<ref name=\"kiwirail_history\">{{cite web|url=https://www.kiwirail.co.nz/about-us/history-of-kiwirail/150yearsofrail/stories/railway-administration.html|title=Railway administration has reflected public expectation of rail's social and economic role|publisher=[[KiwiRail]]|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nOriginally, New Zealand's railways were constructed by [[Provinces of New Zealand|provincial governments]] and private firms. The largest provincial operation was the [[Canterbury Provincial Railways]], which opened the first public railway at [[Ferrymead Railway|Ferrymead]] on 1 December 1863. During [[The Vogel Era]] of the late 1860s to the 1870s, railway construction by central government expanded greatly, from just {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} in 1869 to {{convert|1200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} in 1880.\n\nFollowing the abolition of the provinces in 1877, the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]] took over the various provincial railways. However, since the Public Works Department was charged with constructing new railway lines (among other public works) the day to day railway operations were transferred into a new government department on the recommendation of a parliamentary select committee.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=15}} At the time {{convert|1136|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} of railway lines were open for traffic, {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the North Island and {{convert|797|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the [[South Island]], mainly consisting of the {{convert|390|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Main South Line]] from the port of Lyttelton to Bluff.<ref name=\"Te Ara Birth of a National Railway System\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/railways/3|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|year=1966|title=Birth of a National Railway System}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation and early years ===\n[[File:Railway HQ Wellington.jpg|thumb|New Zealand Railways Department Head Office, Wellington, photographed circa 1905\u20131908 by J N Taylor.]]\nThe Railways Department was formed in 1880 during the premiership of Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]]. That year, the private [[Port Chalmers Branch|Port Chalmers Railway Company Limited]] was acquired by the department and new workshops at [[Addington Railway Workshops|Addington]] opened. Ironically, the first few years of NZR were marked by the [[Long Depression]], which led to great financial constraint on the department.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=21}} As a result, the central government passed legislation to allow for the construction of more private railways. A Royal Commission, ordered by Hall, had removed plans for a railway line on the west coast of the North Island from Foxton to Wellington. Instead, in August 1881 the Railways Construction and Land Act was passed, allowing joint-stock companies to build and run private railways, as long as they were built to the government's standard [[rail gauge]] of {{RailGauge|1067mm}} and connected with the government railway lines. The Act had the effect of authorising the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] to build the [[Wellington-Manawatu Line]].{{sfn|Cassels|1994|p=2}}\n\nIn 1877 the first American locomotives were purchased; the [[NZR K class (1877)]] from [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works|Rogers]], followed by the [[NZR T class]] of 1879 from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]].\n\nThe most important construction project for NZR at this time was the central section of the [[North Island Main Trunk]]. Starting from [[Te Awamutu]] on 15 April 1885, the section\u2014including the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]]\u2014was not completed for another 23 years.{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=26}}\n\nThe economy gradually improved and in 1895 the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] of Premier [[Richard Seddon]] appointed [[Alfred Cadman]] as the first [[Minister of Railways (New Zealand)|Minister of Railways]]. The Minister appointed a General Manager for the railways, keeping the operation under tight political control.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=171}} Apart from four periods of government-appointed commissions (1889\u20131894, 1924\u20131928, 1931\u20131936 and 1953\u20131957), this system remained in place until the department was corporatised in 1982.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=171}} In 1895, patronage had reached 3.9M passengers per annum and 2.048M tonnes.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=45}}\n\nNZR produced its first New Zealand-built steam locomotive in 1889; the [[NZR W class|W class]] built in the [[Addington Railway Workshops]].\n\nAlong with opening new lines, NZR began acquiring a number of the private railways which had built railway lines around the country. It acquired the [[Waimea Plains Railway|Waimea Plains Railway Company]] in 1886. At the same time, a protracted legal battle began with the [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company]], which was only resolved in 1898. The partially completed [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland line]] was not handed over to NZR until 1900.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=44}} By that time, {{convert|2000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of railway lines were open for traffic.<ref name=\"Te Ara Birth of a National Railway System\" /> The acquisition in 1908 of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company and its railway line marked the completion of the North Island Main Trunk from Wellington to Auckland. A new locomotive class, the [[NZR X class|X class]], was introduced in 1909 for traffic on the line. The X class was the most powerful locomotive at the time. Gold rushes led to the construction of the [[Thames Branch]], opening in 1898.\n\nIn 1906 the [[Dunedin railway station]] was completed, architect [[George Troup (architect)|George Troup]]. [[A. L. Beattie]] became Chief Mechanical Officer in April 1900. Beattie designed the famous [[NZR A class (1906)|A class]], the [[NZR Q class|Q class]] (the first \"Pacific\" type locomotive in the world), and many other locomotive classes.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=43}}\n\nNZR's first bus operation began on 1 October 1907, between [[Culverden]] on the [[Waiau Branch]] and [[Waiau, Canterbury|Waiau]] Ferry in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]. By the 1920s NZR was noticing a considerable downturn in rail passenger traffic on many lines due to increasing ownership of private cars, and from 1923 it began to co-ordinate rail passenger services with private bus services. The [[New Zealand Railways Road Services]] branch was formed to operate bus services.\n\nBy 1912, patronage had reached 13.4M passengers per annum (a 242% increase since 1895) and 5.9M tonnes of freight (a 188% increase since 1895).{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=45}}\n\n=== World War I ===\n[[File:NZR Ab Class 778 hauling the Kingston Flyer.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ab class were introduced in 1915. Over 141 of these locomotives were introduced, from three different builders. Here preserved Ab 778 hauls the [[Kingston Flyer]].]]\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 had a significant impact on the Railways Department. That year the [[NZR Aa class|Aa class]] appeared, and the following year the first [[NZR AB class|AB class]] locomotives were introduced. This class went on to become the most numerous locomotive class in New Zealand history, with several examples surviving into preservation.\n\nThe war itself led to a decline in passenger, freight and train miles run but also led to an increase in profitability. In the 1917 Annual Report, a record 5.3% return on investment was made.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=51}} The war did take its toll on railway services, with dining cars being removed from passenger trains in 1917, replaced by less labour-intensive refreshment rooms at railway stations along the way. As a result, the \"scramble for pie and tea at [[Taihape]]\" became a part of New Zealand folklore.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=51}}\n\nNon-essential rail services were curtailed as more staff took part in the war effort, and railway workshops were converted for producing military equipment, on top of their existing maintenance and construction work.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=51}} The war soon affected the supply of coal to the railways. Although hostilities ended in 1918, the coal shortage carried on into 1919 as first miners strikes and then an influenza epidemic cut supplies. As a result, non-essential services remained in effect until the end of 1919. Shortages of spare parts and materials led to severe inflation, and repairs on locomotives being deferred. Similar coal-saving timetable cuts occurred at the end of the next war in 1945 and 1946.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NA19450212.2.68|title=North Island Rail Services To Be Cut NORTHERN ADVOCATE|date=12 Feb 1945|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19451214.2.73|title=SOUTH ISLAND MAIN TRUNK, PRESS|date=14 Dec 1945|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Increasing competition and great depression ===\n[[File:Joseph Gordon Coates, 1931.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gordon Coates]] became Minister of Railways in 1923.

However, this scheme was shut down in 1929 as it was considered improper for a government department to compete with private builders.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=52}}\n\nThe [[Otira Tunnel]] was completed in 1923, heralding the completion of the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. The tunnel included the first section of [[railway electrification]] in New Zealand and its first electric locomotives, the [[NZR EO class (1923)|original EO class]]. The section was electrified at 1,500&nbsp;V DC, due to the steep grade in the tunnel, and included its own hydro-electric power station.{{sfn|Scott|p=54}} The second section to be electrified by the department was the [[Lyttelton Line]] in Christchurch, completed in 1929, at the same voltage and current. This again saw English Electric supply locomotives, the [[NZR EC class|EC class]].\n\nIn the same year, [[Gordon Coates]] became the Minister of Railways. Coates was an ambitious politician who had an almost \"religious zeal\" for his portfolio. During the summer of 1923, he spent the entire parliamentary recess inspecting the department's operations. The following year, he put forward a \"Programme of Improvements and New Works'\".{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=55}}\n\nCoates scheme proposed spending \u00a38 million over 8 years. This was later expanded to \u00a310 million over 10 years. The programme included:\n\n* The Auckland\u2013Westfield deviation of the [[North Island Main Trunk]];\n* New marshalling yards at Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch;\n* The Milson Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk through [[Palmerston North]];\n* The [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] under the [[Rimutaka Ranges]] in Wellington;\n* The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] of the North Island Main Trunk out of Wellington;\n* Electric lighting;\n* New locomotive facilities and\n* New signalling systems.\n\nAn independent commission, led by Sir [[Sam Fay]] and Sir [[Vincent Raven]] produced a report known as the \"Fay Raven Report\"{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=151}} which gave qualified approval to Coates' programme. The reports only significant change was the proposal of a [[Cook Strait]] train ferry service between Wellington and Picton, to link the two systems up.{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=152}} Coates went on to become Prime Minister in 1925, an office he held until 1928 when he was defeated at the [[1928 New Zealand general election|general election of that year]]. While the Westfield and Tawa Flat deviations proceeded, the Milson deviation and Rimutaka Tunnel projects remained stalled. The onset of the [[Great Depression]] from late 1929 saw these projects scaled back or abandoned. The Westfield deviation was completed in 1930 and the Tawa deviation proceeded at a snail's pace. A number of new lines under construction were casualties, including the [[Taupo railway proposals|Rotorua-Taupo]] line, approved in July 1928 but abandoned almost a year later due to the depression.{{sfn|Scott|p=57}} An exception was the [[Stratford\u2013Okahukura Line]], finished in 1933.{{sfn|Churchman|Hurst|1991|p=30}}\n\nHowever, there was criticism that maintenance was being neglected. In the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberals]] last year of office in 1912, {{convert|140|mi}} of line had been relaid, but that was reduced to 118 in 1913, 104 in 1914, 81 in 1924 and 68 in 1925, during the [[Reform Government of New Zealand|Reform Government]]'s years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250827.2.148|title=RAILWAY POLICY.

Three of the locomotives were introduced for operation on the North Island Main Trunk. They were not well suited to New Zealand conditions: they had overly complex [[valve gear]], were too hot for crews manning them and too powerful for the wagons they were hauling.{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=157}} The failure of this class lead to the introduction of the [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] in 1932.\n\n=== Government Railways Board ===\nTough economic conditions and increasing competition from road transport led to calls for regulation of the land transport sector. In 1931 it was claimed half a million tons of freight had been lost to road transport.{{sfn|Scott|p=56}} That year, the department carried 7.2 million passengers per year, down from 14.2 million in 1923.{{sfn|Scott|p=57}} In 1930 a Royal Commission on Railways recommended that land transport should be \"co-ordinated\" and the following year parliament passed the [[Transport Licensing Act 1931]]. The Act regulated the carriage of goods and entrenched the monopoly the department had on land transport. It set a minimum distance road transport operators could transport goods at {{convert|30|mi}} before they had to be licensed. The Act was repealed in 1982.{{sfn|Scott|p=62}}\n\nAlongside these changes, in 1931 the Railways Department was briefly restructured into the Government Railways Board. Another Act of Parliament, the Government Railways Amendment Act 1931 was passed.<ref name=\"govtrailwaysborad\">{{cite web|url=https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&d=AJHR1931-I-II.2.2.2.3&e=-------10--1------0--|title=Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives, Report of the Government Railways Board|publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]]|accessdate=10 February 2019|date=9 September 1931}}</ref> The Railways Board was independent of the Government of the day and answered to the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].<ref name=\"kiwirail_history\" /> During this period the Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]] was also Minister of Railways, and Minister of Finance was former Minister of Railways [[Gordon Coates]]. The Railways Board was abolished by the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] in 1936.<ref name=\"kiwirail_history\" />\n\nIn 1933 plans for a new railway station and head office in Wellington were approved, along with the electrification of the [[Johnsonville Line]] (then still part of the North Island Main Trunk). The [[Wellington railway station]] and Tawa flat deviation were both completed in 1937.{{sfn|Churchman|Hurst|1991|p=31}} As part of attempts by NZR to win back passengers from private motor vehicles, the same year the first [[NZR 56-foot carriage|56-foot carriage]]s were introduced.\n\n[[Garnet Hercules Mackley]] was appointed General Manager in 1933, and worked hard to improve the standard and range of services provided by the Department. This included a number of steps to make passenger trains faster, more efficient and cheaper to run. In the early 20th century, NZR had begun investigating railcar technology to provide passenger services on regional routes and rural branch lines where carriage trains were not economic and [[mixed train|\"mixed\" trains]] (passenger carriages attached to freight trains) were undesirably slow. However, due to New Zealand's rugged terrain overseas technology could not simply be directly introduced. A number of experimental railcars and railbuses were developed. From 1925 these included the [[NZR RM class (Leyland petrol)|Leyland experimental petrol railcar]] and a fleet of [[NZR RM class (Model T Ford)|Model T Ford railbus]]es, the [[NZR RM class (Sentinel-Cammell)|Sentinel-Cammell steam railcar]] and from 1926 the [[NZR RM class (Clayton)|Clayton steam railcar]] and successful [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|Edison battery-electric railcar]]. 10 years later in 1936 the [[NZR RM class (Leyland diesel)|Leyland diesel railbus]] was introduced, but the first truly successful railcar class to enter service began operating that year, the [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa railcar]] specially designed to operate over the [[Rimutaka Incline]]. This class followed the building of the Red Terror (an inspection car on a Leyland Cub chassis) for the General Manager in 1933. More classes followed over the years, primarily to operate regional services.\n\nFollowing the success of the Wairarapa railcar class, in 1938 the [[NZR RM class (Standard)|Standard class railcars]] were introduced. A further improvement to passenger transport came in July that year, with electric services on the Johnsonville Line starting with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DM class electric multiple unit|DM/D]] [[English Electric]] [[Electric Multiple Unit|Multiple Unit]]s.<ref name=\"electricifcation_start\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/electric-trains-come-wellington|date=20 December 2012|title=Electric trains come to Wellington|publisher=New Zealand History online}}</ref>\n\nThree new locomotive classes appeared in 1939: the [[NZR KA class|K<sup>A</sup> class]], [[NZR KB class|K<sup>B</sup> class]] and the [[NZR J class (1939)|J class]]. The K<sup>A</sup> was a further development of the K class, while the J class was primarily for lighter trackage in the South Island. The numerically smaller K<sup>B</sup> class were allocated to the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland line]], where they dominated traffic. This led to the coining of the phrase \"KB country\" to describe the area, made famous by the [[National Film Unit]]'s documentary of the same title.\n\n=== World War II and its aftermath ===\n[[File:JA1271 Opapa 16Feb2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[NZR JA class|J<sup>A</sup>]] class were introduced in 1946, and were the last steam locomotives built by NZR.]]\nAs with the first world war, the [[Second World War]] had a significant impact on railways. The war created major labour shortages across the economy generally, and while considered \"essential industry\", railways were no exception. A large number of NZR employees signed up to fight in the war. For the first time, the Department employed significant numbers of women to meet the shortages. The war created serious coal shortages as imported coal was no longer available. Despite this, NZR had record revenues in 1940.\n\nDespite the war and associated labour and material shortages, new railway construction continued. In 1942 the [[Palmerston North\u2013Gisborne Line|Gisborne Line]] was finally opened, followed by the [[Main North Line, New Zealand|Main North Line]] between Picton and Christchurch being completed in 1945. The final section of the then ECMT, the [[Taneatua Branch]], was also completed. [[Centralized traffic control|Centralised Traffic Control]] (CTC) was installed from Taumaranui to Auckland at the same time.\n\nIn 1946 the last class of steam locomotives built by NZR was introduced, the [[NZR JA class|J<sup>A</sup> class]]. Due to coal shortages the conversion of [[NZR K class (1932)|K]], [[NZR J class (1939)|J]], [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]], J<sup>A</sup> classes of steam locomotives to oil burning.\n\nFollowing the war, NZR contracted the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] from 1947 to ship inter-island freight across Cook's Strait between Paraparaumu in the North Island and Blenheim in the South Island, as part of the \"[[Straits Air Freight Express#Rail Air|Rail Air]]\" service. In 1950, Straits Air Freight Express (Later SAFE Air) took over the contract from the RNZAF. The service was discontinued in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Leitch & Stott|1988|p=153}}\n\n=== Modernisation ===\n[[Image:NZR Class DE 504.JPG|thumb|200px|A [[New Zealand DE class locomotive|DE class]] locomotive, the first diesel-electric locomotives introduced by NZR.]]\n[[File:DF1501.jpg|thumb|200px|[[NZR DF class (1954)|DF class]] locomotive, the first mainline diesel-electric locomotives.]]\n[[Image:DA_1431_crossing_Rangitikei_River.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]] locomotive.]]\n[[File:RM 114.jpg|thumb|200px|RM 114 at [[Kaikoura]] during the 1960s.]]\n[[Image:DJ3107 on Taieri Gorge Railway 2.jpg|thumb|200px|The DJ class, introduced from 1968, led to the end of steam traction in the South Island, and the whole of New Zealand, by 1971.]]\nThe General Manager of NZR, Frederick Aicken, was an advocate for electrifying the entire North Island Main Trunk to alleviate the shortage of coal and the cost of importing diesel fuel; though he also recognised that steam and diesel traction would be required on other lines. NZR's first diesel-electric locomotives, the [[English Electric]] built [[New Zealand DE class locomotive|DE class]], were introduced in 1951. The locomotives gave good service, but were not powerful or numerous enough to seriously displace steam traction.\n\nIn 1954, the New Zealand railway network reached its zenith in terms of distance with {{convert|3500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, 60% of it on gradients between 1 in 100 and 1 in 200 and 33% steeper than 1 in 100.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=June 1954 |page=379 |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster |number=638 |volume=100 |title=The New Zealand Government Railways \u2013 1 |first=J. B. |last=Snell }}</ref> The [[NZR EW class|EW class]] electric locomotives introduced for the Wellington electric system. They were the second class of electric locomotive to be used on this section of electrification.\n\nAicken went as far as negotiating a tentative contract for the construction of electrification and locomotives for it, but fell out with the Government in late 1951 and resigned. His successor, H.C. Lusty, terminated the contract and entered into an agreement with General Motors for the supply of 40 EMD G12 model locomotives, designated by NZR as the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]]. The first of these locomotives entered service in September 1955, with all of this initial order running by September 1957.\n\nOn Christmas eve 1953 the worst disaster in NZR's history, and [[List of New Zealand disasters by death toll|one of the worst in New Zealand's history]] occurred. 151 people died when the [[Wellington]]-[[Auckland]] express was derailed due to a bridge collapse north of Tangiwai due to a [[lahar]] from a volcanic eruption, in what became known as the [[Tangiwai disaster]].\n\nThe following year NZR introduced the dual-cab [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF class]] in 1954, the first main-line [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] locomotives in service. However, they proved to be unsuccessful in service and original order of 31 was cancelled, and [[NZR DG class|DG class]] locomotives, also built by [[English Electric]], were ordered instead. While the DG class proved more successful than the DF class, steam remained the dominant form of traction.\n\nThis led to the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]] in 1955, the largest fleet of diesel-electric locomotives NZR ever introduced. The DA, more than any other class, displaced steam locomotives from the [[North Island]]. On 3 November of the same year the {{convert|8.798|km|mi}} long [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] opened, greatly reducing transit times between the [[Wairarapa]] and Wellington. This led to the closure of the Rimutaka Incline and its unique Fell railway system. Because steam locomotives could not be operated through the new tunnel, the [[Wairarapa Line]] was the first to be fully \"dieselised\". Amid much protest, the isolated [[Nelson Section]] was closed, although future [[Nelson Railway Proposals]] resurfaced from 1957.\n\nThe [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|RM class]] \"88 seater\" or \"Fiats\" also began entering service from 1955. The railcars were designed to take over provincial inter-city routes but proved to be mechanically unreliable.\n\nDespite large orders for diesel-electric locomotives, NZR was still building steam locomotives until 1956, when J<sup>A</sup>1274 was completed at [[Hillside Workshops]], [[Dunedin]]. The locomotive is now preserved in Dunedin near the railway station.\n\nDuring the 1950s New Zealand industry was diversifying, particularly into the timber industry. On 6 October 1952 the [[Kinleith Branch]], formerly part of the [[Taupo Totara Timber Company]]'s line, was opened to service a new pulp and paper mill at its terminus. NZR's first single-purpose log trains, called \"express loggers\", began to operate on this branch. The Kinleith Branch was shortly followed in 1957 by the {{convert|57|km}} long [[Murupara Branch]], which was opened running through the [[Bay of Plenty]]'s [[Kaingaroa Forest]]. The branch is the last major branch line to open in New Zealand to date. The line was primarily built to service the [[Tasman Mill|Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill]] in [[Kawerau]], with several loading points along its length.{{sfn|Bromby|2003|p=61}} The line's success led to several [[Taupo Railway Proposals]] being put forward, with extensions of the branch being mooted at various times.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nIn 1960 the second [[Christchurch railway station (New Zealand)|Christchurch railway station]], at Moorhouse Avenue, was opened. The station was closed in 1990, with a new station being built at Addington.\n\n[[File:Aranui roll-on roll-off ferry.jpg|thumb|200px|MV ''Aranui'', the second inter-island rail ferry operated by NZR]]\n\nThe introduction of [[GMV Aramoana|GMV ''Aramoana'']] in 1962 heralded the start of inter-island ferry services run by NZR.<ref name=\"railferry\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/cook-strait-rail-ferries/floating-bridge |title=Cook Strait ferries |publisher=NZhistory.net.nz |access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> The service was very successful, leading to criticism, when the Wellington\u2013Lytellton overnight ferry was withdrawn, that NZR was competing unfairly with private operators. Before the ''Aramoana'' was introduced, NZR could not compete for inter-island freight business, and the rail networks of both the North and South Islands were not well integrated. To send goods between the islands, freight had to be unloaded from wagons onto a ship on one island, unloaded at the other and then loaded back into wagons to resume its journey by rail. The introduction of a roll-on roll-off train ferry changed that. Wagons were rolled onto the ferry and rolled off at the other side. This led to many benefits for NZR customers.<ref name=\"railferry\" />\n\nNZR's 1963\u20131964 year-end financial report showed that inter-island ferry services contributed $1.07 million to NZRs profit of $1.077 million.

The success of the Blue Streaks led to the purchase of three new railcars in 1972. The Blue Streaks were then allocated to the Wellington\u2014[[New Plymouth]] service. The introduction of the Japanese-built [[NZR DJ class|DJ class]] diesels from that year in the [[South Island]] accelerated the demise of steam, replacing the remaining steam locomotives. The final demise of steam came on 26 October 1971 with the withdrawal of the last class of mainline steam locomotives, the [[NZR Ja class|Ja class]] in the South Island (although the NZR-operated heritage [[Kingston Flyer]] service, using two [[NZR Ab class|AB class locomotives]] began just two months later in December 1971).\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\n[[File:Railways Timetable (19573056451).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Timetable published by Railways from 1976]]\nRailways' management had entered the 1970s with a modernisation plan around the theme \"Great things are happening to Railways\", to counter negative views of the railways' held by the general public and political elites.{{sfn|Miles|1995|p=15}} In 1970, a red, black and white corporate logo designed by Barry Ellis was introduced and a new Passenger Division was established.<ref name=\"NZRO summer 1969-70\">{{cite book|title=New Zealand Railway Observer, Summer 1969\u20131970|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|editor=Tom McGavin|date=1970|volume=26|number=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/silver-star-poster|title=Silver Star poster|publisher=NZHistory.net.nz|accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref> [[The Southerner (train)|The Southerner]] between [[Christchurch]] and [[Invercargill]] was introduced, replacing the [[South Island Limited]]. The new service featured buffet cars and modernised rolling stock. New rolling stock included the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]] luxury [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Auckland]] overnight train, sourced from Japan. The service never lived up to its promise and was withdrawn in 1979 due to poor patronage. In 1972 the first [[Silver Fern (train)|Silver Fern]] railcars were introduced for the daytime Wellington\u2013Auckland run.\n\nFreight traffic was again changing. In October 1969, the first unit coal trains were introduced, between coal mines at [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]] and [[New Zealand Steel]] at [[Waiuku and Mission Bush Branches|Mission Bush]].<ref name=\"NZRO summer 1969-70\" /> The US-built [[General Electric]] [[GE U26C|U26C]] [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|DX class]] locomotives were introduced in 1972, with a further batch arriving in 1975. They were at the time the most powerful class of locomotives in New Zealand. At first, they were deployed to the North Island Main Trunk but gradually began working the express freight trains for which they were ordered throughout the North Island. The DX continued to dominate North Island traffic until electrification of the main trunk in the 1980s. 1971 saw the introduction of scheduled [[Intermodal containers|ISO shipping container]] services to New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=nzhistory.net.nz|title=Transforming our economy\u2014Container shipping|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/shipping-containers/transforming-our-economy|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> NZR introduced its first purpose-built container wagons, the UK class, for the growing traffic that was quickly changing freight patterns. However, NZR was criticized for not investing enough in new bogie wagons.\n\nFreight volumes greatly increased during the 1970s, despite the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, with the greatest setback for freight volumes being Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. Inflationary pressures within the economy greatly rose, at the same time exports were falling. In reaction to this, the government attempted to control inflation by fixing prices; in 1972 it was decided that NZR could only charge for its services at no more than 1971 rates, despite rising fuel and labour costs. As a result Railways' accounts were in deficit for much of the decade and were topped up with a special \"Vote Stabilisation\" in the budget.\n\nFollowing a change of Government in 1975, the [[Robert Muldoon]] led [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]] decided to increase the transport licensing limited from {{convert|40|mi|km}} to 150&nbsp;km. This change took effect from 1977,<ref name=\"road_transport_kiwirail\">{{cite web|title=Road transport regulation a controversial measure to protect railways|url=https://www.kiwirail.co.nz/about-us/history-of-kiwirail/150yearsofrail/stories/road-transport-regulation.html|publisher=[[KiwiRail]]|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> and greatly increased competition for NZR on key routes between larger centres within 150&nbsp;km of each other\u2014routes such as Auckland\u2013Hamilton, Hamilton\u2013Tauranga, Wellington\u2013Palmerston North and Christchurch\u2013Ashburton.<ref name=\"road_transport_kiwirail\" />\n\nIn 1978 a major rebuilding programme of the ageing DA class was launched, creating the [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC class]]. Locomotives were sent to Australia for rebuilding, with five being rebuilt at the NZR's own Hutt Workshops. Ten of the [[New Zealand DB class locomotive|DB class]] were rebuilt into the DBR class at the same time. The following year the Canadian built [[General Motors]] [[New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)|DF class]] was introduced.\n\nDespite these efforts, there was still considerable negativity about railways and the service they offered. In its 30 May 1979 issue, the [[National Business Review]] said \"long-distance rail travel is likely to completely disappear in the early 1980s.

From 1895 to 1993 there was a responsible Minister, the [[Minister of Railways (New Zealand)|Minister of Railways]].

The largest provincial operation was the [[Canterbury Provincial Railways]], which opened the first public railway at [[Ferrymead Railway|Ferrymead]] on 1 December 1863. During [[The Vogel Era]] of the late 1860s to the 1870s, railway construction by central government expanded greatly, from just {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} in 1869 to {{convert|1200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} in 1880.\n\nFollowing the abolition of the provinces in 1877, the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]] took over the various provincial railways. However, since the Public Works Department was charged with constructing new railway lines (among other public works) the day to day railway operations were transferred into a new government department on the recommendation of a parliamentary select committee.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=15}} At the time {{convert|1136|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} of railway lines were open for traffic, {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the North Island and {{convert|797|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the [[South Island]], mainly consisting of the {{convert|390|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Main South Line]] from the port of Lyttelton to Bluff.<ref name=\"Te Ara Birth of a National Railway System\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/railways/3|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|year=1966|title=Birth of a National Railway System}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation and early years ===\n[[File:Railway HQ Wellington.jpg|thumb|New Zealand Railways Department Head Office, Wellington, photographed circa 1905\u20131908 by J N Taylor.]]\nThe Railways Department was formed in 1880 during the premiership of Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]]. That year, the private [[Port Chalmers Branch|Port Chalmers Railway Company Limited]] was acquired by the department and new workshops at [[Addington Railway Workshops|Addington]] opened. Ironically, the first few years of NZR were marked by the [[Long Depression]], which led to great financial constraint on the department.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=21}} As a result, the central government passed legislation to allow for the construction of more private railways. A Royal Commission, ordered by Hall, had removed plans for a railway line on the west coast of the North Island from Foxton to Wellington. Instead, in August 1881 the Railways Construction and Land Act was passed, allowing joint-stock companies to build and run private railways, as long as they were built to the government's standard [[rail gauge]] of {{RailGauge|1067mm}} and connected with the government railway lines. The Act had the effect of authorising the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] to build the [[Wellington-Manawatu Line]].{{sfn|Cassels|1994|p=2}}\n\nIn 1877 the first American locomotives were purchased; the [[NZR K class (1877)]] from [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works|Rogers]], followed by the [[NZR T class]] of 1879 from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]].\n\nThe most important construction project for NZR at this time was the central section of the [[North Island Main Trunk]]. Starting from [[Te Awamutu]] on 15 April 1885, the section\u2014including the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]]\u2014was not completed for another 23 years.{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=26}}\n\nThe economy gradually improved and in 1895 the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] of Premier [[Richard Seddon]] appointed [[Alfred Cadman]] as the first [[Minister of Railways (New Zealand)|Minister of Railways]]. The Minister appointed a General Manager for the railways, keeping the operation under tight political control.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=171}} Apart from four periods of government-appointed commissions (1889\u20131894, 1924\u20131928, 1931\u20131936 and 1953\u20131957), this system remained in place until the department was corporatised in 1982.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=171}} In 1895, patronage had reached 3.9M passengers per annum and 2.048M tonnes.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=45}}\n\nNZR produced its first New Zealand-built steam locomotive in 1889; the [[NZR W class|W class]] built in the [[Addington Railway Workshops]].\n\nAlong with opening new lines, NZR began acquiring a number of the private railways which had built railway lines around the country. It acquired the [[Waimea Plains Railway|Waimea Plains Railway Company]] in 1886. At the same time, a protracted legal battle began with the [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company]], which was only resolved in 1898. The partially completed [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland line]] was not handed over to NZR until 1900.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=44}} By that time, {{convert|2000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of railway lines were open for traffic.<ref name=\"Te Ara Birth of a National Railway System\" /> The acquisition in 1908 of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company and its railway line marked the completion of the North Island Main Trunk from Wellington to Auckland. A new locomotive class, the [[NZR X class|X class]], was introduced in 1909 for traffic on the line. The X class was the most powerful locomotive at the time. Gold rushes led to the construction of the [[Thames Branch]], opening in 1898.\n\nIn 1906 the [[Dunedin railway station]] was completed, architect [[George Troup (architect)|George Troup]]. [[A. L. Beattie]] became Chief Mechanical Officer in April 1900. Beattie designed the famous [[NZR A class (1906)|A class]], the [[NZR Q class|Q class]] (the first \"Pacific\" type locomotive in the world), and many other locomotive classes.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=43}}\n\nNZR's first bus operation began on 1 October 1907, between [[Culverden]] on the [[Waiau Branch]] and [[Waiau, Canterbury|Waiau]] Ferry in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]. By the 1920s NZR was noticing a considerable downturn in rail passenger traffic on many lines due to increasing ownership of private cars, and from 1923 it began to co-ordinate rail passenger services with private bus services. The [[New Zealand Railways Road Services]] branch was formed to operate bus services.\n\nBy 1912, patronage had reached 13.4M passengers per annum (a 242% increase since 1895) and 5.9M tonnes of freight (a 188% increase since 1895).{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=45}}\n\n=== World War I ===\n[[File:NZR Ab Class 778 hauling the Kingston Flyer.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ab class were introduced in 1915. Over 141 of these locomotives were introduced, from three different builders. Here preserved Ab 778 hauls the [[Kingston Flyer]].]]\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 had a significant impact on the Railways Department. That year the [[NZR Aa class|Aa class]] appeared, and the following year the first [[NZR AB class|AB class]] locomotives were introduced. This class went on to become the most numerous locomotive class in New Zealand history, with several examples surviving into preservation.\n\nThe war itself led to a decline in passenger, freight and train miles run but also led to an increase in profitability. In the 1917 Annual Report, a record 5.3% return on investment was made.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=51}} The war did take its toll on railway services, with dining cars being removed from passenger trains in 1917, replaced by less labour-intensive refreshment rooms at railway stations along the way. As a result, the \"scramble for pie and tea at [[Taihape]]\" became a part of New Zealand folklore.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=51}}\n\nNon-essential rail services were curtailed as more staff took part in the war effort, and railway workshops were converted for producing military equipment, on top of their existing maintenance and construction work.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=51}} The war soon affected the supply of coal to the railways. Although hostilities ended in 1918, the coal shortage carried on into 1919 as first miners strikes and then an influenza epidemic cut supplies. As a result, non-essential services remained in effect until the end of 1919. Shortages of spare parts and materials led to severe inflation, and repairs on locomotives being deferred. Similar coal-saving timetable cuts occurred at the end of the next war in 1945 and 1946.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NA19450212.2.68|title=North Island Rail Services To Be Cut NORTHERN ADVOCATE|date=12 Feb 1945|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19451214.2.73|title=SOUTH ISLAND MAIN TRUNK, PRESS|date=14 Dec 1945|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Increasing competition and great depression ===\n[[File:Joseph Gordon Coates, 1931.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gordon Coates]] became Minister of Railways in 1923.

However, this scheme was shut down in 1929 as it was considered improper for a government department to compete with private builders.{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=52}}\n\nThe [[Otira Tunnel]] was completed in 1923, heralding the completion of the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. The tunnel included the first section of [[railway electrification]] in New Zealand and its first electric locomotives, the [[NZR EO class (1923)|original EO class]]. The section was electrified at 1,500&nbsp;V DC, due to the steep grade in the tunnel, and included its own hydro-electric power station.{{sfn|Scott|p=54}} The second section to be electrified by the department was the [[Lyttelton Line]] in Christchurch, completed in 1929, at the same voltage and current. This again saw English Electric supply locomotives, the [[NZR EC class|EC class]].\n\nIn the same year, [[Gordon Coates]] became the Minister of Railways. Coates was an ambitious politician who had an almost \"religious zeal\" for his portfolio. During the summer of 1923, he spent the entire parliamentary recess inspecting the department's operations. The following year, he put forward a \"Programme of Improvements and New Works'\".{{sfn|Stott|Leitch|1988|p=55}}\n\nCoates scheme proposed spending \u00a38 million over 8 years. This was later expanded to \u00a310 million over 10 years. The programme included:\n\n* The Auckland\u2013Westfield deviation of the [[North Island Main Trunk]];\n* New marshalling yards at Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch;\n* The Milson Deviation of the North Island Main Trunk through [[Palmerston North]];\n* The [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] under the [[Rimutaka Ranges]] in Wellington;\n* The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] of the North Island Main Trunk out of Wellington;\n* Electric lighting;\n* New locomotive facilities and\n* New signalling systems.\n\nAn independent commission, led by Sir [[Sam Fay]] and Sir [[Vincent Raven]] produced a report known as the \"Fay Raven Report\"{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=151}} which gave qualified approval to Coates' programme. The reports only significant change was the proposal of a [[Cook Strait]] train ferry service between Wellington and Picton, to link the two systems up.{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=152}} Coates went on to become Prime Minister in 1925, an office he held until 1928 when he was defeated at the [[1928 New Zealand general election|general election of that year]]. While the Westfield and Tawa Flat deviations proceeded, the Milson deviation and Rimutaka Tunnel projects remained stalled. The onset of the [[Great Depression]] from late 1929 saw these projects scaled back or abandoned. The Westfield deviation was completed in 1930 and the Tawa deviation proceeded at a snail's pace. A number of new lines under construction were casualties, including the [[Taupo railway proposals|Rotorua-Taupo]] line, approved in July 1928 but abandoned almost a year later due to the depression.{{sfn|Scott|p=57}} An exception was the [[Stratford\u2013Okahukura Line]], finished in 1933.{{sfn|Churchman|Hurst|1991|p=30}}\n\nHowever, there was criticism that maintenance was being neglected. In the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberals]] last year of office in 1912, {{convert|140|mi}} of line had been relaid, but that was reduced to 118 in 1913, 104 in 1914, 81 in 1924 and 68 in 1925, during the [[Reform Government of New Zealand|Reform Government]]'s years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250827.2.148|title=RAILWAY POLICY.

Four of the locomotives were introduced for operation on the North Island Main Trunk. They were not well suited to New Zealand conditions: they had overly complex [[valve gear]], were too hot for crews manning them and too powerful for the wagons they were hauling.{{sfn|Pierre|1981|p=157}} The failure of this class lead to the introduction of the [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] in 1932.\n\n=== Government Railways Board ===\nTough economic conditions and increasing competition from road transport led to calls for regulation of the land transport sector. In 1931 it was claimed half a million tons of freight had been lost to road transport.{{sfn|Scott|p=56}} That year, the department carried 7.2 million passengers per year, down from 14.2 million in 1923.{{sfn|Scott|p=57}} In 1930 a Royal Commission on Railways recommended that land transport should be \"co-ordinated\" and the following year parliament passed the [[Transport Licensing Act 1931]]. The Act regulated the carriage of goods and entrenched the monopoly the department had on land transport. It set a minimum distance road transport operators could transport goods at {{convert|30|mi}} before they had to be licensed. The Act was repealed in 1982.{{sfn|Scott|p=62}}\n\nAlongside these changes, in 1931 the Railways Department was briefly restructured into the Government Railways Board. Another Act of Parliament, the Government Railways Amendment Act 1931 was passed.<ref name=\"govtrailwaysborad\">{{cite web|url=https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&d=AJHR1931-I-II.2.2.2.3&e=-------10--1------0--|title=Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives, Report of the Government Railways Board|publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]]|accessdate=10 February 2019|date=9 September 1931}}</ref> The Railways Board was independent of the Government of the day and answered to the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].<ref name=\"kiwirail_history\" /> During this period the Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]] was also Minister of Railways, and Minister of Finance was former Minister of Railways [[Gordon Coates]]. The Railways Board was abolished by the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] in 1936.<ref name=\"kiwirail_history\" />\n\nIn 1933 plans for a new railway station and head office in Wellington were approved, along with the electrification of the [[Johnsonville Line]] (then still part of the North Island Main Trunk). The [[Wellington railway station]] and Tawa flat deviation were both completed in 1937.{{sfn|Churchman|Hurst|1991|p=31}} As part of attempts by NZR to win back passengers from private motor vehicles, the same year the first [[NZR 56-foot carriage|56-foot carriage]]s were introduced.\n\n[[Garnet Hercules Mackley]] was appointed General Manager in 1933, and worked hard to improve the standard and range of services provided by the Department. This included a number of steps to make passenger trains faster, more efficient and cheaper to run. In the early 20th century, NZR had begun investigating railcar technology to provide passenger services on regional routes and rural branch lines where carriage trains were not economic and [[mixed train|\"mixed\" trains]] (passenger carriages attached to freight trains) were undesirably slow. However, due to New Zealand's rugged terrain overseas technology could not simply be directly introduced. A number of experimental railcars and railbuses were developed. From 1925 these included the [[NZR RM class (Leyland petrol)|Leyland experimental petrol railcar]] and a fleet of [[NZR RM class (Model T Ford)|Model T Ford railbus]]es, the [[NZR RM class (Sentinel-Cammell)|Sentinel-Cammell steam railcar]] and from 1926 the [[NZR RM class (Clayton)|Clayton steam railcar]] and successful [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|Edison battery-electric railcar]]. 10 years later in 1936 the [[NZR RM class (Leyland diesel)|Leyland diesel railbus]] was introduced, but the first truly successful railcar class to enter service began operating that year, the [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa railcar]] specially designed to operate over the [[Rimutaka Incline]]. This class followed the building of the Red Terror (an inspection car on a Leyland Cub chassis) for the General Manager in 1933. More classes followed over the years, primarily to operate regional services.\n\nFollowing the success of the Wairarapa railcar class, in 1938 the [[NZR RM class (Standard)|Standard class railcars]] were introduced. A further improvement to passenger transport came in July that year, with electric services on the Johnsonville Line starting with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DM class electric multiple unit|DM/D]] [[English Electric]] [[Electric Multiple Unit|Multiple Unit]]s.<ref name=\"electricifcation_start\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/electric-trains-come-wellington|date=20 December 2012|title=Electric trains come to Wellington|publisher=New Zealand History online}}</ref>\n\nThree new locomotive classes appeared in 1939: the [[NZR KA class|K<sup>A</sup> class]], [[NZR KB class|K<sup>B</sup> class]] and the [[NZR J class (1939)|J class]]. The K<sup>A</sup> was a further development of the K class, while the J class was primarily for lighter trackage in the South Island. The numerically smaller K<sup>B</sup> class were allocated to the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland line]], where they dominated traffic. This led to the coining of the phrase \"KB country\" to describe the area, made famous by the [[National Film Unit]]'s documentary of the same title.\n\n=== World War II and its aftermath ===\n[[File:JA1271 Opapa 16Feb2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[NZR JA class|J<sup>A</sup>]] class were introduced in 1946, and were the last steam locomotives built by NZR.]]\nAs with the first world war, the [[Second World War]] had a significant impact on railways. The war created major labour shortages across the economy generally, and while considered \"essential industry\", railways were no exception. A large number of NZR employees signed up to fight in the war. For the first time, the Department employed significant numbers of women to meet the shortages. The war created serious coal shortages as imported coal was no longer available. Despite this, NZR had record revenues in 1940.\n\nDespite the war and associated labour and material shortages, new railway construction continued. In 1942 the [[Palmerston North\u2013Gisborne Line|Gisborne Line]] was finally opened, followed by the [[Main North Line, New Zealand|Main North Line]] between Picton and Christchurch being completed in 1945. The final section of the then ECMT, the [[Taneatua Branch]], was also completed. [[Centralized traffic control|Centralised Traffic Control]] (CTC) was installed from Taumaranui to Auckland at the same time.\n\nIn 1946 the last class of steam locomotives built by NZR was introduced, the [[NZR JA class|J<sup>A</sup> class]]. Due to coal shortages the conversion of [[NZR K class (1932)|K]], [[NZR J class (1939)|J]], [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]], J<sup>A</sup> classes of steam locomotives to oil burning.\n\nFollowing the war, NZR contracted the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] from 1947 to ship inter-island freight across Cook's Strait between Paraparaumu in the North Island and Blenheim in the South Island, as part of the \"[[Straits Air Freight Express#Rail Air|Rail Air]]\" service. In 1950, Straits Air Freight Express (Later SAFE Air) took over the contract from the RNZAF. The service was discontinued in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Leitch & Stott|1988|p=153}}\n\n=== Modernisation ===\n[[Image:NZR Class DE 504.JPG|thumb|200px|A [[New Zealand DE class locomotive|DE class]] locomotive, the first diesel-electric locomotives introduced by NZR.]]\n[[File:DF1501.jpg|thumb|200px|[[NZR DF class (1954)|DF class]] locomotive, the first mainline diesel-electric locomotives.]]\n[[Image:DA_1431_crossing_Rangitikei_River.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]] locomotive.]]\n[[File:RM 114.jpg|thumb|200px|RM 114 at [[Kaikoura]] during the 1960s.]]\n[[Image:DJ3107 on Taieri Gorge Railway 2.jpg|thumb|200px|The DJ class, introduced from 1968, led to the end of steam traction in the South Island, and the whole of New Zealand, by 1971.]]\nThe General Manager of NZR, Frederick Aicken, was an advocate for electrifying the entire North Island Main Trunk to alleviate the shortage of coal and the cost of importing diesel fuel; though he also recognised that steam and diesel traction would be required on other lines. NZR's first diesel-electric locomotives, the [[English Electric]] built [[New Zealand DE class locomotive|DE class]], were introduced in 1951. The locomotives gave good service, but were not powerful or numerous enough to seriously displace steam traction.\n\nIn 1954, the New Zealand railway network reached its zenith in terms of distance with {{convert|3500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, 60% of it on gradients between 1 in 100 and 1 in 200 and 33% steeper than 1 in 100.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Railway Magazine |date=June 1954 |page=379 |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster |number=638 |volume=100 |title=The New Zealand Government Railways \u2013 1 |first=J. B. |last=Snell }}</ref> The [[NZR EW class|EW class]] electric locomotives introduced for the Wellington electric system. They were the second class of electric locomotive to be used on this section of electrification.\n\nAicken went as far as negotiating a tentative contract for the construction of electrification and locomotives for it, but fell out with the Government in late 1951 and resigned. His successor, H.C. Lusty, terminated the contract and entered into an agreement with General Motors for the supply of 40 EMD G12 model locomotives, designated by NZR as the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]]. The first of these locomotives entered service in September 1955, with all of this initial order running by September 1957.\n\nOn Christmas eve 1953 the worst disaster in NZR's history, and [[List of New Zealand disasters by death toll|one of the worst in New Zealand's history]] occurred. 151 people died when the [[Wellington]]-[[Auckland]] express was derailed due to a bridge collapse north of Tangiwai due to a [[lahar]] from a volcanic eruption, in what became known as the [[Tangiwai disaster]].\n\nThe following year NZR introduced the dual-cab [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF class]] in 1954, the first main-line [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] locomotives in service. However, they proved to be unsuccessful in service and original order of 31 was cancelled, and [[NZR DG class|DG class]] locomotives, also built by [[English Electric]], were ordered instead. While the DG class proved more successful than the DF class, steam remained the dominant form of traction.\n\nThis led to the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]] in 1955, the largest fleet of diesel-electric locomotives NZR ever introduced. The DA, more than any other class, displaced steam locomotives from the [[North Island]]. On 3 November of the same year the {{convert|8.798|km|mi}} long [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] opened, greatly reducing transit times between the [[Wairarapa]] and Wellington. This led to the closure of the Rimutaka Incline and its unique Fell railway system. Because steam locomotives could not be operated through the new tunnel, the [[Wairarapa Line]] was the first to be fully \"dieselised\". Amid much protest, the isolated [[Nelson Section]] was closed, although future [[Nelson Railway Proposals]] resurfaced from 1957.\n\nThe [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|RM class]] \"88 seater\" or \"Fiats\" also began entering service from 1955. The railcars were designed to take over provincial inter-city routes but proved to be mechanically unreliable.\n\nDespite large orders for diesel-electric locomotives, NZR was still building steam locomotives until 1956, when J<sup>A</sup>1274 was completed at [[Hillside Workshops]], [[Dunedin]]. The locomotive is now preserved in Dunedin near the railway station.\n\nDuring the 1950s New Zealand industry was diversifying, particularly into the timber industry. On 6 October 1952 the [[Kinleith Branch]], formerly part of the [[Taupo Totara Timber Company]]'s line, was opened to service a new pulp and paper mill at its terminus. NZR's first single-purpose log trains, called \"express loggers\", began to operate on this branch. The Kinleith Branch was shortly followed in 1957 by the {{convert|57|km}} long [[Murupara Branch]], which was opened running through the [[Bay of Plenty]]'s [[Kaingaroa Forest]]. The branch is the last major branch line to open in New Zealand to date. The line was primarily built to service the [[Tasman Mill|Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill]] in [[Kawerau]], with several loading points along its length.{{sfn|Bromby|2003|p=61}} The line's success led to several [[Taupo Railway Proposals]] being put forward, with extensions of the branch being mooted at various times.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nIn 1960 the second [[Christchurch railway station (New Zealand)|Christchurch railway station]], at Moorhouse Avenue, was opened. The station was closed in 1990, with a new station being built at Addington.\n\n[[File:Aranui roll-on roll-off ferry.jpg|thumb|200px|MV ''Aranui'', the second inter-island rail ferry operated by NZR]]\n\nThe introduction of [[GMV Aramoana|GMV ''Aramoana'']] in 1962 heralded the start of inter-island ferry services run by NZR.<ref name=\"railferry\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/cook-strait-rail-ferries/floating-bridge |title=Cook Strait ferries |publisher=NZhistory.net.nz |access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> The service was very successful, leading to criticism, when the Wellington\u2013Lytellton overnight ferry was withdrawn, that NZR was competing unfairly with private operators. Before the ''Aramoana'' was introduced, NZR could not compete for inter-island freight business, and the rail networks of both the North and South Islands were not well integrated. To send goods between the islands, freight had to be unloaded from wagons onto a ship on one island, unloaded at the other and then loaded back into wagons to resume its journey by rail. The introduction of a roll-on roll-off train ferry changed that. Wagons were rolled onto the ferry and rolled off at the other side. This led to many benefits for NZR customers.<ref name=\"railferry\" />\n\nNZR's 1963\u20131964 year-end financial report showed that inter-island ferry services contributed $1.07 million to NZRs profit of $1.077 million.

The success of the Blue Streaks led to the purchase of three new railcars in 1972. The Blue Streaks were then allocated to the Wellington\u2014[[New Plymouth]] service. The introduction of the Japanese-built [[NZR DJ class|DJ class]] diesels from that year in the [[South Island]] accelerated the demise of steam, replacing the remaining steam locomotives. The final demise of steam came on 26 October 1971 with the withdrawal of the last class of mainline steam locomotives, the [[NZR Ja class|Ja class]] in the South Island (although the NZR-operated heritage [[Kingston Flyer]] service, using two [[NZR Ab class|AB class locomotives]] began just two months later in December 1971).\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\n[[File:Railways Timetable (19573056451).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Timetable published by Railways from 1976]]\nRailways' management had entered the 1970s with a modernisation plan around the theme \"Great things are happening to Railways\", to counter negative views of the railways' held by the general public and political elites.{{sfn|Miles|1995|p=15}} In 1970, a red, black and white corporate logo designed by Barry Ellis was introduced and a new Passenger Division was established.<ref name=\"NZRO summer 1969-70\">{{cite book|title=New Zealand Railway Observer, Summer 1969\u20131970|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|editor=Tom McGavin|date=1970|volume=26|number=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/silver-star-poster|title=Silver Star poster|publisher=NZHistory.net.nz|accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref> [[The Southerner (train)|The Southerner]] between [[Christchurch]] and [[Invercargill]] was introduced, replacing the [[South Island Limited]].

In 1972 the first [[Silver Fern (train)|Silver Fern]] railcars were introduced for the daytime Wellington\u2013Auckland run.\n\nFreight traffic was again changing. In October 1969, the first unit coal trains were introduced, between coal mines at [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]] and [[New Zealand Steel]] at [[Waiuku and Mission Bush Branches|Mission Bush]].<ref name=\"NZRO summer 1969-70\" /> The US-built [[General Electric]] [[GE U26C|U26C]] [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|DX class]] locomotives were introduced in 1972, with a further batch arriving in 1975. They were at the time the most powerful class of locomotives in New Zealand. At first, they were deployed to the North Island Main Trunk but gradually began working the express freight trains for which they were ordered throughout the North Island. The DX continued to dominate North Island traffic until electrification of the main trunk in the 1980s. 1971 saw the introduction of scheduled [[Intermodal containers|ISO shipping container]] services to New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=nzhistory.net.nz|title=Transforming our economy\u2014Container shipping|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/shipping-containers/transforming-our-economy|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> NZR introduced its first purpose-built container wagons, the UK class, for the growing traffic that was quickly changing freight patterns. However, NZR was criticized for not investing enough in new bogie wagons.\n\nFreight volumes greatly increased during the 1970s, despite the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, with the greatest setback for freight volumes being Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. Inflationary pressures within the economy greatly rose, at the same time exports were falling. In reaction to this, the government attempted to control inflation by fixing prices; in 1972 it was decided that NZR could only charge for its services at no more than 1971 rates, despite rising fuel and labour costs. As a result Railways' accounts were in deficit for much of the decade and were topped up with a special \"Vote Stabilisation\" in the budget.\n\nFollowing a change of Government in 1975, the [[Robert Muldoon]] led [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]] decided to increase the transport licensing limited from {{convert|40|mi|km}} to 150&nbsp;km. This change took effect from 1977,<ref name=\"road_transport_kiwirail\">{{cite web|title=Road transport regulation a controversial measure to protect railways|url=https://www.kiwirail.co.nz/about-us/history-of-kiwirail/150yearsofrail/stories/road-transport-regulation.html|publisher=[[KiwiRail]]|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> and greatly increased competition for NZR on key routes between larger centres within 150&nbsp;km of each other\u2014routes such as Auckland\u2013Hamilton, Hamilton\u2013Tauranga, Wellington\u2013Palmerston North and Christchurch\u2013Ashburton.<ref name=\"road_transport_kiwirail\" />\n\nIn 1978 a major rebuilding programme of the ageing DA class was launched, creating the [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC class]]. Locomotives were sent to Australia for rebuilding, with five being rebuilt at the NZR's own Hutt Workshops. Ten of the [[New Zealand DB class locomotive|DB class]] were rebuilt into the DBR class at the same time. The following year the Canadian built [[General Motors]] [[New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)|DF class]] was introduced.\n\nDespite these efforts, there was still considerable negativity about railways and the service they offered. In its 30 May 1979 issue, the [[National Business Review]] said \"long-distance rail travel is likely to completely disappear in the early 1980s. This will leave the slow creaking third world narrow gauge network to bulk freight where it can be more efficient.\"{{sfn|Miles|1995|p=15}}\n\n=== Traffic Monitoring System ===\nOn 12 February 1979, NZR introduced a computerised \"Traffic Monitoring System\", known as TMS.{{sfn|Parsons|2002|p=15}} A pilot scheme of TMS began in 1973 on the [[Palmerston North - Gisborne Line]] between Woodville and Gisborne.<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1979\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=Computerised Wagon Control on New Zealand Railways|date=Winter 1979|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=00288624|volume=36|number=2|page=58}}</ref> TMS resulted in a 8 per cent improvement in wagon utilisation.<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1979\" />\n\n=== \"Time for Change\" ===\nFollowing the increase in distance for road transport licensing in 1977, NZR General Manager Trevor Hayward published a pamphlet entitled \"Time for Change\".<ref name=\"road_transport_kiwirail\" /> In it, he spelt out the basic challenge facing NZR at the time: providing both commercial and loss-making \"social\" services.<ref name=\"road_transport_kiwirail\" /> While Hayward was not against road transport deregulation, he was in favour of greater investment in NZR to meet freight requirements, and shutting down uneconomic services.<ref name=\"road_transport_kiwirail\" />\n\nIn 1981, parliament passed the New Zealand Railways Corporation Act, and the department was corporatised as the [[New Zealand Railways Corporation]] on 1 April 1982.<ref name=\"date\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0119/20.0/DLM57010.html|title=New Zealand Railways Corporation Act 1981, s1(2)|publisher=Public Access to Legislation website|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Branches==\nThe Railways Department followed a traditional branch structure, which was carried over to the Corporation.\n* Commercial;\n* Finance and Accounts;\n* Mechanical;\n* Publicity and Advertising;\n* Refreshment;\n* [[New Zealand Railways Road Services|Railways Road Services]];\n* Stores;\n* Traffic; and\n* Way and Works.\n\n== Performance ==\nThe table below records the performance of the Railways Department in terms of freight tonnage:<ref name=\"dereg\">{{cite journal|first=Rob|last=Merrifield|title=Land Transport Deregulation in New Zealand, 1983\u20131989|journal=The New Zealand Railway Observer|editor=T.

Each hard-shell suitcase is made of 205 parts that are individually inspected and assembled in a manufacturing process that takes exactly 117 minutes to complete in the factory in Cologne, Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh3W5RAlTr4|title=The 80th Anniversary of the Original Aluminium Suitcase|last=|first=|date=Oct 9, 2017|website=YouTube|access-date=}}</ref> Production begins with a flat sheet of aluminium that is then imprinted with raised grooves - the iconic ribbed design first inspired by the corrugated metal of aircraft of the 1930s. From there, the aluminium is pressed into two identical shells, fitted with a frame, corners, and telescopic handle, and secured together by aviation-standard aluminium rivets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMcRuLO2Nw|title=How a Rimowa Aluminium Topas case is made|last=|first=|date=Dec 14, 2015|website=YouTube|access-date=}}</ref> The Original Collection comes in eight sizes - the Cabin S, Cabin, Cabin Plus, Check-In M, Check-In L, Trunk, Trunk Plus, Trunk XL, and is available in three colours variations - silver, black and titanium. The 80-year anniversary of the RIMOWA Original was celebrated in 2017.\n\n=== Classic ===\nThe RIMOWA Classic is the modern interpretation of the Classic Flight collection. The heritage-inspired design is made from the brand's trademark anodized aluminium and includes details like riveted high-gloss aluminium corners and handmade leather handles. It is available in five sizes - the Cabin S, Cabin, Check-In M, Check-In L, and Trunk. Personalised versions of the RIMOWA Classic can be created with the RIMOWA Unique customisation service that allows customers to select from different coloured wheels, leather handles and initialled leather luggage tags.\n[[File:Rimowa Hybrid Cabin blue, 2019.jpg|thumb|RIMOWA Hybrid Cabin Blue, 2019]]\n=== Hybrid ===\nThe RIMOWA Hybrid combines two innovative materials, robust aluminium-magnesium alloy and lightweight polycarbonate, in one unique suitcase design. It is available in five sizes - the Cabin S, Cabin, Cabin Plus, Check-In M, Check-In L, and in a range of matte or gloss colours.\n=== Essential ===\nThe RIMOWA Essential is the present version of the world's first polycarbonate suitcase, which RIMOWA brought to market in 2000. The high-tech material resists extreme temperatures, is light yet durable, and has received two safety certifications from T\u00dcV Rheinland. The Essential range is characterised by lightweight cases that come in a rotating mix of seasonal colour variations and both matte and gloss finishes. The RIMOWA Essential is available in seven sizes - the Cabin S, Cabin, Cabin Plus, Check-In M, Check-In L, Trunk and Trunk Plus.\n\n=== Essential Lite ===\nThe Essential Lite is RIMOWA's lightest suitcase ever created, weighing 30 percent less than the Essential variant. It is the only RIMOWA product available in a miniature kid's size, in addition to four other standard sizes - the Cabin S, Cabin, Check-In M and Check-In L.\n\n=== Product Features ===\nRIMOWA suitcases currently in production include the following features:\n* The Multiwheel\u00ae System first patented by RIMOWA in 2001. Ball-bearing mounted wheels with cushioned axels ensure smooth and stable 360-degree motion across eight wheels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2019/11/10-things-to-know-about-rimowa/rimowa-8|title=10 Things to Know About Rimowa|last=|first=|date=Nov 14, 2019|website=Complex|access-date=}}</ref>\n* TSA-approved locks first introduced in 2006 for global airport security compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://realstyle.therealreal.com/authenticity-real-rimowa-luggage-collaboration-off-white/|title=How to Spot Real Rimowa Luggage|last=|first=|date=May 21, 2019|website=RealStyle|access-date=}}</ref> \n* Telescopic handles with stage-free adjustment for smooth manoeuvrability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2019/12/rimowa-classic-trunk-silver-aluminum-release|title=RIMOWA Classic Trunk Receives Silver Aluminum Version|last=|first=|date=Dec 19, 2019|website=HypeBeast|access-date=}}</ref>\n* Interior compartment equipped with two height-adjustable Flex Dividers that secure the contents of each suitcase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelandstyle.ca/expert-packing-tips-from-rimowa/|title=Expert Packing Tips from RIMOWA|last=|first=|date=Apr 8, 2013|website=Travel and Style|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Collaborations ==\nRIMOWA has established several partnerships with well-know German brands, such as [[Lufthansa]] since 1998<ref>{{cite web|title=Lufthansa launches RIMOWA Electronic Tag at FTE Global 2015|url=https://www.futuretravelexperience.com/2015/09/lufthansa-launches-rimowa-electronic-tag-fte-global-2015/|website=Future Travel Experience|date=25 September 2015|publication-date=}}</ref> for the brand's centenary, or with [[Porsche]] since 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porsche Design x RIMOWA \"RS 2.7\" PTS Lightweight Collection|url=https://hypebeast.com/2015/8/porsche-design-x-rimowa-rs-2-7-collection|website=HypeBeast|publication-date=}}</ref> As part of the partnership with Porsche, RIMOWA regularly produces special series of its suitcases with specific colours or designs.

After the capture of [[Monte Cassino]] in May 1944, the [[Polish government-in-exile]] (in London) created a campaign cross to commemorate the role of the Polish II Corps (often known as ''Anders Army'') in capturing this strategic point, which had long blocked the Allied advance up the Italian peninsula.\n\nA consignment of 50,000 crosses was ordered from a manufacturer in [[Tel Aviv]], then part of British-ruled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where the Polish forces had spent part of 1942 and almost all of 1943 in training.

After the capture of [[Monte Cassino]] in May 1944, the [[Polish government-in-exile]] (in London) created a campaign cross to commemorate the role of the Polish II Corps (often known as ''Anders Army'') in capturing this strategic point, which had long blocked the Allied advance up the Italian peninsula.\n\nA consignment of 50,000 crosses was ordered from a manufacturer in [[Tel Aviv]], then part of British-ruled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where the Polish forces had spent part of 1942 and almost all of 1943 in training. A total of 48,498 crosses (serial numbers 1 to 48,498) were awarded with accompanying award documents issued in the field to each soldier who took part in the battle.<ref name=\"Wesolowski\">\n{{cite

It is {{convert|10.1|mi}} north-northeast of [[Central London]]. The area is identified in the [[London Plan]] as one of 35 major centres in [[Greater London]].<ref name=london_plan_f08>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf |author=[[Mayor of London]] |publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] |title=London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602000714/http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf |archivedate=2 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> The town was originally in the county of [[Middlesex]], but became part of [[Greater London]] on 1 April 1965 when the [[London Government Act 1963]] was implemented. Enfield, including its localities such as [[Ponders End]], [[Crews Hill]] and [[Freezywater]], had a total population of 132,640 in 2011; the wider borough meanwhile had a population of 333,869.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Edmonton Hundred}}\nEnfield was a set settlements united by one church, including by the [[High Middle Ages]] in 1303 a small agrarian market town, otherwise [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s spread around the royal hunting grounds of [[Enfield Chase]]. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]] the area was spelt 'Enefelde', and had a priest who almost certainly resided in [[St Andrew's Enfield|St. Andrew's Church]]. By 1572 most of the long-distance streets had been completed. The village green, in 1303, became a marketplace making the place a market town; the area between the church and the present fountain. Traders sell products at the regular market, on licence by a non-discriminatory poor relief charity covering the whole Borough. Its name most likely came from [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''\u0112anafeld'' or similar, meaning \"open land belonging to a man called \u0112ana\" or \"open land for lambs\".  The parish was the largest in [[Middlesex]] if excluding from [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] its [[Pinner]] north-west corner, which broke away in 1766; Enfield measured 12,460 acres in 1831, i.e. {{convert|19.5|sqmi}}.<ref>A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, Eileen P Scarff and G C Tyack, 'Enfield: Introduction', in ''[[Victoria County History|A History of the County of Middlesex]]'': Volume 5 ed.

British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol5/pp207-208 [accessed 24 May 2018].</ref>\n\n===Notable people, places, and events===\nThe parish church, on the north side of the marketplace, is dedicated to [[St Andrew's Enfield|St Andrew]]. There is some masonry surviving from the thirteenth century, but the nave, north aisle, choir and tower are late fourteenth century, built of random rubble and flint. The clerestory dates from the early sixteenth century, and the south aisle was rebuilt in  brick in 1824.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1079549 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Adjacent to the church is the old school building of the Tudor period, [[Enfield Grammar School]], which expanded  over the years, becoming a large comprehensive school from the late 1960s.\n\n====Enfield Palace====\nA sixteenth century manor house, known since the eighteenth century as Enfield Palace, is remembered in the name of the Palace Gardens Shopping Centre (and the hothouses on the site were once truly notable; see below). It was used as a private school from around 1670 until the late nineteenth century.  The last remains of it  were demolished in 1928, to make way for an extension to Pearson's department store, though a panelled room with an elaborate plaster ceiling and a stone fireplace survives, relocated to a house in Gentleman's Row, a street of sixteenth- to eighteenth-century houses near the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=26951|title=Enfield: Manors|editor1=T F T Baker|editor2=R B Pugh |author1=A P Baggs|author2=Diane K Bolton|author3=Eileen P Scarff|author4=G C Tyack|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|date=1976|work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5: Hendon, Kingsbury, Great Stanmore, Little Stanmore, Edmonton Enfield, Monken Hadley, South Mimms, Tottenham|accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Enfield Market====\nIn 1303, Edward I granted a charter to Humphrey de Bohun, and his wife to hold a weekly market in Enfield each Monday, and  James I granted another in 1617,  to a charitable trust, for a Saturday market.<ref>Ford (1873) p.101</ref>  The Market was still prosperous in the early eighteenth century, but fell into decline soon afterwards.  There were sporadic attempts to revive it: an unsuccessful one of 1778 is recorded,<ref>Pam (1990) pp.226</ref> and in 1826 a stone Gothic market cross was erected,  to replace the octagonal wooden market house, demolished sixteen years earlier.  In 1858,  J. Tuff wrote  of the market  \"several attempts have been made to revive it, the last of which, about twenty years ago, also proved a failure, It has again fallen into desuetude and will probably never be revived\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tuff |first1=J. |title= Historical, Topographical and Statistical Notices of Enfield |url= https://archive.org/details/historicaltopogr00tuff  |accessdate=  |year= 1858|publisher= J.H. Meyers|location=Enfield |page= |pages= }}\"</ref>\n\nHowever the trading resumed in the 1870s. In 1904 a new wooden structure was built to replace the stone cross, by now decayed.  The market  is still in existence, administered by the Old Enfield Charitable trust.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toect.org.uk/history-page.html |title=Historical Information |publisher= Old Enfield Charitable Trust|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n====The Enfield Fair====\nThe charter of 1303 also gave the right to hold two annual fairs, one on St Andrew's Day and the other in September.<ref>Ford (1873) pp. 102</ref>  The latter was  suppressed in 1869 at the request of  local tradesmen, clergy and other prominent citizens, having become, according to the local historian Pete Eyre, \"a source of immorality and disorder, and a growing  nuisance to the inhabitants\".<ref>Ford (1873) pp. 104-5</ref>\n\n====The New River====\nThe [[New River (England)|New River]], built to supply water to [[London]] from [[Hertfordshire]], runs immediately behind the town centre through the [[Enfield Town Park|Town Park]], which is the last remaining public open space of [[Enfield Old Park]]. The Enfield Loop of the New River also passes through the playing fields of Enfield Grammar School, and this is the only stretch of the loop without a public footpath on at least one side of it.\n\n====Hothouses====\nEnfield was the location of some of the earliest successful hothouses, developed by Dr [[Robert Uvedale]], headmaster of both  [[Enfield Grammar School]] and the Palace School. He was a Cambridge scholar and renowned horticulturalist; George Simonds Boulger writes of Uvedale in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1885\u20131900, Volume 58: <blockquote>As a horticulturist Uvedale earned a reputation for his skill in cultivating exotics, being one of the earliest possessors of hothouses in England. In an ''Account of several Gardens near London'' written by J. Gibson in 1691 (''Arch\u00e6ologia'', 1794, xii. 188), the writer says: 'Dr. Uvedale of Enfield is a great lover of plants, and, having an extraordinary art in managing them, is become master of the greatest and choicest collection of exotic greens that is perhaps anywhere in this land. His greens take up six or seven houses or roomsteads. His orange-trees and largest myrtles fill up his biggest house, and \u2026 those more nice and curious plants that need closer keeping are in warmer rooms, and some of them stoved when he thinks fit. His flowers are choice, his stock numerous, and his culture of them very methodical and curious.'</blockquote>\n\n====John Keats====\nThe poet [[John Keats]] went to progressive Clarke's School in Enfield, where he began a translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]''. The school's building later became [[Enfield Town railway station]] until it was demolished in 1872. The current building was erected in the 1960s. In 1840 the first section of the [[Northern and Eastern Railway]] had been opened from [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] to [[Broxbourne]]. The branch line from Water Lane to Enfield Town  station was opened in 1849.\n\n====Silver Street White House====\nThe White House in Silver Street \u2013 now a doctors' surgery \u2013 was the home of [[Joseph Whitaker (publisher)|Joseph Whitaker]], publisher and founder of [[Whitaker's Almanack]], who lived there from 1820 until his death in 1895. (Inscription on Blue Plaque on The White House, Silver Street, Enfield.)\n\n====World's first ATM====\nEnfield Town had the world's first cash machine or [[automatic teller machine]], invented by [[John Shepherd-Barron]]. It was installed at the local branch of [[Barclays Bank]] on 27&nbsp;June 1967 and was opened by the actor and Enfield resident [[Reg Varney]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6230194.stm | work=BBC News | title=The man who invented the cash machine | date=25 June 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n====The Civic Centre====\nEnfield Town houses the Civic Centre, the headquarters of the Borough administration, where Council and committee meetings are also held.\n\n====August 2011 riots====\nOn Sunday 7 August 2011, after rioting spread from [[Tottenham riots 2011|Tottenham]], vehicles including a police car were attacked and several shops and business were targeted in the town centre. Most businesses remained closed on Monday 8th and many were not repaired for several weeks after the rioting. The mayor of London, [[Boris Johnson]], later visited the town centre to receive people's views of the riots.<ref>[http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/topstories/9182575.Police_car_trashed_by_Enfield_Town_rioters/ News report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928120514/http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/topstories/9182575.Police_car_trashed_by_Enfield_Town_rioters/ |date=28 September 2011 }} Retrieved 12 August 2011</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nNeighbourhoods and villages of Enfield Town include: [[Botany Bay]], [[Bulls Cross]], [[Bullsmoor]], [[Bush Hill Park]], [[Clay Hill, London|Clay Hill]], [[Crews Hill]], [[Enfield Highway]], [[Enfield Lock]], [[Enfield Wash]], [[Forty Hill]], [[Freezywater]], [[Gordon Hill, London|Gordon Hill]], and [[Ponders End]].

The largest non-white group, Black African, claimed 3%. The District is also covered by the Chase, Highlands, Grange, Southbury, Lock, Highway, Turkey Street and Bush Hill Park wards. Of these, the Lock ward had the highest minority proportion, 45.1% of its population.<ref>https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas</ref>\n\nHighlands ward had the highest male and female life expectancies from 2009\u20132013, 82.5 and 87.2 years respectively.

A large extension to the existing shopping centre was built, under the name Palace Exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palaceexchange.co.uk |title=Enfield |publisher=Palace Exchange |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref> Many branches of chain stores already existing in the town centre were relocated to the new extension, and there are some completely new stores. In the summer of 2011 a vacant building (previously a bingo club) on Burleigh way in the town centre was demolished and replaced with new apartments, which were completed in the spring of 2012.

It is {{convert|10.1|mi}} north-northeast of [[Central London]]. The area is identified in the [[London Plan]] as one of 35 major centres in [[Greater London]].<ref name=london_plan_f08>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf |author=[[Mayor of London]] |publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] |title=London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602000714/http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf |archivedate=2 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> The town was originally in the county of [[Middlesex]], but became part of [[Greater London]] on 1 April 1965 when the [[London Government Act 1963]] was implemented. Enfield, including its localities such as [[Ponders End]], [[Crews Hill]] and [[Freezywater]], had a total population of 132,640 in 2011; the wider borough meanwhile had a population of 333,869.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Edmonton Hundred}}\nEnfield was a set settlements united by one church, including by the [[High Middle Ages]] in 1303 a small agrarian market town, otherwise [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s spread around the royal hunting grounds of [[Enfield Chase]]. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]] the area was spelt 'Enefelde', and had a priest who almost certainly resided in [[St Andrew's Enfield|St. Andrew's Church]]. By 1572 most of the long-distance streets had been completed. The village green, in 1303, became a marketplace making the place a market town; the area between the church and the present fountain. Traders sell products at the regular market, on licence by a non-discriminatory poor relief charity covering the whole Borough. Its name most likely came from [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''\u0112anafeld'' or similar, meaning \"open land belonging to a man called \u0112ana\" or \"open land for lambs\".  The parish was the largest in [[Middlesex]] if excluding from [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] its [[Pinner]] north-west corner, which broke away in 1766; Enfield measured 12,460 acres in 1831, i.e. {{convert|19.5|sqmi}}.<ref>A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, Eileen P Scarff and G C Tyack, 'Enfield: Introduction', in ''[[Victoria County History|A History of the County of Middlesex]]'': Volume 5 ed.

There is some masonry surviving from the thirteenth century, but the nave, north aisle, choir and tower are late fourteenth century, built of random rubble and flint. The clerestory dates from the early sixteenth century, and the south aisle was rebuilt in  brick in 1824.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1079549 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Adjacent to the church is the old school building of the Tudor period, [[Enfield Grammar School]], which expanded  over the years, becoming a large comprehensive school from the late 1960s.\n\n====Enfield Palace====\nA sixteenth century manor house, known since the eighteenth century as Enfield Palace, is remembered in the name of the Palace Gardens Shopping Centre (and the hothouses on the site were once truly notable; see below). It was used as a private school from around 1670 until the late nineteenth century.  The last remains of it  were demolished in 1928, to make way for an extension to Pearson's department store, though a panelled room with an elaborate plaster ceiling and a stone fireplace survives, relocated to a house in Gentleman's Row, a street of sixteenth- to eighteenth-century houses near the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=26951|title=Enfield: Manors|editor1=T F T Baker|editor2=R B Pugh |author1=A P Baggs|author2=Diane K Bolton|author3=Eileen P Scarff|author4=G C Tyack|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|date=1976|work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5: Hendon, Kingsbury, Great Stanmore, Little Stanmore, Edmonton Enfield, Monken Hadley, South Mimms, Tottenham|accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Enfield Market====\nIn 1303, Edward I granted a charter to Humphrey de Bohun, and his wife to hold a weekly market in Enfield each Monday, and  James I granted another in 1617,  to a charitable trust, for a Saturday market.<ref>Ford (1873) p.101</ref>  The Market was still prosperous in the early eighteenth century, but fell into decline soon afterwards.  There were sporadic attempts to revive it: an unsuccessful one of 1778 is recorded,<ref>Pam (1990) pp.226</ref> and in 1826 a stone Gothic market cross was erected,  to replace the octagonal wooden market house, demolished sixteen years earlier.  In 1858,  J. Tuff wrote  of the market  \"several attempts have been made to revive it, the last of which, about twenty years ago, also proved a failure, It has again fallen into desuetude and will probably never be revived\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tuff |first1=J. |title= Historical, Topographical and Statistical Notices of Enfield |url= https://archive.org/details/historicaltopogr00tuff  |accessdate=  |year= 1858|publisher= J.H. Meyers|location=Enfield |page= |pages= }}\"</ref>\n\nHowever the trading resumed in the 1870s. In 1904 a new wooden structure was built to replace the stone cross, by now decayed.  The market  is still in existence, administered by the Old Enfield Charitable trust.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toect.org.uk/history-page.html |title=Historical Information |publisher= Old Enfield Charitable Trust|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n====The Enfield Fair====\nThe charter of 1303 also gave the right to hold two annual fairs, one on St Andrew's Day and the other in September.<ref>Ford (1873) pp. 102</ref>  The latter was  suppressed in 1869 at the request of  local tradesmen, clergy and other prominent citizens, having become, according to the local historian Pete Eyre, \"a source of immorality and disorder, and a growing  nuisance to the inhabitants\".<ref>Ford (1873) pp. 104-5</ref>\n\n====The New River====\nThe [[New River (England)|New River]], built to supply water to [[London]] from [[Hertfordshire]], runs immediately behind the town centre through the [[Enfield Town Park|Town Park]], which is the last remaining public open space of [[Enfield Old Park]]. The Enfield Loop of the New River also passes through the playing fields of Enfield Grammar School, and this is the only stretch of the loop without a public footpath on at least one side of it.\n\n====Hothouses====\nEnfield was the location of some of the earliest successful hothouses, developed by Dr [[Robert Uvedale]], headmaster of both  [[Enfield Grammar School]] and the Palace School. He was a Cambridge scholar and renowned horticulturalist; George Simonds Boulger writes of Uvedale in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1885\u20131900, Volume 58: <blockquote>As a horticulturist Uvedale earned a reputation for his skill in cultivating exotics, being one of the earliest possessors of hothouses in England. In an ''Account of several Gardens near London'' written by J. Gibson in 1691 (''Arch\u00e6ologia'', 1794, xii. 188), the writer says: 'Dr. Uvedale of Enfield is a great lover of plants, and, having an extraordinary art in managing them, is become master of the greatest and choicest collection of exotic greens that is perhaps anywhere in this land. His greens take up six or seven houses or roomsteads. His orange-trees and largest myrtles fill up his biggest house, and \u2026 those more nice and curious plants that need closer keeping are in warmer rooms, and some of them stoved when he thinks fit. His flowers are choice, his stock numerous, and his culture of them very methodical and curious.'</blockquote>\n\n====John Keats====\nThe poet [[John Keats]] went to progressive Clarke's School in Enfield, where he began a translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]''. The school's building later became [[Enfield Town railway station]] until it was demolished in 1872. The current building was erected in the 1960s. In 1840 the first section of the [[Northern and Eastern Railway]] had been opened from [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] to [[Broxbourne]]. The branch line from Water Lane to Enfield Town  station was opened in 1849.\n\n====Silver Street White House====\nThe White House in Silver Street \u2013 now a doctors' surgery \u2013 was the home of [[Joseph Whitaker (publisher)|Joseph Whitaker]], publisher and founder of [[Whitaker's Almanack]], who lived there from 1820 until his death in 1895. (Inscription on Blue Plaque on The White House, Silver Street, Enfield.)\n\n====World's first ATM====\nEnfield Town had the world's first cash machine or [[automatic teller machine]], invented by [[John Shepherd-Barron]]. It was installed at the local branch of [[Barclays Bank]] on 27&nbsp;June 1967 and was opened by the actor and Enfield resident [[Reg Varney]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6230194.stm | work=BBC News | title=The man who invented the cash machine | date=25 June 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n====The Civic Centre====\nEnfield Town houses the Civic Centre, the headquarters of the Borough administration, where Council and committee meetings are also held.\n\n====August 2011 riots====\nOn Sunday 7 August 2011, after rioting spread from [[Tottenham riots 2011|Tottenham]], vehicles including a police car were attacked and several shops and business were targeted in the town centre. Most businesses remained closed on Monday 8th and many were not repaired for several weeks after the rioting. The mayor of London, [[Boris Johnson]], later visited the town centre to receive people's views of the riots.<ref>[http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/topstories/9182575.Police_car_trashed_by_Enfield_Town_rioters/ News report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928120514/http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/topstories/9182575.Police_car_trashed_by_Enfield_Town_rioters/ |date=28 September 2011 }} Retrieved 12 August 2011</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nNeighbourhoods and villages of Enfield Town include: [[Botany Bay]], [[Bulls Cross]], [[Bullsmoor]], [[Bush Hill Park]], [[Clay Hill]], [[Crews Hill]], [[Enfield Highway]], [[Enfield Lock]], [[Enfield Wash]], [[Forty Hill]], [[Freezywater]], [[Gordon Hill]], and [[Ponders End]].
