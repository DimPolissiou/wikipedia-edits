The community strives to keep the [[simulation]] as realistic as possible by using real world communication phraseology and operating procedures.\n\nIn doing so, BVA provides worthwhile training experiences to pilots in training (although flights flown online cannot be officially counted toward real-world [[flight training]]) and helps private and commercial pilots enhance skills and maintain proficiency in areas such as checklist usage, navigation, radio communications, and simulated emergencies.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = Boston Virtual ARTCC Welcome\n  | url = http://bvartcc.com/welcome/\n  | accessdate = 2013-08-21}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n  | work = AOPA\n  | title = Proficiency: To new heights\n  | url = http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2014/April/Pilot/1404p_pe_proficiency.aspx\n  | accessdate = 2014-03-28}}\n</ref>\n\nBVA operates exclusively in the [[Boston ARTCC]], regularly staffing airports like [[Boston Logan International Airport|Boston]], [[Bradley International Airport|Hartford/Bradley]], [[T.F.

It was erected to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at [[Apollo Bunder]], Mumbai (then Bombay) of [[Emperor of India|King-Emperor]] [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen-Empress Mary]], the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built, and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch. The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Marathi architecture. The final design of the monument by architect [[George Wittet]] was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a [[triumphal arch]] made of [[basalt]], which is {{convert|26|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} high.\n\nAfter its construction the gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to British India for important colonial personnel. It has been called a symbol of \"conquest and colonisation\" commemorating British colonial legacy. The gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel]] and overlooks the [[Arabian Sea]]. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for [[Hanukkah]] celebrations, with the lighting of the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]], since 2003. There are five jetties located at the gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.\n\nThe gateway was the site of a [[25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings|terror attack in August 2003]], when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|2008 Mumbai terror attacks]], in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.\n\nIn March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019.\n\n==History and significance==\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/1|total_width=200|| align=left|caption_align=left\n| image1 = Gateway of India, Bombay. 1911.JPG|caption1=The gateway, in 1924\n| image2 = Departure of British Troops from India - 28 February 1948 - Gateway of India.jpg|caption2=Departure of the last British troops from the gateway, in 1948}}\nThe gateway was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the [[Delhi Durbar|Delhi Durbar of 1911]]; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India.{{sfn|Dup\u00e9e, Jeffrey N.|2008|p=114}}{{sfn|Anthony Hewitt|1993|p=173}}{{sfn|Timothy H.

It was erected to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at [[Apollo Bunder]], Mumbai (then Bombay) of [[Emperor of India|King-Emperor]] [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen-Empress Mary]], the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built, and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch. The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the [[Indo-Saracenic]] style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Marathi architecture. The final design of the monument by architect [[George Wittet]] was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a [[triumphal arch]] made of [[basalt]], which is {{convert|26|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} high.\n\nAfter its construction the gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to British India for important colonial personnel. It has been called a symbol of \"conquest and colonisation\" commemorating British colonial legacy. The gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel]] and overlooks the [[Arabian Sea]]. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for [[Hanukkah]] celebrations, with the lighting of the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]], since 2003. There are five jetties located at the gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.\n\nThe gateway was the site of a [[25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings|terror attack in August 2003]], when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|2008 Mumbai terror attacks]], in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.\n\nIn March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019.\n\n==History and significance==\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/1|total_width=200|| align=left|caption_align=left\n| image1 = Gateway of India, Bombay. 1911.JPG|caption1=The gateway, in 1924\n| image2 = Departure of British Troops from India - 28 February 1948 - Gateway of India.jpg|caption2=Departure of the last British troops from the gateway, in 1948}}\nThe gateway was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the [[Delhi Durbar|Delhi Durbar of 1911]]; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India.{{sfn|Dup\u00e9e, Jeffrey N.|2008|p=114}}{{sfn|Anthony Hewitt|1993|p=173}}{{sfn|Timothy H.
