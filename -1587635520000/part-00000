The VMM states that the summit metabolism (or the maximum metabolic rate in response to the cold) increases during the winter, and that the sustained metabolism (or themetabolic rate that can be indefinitely sustained) remains a constant fraction of the former. The VFM says that the summit metabolism does not change, but that the sustained metabolism is a larger fraction of it. The VMM is supported in mammals, and, when using whole-body rates, passerine birds. The VFM is supported in studies of passerine birds using mass-specific metabolic rates (or metabolic rates per unit of mass).

Arthur Harris]] and Francis G. Benedict showed that approximate values for BMR could be derived using [[body surface area]] (computed from height and weight), age, and sex, along with the oxygen and carbon dioxide measures taken from calorimetry. Studies also showed that by eliminating the sex differences that occur with the accumulation of [[adipose tissue]] by expressing metabolic rate per unit of \"fat-free\" or [[lean body mass]], the values between sexes for basal metabolism are essentially the same. [[Exercise physiology]] textbooks have tables to show the conversion of height and body surface area as they relate to weight and basal metabolic values.\n\nThe primary [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] responsible for regulating metabolism is the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus is located on the [[diencephalon]] and forms the floor and part of the lateral walls of the third ventricle of the [[cerebrum]]. The chief functions of the hypothalamus are:\n\n:#control and integration of activities of the [[autonomic nervous system]] (ANS)\n:#*The ANS regulates contraction of smooth muscle and [[cardiac muscle]], along with secretions of many endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland (associated with many metabolic disorders).\n:#*Through the ANS, the hypothalamus is the main regulator of visceral activities, such as heart rate, movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract, and contraction of the urinary bladder.\n:#production and regulation of feelings of rage and aggression\n:#regulation of body temperature\n:#regulation of food intake, through two centers:\n:#*The feeding center or hunger center is responsible for the sensations that cause us to seek food. When sufficient food or substrates have been received and [[leptin]] is high, then the satiety center is stimulated and sends impulses that inhibit the feeding center. When insufficient food is present in the stomach and [[ghrelin]] levels are high, receptors in the hypothalamus initiate the sense of hunger.\n:#*The thirst center operates similarly when certain cells in the hypothalamus are stimulated by the rising [[osmotic pressure]] of the extracellular fluid. If thirst is satisfied, osmotic pressure decreases.\n\nAll of these functions taken together form a survival mechanism that causes us to sustain the body processes that BMR measures.\n\n===BMR estimation formulas===\nSeveral equations to predict the number of calories required by humans have been published from the early 20th\u201321st centuries.

The breakdown of large molecules into smaller molecules\u2014associated with release of energy\u2014is catabolism. The building up process is termed anabolism. The breakdown of proteins into amino acids is an example of catabolism, while the formation of proteins from amino acids is an anabolic process.\n\n[[Exergonic reaction]]s are energy-releasing reactions and are generally catabolic. Endergonic reactions require energy and include anabolic reactions and the contraction of muscle. Metabolism is the total of all catabolic, exergonic, anabolic, endergonic reactions.\n\n[[Adenosine Triphosphate]] (ATP) is the intermediate molecule that drives the exergonic transfer of energy to switch to endergonic anabolic reactions used in muscle contraction. This is what causes muscles to work which can require a breakdown, and also to build in the rest period, which occurs during the strengthening phase associated with muscular contraction. ATP is composed of adenine, a nitrogen containing base, ribose, a five carbon sugar (collectively called adenosine), and three phosphate groups. ATP is a high energy molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in the chemical bonds of the two terminal phosphate groups. The breaking of these chemical bonds in the Krebs Cycle provides the energy needed for muscular contraction.\n\n===Glucose===\nBecause the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms in all carbohydrates is always the same as that in water\u2014that is, 2 to 1\u2014all of the oxygen consumed by the cells is used to oxidize the carbon in the carbohydrate molecule to form carbon dioxide. Consequently, during the complete [[oxidation]] of a glucose molecule, six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water are produced and six molecules of oxygen are consumed.\n\nThe overall equation for this reaction is:\n\n:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 6 CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n(38 ATP molecules)\n\nBecause the gas exchange in this reaction is equal, the [[respiratory quotient]] (R.Q.) for carbohydrate is unity or 1.0:\n\n:R.Q. = 6 CO<sub>2</sub> / 6 O<sub>2</sub> = 1.0\n\n===Fats===\nThe chemical composition for fats differs from that of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, [[saturated fatty acid]], [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], [[unsaturated fat|monounsaturated fatty acid]], dietary [[cholesterol]], and [[trans fatty acid]]. From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a saturated fatty acid than an unsaturated fatty acid. The fatty acid molecule is broken down and categorized based on the number of carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a saturated fatty acid molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids. [[Palmitic acid]] is a commonly studied example of the saturated fatty acid molecule.\n\nThe overall equation for the substrate utilization of palmitic acid is:\n:C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 23 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 16 CO<sub>2</sub> + 16 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThus the R.Q. for palmitic acid is 0.696:\n\n:R.Q. = 16 CO<sub>2</sub> / 23 O<sub>2</sub> = 0.696\n\n===Proteins===\nProteins are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen arranged in a variety of ways to form a large combination of [[amino acids]]. Unlike fat the body has no storage deposits of protein. All of it is contained in the body as important parts of tissues, blood hormones, and enzymes. The structural components of the body that contain these amino acids are continually undergoing a process of breakdown and replacement. The respiratory quotient for protein metabolism can be demonstrated by the chemical equation for oxidation of albumin:\n\n:C<sub>72</sub>H<sub>112</sub>N<sub>18</sub>O<sub>22</sub>S + 77 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 63 CO<sub>2</sub> + 38 H<sub>2</sub>O + SO<sub>3</sub> + 9 CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe R.Q. for albumin is 63 CO<sub>2</sub>/ 77 O<sub>2</sub> = 0.818\n\nThe reason this is important in the process of understanding protein metabolism is that the body can blend the three macronutrients and based on the mitochondrial density, a preferred ratio can be established which determines how much fuel is utilized in which packets for work accomplished by the muscles. Protein catabolism (breakdown) has been estimated to supply 10% to 15% of the total energy requirement during a two-hour aerobic training session. This process could severely degrade the protein structures needed to maintain survival such as contractile properties of proteins in the heart, cellular mitochondria, myoglobin storage, and metabolic enzymes within muscles.\n\nThe oxidative system (aerobic) is the primary source of ATP supplied to the body at rest and during low intensity activities and uses primarily carbohydrates and fats as substrates. Protein is not normally metabolized significantly, except during long term starvation and long bouts of exercise (greater than 90 minutes.) At rest approximately 70% of the ATP produced is derived from fats and 30% from carbohydrates.

That biomass (W) is subjected to deterioration over time from thermodynamic, entropic pressure. Metabolism is essentially understood as [[redox]] coupling, and has nothing to do with thermogenesis. Metabolic efficiency (ME) is then expressed as the efficiency of this coupling, a ratio of [[ampere]]s{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=Why electric charge appears here out of a sudden?}} captured and used by biomass, to the amperes available for that purpose. MR is measured in watts, W is measured in grams. These factors are combined in a power law, an elaboration on [[Kleiber's law]] relating MR to W and MPLS, that appears as MR = W^ (4ME-1)/4ME.{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=Where is MPLS in this equation? Why MR is not in watts as described one sentence earlier?}} When ME is 100%, MR = W^3/4; this is popularly known as quarter power scaling, a version of allometric scaling that is premised upon unrealistic estimates of biological efficiency.\n\nThe equation reveals that as ME drops below 20%, for W < one gram, MR/MPLS increases so dramatically as to endow W with virtual immortality by 16%. The smaller W is to begin with, the more dramatic is the increase in MR as ME diminishes. All of the cells of an organism fit into this range, i.e., less than one gram, and so this MR will be referred to as BMR.\n\nBut the equation reveals that as ME increases over 25%, BMR approaches zero. The equation also shows that for all W > one gram, where W is the organization of all of the BMRs of the organism's structure, but also includes the activity of the structure, as ME increases over 25%, MR/MPLS increases rather than decreases, as it does for BMR. An MR made up of an organization of BMRs will be referred to as an FMR.{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=What FMR stands for?}} As ME decreases below 25%, FMR diminishes rather than increases as it does for BMR.\n\nThe antagonism between FMR and BMR is what marks the process of aging of biomass W in energetic terms. The ME for the organism is the same as that for the cells, such that the success of the organism's ability to find food (and lower its ME), is key to maintaining the BMR of the cells driven, otherwise, by starvation, to approaching zero; while at the same time a lower ME diminishes the FMR/MPLS of the organism.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n==Medical considerations==\nA person's metabolism varies with their physical condition and activity.

The VFM says that the summit metabolism does not change, but that the sustained metabolism is a larger fraction of it. The VMM is supported in mammals, and, when using whole-body rates, passerine birds.

Arthur Harris]] and Francis G. Benedict showed that approximate values for BMR could be derived using [[body surface area]] (computed from height and weight), age, and sex, along with the oxygen and carbon dioxide measures taken from calorimetry. Studies also showed that by eliminating the sex differences that occur with the accumulation of [[adipose tissue]] by expressing metabolic rate per unit of \"fat-free\" or [[lean body mass]], the values between sexes for basal metabolism are essentially the same. [[Exercise physiology]] textbooks have tables to show the conversion of height and body surface area as they relate to weight and basal metabolic values.\n\nThe primary [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] responsible for regulating metabolism is the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus is located on the [[diencephalon]] and forms the floor and part of the lateral walls of the third ventricle of the [[cerebrum]]. The chief functions of the hypothalamus are:\n\n:#control and integration of activities of the [[autonomic nervous system]] (ANS)\n:#*The ANS regulates contraction of smooth muscle and [[cardiac muscle]], along with secretions of many endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland (associated with many metabolic disorders).\n:#*Through the ANS, the hypothalamus is the main regulator of visceral activities, such as heart rate, movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract, and contraction of the urinary bladder.\n:#production and regulation of feelings of rage and aggression\n:#regulation of body temperature\n:#regulation of food intake, through two centers:\n:#*The feeding center or hunger center is responsible for the sensations that cause us to seek food. When sufficient food or substrates have been received and [[leptin]] is high, then the satiety center is stimulated and sends impulses that inhibit the feeding center. When insufficient food is present in the stomach and [[ghrelin]] levels are high, receptors in the hypothalamus initiate the sense of hunger.\n:#*The thirst center operates similarly when certain cells in the hypothalamus are stimulated by the rising [[osmotic pressure]] of the extracellular fluid. If thirst is satisfied, osmotic pressure decreases.\n\nAll of these functions taken together form a survival mechanism that causes us to sustain the body processes that BMR measures.\n\n===BMR estimation formulas===\nSeveral equations to predict the number of calories required by humans have been published from the early 20th\u201321st centuries.

The breakdown of large molecules into smaller molecules\u2014associated with release of energy\u2014is catabolism. The building up process is termed anabolism. The breakdown of proteins into amino acids is an example of catabolism, while the formation of proteins from amino acids is an anabolic process.\n\n[[Exergonic reaction]]s are energy-releasing reactions and are generally catabolic. Endergonic reactions require energy and include anabolic reactions and the contraction of muscle. Metabolism is the total of all catabolic, exergonic, anabolic, endergonic reactions.\n\n[[Adenosine Triphosphate]] (ATP) is the intermediate molecule that drives the exergonic transfer of energy to switch to endergonic anabolic reactions used in muscle contraction. This is what causes muscles to work which can require a breakdown, and also to build in the rest period, which occurs during the strengthening phase associated with muscular contraction. ATP is composed of adenine, a nitrogen containing base, ribose, a five carbon sugar (collectively called adenosine), and three phosphate groups. ATP is a high energy molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in the chemical bonds of the two terminal phosphate groups. The breaking of these chemical bonds in the Krebs Cycle provides the energy needed for muscular contraction.\n\n===Glucose===\nBecause the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms in all carbohydrates is always the same as that in water\u2014that is, 2 to 1\u2014all of the oxygen consumed by the cells is used to oxidize the carbon in the carbohydrate molecule to form carbon dioxide. Consequently, during the complete [[oxidation]] of a glucose molecule, six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water are produced and six molecules of oxygen are consumed.\n\nThe overall equation for this reaction is:\n\n:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 6 CO<sub>2</sub> + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n(38 ATP molecules)\n\nBecause the gas exchange in this reaction is equal, the [[respiratory quotient]] (R.Q.) for carbohydrate is unity or 1.0:\n\n:R.Q. = 6 CO<sub>2</sub> / 6 O<sub>2</sub> = 1.0\n\n===Fats===\nThe chemical composition for fats differs from that of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, [[saturated fatty acid]], [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], [[unsaturated fat|monounsaturated fatty acid]], dietary [[cholesterol]], and [[trans fatty acid]]. From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a saturated fatty acid than an unsaturated fatty acid. The fatty acid molecule is broken down and categorized based on the number of carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a saturated fatty acid molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids. [[Palmitic acid]] is a commonly studied example of the saturated fatty acid molecule.\n\nThe overall equation for the substrate utilization of palmitic acid is:\n:C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 23 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 16 CO<sub>2</sub> + 16 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThus the R.Q. for palmitic acid is 0.696:\n\n:R.Q. = 16 CO<sub>2</sub> / 23 O<sub>2</sub> = 0.696\n\n===Proteins===\nProteins are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen arranged in a variety of ways to form a large combination of [[amino acids]]. Unlike fat the body has no storage deposits of protein. All of it is contained in the body as important parts of tissues, blood hormones, and enzymes. The structural components of the body that contain these amino acids are continually undergoing a process of breakdown and replacement. The respiratory quotient for protein metabolism can be demonstrated by the chemical equation for oxidation of albumin:\n\n:C<sub>72</sub>H<sub>112</sub>N<sub>18</sub>O<sub>22</sub>S + 77 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 63 CO<sub>2</sub> + 38 H<sub>2</sub>O + SO<sub>3</sub> + 9 CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe R.Q. for albumin is 63 CO<sub>2</sub>/ 77 O<sub>2</sub> = 0.818\n\nThe reason this is important in the process of understanding protein metabolism is that the body can blend the three macronutrients and based on the mitochondrial density, a preferred ratio can be established which determines how much fuel is utilized in which packets for work accomplished by the muscles. Protein catabolism (breakdown) has been estimated to supply 10% to 15% of the total energy requirement during a two-hour aerobic training session. This process could severely degrade the protein structures needed to maintain survival such as contractile properties of proteins in the heart, cellular mitochondria, myoglobin storage, and metabolic enzymes within muscles.\n\nThe oxidative system (aerobic) is the primary source of ATP supplied to the body at rest and during low intensity activities and uses primarily carbohydrates and fats as substrates. Protein is not normally metabolized significantly, except during long term starvation and long bouts of exercise (greater than 90 minutes.) At rest approximately 70% of the ATP produced is derived from fats and 30% from carbohydrates. Following the onset of activity, as the intensity of the exercise increases, there is a shift in substrate preference from fats to carbohydrates. During high intensity aerobic exercise, almost 100% of the energy is derived from carbohydrates, if an adequate supply is available.\n\n===Aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise===\nStudies published in 1992<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1550061 |year=1992 |last1=Broeder |first1=CE |last2=Burrhus |first2=KA |last3=Svanevik |first3=LS |last4=Wilmore |first4=JH |title=The effects of aerobic fitness on resting metabolic rate |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=795\u2013801 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi=10.1093/ajcn/55.4.795 }}</ref> and 1997<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9029211 |year=1997 |last1=Smith |first1=DA |last2=Dollman |first2=J |last3=Withers |first3=RT |last4=Brinkman |first4=M |last5=Keeves |first5=JP |last6=Clark |first6=DG |title=Relationship between maximum aerobic power and resting metabolic rate in young adult women |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=156\u201363 |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |doi=10.1152/jappl.1997.82.1.156|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3cfe8fd2165d071b5c51fcfeea59fd7deb98fd9 }}</ref> indicate that the level of [[Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] fitness of an individual does not have any correlation with the level of resting metabolism.

Resistance training causes injuries at a much higher rate than aerobic training.<ref name=\"Schwingshackl L, Dias S, Strasser B, Hoffmann G 2013 e82853\"/> Compared to resistance training, it was found that aerobic training resulted in a significantly more pronounced reduction of body weight by enhancing the cardiovascular system which is what is the principal factor in metabolic utilization of fat substrates. Resistance training if time is available is also helpful in post-exercise metabolism, but it is an adjunctive factor because the body needs to heal sufficiently between resistance training episodes, whereas with aerobic training, the body can accept this every day.

That biomass (W) is subjected to deterioration over time from thermodynamic, entropic pressure. Metabolism is essentially understood as [[redox]] coupling, and has nothing to do with thermogenesis. Metabolic efficiency (ME) is then expressed as the efficiency of this coupling, a ratio of [[ampere]]s{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=Why electric charge appears here out of a sudden?}} captured and used by biomass, to the amperes available for that purpose. MR is measured in watts, W is measured in grams. These factors are combined in a power law, an elaboration on [[Kleiber's law]] relating MR to W and MPLS, that appears as MR = W^ (4ME-1)/4ME.{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=Where is MPLS in this equation? Why MR is not in watts as described one sentence earlier?}} When ME is 100%, MR = W^3/4; this is popularly known as quarter power scaling, a version of allometric scaling that is premised upon unrealistic estimates of biological efficiency.\n\nThe equation reveals that as ME drops below 20%, for W < one gram, MR/MPLS increases so dramatically as to endow W with virtual immortality by 16%. The smaller W is to begin with, the more dramatic is the increase in MR as ME diminishes. All of the cells of an organism fit into this range, i.e., less than one gram, and so this MR will be referred to as BMR.\n\nBut the equation reveals that as ME increases over 25%, BMR approaches zero. The equation also shows that for all W > one gram, where W is the organization of all of the BMRs of the organism's structure, but also includes the activity of the structure, as ME increases over 25%, MR/MPLS increases rather than decreases, as it does for BMR. An MR made up of an organization of BMRs will be referred to as an FMR.{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=What FMR stands for?}} As ME decreases below 25%, FMR diminishes rather than increases as it does for BMR.\n\nThe antagonism between FMR and BMR is what marks the process of aging of biomass W in energetic terms. The ME for the organism is the same as that for the cells, such that the success of the organism's ability to find food (and lower its ME), is key to maintaining the BMR of the cells driven, otherwise, by starvation, to approaching zero; while at the same time a lower ME diminishes the FMR/MPLS of the organism.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n==Medical considerations==\nA person's metabolism varies with their physical condition and activity.

The anaerobic threshold is defined as the energy utilization level of heart rate exertion that occurs without oxygen during a standardized test with a specific protocol for accuracy of measurement,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} such as the Bruce Treadmill protocol (see [[metabolic equivalent of task]]). With four to six weeks of targeted training the body systems can adapt to a higher perfusion of mitochondrial density for increased oxygen availability for the Krebs cycle, or tricarboxylic cycle, or the glycolitic cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This in turn leads to a lower resting heart rate, lower blood pressure, and increased resting or basal metabolic rate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nBy measuring heart rate we can then derive estimations of what level of substrate utilization is actually causing biochemical metabolism in our bodies at rest or in activity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This in turn can help a person to maintain an appropriate level of consumption and utilization by studying a graphical representation of the anaerobic threshold.
