Written [[English language|English]] lacks a standard way to mark irony, and several forms of [[punctuation]] have been proposed. Among the oldest and most frequently attested is the '''percontation point''' proposed by English printer [[Henry Denham]] in the 1580s, and the '''irony mark''', used by [[Marcellin Jobard]] and French poet [[Alcanter de Brahm]] during the 19th century. Both marks take the form of a reversed [[question mark]], \"\u2e2e\".\n\nIrony punctuation is primarily used to indicate that a sentence should be understood at a second level. A bracketed [[Exclamation point#Sarcasm|exclamation point]] or question mark as well as [[scare quotes]] are also occasionally used to express irony or sarcasm.\n\n==Percontation point==\nThe percontation point \n{{nowrap|([[File: Irony_mark_full.svg|8px]])}}\n, a reversed question mark later referred to as a rhetorical question mark, was proposed by [[Henry Denham]] in the 1580s and was used at the end of a question that does not require an answer\u2014a [[rhetorical question]].

Both marks take the form of a reversed [[question mark]], \"\u2e2e\".\n\nIrony punctuation is primarily used to indicate that a sentence should be understood at a second level. A bracketed [[Exclamation point#Sarcasm|exclamation point]] or question mark as well as [[scare quotes]] are also occasionally used to express irony or sarcasm.\n\n==Percontation point==\nThe percontation point \n{{nowrap|([[File: Irony_mark_full.svg|8px]])}}\n, a reversed question mark later referred to as a rhetorical question mark, was proposed by [[Henry Denham]] in the 1580s and was used at the end of a question that does not require an answer\u2014a [[rhetorical question]].
