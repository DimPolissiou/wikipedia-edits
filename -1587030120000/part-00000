The most prevalent cause put forward for TRS is that of mutation in the genes responsible for drug effectiveness. These include [[CYP3A4|liver enzyme genes]] that control the [[bioavailability|availability of a drug]] to brain targets, and genes responsible for the structure and function of these targets. In the [[large intestine|colon]] the bacteria encode a hundred times more genes than exist in the [[human genome]]. Only a fraction of ingested drugs reach the colon, having been already exposed to small intestinal bacteria, and absorbed in the [[portal circulation]]. This small fraction is then subject to the [[drug metabolism|metabolic action]] of many communities of bacteria. Activation of the drug depends on the composition and enzymes of the bacteria and of the specifics of the drug, and therefore a great deal of individual variation can affect both the usefulness of the drug and its tolerability. It is suggested that [[parenteral administration]] of antipsychotics would bypass the gut and be more successful in overcoming TRS. The composition of gut microbiota is variable between individuals, but they are seen to remain stable. However, phyla can change in response to many factors including ageing, diet, substance-use, and medications \u2013 especially antibiotics, laxatives, and antipsychotics. In FEP, schizophrenia has been linked to significant changes in the gut microbiota that can predict response to treatment.<ref name=\"Seeman\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Seeman MV |title=The Gut Microbiome and Treatment-Resistance in Schizophrenia |journal=The Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=127\u2013136 |date=March 2020 |pmid=31781943|doi=10.1007/s11126-019-09695-4}}</ref>\n\n===Supplements===\nDisruption of the [[gut microbiota]] has been linked to inflammation, and disorders of the central nervous system.

The most prevalent cause put forward for TRS is that of mutation in the genes responsible for drug effectiveness. These include [[CYP3A4|liver enzyme genes]] that control the [[bioavailability|availability of a drug]] to brain targets, and genes responsible for the structure and function of these targets. In the [[large intestine|colon]] the bacteria encode a hundred times more genes than exist in the [[human genome]]. Only a fraction of ingested drugs reach the colon, having been already exposed to small intestinal bacteria, and absorbed in the [[portal circulation]]. This small fraction is then subject to the [[drug metabolism|metabolic action]] of many communities of bacteria. Activation of the drug depends on the composition and enzymes of the bacteria and of the specifics of the drug, and therefore a great deal of individual variation can affect both the usefulness of the drug and its tolerability. It is suggested that [[parenteral administration]] of antipsychotics would bypass the gut and be more successful in overcoming TRS. The composition of gut microbiota is variable between individuals, but they are seen to remain stable. However, phyla can change in response to many factors including ageing, diet, substance-use, and medications \u2013 especially antibiotics, laxatives, and antipsychotics. In FEP, schizophrenia has been linked to significant changes in the gut microbiota that can predict response to treatment.<ref name=\"Seeman\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Seeman MV |title=The Gut Microbiome and Treatment-Resistance in Schizophrenia |journal=The Psychiatric Quarterly |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=127\u2013136 |date=March 2020 |pmid=31781943|doi=10.1007/s11126-019-09695-4}}</ref>\n\n===Supplements===\nDisruption of the [[gut microbiota]] has been linked to inflammation, and disorders of the central nervous system.

For people suffering from severe schizophrenia, and discharged from a stay in hospital, these services are often brought together in an integrated approach to offer support in the community away from the hospital setting. In addition to medicine management, housing, and finances, assistance is given for more routine matters such as help with shopping and using public transport. This approach is known as [[assertive community treatment]] (ACT) and has been shown to achieve positive results in symptoms, social functioning and quality of life.<ref name=\"Bond\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bond GR, Drake RE | title = The critical ingredients of assertive community treatment. | journal = World Psychiatry | date = June 2015 | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 240\u20132 | doi = 10.1002/wps.20234 | pmid = 26043344| pmc = 4471983 }}</ref><ref name=\"Smeerdijk\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Smeerdijk M | title = [Using resource groups in assertive community treatment; literature review and recommendation]. | journal = Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie | date = 2017 | volume = 59 | issue = 8 | pages = 466\u2013473 | pmid = 28880347}}</ref> Another more intense approach is known as ''intensive care management'' (ICM).

James (Secretary-Treasurer)\n* Harry McLaughlin (Councillor)\n\nMcGill University applied to join the league but was turned down.\n\nThe use of netting for the goal was demonstrated with a model produced by Frank Stocking, [[goaltender]] of the Quebec club at the annual meeting. After an exhibition game between the Shamrocks and Victorias, the use of goal nets was approved for league play, and used for the season. The netting connected the two upright posts, but there was no crossbar across the top.\n\nThe use of hockey gloves was quite common and shin guards were now mostly in use inside the stockings though some players still used the old style outside the stockings.\n\n==Season==\nStar rover [[Graham Drinkwater]] retired from the Victorias before the season.\n\n===Highlights===\nThe Shamrocks won the championship losing only one game, and that, after the league championship was decided. This was the second year in a row for the Shamrocks, who were a mediocre team before this stretch of success and would return to it the next year.\n\n===Final standing===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

James (Secretary-Treasurer)\n* Harry McLaughlin (Councillor)\n\nMcGill University applied to join the league but was turned down.\n\nThe use of netting for the goal was demonstrated with a model produced by Frank Stocking, [[goaltender]] of the Quebec club at the annual meeting. After an exhibition game between the Shamrocks and Victorias, the use of goal nets was approved for league play, and used for the season. The netting connected the two upright posts, but there was no crossbar across the top.\n\nThe use of hockey gloves was quite common and shin guards were now mostly in use inside the stockings though some players still used the old style outside the stockings.\n\n==Season==\nStar rover [[Graham Drinkwater]] retired from the Victorias before the season.\n\n===Highlights===\nThe Shamrocks won the championship losing only one game, and that, after the league championship was decided. This was the second year in a row for the Shamrocks, who were a mediocre team before this stretch of success and would return to it the next year.\n\n===Final standing===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
