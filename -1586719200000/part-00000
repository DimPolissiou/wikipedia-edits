Hearing students are admitted to the graduate school and a small number are also admitted as undergraduates each year.

[[Ronda Jo Miller]], most certainly the greatest women's basketball player in the program's history, was a three-time Division III All-America selection, as well as one of the top women's volleyball players.\n\nUnder the leadership of coach Kitty Baldridge, Miller, Touria Ouahid, Ronda Johnson and Jenny Cooper led the Bison to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three seasons. Receiving one of the lowest seeds as an at-large team into the Division III NCAA Tournament field, which numbered just 48 teams, the Bison traveled to St. Mary's College (Md.), the school which had just defeated them in the Capital Athletic Conference tournament, and came away with an 80\u201373 win. In the second round, Gallaudet faced a team from The College of New Jersey which had received a first-round bye and was highly favored, but Miller poured in 38 points, using a variety of impressive shots. The Bison advanced to the Sweet 16 round of the 1999 tournament before falling to host school Salem State College (Mass.).<ref name=D3hoops1>{{cite web|title=Beware the Thundering Herd|url=http://www.d3hoops.com/notables/1999/03/beware-thundering-herd-gallaudet|work=D3hoops.com|publisher=D3hoops.com|accessdate=23 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402171942/http://www.d3hoops.com/notables/1999/03/beware-thundering-herd-gallaudet|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nMiller finished with 2,656 points scored, 1,545 rebounds and 373 blocked shots, and was called \"one of the best basketball players in Division III history\" by the NCAA.<ref name=NCAA>{{cite web|title=Embracing the silence|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/embracing-silence|work=NCAA.org|publisher=NCAA.org|accessdate=23 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312153846/http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/embracing-silence|archivedate=March 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nKevin Cook coached the team briefly to success.

It was the first school for the advanced education of the deaf and hard of hearing in the world and remains the only higher education institution in which all programs and services are specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students. Hearing students are admitted to the graduate school and a small number are also admitted as undergraduates each year. The university was named after [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], a notable figure in the advancement of deaf education.\n\nGallaudet University is officially bilingual, with [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and written [[English language|English]] used for instruction and by the college community.

Two houses were used, one purchased and one rented. On November 1, 1858, the First Annual Report was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1858.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=1 November 1858|accessdate=18 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209174704/http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1858.pdf|archivedate=February 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edward Miner Gallaudet - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Edward M.

There were 24 deaf students, necessitating a second teacher of the deaf.

Plans were underway to construct a new building using $9,000 that Congress appropriated to the school.  There were 35 deaf students and 6 blind students.  During vacation in August a regiment of troops used the brick building for a hospital, and some of the students who stayed over the summer helped with tending to the sick soldiers. One soldier died.

An elaborate inauguration ceremony was held in June with [[Laurent Clerc]] in attendance. Fourteen acres of land was purchased with money supplied by the government. Gallaudet was promoted to the position of president of the institution. He continued to push for funds for expansion and new buildings.

Gallaudet proposed that a representative of the school be sent to Europe to study the methods employed there, in order to determine which types of instructional methods might be added to those methods already being used successfully at the Columbia Institution and other American schools.  Combined enrollment of all levels of instruction, including the collegiate level, exceeded 100 for the first time during this year.

Coral reefs occupy less than one percent of the ocean floor but are the home to many marine animals and over 4,000 fish on its own. Coral reefs provide resources to over 500 million people in over 100 countries in the world and are great for the economy. Unfortunately, coral reefs are in great danger due to coral bleaching. <ref>{{Citation|title=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412994064.n179|work=Encyclopedia of Disaster Relief|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4129-7101-0|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>Coral bleaching occurs when corals are presented with very stressful and harm conditions like temperature, light, or nutrients that causes them to expel symbiotic algae that live in their tissues resulting them to turn completely white. Corals are healthy when a brownish tone is evident, but when a white tone is shown this is a sign of the bleaching that has occurred. Coral and algae depend on one another in order to survive and give off that healthy brown tone in a symbiont relationship, but when these corals are stressed the algae are forced to leave causing a change in color. When corals are bleached it doesn\u2019t mean they have died, they can survive the stress they experience through coral bleaching, but they are more susceptible to becoming vulnerable and mortality in the long run.Evidence shows that oceans are warming due to the rise in temperature that for the most part are due to greenhouse gases resulting from humans; an example of an anthropogenic disturbance. Corals, unfortunately, do not do well in very warm or cold waters since they release the algae (zooxanthellae) that live in their tissues. The different impacts include warming oceans, sea level rise, changes in storm patterns, changes in precipitation, altered ocean currents, and ocean acidification. The influences combined, impact the services coral reefs provide.\n[[File:Climate_change_threats_to_coral_reefs.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Climate_change_threats_to_coral_reefs.png|thumb|Climate changes are a threat to coral reefs that will eventually lead to coral bleaching.]]\n[[File:Coral_Reef_in_Malluse_Tasi.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coral_Reef_in_Malluse_Tasi.jpg|thumb|Coral Reef that has been bleached due to changes in tempertaure]]\nCoral bleaching has occurred at a large scale all around the world. One major event of coral bleaching occurred in the United States where the Caribbean in 2005 lost more than half of its reefs. The ocean water centered in northern Antilles near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was too warm for the coral reefs that lead to extreme thermal stress<ref>{{Citation|last=Prono|first=Luca|title=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412963893.n448|work=Encyclopedia of Global Warming and Climate Change|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4129-5878-3|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>. The thermal stress was recorded to be so large compared to all the stress of the previous 20 years combined. Another case of coral reefs being greatly affected happened near the Florida Keys where a large amount of corals died when the water temperatures dropped way to low that this cold- stress event lead to many different corals being impacted<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=David J.|date=2020-03-17|title=Opposing climate-change impacts on poleward-shifting coral-reef fishes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01919-5|journal=Coral Reefs|doi=10.1007/s00338-020-01919-5|issn=0722-4028}}</ref>. Thus, coral bleaching can occur at temperatures at either ends of the spectrum, too hot or too cold.\n\nGlobal warming is mainly known for rising temperatures, but along with the rising temperatures causing coral bleaching cascading events like changes in wind patterns, jet streams, and water circulation are occurring. If humans continue to mine and burn coal causing a release of carbon pollution into the air which is heating the Earth and warming the oceans. It was thought for a long time that the main cause for coral bleaching brought about direct anthropogenic effects like water pollution and sedimentation, but evidence has shown that anthropogenic global climate changes have dominated. About 50%-70% of these global climate changes are directly affecting these reefs which including the rising in temperature, increasing oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> (ocean acidification), changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels, and circulation. Research has shown that over the years there has been an increase of 1\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C in sea surface temperature that has led to the mortality of so many reefs<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Barkley|first=Hannah C.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1575/1912/8427|title=A scientific framework for evaluating coral reef resilience to climate change|date=2016|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|location=Woods Hole, MA}}</ref>. For example, the reefs in Guam in the past 40 years have declined from 50% in 1960 and 25% in the 1990\u2019s. If these types of patterns continue, coral reefs will reach mortality quickly. Not only is coral bleaching affecting species diversity, but it is depleting resources that provide millions with medicine, food, protection, and funds from fishing and tourism.

Coral reefs occupy less than one percent of the ocean floor but are the home to many marine animals and over 4,000 fish on its own. Coral reefs provide resources to over 500 million people in over 100 countries in the world and are great for the economy. Unfortunately, coral reefs are in great danger due to coral bleaching. <ref>{{Citation|title=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412994064.n179|work=Encyclopedia of Disaster Relief|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4129-7101-0|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>Coral bleaching occurs when corals are presented with very stressful and harm conditions like temperature, light, or nutrients that causes them to expel symbiotic algae that live in their tissues resulting them to turn completely white. Corals are healthy when a brownish tone is evident, but when a white tone is shown this is a sign of the bleaching that has occurred. Coral and algae depend on one another in order to survive and give off that healthy brown tone in a symbiont relationship, but when these corals are stressed the algae are forced to leave causing a change in color. When corals are bleached it doesn\u2019t mean they have died, they can survive the stress they experience through coral bleaching, but they are more susceptible to becoming vulnerable and mortality in the long run.Evidence shows that oceans are warming due to the rise in temperature that for the most part are due to greenhouse gases resulting from humans; an example of an anthropogenic disturbance. Corals, unfortunately, do not do well in very warm or cold waters since they release the algae (zooxanthellae) that live in their tissues. The different impacts include warming oceans, sea level rise, changes in storm patterns, changes in precipitation, altered ocean currents, and ocean acidification. The influences combined, impact the services coral reefs provide.\n[[File:Climate_change_threats_to_coral_reefs.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Climate_change_threats_to_coral_reefs.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Coral_Reef_in_Malluse_Tasi.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coral_Reef_in_Malluse_Tasi.jpg|thumb]]\nCoral bleaching has occurred at a large scale all around the world. One major event of coral bleaching occurred in the United States where the Caribbean in 2005 lost more than half of its reefs. The ocean water centered in northern Antilles near the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was too warm for the coral reefs that lead to extreme thermal stress<ref>{{Citation|last=Prono|first=Luca|title=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412963893.n448|work=Encyclopedia of Global Warming and Climate Change|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4129-5878-3|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>. The thermal stress was recorded to be so large compared to all the stress of the previous 20 years combined. Another case of coral reefs being greatly affected happened near the Florida Keys where a large amount of corals died when the water temperatures dropped way to low that this cold- stress event lead to many different corals being impacted<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=David J.|date=2020-03-17|title=Opposing climate-change impacts on poleward-shifting coral-reef fishes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01919-5|journal=Coral Reefs|doi=10.1007/s00338-020-01919-5|issn=0722-4028}}</ref>. Thus, coral bleaching can occur at temperatures at either ends of the spectrum, too hot or too cold.\n\nGlobal warming is mainly known for rising temperatures, but along with the rising temperatures causing coral bleaching cascading events like changes in wind patterns, jet streams, and water circulation are occurring. If humans continue to mine and burn coal causing a release of carbon pollution into the air which is heating the Earth and warming the oceans. It was thought for a long time that the main cause for coral bleaching brought about direct anthropogenic effects like water pollution and sedimentation, but evidence has shown that anthropogenic global climate changes have dominated. About 50%-70% of these global climate changes are directly affecting these reefs which including the rising in temperature, increasing oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> (ocean acidification), changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels, and circulation. Research has shown that over the years there has been an increase of 1\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C in sea surface temperature that has led to the mortality of so many reefs<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Barkley|first=Hannah C.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1575/1912/8427|title=A scientific framework for evaluating coral reef resilience to climate change|date=2016|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|location=Woods Hole, MA}}</ref>. For example, the reefs in Guam in the past 40 years have declined from 50% in 1960 and 25% in the 1990\u2019s. If these types of patterns continue, coral reefs will reach mortality quickly. Not only is coral bleaching affecting species diversity, but it is depleting resources that provide millions with medicine, food, protection, and funds from fishing and tourism. Approximately 99 reef countries exist that provide resources to about six million fishermen<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=SUZUKI|first=Rintaro|date=2017|title=Activities by NGOs to conserve coral reefs facing large-scale coral bleaching|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3755/jcrs.19.135|journal=Journal of the Japanese Coral Reef Society|volume=19|issue=1|pages=135\u2013142|doi=10.3755/jcrs.19.135|issn=1345-1421}}</ref>.
