Anthropogenic means caused by humans. The list covers the name of the event, location and the start and end of each event. Some events may belong in more than one category. In addition, some of the listed events overlap each other, and in some cases the death toll from a smaller event is included in the one for the larger event or time period of which it was part. \n\nThere is often large uncertainty about the number of deaths. The tables are initially sorted by the [[geometric mean]], meaning the square root of the product of the lowest and highest estimate.

The principal actors in the war were the [[Communist Party of Peru]] or \"Shining Path\" and the government of Peru; the [[Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] was also involved and other paramilitary entities. [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] reached a figure of approx. 68,784 deaths and disappearances, of which 54% were ascribed to Shining Path, 1.5% to Tupac Amaru and 37% to State officials, who were also responsible for 83% of reported cases of sexual violence, and systematic use of torture. An academic research published in 2019 contests the Commission's methodology, reaching a total figure of approx. 47,849, of which 27,872 were victims of State officials, 18,341 of the Shining Path, and 1,636 by all other actors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rendon|first=Silvio|date=January 1, 2019 |title=Capturing correctly: A reanalysis of the indirect capture\u2013recapture methods in the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission|journal=Research & Politics|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|page=2053168018820375|doi=10.1177/2053168018820375|issn=2053-1680}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rendon|first=Silvio|date=April 1, 2019 |title=A truth commission did not tell the truth: A rejoinder to Manrique-Vallier and Ball|journal=Research & Politics|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|page=2053168019840972|doi=10.1177/2053168019840972|issn=2053-1680}}</ref>\n|-\n||War crimes during the [[Sheikh Said rebellion]]\n||{{ntsh|17321}}15,000\n20,000<ref name=\"The Militant Kurds page 86\" />\n||{{ntsh|100000}}40,000\n250,000<ref name=\"page 104\" />\n||{{ntsh|41618}}24,495\n70,711\n||[[Turkey]]\n||1925\n||1925\n|1 month\n||The [[Sheikh Said Rebellion]] was a rebellion to revive the Islamic Caliphate System, and used elements of Kurdish nationalism for recruiting.<ref name=\":37\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cw5V1c1ej_cC&pg=PA147|title=From Caliphate to Secular State: Power Struggle in the Early Turkish Republic: Power Struggle in the Early Turkish Republic|author=Hakan Ozoglu Ph.D.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=978-0-313-37957-4|page=147}}</ref> It was led by [[Sheikh Said]] and a group of former Ottoman soldiers, known as [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye soldiers]].

The parameters were limited to the intentional and indiscriminate [[murder]], [[torture]], or mutilation of civilians, the wounded, and prisoners.

The Final Solution. The Attempt to Exterminate the Jews of Europe, 1939\u20131945. New York City: Beechhurst Press.</ref><ref>Early efforts by scholars to determine the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis were limited by a lack of access to pertinent records. The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was Gerald Reitlinger's Final Solution (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. Raul Hilberg's 1961 [[The Destruction of the European Jews]] became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 \u2013 5.4 million broadly construed. The trial of Adolph Eichmann further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was Lucy Dawidowicz's The War Against the Jews, published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's Encyclopedia of the Holocaust was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.Wolfgang Benz's The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide, published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref><ref>Davies, Norman (2012).

The parameters were limited to the intentional and indiscriminate [[murder]], [[torture]], or mutilation of civilians, the wounded, and prisoners. The results revealed that 7,193 people died from atrocities perpetrated by those of European descent, and 9,156 people died from atrocities perpetrated by Native Americans.<ref name=\"Osborn, William M. 2001\">Osborn, William M.

New York City: Beechhurst Press.</ref><ref>Early efforts by scholars to determine the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis were limited by a lack of access to pertinent records. The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was Gerald Reitlinger's Final Solution (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. Raul Hilberg's 1961 [[The Destruction of the European Jews]] became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 \u2013 5.4 million broadly construed. The trial of Adolph Eichmann further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was Lucy Dawidowicz's The War Against the Jews, published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's Encyclopedia of the Holocaust was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.Wolfgang Benz's The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide, published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref><ref>Davies, Norman (2012).

The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . . . All in all, the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included. For the Soviets during the Stalin period, the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million.

His elder brother Claude was made a [[Champion de Crespigny baronets|baronet]] in 1805.\n\nPhilip Champion de Crespigny was probably educated at [[Eton College]] in 1748, and was an advocate of [[Doctors' Commons]] in 1759. In 1768 he became [[Government Legal Department|King's Proctor]] and held the post until 1784.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/crespigny-philip-champion-1803| title=\nCRESPIGNY, Philip Champion (d.1803), of Burwood, nr.

In [[1780 British general election|1780]] he was returned unopposed at [[Aldeburgh (UK Parliament constituency)|Aldeburgh]], also on the Fonnereau interest, as well as at Sudbury after a contest. He held both seats until 1781, when he lost Sudbury on petition, and continued to sit for Aldeburgh. The ''[[English Chronicle]]'' wrote in 1781 that \u201chis hauteur is so distinguished, that he is generally characterised ... by the profane, though very applicable appellation, of God Almighty\u201d.
