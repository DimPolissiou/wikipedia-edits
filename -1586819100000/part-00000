The new type was known as the Limousine IV early in development, which soon became the name Westland IV.<ref name=\"westp176\">{{Harvnb|James|1991|p=176}}</ref><ref name=\"am520p114\">{{Harvnb|Willis|2020|p=114}}</ref> The Westland IV was a high-winged [[monoplane]] with a mainly wooden structure. The [[fuselage]] was of square section and built around [[spruce]] [[longeron]]s and [[Fraxinus|ash]] frames, with internal wire bracing and fabric covering. The wings had wooden box [[wing spar|spar]]s and spruce [[wing ribs]] in a [[Warren girder]] arrangement, and were braced to the fuselage by streamlined struts.<ref name=\"westp177\">{{Harvnb|James|1991|p=177}}</ref> \n\nThe Westland IV first flew on 21 February 1929 at which time it was powered by the 95&nbsp;hp (71&nbsp;Kw) [[Cirrus Aero-Engines|Cirrus]] engine. This prototype was registered as G-EBXK and was certified for a crew of two and four passengers. The second machine had [[ADC Cirrus|Hermes]] engines and a metal rear fuselage. The third machine, G-ABAJ, was modified to take the 105&nbsp;hp (78&nbsp;Kw) [[Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major]] engines as well as some other changes and became the prototype Westland Wessex. The two Westland IVs were subsequently converted to Wessexes giving 10 aircraft in total.\n\n==Cobham Air Routes Ltd==\nThe Wessex was noted for its reliability and ability to make short landing runs. This made it attractive to Sir [[Alan Cobham]] in 1935 when he was looking for a small airliner to use for a service between [[Guernsey]] and the British mainland. Previously, [[flying boat]]s had provided a service between [[Portsmouth]] and [[St Peter Port]] on the island. There was no public airfield at the time on Guernsey, only the private airfield at [[L'Eree]] run by the [[Guernsey Aero Club]], of which Cobham was a member. The Wessex was certified as the only commercial aircraft to use L'Eree. Cobham's airline, Cobham Air Routes Ltd, used the following Wessex aircraft:\n\n'''G-EBXK''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1771, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 21 March 1929. Originally the prototype Westland IV and retained as a demonstrator, later converted to a Wessex and sold to Cobham Air Routes Ltd in 1935 and withdrawn from use in 1936.\n\n'''G-ABAJ''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1897, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 27 May 1930. Built as a Westland IV and registered as G-AAJI, originally intended for service in Kenya with Wilson's Airways but the order was never taken up. Instead, G-AAJI was rebuilt as a Wessex and sold to Sabena with Belgian registration OO-AGC, before being in turn sold to Cobham in 1935. This aircraft was used by Trafalgar Advertising in 1936.\n\n'''G-ADEW''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1899, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 6 August 1930, sold to [[Sabena]] and registered as OO-AGF, then bought by Cobham in 1935. Unfortunately, this aircraft was lost in the Channel on 3 July 1935, 3 to 4 miles south off The Needles. The only passenger on board, a Mr C F Grainger, was picked up by the SS Stanmore and taken to Fowey. The pilot, W H Ogden, was presumed drowned within the aircraft and was never found. The blame was largely placed on Ogden, but was probably also due to the age of the Wessex airframes and their engines. This accident was the last straw for Sir Alan, who was struggling operationally, and he sold his airline to Olley Air Service.\n\n'''G-ADFZ''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1900, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 30 August 1930, sold to Sabena and registered as OO-AGF, and bought by Cobham in 1935. G-ADFZ went on to work for Trafalgar Advertising with G-ABAJ, and it was decided to take G-ADFZ to [[Blackpool]] for the air display in September 1935. On 7 September 1935 it was involved in a collision over Blackpool with an [[Avro 504|Avro 504N]] (G-ACOD), the Wessex crashing in [[Cedar Square]] with the crew safe but all three occupants of the Avro being killed. Repaired, G-ADFZ was finally withdrawn from service on 1 December 1946.\n\n== Operators ==\n;{{flag|Egypt|1922}}\n* [[Egyptian Air Force]]\n;{{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* AST Ltd, Hamble \u2013 taken on by RAF and used as navigation trainers from 1939\n* Great Western Railway Air Services Ltd \u2013 passenger air services between [[Cardiff Municipal Airport]] and Plymouth (1934\u20131939)\n* [[Cobham Air Routes]] \u2013 passenger air services between [[Christchurch Airfield]] and Guernsey L'Eree (1935)\n* Portsmouth, Southsea and Isle of Wight Aviation Co., Ltd \u2013 passenger services.\n* Imperial Airways \u2013 passenger services.\n* Trafalgar Advertising Co Ltd \u2013 night-time airborne illuminated advertising, including for [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]].\n;{{flag|Belgium}}\n*[[sabena|SABENA]] \u2013 passenger services, sold their aircraft to Cobham Air Routes Ltd in 1935.\n\n==Specifications Wessex (Genet Major 1A)==\n[[File:Westland_IV_3-view_NACA_Aircraft_Circular_No.95.jpg|thumb|Westland IV 3-view drawing from NACA Aircraft Circular No.95]]\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=British Civil Aircraft 1919\u20131972: Volume III<ref name=\"Jackson civil v3p246-7\">{{Harvnb|Jackson|1988|pp=246\u2013247}}</ref>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|genhide= \n\n|crew=2 (pilot and mechanic)\n|capacity=4 passengers\n|length m=\n|length ft=38\n|length in=0\n|span m=\n|span ft=57\n|span in=6\n|height m=\n|height ft=9\n|height in=6\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=490\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=3891\n|gross weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=6300\n|fuel capacity=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=3\n|eng1 name=[[Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major]] 1A \n|eng1 type=seven-cylinder air-cooled [[radial engine]]\n|eng1 kw=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 hp=140<!-- prop engines -->\n\n|prop blade number=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia ft=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia in=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|perfhide=\n\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=122\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft -->\n|cruise speed kmh=<!-- if max speed unknown -->\n|cruise speed mph=100<!-- if max speed unknown -->\n|cruise speed kts=\n|range km=\n|range miles=420\n|range nmi=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=14900\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=680\n|more performance=\n\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n<!-- ==See also== -->\n{{aircontent\n<!-- designs which were developed into or from this aircraft: -->\n|related=\n\n<!-- aircraft similar in appearance or function to this design: -->\n|similar aircraft=\n\n<!-- any lists that are appropriate: -->\n|lists=\n\n<!-- other articles that could be useful to connect with: -->\n|see also=\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Jackson |first=A.

Their music and lyrics frequently focus on struggles between socioeconomic classes, challenging authority and youth empowerment. These themes are often specifically addressed in relation to the Seattle region (\"Southside Revival\", \"North by Northwest\", \"50 Thousand Deep\", \"Joe Metro\", \"Slick Watts\" and \"[[The Ave]]\"), and heavily draw upon Geologic's history as an activist within the [[Filipino American]] community dealing with issues of immigration, racism, and U.S. imperialism in [[the Philippines]]. Recent music has begun to extend even further outward, reflecting the group's greater [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and Pacific roots including an album devoted to exploring Geo's [[Hawaiian people|Hawaiian]] heritage on the ''[[OOF! EP]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://02cd02a.netsolhost.com/blog/releases/oof-ep/|title=OOF!

The hip hop group first came to be in 2002 because, \"two students skipped a class, went and crafted an album\", as it says in the track Bayani. The two students, George Quibuyen and Alexei Saba Mohajerjasbi, were attending the [[University of Washington]] at the time. The two met at a meeting for S.H.O.W. (the Student HipHop Organization of Washington) which was organized by classmate and future manager Marc Matsui.<ref>Blue Scholars Bio and Press Release</ref> The organization had set out to revive an authentic interest in hip hop within Seattle which, at the time, had become a solely rock town. This was a result of a series of incidents including a shooting at an [[Ice Cube]] concert in the early 1990s as well as the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]].

The hip hop group first came to be in 2002 because, \"two students skipped a class, went and crafted an album\", as it says in the track Bayani. The two students, George Quibuyen and Alexei Saba Mohajerjasbi, were attending the [[University of Washington]] at the time. The two met at a meeting for S.H.O.W. (the Student HipHop Organization of Washington) which was organized by classmate and future manager Marc Matsui.<ref>Blue Scholars Bio and Press Release</ref> The organization had set out to revive an authentic interest in hip hop within Seattle which, at the time, had become a solely rock town. This was a result of a series of incidents including a shooting at an [[Ice Cube]] concert in the early 1990s as well as the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]]. George and Alexei soon joined forces and formed their own duo that utilized Geo's raps and Sabzi's beats and became known as the Blue Scholars.\n\nSince then the duo has performed in over 400 shows together across the [[United States]] including the [[Sasquatch!

He is currently an academy coach for Derby County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35526658|title=Des Walker: Derby County bring in Nottingham Forest legend|date=8 February 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt club level he played in seven cup finals for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at Wembley, winning five of them. He was Forest's player of the year three times. On four straight occasions at Forest he was selected for the PFA Team of the Year. At [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] he picked up another club player of the year accolade. He played in twenty seasons of senior football. All but the last three of those were in the top flight in either England or Italy.\n\nHe played 59 times for [[England national football team|England]], which included the nation's run to the semi-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Nottingham Forest===\nWalker was spotted playing locally in London and was signed by Forest in 1980 as an apprentice. Known for being unafraid of pitching youngsters into the first team if they were good enough, Forest manager [[Brian Clough]], trying to build a second great side after his ageing [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] winning team broke up, gave Walker his debut in March 1984 at the age of 18, just two months before the end of the [[1983\u201384 Football League|1983\u201384 First Division]] campaign. Forest finished third and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. In a minor statistical anomaly in Walker's nine seasons of first team football at Forest, they only finished the league in three different positions - third (three times), eighth (four times) and ninth (twice).\n\nIn 1987 Walker earned the first of his club player of the year awards at Forest.\n\nForest won the [[Football League Centenary Tournament]] in April 1988 (their first senior trophy since 1981). They finished third in the league in 1988. That form also carried them to the semi-finals of that season's [[FA Cup]] with Walker in outstanding form.\n\nForest won the 1989 [[Full Members Cup]] beating Everton 4-3 in the final after extra time. They won a second cup that season, the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] with a 3\u20131 victory at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] over [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].\n\nWith Forest now chasing a unique cup treble tragedy struck a week after the League Cup triumph. Forest and Liverpool met for the second season in a row in the FA Cup semi-finals. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. When the emotion laden rescheduled game took place Forest struggled as Liverpool won 3\u20131. Forest finished third in the First Division for a second successive year. However they were unable to compete in the [[UEFA Cup]] as the ban on English clubs in European competition, arising from the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster|Heysel]] tragedy of 1985, still had [[1989-90 in English football|one season]] to run. Walker was selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the first time.\n\nWalker won his second League Cup winner's medal when Forest retained the trophy in 1990 with victory over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. He earned his second Forest player of the year accolade. He was also selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the second successive season.\n\nDespite English clubs being re-admitted to Europe for the [[1990-91 in English football|1990\u201391 season]], places in the competition were initially limited, and 1990 League Cup winners Forest were not included; the only [[UEFA Cup]] place that season went to league runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Walker was now in his 25th year, and despite playing for one of England's most successful clubs, he had not yet been given a chance to prove himself in European competition.\n\nWalker scored an own goal in the 1991 [[FA Cup Final]] that lost 2\u20131 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. [[Roy Keane]] played in central midfield for Forest; years later in his autobiography, Keane admitted he should not have declared himself fit to play as he had not recovered from injury. Yet again Walker missed the chance of playing in Europe. The otherwise excellent consistency of his form earned him a third successive selection for the PFA Team of the Year.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1992, Walker scored his only goal in professional football, the equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw against Luton. [[1991-92 in English football|That season]] Forest won the Full Members Cup for a second time beating Southampton 3-2 after extra time. Forest reached another League Cup final but lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Forest had now played in seven domestic cup finals at Wembley in five seasons, winning five of the finals. Walker signed off from Forest as their player of the year for the third time in six seasons. He also earned a fourth successive selection for the PFA Team of the Year. One other player was selected in the same four PFA Teams of the Year, Walker's teammate [[Stuart Pearce]] who earned selection five seasons in a row.\n\n===Sampdoria===\nAfter the Euro 1992 finals he was sold for \u00a31.5 million to Italian side [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] coached by [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Williams |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-no-time-to-show-you-are-fallible-des-walker-was-the-man-england-could-rely-upon-above-all-2324622.html |title=Football: No time to show you are fallible: Des Walker was the man England could rely upon above all others. But as two vital World Cup games approach, is that still the case? Richard Williams reports |publisher=The Independent |date=1993-05-23 |accessdate=2019-10-11}}</ref> Samp finished the season placed seventh in [[Serie A]]. Despite playing 30 of Sampdoria's league games he was largely played out of position at full back. He stayed just one season before returning to England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/27/newsstory.sport6 |title=Lonely man in the middle &#124; Football |publisher=The Guardian |date=2003-04-26 |accessdate=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\nSampdoria had been runners-up in the [[1992 European Cup Final]] in the season prior to Walker's arrival, however they finished sixth in 1992 in Serie A. Nor did they win the 1992 [[Coppa Italia]]. Thus they took no part in any UEFA competition in Walker's 1992-93 season there.\n\n===Sheffield Wednesday===\nWalker joined Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a32.7 million in 1993. He made more than 300 appearances for the club under eight different managers in eight years. He quickly became a favourite of the fans earning their player of the year award at the end of his first season. He also picked up the captain's armband. His time at Sheffield Wednesday brought mixed fortunes, although he played in the overwhelming majority of the club's games following his arrival.\n\nIn that first season, Wednesday finished seventh in the [[Premier League]], but were defeated in what was effectively their last chance of silverware in February. They suffered a hefty defeat at the hands of [[Manchester United]] in the semi-finals of the [[League Cup]]. In 1994\u201395, Wednesday finished in 13th and 15th in 1995\u201396. Wednesday were never in any acute danger of relegation on either occasion. In the 1995\u201396 season, Wednesday played four games in the group stage of the [[Intertoto Cup]].\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season began brilliantly for Wednesday topping the Premier League at the end of August. However they were unable to keep up their excellent form. They finished the season in seventh as they had three seasons before. They also had the best FA Cup run in Walker's time their reaching the last eight. In the next two seasons Wednesday finished 16th and 12th respectively in the top division.\n\nThey were then relegated in [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000]]. Walker played in seven seasons of top tier football with Wednesday to add to his nine at Forest and one with Sampdoria. In a disappointing [[2000-01 in English football|2000\u201301]] season in the 24 team second tier Wednesday finished 17th. Amid Sheffield Wednesday's growing financial strain associated with their fall from the top league, Walker was released from his contract in 2001.\n\nIn 2007, he came out top alongside [[Peter Swan (footballer born 1936)|Peter Swan]] in a poll to find Sheffield Wednesday's two greatest ever centre backs on the website [[Vital Football]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Return to Forest===\nHe briefly trained with his ex-Forest teammate [[Nigel Clough]] at [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] (where he was manager) and a short stint in the US playing for the [[New York Red Bulls|MetroStars]] in their [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] benefit matches against [[D.C. United]]. Forest manager, [[Paul Hart]] then asked if Walker could train with Forest, who were now struggling in the second tier of English football. In July 2002, Walker signed for Forest on a permanent basis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walker seals Forest return|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/2097360.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=5 July 2002|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nWalker made almost 60 more appearances in his second spell for Forest, nearly a decade after he had left them, and finally left the club at the age of 38 with a total of 354 appearances for the club to his name \u2013 and one goal. His final competitive appearance for Forest came against Wigan Athletic on 7 August 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/3942117.stm\n|title=Wigan 1\u20131 Nottm Forest |publisher=BBC |date=7 August 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 2005, a testimonial match was held in his honour \u2013 this drew 13,886 spectators with guest appearances from [[Stuart Pearce]], [[Ian Wright]], [[Emile Heskey]] and Nigel Clough.<ref name=bbctestimonial>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/4490613.stm|title=Forest fans honour legend Walker|date=17 May 2005|website=BBC Sport|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=guardiantestimonial>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/18/newsstory.sport6|title=Drunk Walker arrested|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|date=17 May 2005|website=The Guardian|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Controversy was caused when the player was arrested several hours later for being [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly]].<ref name=guardiantestimonial /> He became first team coach at Forest afterwards but left in January 2005 when [[Gary Megson]] was appointed as manager.<ref name=bbctestimonial />\n\n==International career==\nWalker made his international debut as a [[substitute (soccer)|substitute]] for [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] in a game against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in 1988. It was not long before Walker was a regular starter in the side against competition from Adams, [[Terry Butcher]] and [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]].\n\n===1990 World Cup===\nAt the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], Walker started all seven of the games in which England would play, gaining international acclaim. Playing in a three-man defence alongside Wright and Butcher, Walker shrugged off knocks and fatigue to enjoy a superb tournament, which ended when England were knocked out in a [[penalty shootout]] by [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-finals. Rob Bagchi, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2010, praised his performances, arguing that Walker's \"speed, anticipation and mastery of the fair tackle were reminiscent of [[Bobby Moore]].\"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/may/26/italia-90-south-africa-2010 | title= Italia 90 had its moments at about 4am on Australia's backpacker trail| first=Rob| last=Bagchi| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=26 May 2010 | accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Euro 1992===\n\nWalker subsequently became England's defensive linchpin after Butcher decided to retire, continuing to feature regularly after [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] had taken over as manager. As an almost ever-present during a period when England played a relatively large number of internationals, Walker became the fastest player in history to reach 50 caps, a feat he accomplished in just over four years from 53 internationals played by England.\n\nWalker then travelled with the England squad to the [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship]] in Sweden but England failed to get beyond the group stages. Walker's trademark excellent defending made him one of the few bright spots of the England performance.\n\n===World Cup 1994 qualification===\n\nOn 28 April 1993, in a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification|1994 World Cup qualifier]], England were leading 2\u20131 against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. With four minutes remaining the exceptionally paced [[Marc Overmars]] became the first person in Walker's then 52 internationals to beat the defender for speed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-world-cup-football-england-undone-by-walkers-blunder-netherlands-claw-out-a-wembley-draw-1458168.html,|title=Football: World Cup Football: England undone by Walker's blunder:|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"sn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/des-walker-6141/biography-of-his-england-football-career_a12382/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311003635/http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/des-walker-6141/biography-of-his-england-football-career_a12382/ |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> With little choice Walker brought the Dutchman down.

Poland's [[Dariusz Adamczuk]] got to the ball first and with one touch lobbed [[Chris Woods]] to score.\n\nFour days later, on 2 June 1993, England's hopes of qualifying were dealt a further blow during a 0\u20132 loss away to [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. Walker's defensive authority was compromised by Taylor's imposition of an untested wing back system.<ref name = \"sn\"/> Walker was largely at fault for the first goal. After committing a foul near the corner flag Walker began to argue with the referee. He was caught out with a quick free kick leading to a cross for [[\u00d8yvind Leonhardsen]] to score.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_auy0rgppm4|title=1993 (June 2) Norway 2-England 0 (World Cup Qualifier)|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=17 August 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nWalker played in a three-game Summer tour of the host nation of the following year's finals, USA. He then missed other crucial qualifiers, a 3\u20130 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and a decisive 0\u20132 loss against the Netherlands in Rotterdam. Walker played in England's last qualifier in the group in November 1993. [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] scored the fastest World Cup goal ever after just eight seconds capitalising on an under hit Stuart Pearce pass back. England won 7\u20131 but failed to make the finals (they had needed to win by seven clear goals and hope that the Netherlands lost in Poland, but the Dutch won anyway so England's result was academic). This was Taylor's last match in charge of the England team. No subsequent England Manager picked Walker despite him continuing to play professionally at club level for the next 11 years.\n\nWalker's international career ended with 59 caps and no goals.\n\n==Playing style==\nWalker was a pacey and hard-tackling [[defender (football)|central defender]] regarded for the consistently high quality of his defending through the first half of his playing career. Defensively he was among the best markers and timers of the tackle of the television era in English football.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1165071/THE-LIST-Nos-10-1-best-defenders-graced-English-football.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=THE LIST: Nos 10\u20131 of the best defenders to have graced English football | date=27 March 2009}}</ref> His speed allowed him to repeatedly recover difficult situations for his teams. [[Gary Lineker]] named Walker in the best One to Eleven that Lineker played beside during his career. Lineker said of him, \"Des wasn't the greatest footballer in the world but he was unbelievably quick and had a brilliant defensive mind. [[Brian Clough]] used to stick him on me when we played \u2013 he always put man-to-man which was quite unusual in those days \u2013 and he used to sing that song 'You'll never beat Des Walker!' \u2013 he used to drive you mad when you were playing against him!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/21901/9511630/bryan-robson-picks-his-one2eleven|title=Gary Lineker picks his #One2Eleven on The Fantasy Football Club|website=Skysports.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt set pieces for his teams, Walker would stay back to provide defensive cover rather than supplement the attack, reflected in that fact that he only scored once in around 800 senior games.\n\nHe played in 20 seasons of senior football, with all but the last three of those in the top flight. Other than a brief spell in the USA he played for only three clubs, none of which were ever genuine contenders for a league championship. He played in seven cup finals with Nottingham Forest at Wembley, winning five. Perhaps a more useful indication of the consistency of his excellence are the individual accolades he collected when at his peak: in the last six seasons of his first spell at Forest he was Player of the Year three times, in the last four of those seasons he was selected for the PFA Team of the Year each time, on his return from his season in Italy he was Sheffield Wednesday's player of the year in his first season there, and following his full international debut in 1988 he became the quickest player to collect 50 full England caps, taking just over four years to do so.\n\nWalker rarely missed matches. He incurred a remarkably low number of bookings during the first 10 years of his career, despite often dispossessing opponents with sliding challenges from all directions. While not being the tallest centre-back he could leap to beat the tallest forwards in the air, and his pace meant even the quickest and most skilful forwards very rarely got any change from him.\n\nAt the height of his career, Forest, Owls and England fans frequently chanted \"You'll never beat Des Walker.\"  This was turned into \"You'll never ''meet'' Des Walker\" as a private joke among journalists, commenting on Walker's refusal to talk to the press at this point.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Personal life==\nWalker has two sons who are both professional footballers.

He is currently an academy coach for Derby County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35526658|title=Des Walker: Derby County bring in Nottingham Forest legend|date=8 February 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt club level he played in seven cup finals for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at Wembley, winning five of them. He was Forest's player of the year three times. On four straight occasions at Forest he was selected for the PFA Team of the Year. At [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] he picked up another club player of the year accolade. He played in twenty seasons of senior football. All but the last three of those were in the top flight in either England or Italy.\n\nHe played 59 times for [[England national football team|England]], which included the nation's run to the semi-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Nottingham Forest===\nWalker was spotted playing locally in London and was signed by Forest in 1980 as an apprentice. Known for being unafraid of pitching youngsters into the first team if they were good enough, Forest manager [[Brian Clough]], trying to build a second great side after his ageing [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] winning team broke up, gave Walker his debut in March 1984 at the age of 18, just two months before the end of the [[1983\u201384 Football League|1983\u201384 First Division]] campaign. Forest finished third and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. In a minor statistical anomaly in Walker's nine seasons of first team football at Forest, they only finished the league in three different positions - third (three times), eighth (four times) and ninth (twice).\n\nIn 1987 Walker earned the first of his club player of the year awards at Forest.\n\nForest won the [[Football League Centenary Tournament]] in April 1988 (their first senior trophy since 1981). They finished third in the league in 1988. That form also carried them to the semi-finals of that season's [[FA Cup]] with Walker in outstanding form.\n\nForest won the 1989 [[Full Members Cup]] beating Everton 4-3 in the final after extra time. They won a second cup that season, the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] with a 3\u20131 victory at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] over [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].\n\nWith Forest now chasing a unique cup treble tragedy struck a week after the League Cup triumph. Forest and Liverpool met for the second season in a row in the FA Cup semi-finals. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. When the emotion laden rescheduled game took place Forest struggled as Liverpool won 3\u20131. Forest finished third in the First Division for a second successive year. However they were unable to compete in the [[UEFA Cup]] as the ban on English clubs in European competition, arising from the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster|Heysel]] tragedy of 1985, still had [[1989-90 in English football|one season]] to run. Walker was selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the first time.\n\nWalker won his second League Cup winner's medal when Forest retained the trophy in 1990 with victory over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. He earned his second Forest player of the year accolade. He was also selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the second successive season.\n\nDespite English clubs being re-admitted to Europe for the [[1990-91 in English football|1990\u201391 season]], places in the competition were initially limited, and 1990 League Cup winners Forest were not included; the only [[UEFA Cup]] place that season went to league runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Walker was now in his 25th year, and despite playing for one of England's most successful clubs, he had not yet been given a chance to prove himself in European competition.\n\nWalker scored an own goal in the 1991 [[FA Cup Final]] that lost 2\u20131 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. [[Roy Keane]] played in central midfield for Forest; years later in his autobiography, Keane admitted he should not have declared himself fit to play as he had not recovered from injury. Yet again Walker missed the chance of playing in Europe. The otherwise excellent consistency of his form earned him a third successive selection for the PFA Team of the Year.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1992, Walker scored his only goal in professional football, the equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw against Luton. [[1991-92 in English football|That season]] Forest won the Full Members Cup for a second time beating Southampton 3-2 after extra time. Forest reached another League Cup final but lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Forest had now played in seven domestic cup finals at Wembley in five seasons, winning five of the finals. Walker signed off from Forest as their player of the year for the third time in six seasons. He also earned a fourth successive selection for the PFA Team of the Year. One other player was selected in the same four PFA Teams of the Year, Walker's teammate [[Stuart Pearce]] who earned selection five seasons in a row.\n\n===Sampdoria===\nAfter the Euro 1992 finals he was sold for \u00a31.5 million to Italian side [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] coached by [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Williams |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-no-time-to-show-you-are-fallible-des-walker-was-the-man-england-could-rely-upon-above-all-2324622.html |title=Football: No time to show you are fallible: Des Walker was the man England could rely upon above all others. But as two vital World Cup games approach, is that still the case? Richard Williams reports |publisher=The Independent |date=1993-05-23 |accessdate=2019-10-11}}</ref> Samp finished the season placed seventh in [[Serie A]]. Despite playing 30 of Sampdoria's league games he was largely played out of position at full back. He stayed just one season before returning to England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/27/newsstory.sport6 |title=Lonely man in the middle &#124; Football |publisher=The Guardian |date=2003-04-26 |accessdate=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\nSampdoria had been runners-up in the [[1992 European Cup Final]] in the season prior to Walker's arrival, however they finished sixth in 1992 in Serie A. Nor did they win the 1992 [[Coppa Italia]]. Thus they took no part in any UEFA competition in Walker's 1992-93 season there.\n\n===Sheffield Wednesday===\nWalker joined Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a32.7 million in 1993. He made more than 300 appearances for the club under eight different managers in eight years. He quickly became a favourite of the fans earning their player of the year award at the end of his first season. He also picked up the captain's armband. His time at Sheffield Wednesday brought mixed fortunes, although he played in the overwhelming majority of the club's games following his arrival.\n\nIn that first season, Wednesday finished seventh in the [[Premier League]], but were defeated in what was effectively their last chance of silverware in February. They suffered a hefty defeat at the hands of [[Manchester United]] in the semi-finals of the [[League Cup]]. In 1994\u201395, Wednesday finished in 13th and 15th in 1995\u201396. Wednesday were never in any acute danger of relegation on either occasion. In the 1995\u201396 season, Wednesday played four games in the group stage of the [[Intertoto Cup]].\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season began brilliantly for Wednesday topping the Premier League at the end of August. However they were unable to keep up their excellent form. They finished the season in seventh as they had three seasons before. They also had the best FA Cup run in Walker's time their reaching the last eight. In the next two seasons Wednesday finished 16th and 12th respectively in the top division.\n\nThey were then relegated in [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000]]. Walker played in seven seasons of top tier football with Wednesday to add to his nine at Forest and one with Sampdoria. In a disappointing [[2000-01 in English football|2000\u201301]] season in the 24 team second tier Wednesday finished 17th. Amid Sheffield Wednesday's growing financial strain associated with their fall from the top league, Walker was released from his contract in 2001.\n\nIn 2007, he came out top alongside [[Peter Swan (footballer born 1936)|Peter Swan]] in a poll to find Sheffield Wednesday's two greatest ever centre backs on the website [[Vital Football]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Return to Forest===\nHe briefly trained with his ex-Forest teammate [[Nigel Clough]] at [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] (where he was manager) and a short stint in the US playing for the [[New York Red Bulls|MetroStars]] in their [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] benefit matches against [[D.C. United]]. Forest manager, [[Paul Hart]] then asked if Walker could train with Forest, who were now struggling in the second tier of English football. In July 2002, Walker signed for Forest on a permanent basis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walker seals Forest return|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/2097360.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=5 July 2002|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nWalker made almost 60 more appearances in his second spell for Forest, nearly a decade after he had left them, and finally left the club at the age of 38 with a total of 354 appearances for the club to his name \u2013 and one goal. His final competitive appearance for Forest came against Wigan Athletic on 7 August 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/3942117.stm\n|title=Wigan 1\u20131 Nottm Forest |publisher=BBC |date=7 August 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 2005, a testimonial match was held in his honour \u2013 this drew 13,886 spectators with guest appearances from [[Stuart Pearce]], [[Ian Wright]], [[Emile Heskey]] and Nigel Clough.<ref name=bbctestimonial>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/4490613.stm|title=Forest fans honour legend Walker|date=17 May 2005|website=BBC Sport|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=guardiantestimonial>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/18/newsstory.sport6|title=Drunk Walker arrested|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|date=17 May 2005|website=The Guardian|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Controversy was caused when the player was arrested several hours later for being [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly]].<ref name=guardiantestimonial /> He became first team coach at Forest afterwards but left in January 2005 when [[Gary Megson]] was appointed as manager.<ref name=bbctestimonial />\n\n==International career==\nWalker made his international debut as a [[substitute (soccer)|substitute]] for [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] in a game against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in 1988. It was not long before Walker was a regular starter in the side against competition from Adams, [[Terry Butcher]] and [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]].\n\n===1990 World Cup===\nAt the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], Walker started all seven of the games in which England would play, gaining international acclaim. Playing in a three-man defence alongside Wright and Butcher, Walker shrugged off knocks and fatigue to enjoy a superb tournament, which ended when England were knocked out in a [[penalty shootout]] by [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the semi-finals. Rob Bagchi, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2010, praised his performances, arguing that Walker's \"speed, anticipation and mastery of the fair tackle were reminiscent of [[Bobby Moore]].\"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/may/26/italia-90-south-africa-2010 | title= Italia 90 had its moments at about 4am on Australia's backpacker trail| first=Rob| last=Bagchi| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=26 May 2010 | accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Euro 1992===\n\nWalker subsequently became England's defensive linchpin after Butcher decided to retire, continuing to feature regularly after [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] had taken over as manager. As an almost ever-present during a period when England played a relatively large number of internationals, Walker became the fastest player in history to reach 50 caps, a feat he accomplished in just over four years from 53 internationals played by England.\n\nWalker then travelled with the England squad to the [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship]] in Sweden but England failed to get beyond the group stages. Walker's trademark excellent defending made him one of the few bright spots of the England performance.\n\n===World Cup 1994 qualification===\n\nOn 28 April 1993, in a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification|1994 World Cup qualifier]], England were leading 2\u20131 against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. With four minutes remaining the exceptionally paced [[Marc Overmars]] became the first person in Walker's then 52 internationals to beat the defender for speed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-world-cup-football-england-undone-by-walkers-blunder-netherlands-claw-out-a-wembley-draw-1458168.html,|title=Football: World Cup Football: England undone by Walker's blunder:|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"sn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/des-walker-6141/biography-of-his-england-football-career_a12382/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311003635/http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/des-walker-6141/biography-of-his-england-football-career_a12382/ |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> With little choice Walker brought the Dutchman down.

Poland's [[Dariusz Adamczuk]] got to the ball first and with one touch lobbed [[Chris Woods]] to score.\n\nFour days later, on 2 June 1993, England's hopes of qualifying were dealt a further blow during a 0\u20132 loss away to [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. Walker's defensive authority was compromised by Taylor's imposition of an untested wing back system.<ref name = \"sn\"/> Walker was largely at fault for the first goal. After committing a foul near the corner flag Walker began to argue with the referee. He was caught out with a quick free kick leading to a cross for [[\u00d8yvind Leonhardsen]] to score.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_auy0rgppm4|title=1993 (June 2) Norway 2-England 0 (World Cup Qualifier)|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=17 August 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nWalker played in a three-game Summer tour of the host nation of the following year's finals, USA. He then missed other crucial qualifiers, a 3\u20130 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and a decisive 0\u20132 loss against the Netherlands in Rotterdam. Walker played in England's last qualifier in the group in November 1993. [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] scored the fastest World Cup goal ever after just eight seconds capitalising on an under hit Stuart Pearce pass back. England won 7\u20131 but failed to make the finals (they had needed to win by seven clear goals and hope that the Netherlands lost in Poland, but the Dutch won anyway so England's result was academic). This was Taylor's last match in charge of the England team. No subsequent England Manager picked Walker despite him continuing to play professionally at club level for the next 11 years.\n\nWalker's international career ended with 59 caps and no goals.\n\n==Playing style==\nWalker was a pacey and hard-tackling [[defender (football)|central defender]] regarded for the consistently high quality of his defending through the first half of his playing career. Defensively he was among the best markers and timers of the tackle of the television era in English football.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1165071/THE-LIST-Nos-10-1-best-defenders-graced-English-football.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=THE LIST: Nos 10\u20131 of the best defenders to have graced English football | date=27 March 2009}}</ref> His speed allowed him to repeatedly recover difficult situations for his teams. [[Gary Lineker]] named Walker in the best One to Eleven that Lineker played beside during his career. Lineker said of him, \"Des wasn't the greatest footballer in the world but he was unbelievably quick and had a brilliant defensive mind. [[Brian Clough]] used to stick him on me when we played \u2013 he always put man-to-man which was quite unusual in those days \u2013 and he used to sing that song 'You'll never beat Des Walker!' \u2013 he used to drive you mad when you were playing against him!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/21901/9511630/bryan-robson-picks-his-one2eleven|title=Gary Lineker picks his #One2Eleven on The Fantasy Football Club|website=Skysports.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt set pieces for his teams, Walker would stay back to provide defensive cover rather than supplement the attack, reflected in that fact that he only scored once in around 800 senior games.\n\nHe played in 20 seasons of senior football, with all but the last three of those in the top flight. Other than a brief spell in the USA he played for only three clubs, none of which were ever genuine contenders for a league championship. He played in seven cup finals with Nottingham Forest at Wembley, winning five. Perhaps a more useful indication of the consistency of his excellence are the individual accolades he collected when at his peak: in the last six seasons of his first spell at Forest he was Player of the Year three times, in the last four of those seasons he was selected for the PFA Team of the Year each time, on his return from his season in Italy he was Sheffield Wednesday's player of the year in his first season there, and following his full international debut in 1988 he became the quickest player to collect 50 full England caps, taking just over four years to do so.\n\nWalker rarely missed matches. He incurred a remarkably low number of bookings during the first 10 years of his career, despite often dispossessing opponents with sliding challenges from all directions.

Edwards, B. 2004.</ref> His home was a log cabin without electricity or plumbing, on a farm bringing in only a few hundred dollars a year from corn and hay.\n\nWhen Murrow was six years old, his family moved across the country to [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit County]] in [[Western Washington|western]] [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to [[Homestead principle|homestead]] near [[Blanchard, Washington|Blanchard]], {{convert|30|mi|-1}} south of the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]]. He attended high school in nearby [[Edison, Washington|Edison]], and was president of the student body in his senior year and excelled on the debate team. He was also a member of the basketball team which won the Skagit County championship.\n\nAfter graduation from high school in 1926, Murrow enrolled at [[Washington State University|Washington State College]] (now Washington State University) across the state in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], and eventually majored in speech. A member of the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], he was also active in college politics. By his teen years, Murrow went by the nickname \"Ed\" and during his second year of college, he changed his name from Egbert to Edward. In 1929, while attending the annual convention of the [[National Student Federation of America]], Murrow gave a speech urging college students to become more interested in national and world affairs; this led to his election as president of the federation. After earning his bachelor's degree in 1930, he moved back east to New York.\n\nMurrow was assistant director of the [[Institute of International Education]] from 1932 to 1935 and served as assistant secretary of the [[Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars]], which helped prominent German scholars who had been dismissed from academic positions. He married [[Janet Huntington Brewster]] on March 12, 1935. Their son, Charles Casey Murrow, was born in the west of London on November 6, 1945.\n\n==Career at CBS==\nMurrow joined [[CBS]] as director of talks and education in 1935 and remained with the network for his entire career.<ref name=Baker /> CBS did not have news staff when Murrow joined, save for announcer [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]]. Murrow's job was to line up newsmakers who would appear on the network to talk about the issues of the day. But the onetime Washington State speech major was intrigued by Trout's on-air delivery, and Trout gave Murrow tips on how to communicate effectively on radio.\n\nMurrow went to London in 1937 to serve as the director of CBS's European operations. The position did not involve on-air reporting; his job was persuading European figures to broadcast over the CBS network, which was in direct competition with [[NBC]]'s two radio networks. During this time, he made frequent trips around Europe.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Norton|title=They Also Serve: Edward R.

While Murrow was in [[Poland]] arranging a broadcast of children's choruses, he got word from Shirer of the annexation\u2014and the fact that Shirer could not get the story out through Austrian state radio facilities. Murrow immediately sent Shirer to London, where he delivered an uncensored, eyewitness account of the Anschluss. Murrow then chartered the only transportation available, a 23-passenger plane, to fly from [[Warsaw]] to [[Vienna]] so he could take over for Shirer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Norton|title=They Also Serve: Edward R.

On March 13, 1938, the special was broadcast, hosted by Bob Trout in New York, including Shirer in London (with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] [[Ellen Wilkinson]]), reporter [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] of the ''Chicago Daily News'' in Paris, reporter [[Pierre J. Huss]] of the International News Service in [[Berlin]], and Senator [[Lewis B. Schwellenbach]] in Washington, D.C. Reporter [[Frank Gervasi]], in Rome, was unable to find a transmitter to broadcast reaction from the Italian capital but phoned his script to Shirer in London, who read it on the air.<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|116\u2013120}} Murrow reported live from Vienna, in the first on-the-scene news report of his career: \"This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna.... It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning, and Herr Hitler has not yet arrived.\"\n\nThe broadcast was considered revolutionary at the time. Featuring multipoint, live reports transmitted by shortwave in the days before modern technology (and without each of the parties necessarily being able to hear one another), it came off almost flawlessly. The special became the basis for ''[[CBS World News Roundup|World News Roundup]]''\u2014broadcasting's oldest news series, which still runs each weekday morning and evening on the [[CBS News Radio|CBS Radio Network]].\n\nIn September 1938, Murrow and Shirer were regular participants in CBS's coverage of the crisis over the [[Sudetenland]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], which Hitler coveted for Germany and eventually won in the [[Munich Agreement]]. Their incisive reporting heightened the American appetite for radio news, with listeners regularly waiting for Murrow's [[shortwave]] broadcasts, introduced by analyst [[H. V. Kaltenborn]] in New York saying, \"Calling Ed Murrow ... come in Ed Murrow.\"\n\nDuring the following year, leading up to the outbreak of [[World War II]], Murrow continued to be based in London. William Shirer's reporting from Berlin brought him national acclaim and a commentator's position with CBS News upon his return to the United States in December 1940. (Shirer would describe his [[Berlin]] experiences in his best-selling 1941 book ''[[Berlin Diary]]''.) When the war broke out in September 1939, Murrow stayed in London, and later provided live radio broadcasts during the height of [[the Blitz]] in ''[[London After Dark]]''. These live, shortwave broadcasts relayed on [[CBS]] electrified radio audiences as news programming never had: previous war coverage had mostly been provided by newspaper reports, along with [[newsreel]]s seen in movie theaters; earlier radio news programs had simply featured an announcer in a studio reading [[wire service]] reports.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Edward R. Murrow - Weymouth House 84-94 Hallam Street Fitzrovia W1W 5HF.jpg|thumb|Murrow lived in a flat on Hallam Street, near [[Great Portland Street]], in London during the War]]\nMurrow's reports, especially during the Blitz, began with what became his signature opening, \"''This'' is London,\" delivered with his vocal emphasis on the word ''this'', followed by the hint of a pause before the rest of the phrase. His former speech teacher, [[Ida Lou Anderson]], suggested the opening as a more concise alternative to the one he had inherited from his predecessor at CBS Europe, Cesar Saerchinger: \"Hello America. This is London calling.\" Murrow's phrase became synonymous with the newscaster and his network.<ref name=\"link\">{{cite web| title=Edward R.

They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with \"good night, and good luck.\" The future British monarch, [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]], said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said \"good night, and good luck to you all\". So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with \"Good night, and good luck.\" Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.\n\nWhen Murrow returned to the U.S. in 1941, CBS hosted a dinner in his honor on December 2 at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. 1,100 guests attended the dinner, which the network broadcast. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent a welcome-back telegram, which was read at the dinner, and [[Librarian of Congress]] [[Archibald MacLeish]] gave an [[encomium]] that commented on the power and intimacy of Murrow's wartime dispatches.<ref name=\"sperber1998\">{{cite book | title=Murrow, His Life and Times | publisher=Fordham University Press | author=Sperber, A.

Murrow's skill at improvising vivid descriptions of what was going on around or below him, derived in part from his college training in speech, aided the effectiveness of his radio broadcasts.\n\nAs hostilities expanded, Murrow expanded CBS News in London into what [[Harrison Salisbury]] described as \"the finest news staff anybody had ever put together in Europe\".<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|230}} The result was a group of reporters acclaimed for their intellect and descriptive power, including [[Eric Sevareid]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Howard K.

Hottelet]], [[Bill Downs]], [[Winston Burdett]], [[Charles Shaw (journalist)|Charles Shaw]], [[Ned Calmer]], and [[Larry LeSueur]]. Many of them, Shirer included, were later dubbed \"[[Murrow Boys|Murrow's Boys]]\"\u2014despite Breckinridge being a woman. In 1944, Murrow sought [[Walter Cronkite]] to take over for Bill Downs at the CBS Moscow bureau. Cronkite initially accepted, but after receiving a better offer from his current employer, [[United Press International|United Press]], he turned down the offer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Persico|first1=Joseph|title=Edward R.

Pamela wanted Murrow to marry her, and he considered it; however, after his wife gave birth to their only child, Casey, he ended the affair.\n\nAfter the war, Murrow recruited journalists such as [[Alexander Kendrick]], [[David Schoenbrun]], [[Daniel Schorr]]<ref>{{cite news| last = Hershey Jr.| first = Robert D.| title = Daniel Schorr, Journalist, Dies at 93| work = The New York Times| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/business/media/24schorr.html| accessdate = July 23, 2010| date=July 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Robert Pierpoint (journalist)|Robert Pierpoint]] into the circle of the Boys as a virtual \"second generation\", though the track record of the original wartime crew set it apart.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, Murrow and [[Bill Shadel]] were the first reporters at the [[Buchenwald]] concentration camp in Germany. He met emaciated survivors including [[Petr Zenkl]], children with [[Identification in Nazi camps#Numbers|identification tattoos]], and \"bodies stacked up like cordwood\" in the crematorium.

After the war, he maintained close friendships with his previous hires, including members of the Murrow Boys. Younger colleagues at CBS became resentful toward this, viewing it as preferential treatment, and formed the \"Murrow Isn't God Club.\" The club disbanded when Murrow asked if he could join.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cuthbertson|first1=Keith|title=Books on Google Play A Complex Fate: William L.

Shirer}}</ref> The dispute began when J. B. Williams, maker of shaving soap, withdrew its sponsorship of Shirer's Sunday news show. CBS, of which Murrow was then vice president for public affairs, decided to \"move in a new direction,\" hired a new host, and let Shirer go. There are different versions of these events; Shirer's was not made public until 1990.\n\nShirer contended that the root of his troubles was the network and sponsor not standing by him because of his comments critical of the [[Truman Doctrine]], as well as other comments that were considered outside of the mainstream. Shirer and his supporters felt he was being muzzled because of his views. Meanwhile, Murrow, and even some of Murrow's Boys, felt that Shirer was coasting on his high reputation and not working hard enough to bolster his analyses with his own research.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Murrow and Shirer never regained their close friendship.\n\nThe episode hastened Murrow's desire to give up his network vice presidency and return to newscasting, and it foreshadowed his own problems to come with his friend Paley, boss of CBS.\n\nMurrow and Paley had become close when the network chief himself joined the war effort, setting up [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] radio outlets in Italy and North Africa. After the war, he would often go to Paley directly to settle any problems he had. \"Ed Murrow was Bill Paley's one genuine friend in CBS,\" noted Murrow biographer [[Joseph Persico]].\n\nMurrow returned to the air in September 1947, taking over the nightly 7:45&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] newscast sponsored by [[Campbell's Soup]] and anchored by his old friend and announcing coach Bob Trout. For the next several years Murrow focused on radio, and in addition to news reports he produced special presentations for CBS News Radio. In 1950, he narrated a half-hour radio documentary called \"The Case of the Flying Saucer.\" It offered a balanced look at [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]], a subject of widespread interest at the time. Murrow interviewed both [[Kenneth Arnold]] and astronomer [[Donald Menzel]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Crucial Decade: Voices of the Postwar Era, 1945-1954|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/voices-of-postwar.html|website=National Archives|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Case of the Flying Saucer|series=Special News Report|url=https://archive.org/download/1950-1959RadioNews/1950-04-07-CBS-Edward-R-Murrow-Case-Of-The-Flying-Saucer.mp3|credits=Edward R.

He continued to present daily radio news reports on the CBS Radio Network until 1959. He also recorded a series of narrated \"historical albums\" for [[Columbia Records]] called ''I Can Hear It Now'', which inaugurated his partnership with producer [[Fred W. Friendly]]. In 1950 the records evolved into a weekly CBS Radio show, ''[[Hear It Now]]'', hosted by Murrow and co-produced by Murrow and Friendly.\n\n===Television and films===\nAs the 1950s began, Murrow began his television career by appearing in editorial \"tailpieces\" on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' and in the coverage of special events. This came despite his own misgivings about the new medium and its emphasis on pictures rather than ideas.\n\nOn November 18, 1951, ''Hear It Now'' moved to television and was re-christened ''[[See It Now]]''. In the first episode, Murrow explained: \"This is an old team, trying to learn a new trade.\"<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|354}}\n\nIn 1952, Murrow narrated the political documentary ''Alliance for Peace'', an information vehicle for the newly formed [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] detailing the effects of the [[Marshall Plan]] upon a war-torn Europe. It was written by [[William Templeton (screenwriter)|William Templeton]] and produced by [[Samuel Goldwyn Jr.]]\n\nIn 1953, Murrow launched a second weekly TV show, a series of celebrity interviews entitled ''[[Person to Person]]''.\n\n====Criticism of McCarthyism====\n''See It Now'' focused on a number of controversial issues in the 1950s, but it is best remembered as the show that criticized [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]], contributing, if not leading, to the political downfall of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. McCarthy had previously commended Murrow for his fairness in reporting.<ref name=\"Wertenbaker\"/>\n\nOn March 9, 1954, Murrow, Friendly, and their news team produced a half-hour ''See It Now'' special titled \"A Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy\".<ref name=\"seenow540309\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/murrowmccarthy.html|title=A Report on Senator Joseph R.

Murrow and Friendly paid for their own newspaper advertisement for the program; they were not allowed to use CBS's money for the publicity campaign or even use the CBS logo.\n\nThe broadcast contributed to a nationwide backlash against McCarthy and is seen as a turning point in the history of television. It provoked tens of thousands of letters, telegrams, and phone calls to CBS headquarters, running 15 to 1 in favor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Val |title=PRAISE POURS IN ON MURROW SHOW |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 11, 1954 |page=19 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05EEDE1738E23BBC4952DFB566838F649EDE }}</ref> In a retrospective produced for ''[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]]'', Friendly noted how truck drivers pulled up to Murrow on the street in subsequent days and shouted \"Good show, Ed.\"\n\nMurrow offered McCarthy the chance to respond to the criticism with a full half-hour on ''See It Now''. McCarthy accepted the invitation and appeared on April 6, 1954. In his response, McCarthy rejected Murrow's criticism and accused him of being a communist sympathizer. McCarthy also made an appeal to the public by attacking his detractors, stating:\n\n{{quote|Ordinarily, I would not take time out from the important work at hand to answer Murrow.

Murrow at work with CBS, 1957]]\n\n====Later television career====\nMurrow's hard-hitting approach to the news, however, cost him influence in the world of television. ''See It Now'' occasionally scored high ratings (usually when it was tackling a particularly controversial subject), but in general, it did not score well on prime-time television.\n\nWhen a quiz show phenomenon began and took TV by storm in the mid-1950s, Murrow realized the days of ''See It Now'' as a weekly show were numbered. (Biographer Joseph Persico notes that Murrow, watching an early episode of ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'' air just before his own ''See It Now'', is said to have turned to Friendly and asked how long they expected to keep their time slot).\n\n''See It Now'' was knocked out of its weekly slot in 1955 after sponsor [[Alcoa]] withdrew its advertising, but the show remained as a series of occasional TV special news reports that defined television documentary news coverage. Despite the show's prestige, CBS had difficulty finding a regular sponsor, since it aired intermittently in its new time slot (Sunday afternoons at 5 p.m. ET by the end of 1956) and could not develop a regular audience.\n\nIn 1956, Murrow took time to appear as the on-screen narrator of a special prologue for [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s epic production, ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. Although the prologue was generally omitted on telecasts of the film, it was included in home video releases.\n\nBeginning in 1958, Murrow hosted a talk show entitled ''Small World'' that brought together political figures for one-to-one debates. In January 1959, he appeared on [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]'s ''The Press and the People'' with [[Louis Lyons]], discussing the responsibilities of television journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Press and the People: The Responsibilities of Television, Part II|date=January 24, 1959|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_30960AC28BBF43E3AF25923B13B5FEBD|website=Open Vault from WGBH|publisher=WGBH Media Library and Archives|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMurrow appeared as himself in a cameo in the British film production of ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' in 1960, recreating some of the wartime broadcasts he did from London for CBS.<ref name=\"bismark\">{{IMDb title|0054310|Sink the Bismarck!}}</ref>\n\nOn September 16, 1962, he introduced educational television to New York City via the maiden broadcast of WNDT, which became [[WNET]].\n\n====Fall from favor====\nMurrow's reporting brought him into repeated conflicts with CBS, especially its chairman William Paley, which Friendly summarized in his book ''Due to Circumstances Beyond our Control''. ''See It Now'' ended entirely in the summer of 1958 after a clash in Paley's office. Murrow had complained to Paley he could not continue doing the show if the network repeatedly provided (without consulting Murrow) equal time to subjects who felt wronged by the program.\n\nAccording to Friendly, Murrow asked Paley if he was going to destroy ''See It Now'', into which the CBS chief executive had invested so much. Paley replied that he did not want a constant stomach ache every time Murrow covered a controversial subject.<ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Sally Bedell | authorlink = Sally Bedell Smith | title = In All His Glory: The Life of William S.

Three months later, on October 15, 1958, in a speech before the [[Radio Television Digital News Association|Radio and Television News Directors Association]] in Chicago, Murrow blasted TV's emphasis on entertainment and commercialism at the expense of [[public interest]] in his \"wires and lights\" speech:\n\n{{quote|During the daily peak viewing periods, television in the main insulates us from the realities of the world in which we live. If this state of affairs continues, we may alter an advertising slogan to read: ''Look now, pay later''.<ref name=\"rtnda58\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/content/edward_r_murrow_s_1958_wires_lights_in_a_box_speech|title=Edward R. Murrow Speech|publisher=Radio-Television News Directors Association|date=October 15, 1958|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nThe harsh tone of the Chicago speech seriously damaged Murrow's friendship with Paley, who felt Murrow was biting the hand that fed him. Before his death, Friendly said that the RTNDA (now [[Radio Television Digital News Association]]) address did more than the McCarthy show to break the relationship between the CBS boss and his most respected journalist.\n\nAnother contributing element to Murrow's career decline was the rise of a new crop of television journalists. Walter Cronkite's arrival at CBS in 1950 marked the beginning of a major rivalry which continued until Murrow resigned from the network in 1961. Murrow held a grudge dating back to 1944, when Cronkite turned down his offer to head the CBS Moscow bureau.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Timothy M|title=Assignment to Hell: The War Against Nazi Germany with Correspondents Walter Cronkite, Andy Rooney, A.J. Liebling, Homer Bigart, and Hal Boyle|year=2013|publisher=NAL Caliber Trade|pages=528|isbn=0451417151}}</ref> With the Murrow Boys dominating the newsroom, Cronkite felt like an outsider soon after joining the network. Over time, as Murrow's career seemed on the decline and Cronkite's on the rise, the two found it increasingly difficult to work together. Cronkite's demeanor was similar to reporters Murrow had hired; the difference being that Murrow viewed the Murrow Boys as satellites rather than potential rivals, as Cronkite seemed to be.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Persico|first1=Joseph E.|title=Edward R.

At a dinner party hosted by Bill Downs at his home in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], Cronkite and Murrow argued over the role of sponsors, which Cronkite accepted as necessary and said \"paid the rent.\" Murrow, who had long despised sponsors despite also relying on them, responded angrily. In another instance, an argument devolved into a \"duel\" in which the two drunkenly took a pair of antique dueling pistols and pretended to shoot at each other.<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|527}} Despite this, Cronkite went on to have a long career as an anchor at CBS.\n\nAfter the end of ''See It Now,'' Murrow was invited by New York's Democratic Party to run for the Senate. Paley was enthusiastic and encouraged him to do it. Harry Truman advised Murrow that his choice was between being the junior senator from New York or being Edward R. Murrow, beloved broadcast journalist, and hero to millions. He listened to Truman.<ref name=\"Edward R 2004\"/>\n\nAfter contributing to the first episode of the documentary series ''[[CBS Reports]]'', Murrow, increasingly under physical stress due to his conflicts and frustration with CBS, took a sabbatical from summer 1959 to mid-1960, though he continued to work on ''CBS Reports'' and ''Small World'' during this period. Friendly, executive producer of ''CBS Reports'', wanted the network to allow Murrow to again be his co-producer after the sabbatical, but he was eventually turned down.\n\nMurrow's last major TV milestone was reporting and narrating the ''CBS Reports'' installment \"[[Harvest of Shame]],\" a report on the plight of migrant farmworkers in the United States. Directed by Friendly and produced by David Lowe, it ran in November 1960, just after [[Thanksgiving]].\n\n===Summary of television work===\n* 1951\u20131958 \u2013 ''[[See It Now]]'' (host)\n* 1953\u20131959 \u2013 ''[[Person to Person]]'' (host)\n* 1958\u20131960 \u2013 ''Small World'' (moderator and producer)\n\n===United States Information Agency (USIA) Director===\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right\n | audio1 = [https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/pressclub/murrow.html National Press Club Luncheon Speakers], Edward R.

Murrow was drawn into Vietnam because the USIA was assigned to convince reporters in Saigon that the government of [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] embodied the hopes and dreams of the Vietnamese people.

Fellow journalists [[Eric Sevareid]], [[Ed Bliss]], [[Bill Downs]], [[Dan Rather]], and [[Alexander Kendrick]] consider Murrow one of journalism's greatest figures, noting his honesty and integrity in delivering the news.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Journalism sidebar}}\nMurrow was born Egbert Roscoe Murrow at Polecat Creek, near [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]],<ref name=Baker>Baker, Anne Pimlott (2004), [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47830 \"Murrow, Edward Roscoe (1908\u20131965)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, accessed December 7, 2010</ref> in [[Guilford County, North Carolina]], the son of Roscoe Conklin Murrow and Ethel F.

Edwards, B. 2004.</ref> His home was a log cabin without electricity or plumbing, on a farm bringing in only a few hundred dollars a year from corn and hay.\n\nWhen Murrow was six years old, his family moved across the country to [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit County]] in [[Western Washington|western]] [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to [[Homestead principle|homestead]] near [[Blanchard, Washington|Blanchard]], {{convert|30|mi|-1}} south of the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]]. He attended high school in nearby [[Edison, Washington|Edison]], and was president of the student body in his senior year and excelled on the debate team. He was also a member of the basketball team which won the Skagit County championship.\n\nAfter graduation from high school in 1926, Murrow enrolled at [[Washington State University|Washington State College]] (now Washington State University) across the state in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], and eventually majored in speech. A member of the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], he was also active in college politics. By his teen years, Murrow went by the nickname \"Ed\" and during his second year of college, he changed his name from Egbert to Edward. In 1929, while attending the annual convention of the [[National Student Federation of America]], Murrow gave a speech urging college students to become more interested in national and world affairs; this led to his election as president of the federation. After earning his bachelor's degree in 1930, he moved back east to New York.\n\nMurrow was assistant director of the [[Institute of International Education]] from 1932 to 1935 and served as assistant secretary of the [[Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars]], which helped prominent German scholars who had been dismissed from academic positions. He married [[Janet Huntington Brewster]] on March 12, 1935. Their son, Charles Casey Murrow, was born in the west of London on November 6, 1945.\n\n==Career at CBS==\nMurrow joined [[CBS]] as director of talks and education in 1935 and remained with the network for his entire career.<ref name=Baker /> CBS did not have news staff when Murrow joined, save for announcer [[Robert Trout|Bob Trout]]. Murrow's job was to line up newsmakers who would appear on the network to talk about the issues of the day. But the onetime Washington State speech major was intrigued by Trout's on-air delivery, and Trout gave Murrow tips on how to communicate effectively on radio.\n\nMurrow went to London in 1937 to serve as the director of CBS's European operations. The position did not involve on-air reporting; his job was persuading European figures to broadcast over the CBS network, which was in direct competition with [[NBC]]'s two radio networks. During this time, he made frequent trips around Europe.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Norton|title=They Also Serve: Edward R.

While Murrow was in [[Poland]] arranging a broadcast of children's choruses, he got word from Shirer of the annexation\u2014and the fact that Shirer could not get the story out through Austrian state radio facilities. Murrow immediately sent Shirer to London, where he delivered an uncensored, eyewitness account of the Anschluss. Murrow then chartered the only transportation available, a 23-passenger plane, to fly from [[Warsaw]] to [[Vienna]] so he could take over for Shirer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Norton|title=They Also Serve: Edward R.

On March 13, 1938, the special was broadcast, hosted by Bob Trout in New York, including Shirer in London (with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] [[Ellen Wilkinson]]), reporter [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] of the ''Chicago Daily News'' in Paris, reporter [[Pierre J. Huss]] of the International News Service in [[Berlin]], and Senator [[Lewis B. Schwellenbach]] in Washington, D.C. Reporter [[Frank Gervasi]], in Rome, was unable to find a transmitter to broadcast reaction from the Italian capital but phoned his script to Shirer in London, who read it on the air.<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|116\u2013120}} Murrow reported live from Vienna, in the first on-the-scene news report of his career: \"This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna.... It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning, and Herr Hitler has not yet arrived.\"\n\nThe broadcast was considered revolutionary at the time. Featuring multipoint, live reports transmitted by shortwave in the days before modern technology (and without each of the parties necessarily being able to hear one another), it came off almost flawlessly. The special became the basis for ''[[CBS World News Roundup|World News Roundup]]''\u2014broadcasting's oldest news series, which still runs each weekday morning and evening on the [[CBS News Radio|CBS Radio Network]].\n\nIn September 1938, Murrow and Shirer were regular participants in CBS's coverage of the crisis over the [[Sudetenland]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], which Hitler coveted for Germany and eventually won in the [[Munich Agreement]]. Their incisive reporting heightened the American appetite for radio news, with listeners regularly waiting for Murrow's [[shortwave]] broadcasts, introduced by analyst [[H. V. Kaltenborn]] in New York saying, \"Calling Ed Murrow ... come in Ed Murrow.\"\n\nDuring the following year, leading up to the outbreak of [[World War II]], Murrow continued to be based in London. William Shirer's reporting from Berlin brought him national acclaim and a commentator's position with CBS News upon his return to the United States in December 1940. (Shirer would describe his [[Berlin]] experiences in his best-selling 1941 book ''[[Berlin Diary]]''.) When the war broke out in September 1939, Murrow stayed in London, and later provided live radio broadcasts during the height of [[the Blitz]] in ''[[London After Dark]]''. These live, shortwave broadcasts relayed on [[CBS]] electrified radio audiences as news programming never had: previous war coverage had mostly been provided by newspaper reports, along with [[newsreel]]s seen in movie theaters; earlier radio news programs had simply featured an announcer in a studio reading [[wire service]] reports.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Edward R. Murrow - Weymouth House 84-94 Hallam Street Fitzrovia W1W 5HF.jpg|thumb|Murrow lived in a flat on Hallam Street, near [[Great Portland Street]], in London during the War]]\nMurrow's reports, especially during the Blitz, began with what became his signature opening, \"''This'' is London,\" delivered with his vocal emphasis on the word ''this'', followed by the hint of a pause before the rest of the phrase. His former speech teacher, [[Ida Lou Anderson]], suggested the opening as a more concise alternative to the one he had inherited from his predecessor at CBS Europe, Cesar Saerchinger: \"Hello America. This is London calling.\" Murrow's phrase became synonymous with the newscaster and his network.<ref name=\"link\">{{cite web| title=Edward R.

They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with \"good night, and good luck.\" The future British monarch, [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]], said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said \"good night, and good luck to you all\". So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with \"Good night, and good luck.\" Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.\n\nWhen Murrow returned to the U.S. in 1941, CBS hosted a dinner in his honor on December 2 at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. 1,100 guests attended the dinner, which the network broadcast. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent a welcome-back telegram, which was read at the dinner, and [[Librarian of Congress]] [[Archibald MacLeish]] gave an [[encomium]] that commented on the power and intimacy of Murrow's wartime dispatches.<ref name=\"sperber1998\">{{cite book | title=Murrow, His Life and Times | publisher=Fordham University Press | author=Sperber, A.

Murrow's skill at improvising vivid descriptions of what was going on around or below him, derived in part from his college training in speech, aided the effectiveness of his radio broadcasts.\n\nAs hostilities expanded, Murrow expanded CBS News in London into what [[Harrison Salisbury]] described as \"the finest news staff anybody had ever put together in Europe\".<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|230}} The result was a group of reporters acclaimed for their intellect and descriptive power, including [[Eric Sevareid]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Howard K.

Many of them, Shirer included, were later dubbed \"[[Murrow Boys|Murrow's Boys]]\"\u2014despite Breckinridge being a woman. In 1944, Murrow sought [[Walter Cronkite]] to take over for Bill Downs at the CBS Moscow bureau. Cronkite initially accepted, but after receiving a better offer from his current employer, [[United Press International|United Press]], he turned down the offer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Persico|first1=Joseph|title=Edward R.

CBS, of which Murrow was then vice president for public affairs, decided to \"move in a new direction,\" hired a new host, and let Shirer go. There are different versions of these events; Shirer's was not made public until 1990.\n\nShirer contended that the root of his troubles was the network and sponsor not standing by him because of his comments critical of the [[Truman Doctrine]], as well as other comments that were considered outside of the mainstream. Shirer and his supporters felt he was being muzzled because of his views. Meanwhile, Murrow, and even some of Murrow's Boys, felt that Shirer was coasting on his high reputation and not working hard enough to bolster his analyses with his own research.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Murrow and Shirer never regained their close friendship.\n\nThe episode hastened Murrow's desire to give up his network vice presidency and return to newscasting, and it foreshadowed his own problems to come with his friend Paley, boss of CBS.\n\nMurrow and Paley had become close when the network chief himself joined the war effort, setting up [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] radio outlets in Italy and North Africa. After the war, he would often go to Paley directly to settle any problems he had. \"Ed Murrow was Bill Paley's one genuine friend in CBS,\" noted Murrow biographer [[Joseph Persico]].\n\nMurrow returned to the air in September 1947, taking over the nightly 7:45&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] newscast sponsored by [[Campbell's Soup]] and anchored by his old friend and announcing coach Bob Trout. For the next several years Murrow focused on radio, and in addition to news reports he produced special presentations for CBS News Radio. In 1950, he narrated a half-hour radio documentary called \"The Case of the Flying Saucer.\" It offered a balanced look at [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]], a subject of widespread interest at the time. Murrow interviewed both [[Kenneth Arnold]] and astronomer [[Donald Menzel]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Crucial Decade: Voices of the Postwar Era, 1945-1954|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/voices-of-postwar.html|website=National Archives|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Case of the Flying Saucer|series=Special News Report|url=https://archive.org/download/1950-1959RadioNews/1950-04-07-CBS-Edward-R-Murrow-Case-Of-The-Flying-Saucer.mp3|credits=Edward R.

He continued to present daily radio news reports on the CBS Radio Network until 1959. He also recorded a series of narrated \"historical albums\" for [[Columbia Records]] called ''I Can Hear It Now'', which inaugurated his partnership with producer [[Fred W. Friendly]]. In 1950 the records evolved into a weekly CBS Radio show, ''[[Hear It Now]]'', hosted by Murrow and co-produced by Murrow and Friendly.\n\n===Television and films===\nAs the 1950s began, Murrow began his television career by appearing in editorial \"tailpieces\" on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' and in the coverage of special events. This came despite his own misgivings about the new medium and its emphasis on pictures rather than ideas.\n\nOn November 18, 1951, ''Hear It Now'' moved to television and was re-christened ''[[See It Now]]''. In the first episode, Murrow explained: \"This is an old team, trying to learn a new trade.\"<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|354}}\n\nIn 1952, Murrow narrated the political documentary ''Alliance for Peace'', an information vehicle for the newly formed [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] detailing the effects of the [[Marshall Plan]] upon a war-torn Europe. It was written by [[William Templeton (screenwriter)|William Templeton]] and produced by [[Samuel Goldwyn Jr.]]\n\nIn 1953, Murrow launched a second weekly TV show, a series of celebrity interviews entitled ''[[Person to Person]]''.\n\n====Criticism of McCarthyism====\n''See It Now'' focused on a number of controversial issues in the 1950s, but it is best remembered as the show that criticized [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]], contributing, if not leading, to the political downfall of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. McCarthy had previously commended Murrow for his fairness in reporting.<ref name=\"Wertenbaker\"/>\n\nOn March 9, 1954, Murrow, Friendly, and their news team produced a half-hour ''See It Now'' special titled \"A Report on Senator Joseph McCarthy\".<ref name=\"seenow540309\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/murrowmccarthy.html|title=A Report on Senator Joseph R.

Murrow and Friendly paid for their own newspaper advertisement for the program; they were not allowed to use CBS's money for the publicity campaign or even use the CBS logo.\n\nThe broadcast contributed to a nationwide backlash against McCarthy and is seen as a turning point in the history of television.

McCarthy accepted the invitation and appeared on April 6, 1954. In his response, McCarthy rejected Murrow's criticism and accused him of being a communist sympathizer. McCarthy also made an appeal to the public by attacking his detractors, stating:\n\n{{quote|Ordinarily, I would not take time out from the important work at hand to answer Murrow.

Murrow at work with CBS, 1957]]\n\n====Later television career====\nMurrow's hard-hitting approach to the news, however, cost him influence in the world of television. ''See It Now'' occasionally scored high ratings (usually when it was tackling a particularly controversial subject), but in general, it did not score well on prime-time television.\n\nWhen a quiz show phenomenon began and took TV by storm in the mid-1950s, Murrow realized the days of ''See It Now'' as a weekly show were numbered. (Biographer Joseph Persico notes that Murrow, watching an early episode of ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'' air just before his own ''See It Now'', is said to have turned to Friendly and asked how long they expected to keep their time slot).\n\n''See It Now'' was knocked out of its weekly slot in 1955 after sponsor [[Alcoa]] withdrew its advertising, but the show remained as a series of occasional TV special news reports that defined television documentary news coverage. Despite the show's prestige, CBS had difficulty finding a regular sponsor, since it aired intermittently in its new time slot (Sunday afternoons at 5 p.m. ET by the end of 1956) and could not develop a regular audience.\n\nIn 1956, Murrow took time to appear as the on-screen narrator of a special prologue for [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s epic production, ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. Although the prologue was generally omitted on telecasts of the film, it was included in home video releases.\n\nBeginning in 1958, Murrow hosted a talk show entitled ''Small World'' that brought together political figures for one-to-one debates. In January 1959, he appeared on [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]'s ''The Press and the People'' with [[Louis Lyons]], discussing the responsibilities of television journalism.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Press and the People: The Responsibilities of Television, Part II|date=January 24, 1959|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_30960AC28BBF43E3AF25923B13B5FEBD|website=Open Vault from WGBH|publisher=WGBH Media Library and Archives|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMurrow appeared as himself in a cameo in the British film production of ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' in 1960, recreating some of the wartime broadcasts he did from London for CBS.<ref name=\"bismark\">{{IMDb title|0054310|Sink the Bismarck!}}</ref>\n\nOn September 16, 1962, he introduced educational television to New York City via the maiden broadcast of WNDT, which became [[WNET]].\n\n====Fall from favor====\nMurrow's reporting brought him into repeated conflicts with CBS, especially its chairman William Paley, which Friendly summarized in his book ''Due to Circumstances Beyond our Control''. ''See It Now'' ended entirely in the summer of 1958 after a clash in Paley's office. Murrow had complained to Paley he could not continue doing the show if the network repeatedly provided (without consulting Murrow) equal time to subjects who felt wronged by the program.\n\nAccording to Friendly, Murrow asked Paley if he was going to destroy ''See It Now'', into which the CBS chief executive had invested so much. Paley replied that he did not want a constant stomach ache every time Murrow covered a controversial subject.<ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Sally Bedell | authorlink = Sally Bedell Smith | title = In All His Glory: The Life of William S.

Three months later, on October 15, 1958, in a speech before the [[Radio Television Digital News Association|Radio and Television News Directors Association]] in Chicago, Murrow blasted TV's emphasis on entertainment and commercialism at the expense of [[public interest]] in his \"wires and lights\" speech:\n\n{{quote|During the daily peak viewing periods, television in the main insulates us from the realities of the world in which we live. If this state of affairs continues, we may alter an advertising slogan to read: ''Look now, pay later''.<ref name=\"rtnda58\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/content/edward_r_murrow_s_1958_wires_lights_in_a_box_speech|title=Edward R. Murrow Speech|publisher=Radio-Television News Directors Association|date=October 15, 1958|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nThe harsh tone of the Chicago speech seriously damaged Murrow's friendship with Paley, who felt Murrow was biting the hand that fed him. Before his death, Friendly said that the RTNDA (now [[Radio Television Digital News Association]]) address did more than the McCarthy show to break the relationship between the CBS boss and his most respected journalist.\n\nAnother contributing element to Murrow's career decline was the rise of a new crop of television journalists. Walter Cronkite's arrival at CBS in 1950 marked the beginning of a major rivalry which continued until Murrow resigned from the network in 1961. Murrow held a grudge dating back to 1944, when Cronkite turned down his offer to head the CBS Moscow bureau.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Timothy M|title=Assignment to Hell: The War Against Nazi Germany with Correspondents Walter Cronkite, Andy Rooney, A.J. Liebling, Homer Bigart, and Hal Boyle|year=2013|publisher=NAL Caliber Trade|pages=528|isbn=0451417151}}</ref> With the Murrow Boys dominating the newsroom, Cronkite felt like an outsider soon after joining the network. Over time, as Murrow's career seemed on the decline and Cronkite's on the rise, the two found it increasingly difficult to work together. Cronkite's demeanor was similar to reporters Murrow had hired; the difference being that Murrow viewed the Murrow Boys as satellites rather than potential rivals, as Cronkite seemed to be.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Persico|first1=Joseph E.|title=Edward R.

At a dinner party hosted by Bill Downs at his home in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], Cronkite and Murrow argued over the role of sponsors, which Cronkite accepted as necessary and said \"paid the rent.\" Murrow, who had long despised sponsors despite also relying on them, responded angrily. In another instance, an argument devolved into a \"duel\" in which the two drunkenly took a pair of antique dueling pistols and pretended to shoot at each other.<ref name=\"sperber1998\"/>{{rp|527}} Despite this, Cronkite went on to have a long career as an anchor at CBS.\n\nAfter the end of ''See It Now,'' Murrow was invited by New York's Democratic Party to run for the Senate. Paley was enthusiastic and encouraged him to do it. Harry Truman advised Murrow that his choice was between being the junior senator from New York or being Edward R. Murrow, beloved broadcast journalist, and hero to millions. He listened to Truman.<ref name=\"Edward R 2004\"/>\n\nAfter contributing to the first episode of the documentary series ''[[CBS Reports]]'', Murrow, increasingly under physical stress due to his conflicts and frustration with CBS, took a sabbatical from summer 1959 to mid-1960, though he continued to work on ''CBS Reports'' and ''Small World'' during this period. Friendly, executive producer of ''CBS Reports'', wanted the network to allow Murrow to again be his co-producer after the sabbatical, but he was eventually turned down.\n\nMurrow's last major TV milestone was reporting and narrating the ''CBS Reports'' installment \"[[Harvest of Shame]],\" a report on the plight of migrant farmworkers in the United States. Directed by Friendly and produced by David Lowe, it ran in November 1960, just after [[Thanksgiving]].\n\n===Summary of television work===\n* 1951\u20131958 \u2013 ''[[See It Now]]'' (host)\n* 1953\u20131959 \u2013 ''[[Person to Person]]'' (host)\n* 1958\u20131960 \u2013 ''Small World'' (moderator and producer)\n\n===United States Information Agency (USIA) Director===\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right\n | audio1 = [https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/pressclub/murrow.html National Press Club Luncheon Speakers], Edward R.
