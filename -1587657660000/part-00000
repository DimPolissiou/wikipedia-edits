All the predictions before the fight were the two would unleash early in the contest, and they came true as Parker won the fight with a stunning second-round blow. Parker secured the [[List of New Zealand heavyweight boxing champions|New Zealand National Boxing Federation title]] with an impressive win marred only by a serious cut he suffered in the opening round when the fighters clashed heads. The fight doctor considered ending the fight after the first round due to the state of the cut above the left eye but Parker's manager [[Kevin Barry (boxer)|Kevin Barry]] pleaded for a second round and got it. His charge responded with a flurry of punches which lowered former champion Tatupu two minutes into the second round. Tatupu came out strong in the first round and threw some good shots, testing the chin of the then 21-year-old rising star.

The fight, on the undercard of [[Wladimir Klitschko]]'s world heavyweight title defence against Australian [[Alex Leapai]], was Parker's eighth as a professional. Nascimento, who was a late replacement for durable veteran Sherman Williams, brought a 17\u20135 record to the contest, which was largely padded by results in his homeland. But in the seventh, which turned out to be the final frame, Parker's power began to show and when Nascimento was unable to defend himself the bout was stopped.\n\nIn his next bout he defeated 39-year-old defending American WBO Oriental heavyweight champion [[Brian Minto]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/othersports-news/joseph-parker-fight-brian-minto-5943082 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430234250/http://tvnz.co.nz/othersports-news/joseph-parker-fight-brian-minto-5943082|title=Joseph Parker Fight Brian Minto |archivedate=30 April 2014 }}</ref> on 5 July 2014 in [[Auckland, New Zealand]].

After dominating the opening two rounds, Parker put away the veteran with a stunning combination one minute into the third round. He set it up with a straight left and finished it off with a powerful overhand right.

Parker was in control from the opening bell and made his first inroads in the third when he landed a right and left to Haumono's head, though he responded by winging Parker on the jaw, a blow that was brushed off.

The judges scored the fight 118\u2013110, 118\u2013110, and 119\u2013109 in favour of Joshua. Many media outlets including ESPN had the fight around 116\u2013112 with Joshua the clear winner. With going the distance, Joshua's 20 fight knockout streak came to an end. Parker used his movement well to slip a lot of Joshua's attack but in doing so did not do enough himself to win more rounds. Parker started on the backfoot in the opening rounds allowing Joshua to take the rounds. There was an accidental clash of heads in round 3, however, neither boxer was cut from this. There was another accidental head-butt in round 9 where the referee called for a short break. Joshua's tape on his left glove kept coming loose and he was ordered to go back to his corner for a re-tape. Parker suffered a cut over his left eye after Joshua accidentally elbowed him. In round 12, neither boxers engaged as much as expected with Joshua trying to track Parker down, who again, on the backfoot looked to survive the round. The fight was marred by Italian referee Giuseppe Quartarone, who kept both boxers from fighting on the inside. This mostly had a negative impact on Parker, where he was seen to have the most success. The referee was breaking the action each time both boxers were on the inside, even when they were still throwing shots. Many boxers, pundits and both the Sky Sports and Showtime broadcast team criticised the referee during and after the fight.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/22982698/anthony-joshua-defeats-joseph-parker-via-unanimous-decision-unify-3-heavyweight-titles|title=Joshua unifies 3 belts, wants Wilder fight next|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/joshua/news/34644/11312222/1|title=Joshua vs Parker: Anthony Joshua completes wide points win over Joseph Parker in Cardiff|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fight, Joshua explained his game plan for the fight, \"My strategy in there was kind of stick behind the jab.

And that secured another championship belt. So I stuck behind the jab and I made sure anything that was coming back, I was switched on, I was focused and 12 rounds, baby! I thought it was hard, right?\" Parker was humble in defeat and stated he would back stronger, \"Today I got beaten by a better champion, bigger man. A lot to work on.

Whyte knocked Parker down twice in the fight in dropping him in rounds 2 and 9. It looked as though a short left hook dropped Parker for the first time in his career, however, the instant replay showed it was a clash of heads leaving Parker concussed with no time to recover. Referee Ian John Lewis made the count. Most of the middle rounds were mostly back and forth action with both fighters having success. Whyte was coming forward, countering and began using his jab more and Parker was mostly on the back foot, using movement and landing 2-3 punch combinations. After round 6, Whyte began to show fatigue. This did not prevent him from carrying on going forward trying to land big shots as Parker was wary of Whyte's power. Whyte also starting using roughhouse tactics after the first few rounds. This included [[rabbit punch]]es, [[head-butting]], holding and hitting and pushing Parker over the ropes. He was warned once earlier in the fight and then warned again in the championship rounds, however, no points were deducted. Parker took over in the championship rounds but was unable to put Whyte away. Parker had an explosive start to round 12, knowing he needed a knockout to win, eventually knocked down a fatigued Whyte with 20 seconds left in the fight with a right hand to the head. Whyte got to his feet and survived the remaining seconds of the fight.

I was rocked and took a few.\" Whyte stated he would take another fight before the end of 2018 and ready for Anthony Joshua in April 2019, \"I would like to fight Joshua again if he wants it.

The reason for this was because Parker's team believed the head clash in round 2 which dropped Parker to the canvas affected the scorecards as well as Parker's performance during the middle rounds. It is believed that Parker was having success in round 2 before the head clash, therefore had the knockdown not occurred, the round would have been scored 10\u20139 in favour of Parker instead 10\u20138 for Whyte. In a statement, Higgins said, \"It\u2019s clear that the clash of heads in the second round had a significant impact on the fight. In terms of the scorecards and Joseph\u2019s performance in the middle rounds (the headbutt made a big difference). In light of what is clear evidence of a significant error by the officials, there is a legitimate question as to whether the result should stand. That\u2019s a question Duco will be asking the sanctioning bodies on Joseph\u2019s behalf.\" Looking at the alternative scorecard having round 2 in favour of Parker would have resulted in the bout being scored a split decision draw.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldboxingnews.net/2018080325061/news/alternative-scorecard-shows-headbutt-knockdown-error-cost-joseph-parker-dillian-whyte-draw|title=ALTERNATIVE SCORECARD shows HEADBUTT KNOCKDOWN cost Joseph Parker Dillian Whyte DRAW|last=WBN|work=WBN - World Boxing News|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2018/08/02/joseph-parker-launch-appeal-wbc-wbo-following-dillian-whyte/|title=Joseph Parker to launch appeal to WBC and WBO following Dillian Whyte defeat|last=Davies|first=Gareth A.|date=2018-08-02|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Higgins later revealed they would appeal but instead work towards a rematch with Whyte in the future.

Parker secured the [[List of New Zealand heavyweight boxing champions|New Zealand National Boxing Federation title]] with an impressive win marred only by a serious cut he suffered in the opening round when the fighters clashed heads.

Nascimento, who was a late replacement for durable veteran Sherman Williams, brought a 17\u20135 record to the contest, which was largely padded by results in his homeland.

The New Zealand-born Australian Meehan earned his shot at the promising heavyweight after winning the Super 8 competition and beating Kiwi veteran [[Shane Cameron]]. Parker's dynamic hand speed and power destroyed veteran Kali Meehan inside three rounds of their heavyweight clash. After dominating the opening two rounds, Parker put away the veteran with a stunning combination one minute into the third round. He set it up with a straight left and finished it off with a powerful overhand right. Meehan struggled to get up off the canvas and wobbled against the ropes with referee Ferlin Marsh waving the finish for a technical knockout.

Far from the one or two round finishes of his more recent fights, Parker was made to work for his victory by a staunch and determined Bergman. The challenger offered very little on offense but displayed some impressive mettle in soldiering through a number of Parker onslaughts, the champion tenderising the body relentlessly in what proved to be the ideal workout against his first [[southpaw]] opponent. After twice sending Bergman to his knee in earlier rounds for the count, one particularly brutal liver shot crumbled the American, the referee had seen enough as he waved off the fight.<ref>{{cite news |title=Joseph Parker overpowers Jason Bergman in Samoa |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/76191256/joseph-parker-overpowers-jason-bergman-in-samoa |publisher=Stuff |date=24 January 2016 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Title contention ===\nIt was confirmed that Parker and [[Carlos Takam]] would fight on 21 May 2016 in an [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] heavyweight eliminator.

Haumono's WBA Oceania and PABA heavyweight titles were initially on the line. It was hyped as a [[Trans-Tasman]] grudge match with Parker's IBF world heavyweight mandatory position on the line which attracted the attention of the Australian media and public. Pre-fight Parker predicted he would need the formative rounds of twelve to get a feel and once he found his range a tiring Haumono was visibly struggling before he was dropped by a right uppercut and failed to beat referee [[Bruce McTavish]]'s count, being another routine victory for Parker via a fourth-round knockout. Parker was in control from the opening bell and made his first inroads in the third when he landed a right and left to Haumono's head, though he responded by winging Parker on the jaw, a blow that was brushed off. Haumono thought he had beat the count and was fit to continue, though it was only a matter of time before Parker ended proceeding before a capacity crowd of 5,500.<ref>{{cite news |title=Unbeaten Joseph Parker protects world heavyweight title fight by beating Solomon Haumono |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/82347674/Unbeaten-Joseph-Parker-protects-world-heavyweight-title-fight-by-beating-Solomon-Haumono |publisher=Stuff |date=11 July 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nParker's team made the announcement of Parker's 1 October fight in late July with the tall [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born [[Germany|German]] [[Alexander Dimitrenko]] in a 12-round bout at the [[Vodafone Events Centre]] in Manukau, the same venue Parker secured a points win over Carlos Takam to secure the IBF number one mandatory position in May. Trainer [[Kevin Barry (boxer)|Kevin Barry]] commented that the Dimitrenko bout was a preparation for his eventual heavyweight title fight with Anthony Joshua.

He then used his speed in round two and knocked Dimitrenko down twice following right hands. Dimitrenko was knocked down a final time in round three; as he was falling, Parker hit another body shot, which the referee appeared to miss.

Parker showed Fury respect throughout the fight, having to get through Fury's jab in order to land anything. The opening six rounds saw Fury flicking his jab into thin air, which caused Parker to think twice before going on the attack. Parker started finding his shots in the latter half. Parker finished strong in the last two rounds as Fury started showing signs of fatigue. In the post-fight, Parker said, \"I felt the aggression was good on my side.

The judges scored the fight 118\u2013110, 118\u2013110, and 119\u2013109 in favour of Joshua. Many media outlets including ESPN had the fight around 116\u2013112 with Joshua the clear winner. With going the distance, Joshua's 20 fight knockout streak came to an end. Parker used his movement well to slip a lot of Joshua's attack but in doing so did not do enough himself to win more rounds. Parker started on the backfoot in the opening rounds allowing Joshua to take the rounds. There was an accidental clash of heads in round 3, however, neither boxer was cut from this. There was another accidental head-butt in round 9 where the referee called for a short break. Joshua's tape on his left glove kept coming loose and he was ordered to go back to his corner for a re-tape. Parker suffered a cut over his left eye after Joshua accidentally elbowed him. In round 12, neither boxers engaged as much as expected with Joshua trying to track Parker down, who again, on the backfoot looked to survive the round. The fight was marred by Italian referee Giuseppe Quartarone, who kept both boxers from fighting on the inside. This mostly had a negative impact on Parker, where he was seen to have the most success. The referee was breaking the action each time both boxers were on the inside, even when they were still throwing shots. Many boxers, pundits and both the Sky Sports and Showtime broadcast team criticised the referee during and after the fight.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/22982698/anthony-joshua-defeats-joseph-parker-via-unanimous-decision-unify-3-heavyweight-titles|title=Joshua unifies 3 belts, wants Wilder fight next|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/joshua/news/34644/11312222/1|title=Joshua vs Parker: Anthony Joshua completes wide points win over Joseph Parker in Cardiff|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fight, Joshua explained his game plan for the fight, \"My strategy in there was kind of stick behind the jab.

And that secured another championship belt. So I stuck behind the jab and I made sure anything that was coming back, I was switched on, I was focused and 12 rounds, baby!

Whyte knocked Parker down twice in the fight in dropping him in rounds 2 and 9. It looked as though a short left hook dropped Parker for the first time in his career, however, the instant replay showed it was a clash of heads leaving Parker concussed with no time to recover. Referee Ian John Lewis made the count. Most of the middle rounds were mostly back and forth action with both fighters having success. Whyte was coming forward, countering and began using his jab more and Parker was mostly on the back foot, using movement and landing 2-3 punch combinations. After round 6, Whyte began to show fatigue. This did not prevent him from carrying on going forward trying to land big shots as Parker was wary of Whyte's power. Whyte also starting using roughhouse tactics after the first few rounds. This included [[rabbit punch]]es, [[head-butting]], holding and hitting and pushing Parker over the ropes. He was warned once earlier in the fight and then warned again in the championship rounds, however, no points were deducted. Parker took over in the championship rounds but was unable to put Whyte away. Parker had an explosive start to round 12, knowing he needed a knockout to win, eventually knocked down a fatigued Whyte with 20 seconds left in the fight with a right hand to the head.

If the first knock down was ruled as a clash of heads, the decision would have been a split draw, officially making the judges scores 112\u2013114, 114-112 and 113-113.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/44994831|title=Dillian Whyte beats Joseph Parker in gruelling contest|date=2018-07-28|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/boxing/995731/Dillian-Whyte-Joseph-Parker-result-pundit-Steve-Bunce-boxing-news|title=Dillian Whyte and Joseph Parker should have been a DRAW - pundit|last=Wilson|first=Andy|date=2018-07-29|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nStanding together, speaking to Sky Sports after the fight, Whyte gave Parker credit, \"He was slick and I knew he was going to fight for the first few rounds, then come back in the final few rounds. I am annoyed I slipped at the final hurdle in the last round. I was rocked and took a few.\" Whyte stated he would take another fight before the end of 2018 and ready for Anthony Joshua in April 2019, \"I would like to fight Joshua again if he wants it.

The reason for this was because Parker's team believed the head clash in round 2 which dropped Parker to the canvas affected the scorecards as well as Parker's performance during the middle rounds. It is believed that Parker was having success in round 2 before the head clash, therefore had the knockdown not occurred, the round would have been scored 10\u20139 in favour of Parker instead 10\u20138 for Whyte. In a statement, Higgins said, \"It\u2019s clear that the clash of heads in the second round had a significant impact on the fight. In terms of the scorecards and Joseph\u2019s performance in the middle rounds (the headbutt made a big difference). In light of what is clear evidence of a significant error by the officials, there is a legitimate question as to whether the result should stand. That\u2019s a question Duco will be asking the sanctioning bodies on Joseph\u2019s behalf.\" Looking at the alternative scorecard having round 2 in favour of Parker would have resulted in the bout being scored a split decision draw.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldboxingnews.net/2018080325061/news/alternative-scorecard-shows-headbutt-knockdown-error-cost-joseph-parker-dillian-whyte-draw|title=ALTERNATIVE SCORECARD shows HEADBUTT KNOCKDOWN cost Joseph Parker Dillian Whyte DRAW|last=WBN|work=WBN - World Boxing News|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2018/08/02/joseph-parker-launch-appeal-wbc-wbo-following-dillian-whyte/|title=Joseph Parker to launch appeal to WBC and WBO following Dillian Whyte defeat|last=Davies|first=Gareth A.|date=2018-08-02|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Higgins later revealed they would appeal but instead work towards a rematch with Whyte in the future.

There were many tuberculosis cases in Louisville at the time because of all the wetlands along the Ohio River, which were perfect for the tuberculosis bacteria. To try to contain the disease, a two-story wooden sanatorium was opened which consisted of an administrative/main building and two open air pavilions, each housing 20 patients, for the treatment of \"early cases\".\n\n<blockquote>In the early part of 1911, the city of Louisville began to make preparations to build a new Louisville City Hospital, and the hospital commissioners decided in their plans that there would be no provision made in the new City Hospital for the admission of pulmonary tuberculosis, and the Board of Tuberculosis Hospital was given $25,000 to erect a hospital for the care of advanced cases of pulmonary tuberculosis.<ref name=\"Board Report 3\">[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~waverlymemorial/documents/board_of_tb_hospital/pages/3.html Report of Board of Tuberculosis Hospitals (1915)].

The remaining patients were sent to Hazelwood Sanatorium in Louisville. Waverly Hills closed in June 1961.\n\n===Woodhaven Medical Services===\nThe building was reopened in 1962 as '''Woodhaven Geriatric Center''', a nursing home primarily treating aging patients with various stages of dementia and mobility limits, as well as the severely mentally handicapped.

It was built on the first floor with the rest of the building. The corridor is 500 feet to the bottom of the hill and has a set of stairs on one side, which were the stairs used for the workers. On the other side, there was a cart that moved up and down the stair case which transported supplies and other necessities.\n\nSince antibiotics did not exist in the time that the sanatorium was active, other forms of aid were used to treat TB patients. For example, heat lamps, fresh air, and positive talk and reassurance helped to keep patients alive, since the death rate of TB patients at the time was one death per day. However, at the peak of the disease, the sight of the dead being carried away in full view of the patients lowered the patient morale, increasing the number of deaths per day. Therefore, the sanatorium tried transporting the dead bodies as secretively as possible to increase the morale and lower the death rates, using the tunnel to that end. The doctors and workers of this time also believed that this would help to lower the disease's spreading rate.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Restoration===\nAfter Alberhasky's efforts failed, Waverly Hills was sold to Tina and Charlie Mattingly in 2001. The Mattinglys hold tours of Waverly Hills and host a [[haunted house]] attraction each Halloween, with proceeds going toward restoration of the property. They're also currently restoring all the windows in the decrepit building while restoring the interior of the old sanatorium.<ref>Seewer, John.
