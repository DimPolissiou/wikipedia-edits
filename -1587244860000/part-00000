Graham wrote for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that he thought ''Time'' had shown \"a pattern of lackluster choices\" and the overall promotional nature of the process shouldn't be treated as news, rather simply viewed as [[marketing]]. He remarked, \"Is anyone out there {{em|not}} sick of people ironically listing 'Time Person of the Year, 2006' in Twitter bios, a reference to the gimmicky selection of 'You' that year?\"<ref name=graham>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/everyone-should-ignore-times-person-of-the-year/266462/ |title=Everyone Should Ignore Time's Person of the Year |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the decision raised some criticism as it was described as ideological and even hypocritically political. Some weeks before the announcement, ''Time'' decided to ask the users in a poll, \"Who Should Be Person of the Year?\"  After several weeks, the poll winner by a wide margin was [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], the president of [[Venezuela]], with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], came in second. ''Time'' did not mention these results in the announcement of their \"Person of the Year\" and its critics claimed that ''Time'' discounted input from its [[digital democracy]] among its readers. ''Time'' supporters argue that an online poll is not representative as it has no scientific value.

Graham wrote for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' that he thought ''Time'' had shown \"a pattern of lackluster choices\" and the overall promotional nature of the process shouldn't be treated as news, rather simply viewed as [[marketing]]. He remarked, \"Is anyone out there {{em|not}} sick of people ironically listing 'Time Person of the Year, 2006' in Twitter bios, a reference to the gimmicky selection of 'You' that year?\"<ref name=graham>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/everyone-should-ignore-times-person-of-the-year/266462/ |title=Everyone Should Ignore Time's Person of the Year |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the decision raised some criticism as it was described as ideological and even hypocritically political. Some weeks before the announcement, ''Time'' decided to ask the users in a poll, \"Who Should Be Person of the Year?\"  After several weeks, the poll winner by a wide margin was [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], the president of [[Venezuela]], with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], came in second. ''Time'' did not mention these results in the announcement of their \"Person of the Year\" and its critics claimed that ''Time'' discounted input from its [[digital democracy]] among its readers. ''Time'' supporters argue that an online poll is not representative as it has no scientific value.

The line-up was Stewart Lupton (vocals), Tom Frank (bass), Paul Maroon (guitar and pedal steel), Matt Barrick (drums), and [[Walter Martin (musician)|Walter Martin]] (organs, keyboards).  After the band's break-up, Maroon, Barrick, and Martin went on to form [[The Walkmen]].\n\n==History==\nJonathan Fire*Eater was formed from a childhood band called The Ignobles.  All the members of Jonathan Fire*Eater attended high school at the D.C. private school [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]].  Lupton, Martin, and Barrick formed the Ignobles in junior high school.  Maroon joined as the guitarist and Ryan Cheney signed on as the vocalist. Lupton played bass. In 1993, the members went to college, mostly in New York City, and Jonathan Fire*Eater was formed with Cheney departing and later joining The Cunning Runts and Lupton taking over vocal duties.  St. Albans alum Tom Frank joined as a new bassist.\n\nIn 1995, they released their eponymous debut on Tucson, Arizona's Third World Underground Records, which featured \"Christmastime, Halloween\", \"To The Tigers\", and other tracks.  Later that year, a self-titled EP on PCP established their reputation with the frenetic tracks \"The Public Hanging of a Movie Star\" and \"When Prince Was a Kid\".\n\nIn 1996, the five-song mini-album ''[[Tremble Under Boom Lights]]''<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=210}}</ref> was released by the Medicine label, featuring well-produced offers such as \"The Search for Cherry Red\" and \"Give Me Daughters\". Reviews were positive, with [[AllMusic]] describing ''Tremble'' as \"a ferocious record\" despite its \"minor flaws.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/tremble-under-boom-lights-mw0000182829|title=Tremble Under Boom Lights - Jonathan Fire*Eater &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>  By this time, the band was receiving considerable media and industry attention. They were courted by [[Calvin Klein]] to model and opened for Brit Pop stars [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]].  As Lupton said in a 1996 ''New York Times Magazine'' profile, \"Right now the record companies are sort of circling like vultures.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn early 1997, Jonathan Fire*Eater signed with [[David Geffen]]'s nascent [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks]] music label.

The line-up was Stewart Lupton (vocals), Tom Frank (bass), Paul Maroon (guitar and pedal steel), Matt Barrick (drums), and [[Walter Martin (musician)|Walter Martin]] (organs, keyboards).  After the band's break-up, Maroon, Barrick, and Martin went on to form [[The Walkmen]].\n\n==History==\nJonathan Fire*Eater was formed from a childhood band called The Ignobles.  All the members of Jonathan Fire*Eater attended high school at the D.C. private school [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]].  Lupton, Martin, and Barrick formed the Ignobles in junior high school.  Maroon joined as the guitarist and Ryan Cheney signed on as the vocalist. Lupton played bass. In 1993, the members went to college, mostly in New York City, and Jonathan Fire*Eater was formed with Cheney departing and later joining The Cunning Runts and Lupton taking over vocal duties.  St. Albans alum Tom Frank joined as a new bassist.\n\nIn 1995, they released their eponymous debut on Tucson, Arizona's Third World Underground Records, which featured \"Christmastime, Halloween\", \"To The Tigers\", and other tracks.  Later that year, a self-titled EP on PCP established their reputation with the frenetic tracks \"The Public Hanging of a Movie Star\" and \"When Prince Was a Kid\".\n\nIn 1996, the five-song mini-album ''[[Tremble Under Boom Lights]]''<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=210}}</ref> was released by the Medicine label, featuring well-produced offers such as \"The Search for Cherry Red\" and \"Give Me Daughters\".
