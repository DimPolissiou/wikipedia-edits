A tendency away from the [[narrative]], which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward [[abstraction]] is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called [[contemporary art]] or [[postmodern art]].\n\nModern art begins with the heritage of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the [[Proto-Cubism|pre-cubists]] [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's two versions of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.<ref>Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.</ref> It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].\n\nInitially influenced by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Gauguin]] and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris,'' from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and several other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier coll\u00e9]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe notion of modern art is closely related to [[modernism]].<ref>\"One way of understanding the relation of the terms 'modern,' 'modernity,' and 'modernism' is that aesthetic modernism is a form of art characteristic of high or actualized late modernity, that is, of that period in which social, economic, and cultural life in the widest sense [was] revolutionized by modernity ... [this means] that modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Social modernity is the home of modernist art, even where that art rebels against it.\" Cahoone 1996, p. 13.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]]]\n\n=== Roots in the 19th century ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Van Gogh - la courtisane.jpg\n| width1    = 94\n| caption1  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Courtesan (after [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt1      = Multi-colored portrait of a far eastern cortesan with elaborate hair ornamentation, colorful robelike garment, and a border depicting marshland waters and reeds.\n| image2    = Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg\n| width2    = 133\n| caption2  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''The Blooming Plumtree (after [[Hiroshige]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt2      = Portrait of a tree with blossoms and with far eastern alphabet letters both in the portrait and along the left and right borders.\n| image3    = Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG\n| width3    = 126\n| caption3  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy]]'' (1887), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]\n| alt3      = Portrait of a man of a bearded man facing forward, holding his own hands in his lap; wearing a hat, blue coat, beige collared shirt and brown pants; sitting in front of a background with various tiles of far eastern and nature themed art.\n}}\n\nAlthough modern [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]] are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century, the beginnings of modern [[painting]] can be located earlier.<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 10.</ref> The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863,<ref name=\"Arn13\">Arnason 1998, p. 17.</ref> the year that [[\u00c9douard Manet]] showed his painting ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]'' in Paris. Earlier dates have also been proposed, among them 1855 (the year [[Gustave Courbet]] exhibited ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'') and 1784 (the year [[Jacques-Louis David]] completed his painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'').<ref name=\"Arn13\" /> In the words of art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]]: \"Each of these dates has significance for the development of modern art, but none categorically marks a completely new beginning ....  A gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years.\"<ref name=\"Arn13\" />\n\nThe strands of thought that eventually led to modern art can be traced back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>\"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries momentum began to gather behind a new ''view'' of the world, which would eventually create a new ''world'', the modern world\". Cahoone 1996, p. 27.</ref> The important modern art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, called [[Immanuel Kant]] \"the first real Modernist\" but also drew a distinction: \"The Enlightenment criticized from the outside ... .

This gave rise to what art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a \"self-consciousness that made people select the style of their building as one selects the pattern of a wallpaper.\"<ref>Gombrich 1958, pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\nThe pioneers of modern art were [[Romanticism|Romantics]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 22.</ref> By the late 19th century, additional movements which were to be influential in modern art had begun to emerge: [[post-Impressionism]] as well as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].\n\nInfluences upon these movements were varied: from exposure to Eastern decorative arts, particularly [[Japonism|Japanese printmaking]], to the coloristic innovations of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], to a search for more [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the depiction of common life, as found in the work of painters such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]]. The advocates of realism stood against the [[idealism]] of the tradition-bound [[academic art]] that enjoyed public and official favor.<ref>Corinth, Schuster, Brauner, Vitali, and Butts 1996, p.25.</ref> The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work. There were official, government-sponsored painters' unions, while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts.\n\nThe Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect, and therefore painters should paint in natural light ([[en plein air]]) rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work.<ref>Cogniat 1975, p. 61.</ref> Impressionist artists formed a group, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' (\"Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") which, despite internal tensions, mounted a series of independent exhibitions.<ref>Cogniat 1975, pp. 43\u201349.</ref> The style was adopted by artists in different nations, in preference to a \"national\" style. These factors established the view that it was a [[Art movement|\"movement\"]]. These traits\u2014establishment of a working method integral to the art, establishment of a movement or visible active core of support, and international adoption\u2014would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' 1907, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\n[[File:La danse (I) by Matisse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Dance (Matisse)|The Dance I]]'', 1909, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\nAmong the movements which flowered in the first decade of the 20th century were [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]].\n\nDuring the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]] where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and Salon d\u2019Automne, and his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was \"founded\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1924.\n\nWorld War I brought an end to this phase but indicated the beginning of a number of [[anti-art]] movements, such as [[Dada]], including the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], and of [[Surrealism]]. Artist groups like [[de Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]] developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education.\n\nModern art was introduced to the United States with the [[Armory Show]] in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nIt was only after World War II, however, that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color field painting]], [[Conceptual art]]ists of [[Art & Language]], [[Pop art]], [[Op art]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Photorealism]] and various other movements.

A tendency away from the [[narrative]], which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward [[abstraction]] is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called [[contemporary art]] or [[postmodern art]].\n\nModern art begins with the heritage of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the [[Proto-Cubism|pre-cubists]] [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's two versions of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.<ref>Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.</ref> It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].\n\nInitially influenced by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Gauguin]] and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris,'' from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and several other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier coll\u00e9]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe notion of modern art is closely related to [[modernism]].<ref>\"One way of understanding the relation of the terms 'modern,' 'modernity,' and 'modernism' is that aesthetic modernism is a form of art characteristic of high or actualized late modernity, that is, of that period in which social, economic, and cultural life in the widest sense [was] revolutionized by modernity ... [this means] that modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Social modernity is the home of modernist art, even where that art rebels against it.\" Cahoone 1996, p. 13.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]]]\n\n=== Roots in the 19th century ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Van Gogh - la courtisane.jpg\n| width1    = 94\n| caption1  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Courtesan (after [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt1      = Multi-colored portrait of a far eastern cortesan with elaborate hair ornamentation, colorful robelike garment, and a border depicting marshland waters and reeds.\n| image2    = Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg\n| width2    = 133\n| caption2  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''The Blooming Plumtree (after [[Hiroshige]])'' (1887), [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n| alt2      = Portrait of a tree with blossoms and with far eastern alphabet letters both in the portrait and along the left and right borders.\n| image3    = Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG\n| width3    = 126\n| caption3  = [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy]]'' (1887), [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]]\n| alt3      = Portrait of a man of a bearded man facing forward, holding his own hands in his lap; wearing a hat, blue coat, beige collared shirt and brown pants; sitting in front of a background with various tiles of far eastern and nature themed art.\n}}\n\nAlthough modern [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]] are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century, the beginnings of modern [[painting]] can be located earlier.<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 10.</ref> The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863,<ref name=\"Arn13\">Arnason 1998, p. 17.</ref> the year that [[\u00c9douard Manet]] showed his painting ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]]'' in Paris. Earlier dates have also been proposed, among them 1855 (the year [[Gustave Courbet]] exhibited ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'') and 1784 (the year [[Jacques-Louis David]] completed his painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'').<ref name=\"Arn13\" /> In the words of art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]]: \"Each of these dates has significance for the development of modern art, but none categorically marks a completely new beginning ....  A gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years.\"<ref name=\"Arn13\" />\n\nThe strands of thought that eventually led to modern art can be traced back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref>\"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries momentum began to gather behind a new ''view'' of the world, which would eventually create a new ''world'', the modern world\". Cahoone 1996, p. 27.</ref> The important modern art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], for instance, called [[Immanuel Kant]] \"the first real Modernist\" but also drew a distinction: \"The Enlightenment criticized from the outside ... . Modernism criticizes from the inside.\"<ref>Frascina and Harrison 1982, p. 5.</ref> The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 uprooted assumptions and institutions that had for centuries been accepted with little question and accustomed the public to vigorous political and social debate. This gave rise to what art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a \"self-consciousness that made people select the style of their building as one selects the pattern of a wallpaper.\"<ref>Gombrich 1958, pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\nThe pioneers of modern art were [[Romanticism|Romantics]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].<ref>Arnason 1998, p. 22.</ref> By the late 19th century, additional movements which were to be influential in modern art had begun to emerge: [[post-Impressionism]] as well as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].\n\nInfluences upon these movements were varied: from exposure to Eastern decorative arts, particularly [[Japonism|Japanese printmaking]], to the coloristic innovations of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], to a search for more [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the depiction of common life, as found in the work of painters such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]]. The advocates of realism stood against the [[idealism]] of the tradition-bound [[academic art]] that enjoyed public and official favor.<ref>Corinth, Schuster, Brauner, Vitali, and Butts 1996, p.25.</ref> The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work. There were official, government-sponsored painters' unions, while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts.\n\nThe Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect, and therefore painters should paint in natural light ([[en plein air]]) rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work.<ref>Cogniat 1975, p. 61.</ref> Impressionist artists formed a group, ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' (\"Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") which, despite internal tensions, mounted a series of independent exhibitions.<ref>Cogniat 1975, pp. 43\u201349.</ref> The style was adopted by artists in different nations, in preference to a \"national\" style. These factors established the view that it was a [[Art movement|\"movement\"]]. These traits\u2014establishment of a working method integral to the art, establishment of a movement or visible active core of support, and international adoption\u2014would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art.\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' 1907, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\n[[File:La danse (I) by Matisse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Dance (Matisse)|The Dance I]]'', 1909, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\nAmong the movements which flowered in the first decade of the 20th century were [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Expressionism]], and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]].\n\nDuring the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of [[cubism]], several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]] where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and Salon d\u2019Automne, and his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was \"founded\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1924.\n\nWorld War I brought an end to this phase but indicated the beginning of a number of [[anti-art]] movements, such as [[Dada]], including the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], and of [[Surrealism]]. Artist groups like [[de Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]] developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education.\n\nModern art was introduced to the United States with the [[Armory Show]] in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nIt was only after World War II, however, that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010</ref> The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Color field painting]], [[Conceptual art]]ists of [[Art & Language]], [[Pop art]], [[Op art]], [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Photorealism]] and various other movements.

All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical.<ref>Michael S.

Western painter [[Frederic Remington]] (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel ''Stover at Yale'' (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself.<ref>Robert Higgs, \"'G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung' and Palingenesis: Yale and the Heroic Ideal, 1865\u20131914,\" ''Proteus'' 1986 3(1): 18\u201324</ref>\n[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yale's four-oared [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] team, posing with 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy, won at [[Philadelphia]]]]\n\nAlong with [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Yale students rejected elite British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.<ref>Ronald A.

Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[athletic letters]] for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>Roberta J.

There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President [[Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, A. [[Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.<ref>John S., Watterson III, \"The Football Crisis of 1909\u20131910: the Response of the Eastern 'Big Three',\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 1981 8(1): 33\u201349</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:View of Connecticut Hall Old Campus Yale College New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753]]\n\nYale expanded gradually, establishing the [[Yale School of Medicine]] (1810), [[Yale Divinity School]] (1822), [[Yale Law School]] (1843), [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1847), the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (1847),<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E. Sheffield]].</ref> and the [[Yale School of Art|Yale School of Fine Arts]] (1869). In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of [[Timothy Dwight&nbsp;V]], Yale College was renamed Yale University, with the name [[Yale College]] subsequently applied to the undergraduate college. The university would later add the [[Yale School of Music]] (1894), the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900), the [[Yale School of Public Health]] (1915), the [[Yale School of Nursing]] (1923), the [[Yale School of Drama]](1955), the [[Yale Physician Associate Program]] (1973), the [[Yale School of Management]] (1976), and the [[Jackson School of Global Affairs]] which will open in 2022.<ref name=\"The Future of Jackson\">{{Cite web|url=https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|title=The Future of Jackson|website=Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821223916/https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|archive-date=August 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School.\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. [[Noah Porter]], moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>George Levesque, \"Noah Porter Revisited,\" ''Perspectives on the History of Higher Education'' 2007 26: 29\u201366,</ref> He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n[[File:Rummell, Richard Yale University cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus, facing north]]\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Behavioral sciences====\nBetween 1925 and 1940, [[Foundation (non-profit)|philanthropic foundations]], especially ones connected with the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], contributed about $7&nbsp;million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate [[Biology]]. The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to \"improve mankind\" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President [[James R. Angell]] and psychobiologist [[Robert M. Yerkes]], tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.<ref>Kersten Jacobson Biehn, \"Psychobiology, Sex Research and Chimpanzees: Philanthropic Foundation Support for the Behavioral Sciences at Yale University, 1923\u201341,\" ''History of the Human Sciences'' 2008 21(2): 21\u201343,</ref>\n\n[[File:A View of the Buildings of Yale College at New Haven 1807.jpg|thumb|Old Brick Row in 1807]]\n\n====Biology====\nSlack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were [[Ross Granville Harrison]], [[Grace E. Pickford]], and [[G.&nbsp;Evelyn Hutchinson]], and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.<ref>Nancy G. Slack, \"Are Research Schools Necessary?

Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>Howard Spiro and Priscilla Waters Norton, \"Dean Milton C.

[[Norman Holmes Pearson]], who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose.<ref>Michael Holzman, \"The Ideological Origins of American Studies at Yale,\" ''American Studies'' 40:2 (Summer 1999): 71\u201399</ref> Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire [[William Robertson Coe]] made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming.

The [[Beinecke Rare Book Library]] has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library]] includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The [[Lewis Walpole Library]] contains the largest collection of 18th\u2011century British literary works. The [[Elizabethan Club]], technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The [[Yale University Art Gallery]], the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartout and Kahn buildings. The latter, [[Louis Kahn]]'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The [[Yale Center for British Art]], the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of [[Paul Mellon]] and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\nThe [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The [[Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments]], affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from [[Peru]] by Yale history professor [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] in his Yale-financed expedition to [[Machu Picchu]] in 1912 \u2013 when the removal of such artifacts was legal.

Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]\". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.\n\nSince summer 2010, Yale has also been host to [[Yale Publishing Course]].\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].\n\n==Campus life==\nYale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic backgrounds, and personal backgrounds.

Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas,\" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.<ref>{{cite news |author1-last=Lloyd-Thomas |author1-first=Matthew |author2-last=Rodrigues |author2-first=Adrian |title=New colleges to help reduce overcrowding |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=April 15, 2014 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |accessdate=September 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907085326/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |archive-date=September 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the [[Old Campus]], the university's oldest precinct.\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] or [[Collegiate Gothic]] in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, [[Morse College|Morse]] and [[Ezra Stiles College|Ezra Stiles]] Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities.

Western painter [[Frederic Remington]] (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West.

Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[athletic letters]] for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>Roberta J.

There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President [[Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, A. [[Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.<ref>John S., Watterson III, \"The Football Crisis of 1909\u20131910: the Response of the Eastern 'Big Three',\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 1981 8(1): 33\u201349</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:View of Connecticut Hall Old Campus Yale College New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753]]\n\nYale expanded gradually, establishing the [[Yale School of Medicine]] (1810), [[Yale Divinity School]] (1822), [[Yale Law School]] (1843), [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1847), the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (1847),<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E.

[[Noah Porter]], moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>George Levesque, \"Noah Porter Revisited,\" ''Perspectives on the History of Higher Education'' 2007 26: 29\u201366,</ref> He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture.

The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to \"improve mankind\" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President [[James R. Angell]] and psychobiologist [[Robert M. Yerkes]], tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.<ref>Kersten Jacobson Biehn, \"Psychobiology, Sex Research and Chimpanzees: Philanthropic Foundation Support for the Behavioral Sciences at Yale University, 1923\u201341,\" ''History of the Human Sciences'' 2008 21(2): 21\u201343,</ref>\n\n[[File:A View of the Buildings of Yale College at New Haven 1807.jpg|thumb|Old Brick Row in 1807]]\n\n====Biology====\nSlack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were [[Ross Granville Harrison]], [[Grace E. Pickford]], and [[G.&nbsp;Evelyn Hutchinson]], and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.<ref>Nancy G. Slack, \"Are Research Schools Necessary? Contrasting Models of 20th Century Research at Yale Led by Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford and G. Evelyn Hutchinson,\" ''Journal of the History of Biology'' 2003 36(3): 501\u2013529,</ref>\n\n====Medicine====\nMilton Winternitz led the [[Yale School of Medicine]] as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>Howard Spiro and Priscilla Waters Norton, \"Dean Milton C. Winternitz at Yale,\" ''Perspectives in Biology & Medicine'' 2003 46(3): 403\u2013412,</ref>\n\n====Faculty====\nBefore [[World War&nbsp;II]], most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.<ref>William Palmer, \"On or about 1950 or 1955 History Departments Changed: A Step in the Creation of the Modern History Department,\" ''Journal of the Historical Society'' (1529921x); 2007 7(3): 385\u2013405</ref>\n\n====History and American studies====\nThe American studies program reflected the worldwide anti-Communist ideological struggle. [[Norman Holmes Pearson]], who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose.<ref>Michael Holzman, \"The Ideological Origins of American Studies at Yale,\" ''American Studies'' 40:2 (Summer 1999): 71\u201399</ref> Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire [[William Robertson Coe]] made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming.

Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]\". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.\n\nSince summer 2010, Yale has also been host to [[Yale Publishing Course]].\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].\n\n==Campus life==\nYale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic backgrounds, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010\u20132011 freshman class, 10% are non\u2011U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |title=Yale Factsheet |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080525/http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |archivedate=April 3, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n===Residential colleges===\n{{Main|Residential colleges of Yale University}}\nYale's [[residential college]] system was established in 1933 by [[Edward S. Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas,\" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.<ref>{{cite news |author1-last=Lloyd-Thomas |author1-first=Matthew |author2-last=Rodrigues |author2-first=Adrian |title=New colleges to help reduce overcrowding |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=April 15, 2014 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |accessdate=September 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907085326/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |archive-date=September 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the [[Old Campus]], the university's oldest precinct.\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] or [[Collegiate Gothic]] in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, [[Morse College|Morse]] and [[Ezra Stiles College|Ezra Stiles]] Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history.

Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it's \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nFive years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later \"re-translations\" continued to recycle its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nHowever, in 1962 Anthony Bonner published a fresh, essentially complete translation of Verne's masterwork for [[Bantam Classics]]. This edition also included a special introduction written by sci-fi author [[Ray Bradbury]] and comparing Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nA significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans). ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', [[Washington Square Press]], 1966. Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nMercier's errors were further corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources along with a new translation, again by Walter James Miller but in collaboration with fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter. The volume was published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] and subtitled \"The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3238-0}}.\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. Disney's filmscript elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to acquire Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film.

Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it's \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nFive years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later \"re-translations\" continued to recycle its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nHowever, in 1962 Anthony Bonner published a fresh, essentially complete translation of Verne's masterwork for [[Bantam Classics]]. This edition also included a special introduction written by sci-fi author [[Ray Bradbury]] and comparing Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nA significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans). ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', [[Washington Square Press]], 1966. Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nMercier's errors were further corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources along with a new translation, again by Walter James Miller but in collaboration with fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter. The volume was published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] and subtitled \"The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3238-0}}.\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La Isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. Disney's filmscript elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to acquire Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film.
