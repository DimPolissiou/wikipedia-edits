They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.

They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.\n\nRutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs, owning a 6-4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record and appearing in a [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Final]] in 2007, respectively. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home [[HighPoint.com Stadium]] on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]], and the basketball teams play at [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are located in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], immediately across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields rising men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.\n\nRutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs. The [[Rutgers\u2013Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Camden Scarlet Raptors|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers\u2013Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers\u2013Newark Scarlet Raiders|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].\n\nSeton Hall, unlike Rutgers and Princeton, does not field a football team. Its men's basketball team, however, is one of the Big East's storied programs, New Jersey's most successful representative in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] by number of wins, the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|National Final]], and plays its home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] approximately four miles from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers which alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, has been renewed through 2026.<ref>https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/</ref>\n\n===Other schools===\nThe state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).\n\n[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.\n\nAmong the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.\n\n==High school sports==\nNew Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]].(NJSIAA) <ref>[http://www.njsiaa.org/ NJSIAA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=2009-04-18 }}. iHigh.com, Inc \u2013 The High School Internet Network.
