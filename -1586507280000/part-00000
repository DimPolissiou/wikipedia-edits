Madhur and Sanford Allen met again and decided to pursue a relationship seriously.\n\nIn 1966 Ismail Merchant, in search of further publicity for the film, decided to cultivate  ''[[The New York Times]]'' food critic [[Craig Claiborne]].

As a result of the success of her cookbooks and TV, Jaffrey developed a line of mass-marketed cooking sauces.\n\nIronically, she did not cook at all as a child growing up in Delhi. She had almost never been in the kitchen and almost failed cooking at school.<ref name=\"madhur_nyt_1966-07-07\"/> It was only after she went to London at the age of 19 to study at RADA that she learned how to cook, using recipes of familiar dishes that were provided in correspondence from her mother.<ref>Jaffrey, Madhur, ''Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cooking'', Barron's Educational Series, 1983. {{ISBN|978-0-8120-6548-0}}.</ref> Her editor [[Judith Jones]] claimed in her memoirs that Jaffrey was an ideal cookbook writer precisely because she had learned to cook childhood comfort food as an adult, and primarily from written instructions. In the 1960s, after her award-winning performance in ''Shakespeare Wallah'', she became known as the \"actress who could cook\".\n\nAfter an article about her and her cooking appeared in the ''New York Times'' in 1966, she received a book contract from an independent editor to write a book on Indian cooking. Madhur started compiling all the recipes learnt by her through correspondence with her mother and adapted for the American kitchen.<ref>Sokolov, Raymond: \"Current Stars: Books on Indian, Italian and Inexpensive Food\", ''The New York Times'', 19 April 1973.</ref> Due to a period of rapid consolidation in the American publishing industry, the book went to [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] but got no attention there either.
