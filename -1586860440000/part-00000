The municipality covers an area of {{convert|{{Dutch municipality total area|Hellevoetsluis}}|km2|abbr=on}} of which {{convert|{{Dutch municipality water area|Hellevoetsluis}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water and it includes the population centres [[Nieuw-Helvoet]], [[Nieuwenhoorn]] and [[Oude en Nieuwe Struiten]], all former municipalities.\n\nHellevoetsluis is located on the [[Haringvliet]] with the sea, beach and dunes close by, on the extreme southern edge of the [[South Holland#Subdivisions|Rijnmond]] and [[Europoort]] areas, close to the broad [[Zeeland]] landscape. The name translates as \"[[lock (water transport)|lock]] at the foot of the Helle\". The Helle was a small local river which disappeared over time.\n\n==History==\nThe area has been settled since before roman times and was concentrated around a body of water called the \"Helle\", which was later Latinized by the Romans to \"Helinium\" and \"Helius\". The name Hel(le) Voet, ''Helius' foot'' or \"(land at) the lowest point of Helius\", appears in documents from the 13th century and later, such as in 1395, when the Nieuw-Helvoet Polder is issued for inspection. This polder had a drainage sluice (Dutch: \"sluis\") in the southern dike: the Hellevoetse sluis.\n\nThe history of Hellevoetsluis has always been connected with water. During the time of the [[Eighty Year's War]] and the forming of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] Hellevoetsluis was the naval port of the [[Admiralty of Rotterdam|Admiralty of de Maze]] ([[Rotterdam]]) and could accommodate an entire fleet within a special land-enclosed [[fortification|fortress]] with [[harbour]] and [[dockyard]] facilities, accessible through a [[canal]]. Thanks to its strategic situation the town grew from the beginning of the 17th century to be the homeport for the Dutch war fleet. In later years the port was fortified more and more and Hellevoetsluis therefore became a unique combination of fortified town and naval port. The [[Admiral]]s [[Maarten Tromp]], [[Michiel de Ruyter]] and [[Piet Heyn]] had their home base here and in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]] [[William III of England|William III of Orange]]'s invasion fleet departed from the port.\n\n[[File:Hellevoetsluis 1866.png|thumb|260px|left|Hellevoetsluis in 1866.]]\nThe ''Kanaal door Voorne'' (Canal through Voorne) was built in 1830 from Hellevoetsluis to Nieuwesluis (near [[Heenvliet]]) and made Hellevoetsluis an outport of Rotterdam. It was a period when the town grew and flourished; the shipping industry provided prosperity. Its neighbourhood {{ill|Vlotbrug, Hellevoetsluis|lt=Vlotbrug|nl|Vlotbrug (Hellevoetsluis)}} may have been named after a [[vlotbrug]] constructed over the canal.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, however, Hellevoetsluis went into decline. Ocean-going ships became too large to use the canal and the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]] was dug, making the Canal through Voorne redundant. The naval base was relocated to [[Den Helder]] in the 1930s, the Government [[shipyard]] was closed, and during World War II the Germans destroyed three quarters of all buildings in 1944. They also used the canal as a base for [[Biber (submarine)|Biber submarines]].<ref name=lp146>{{cite book |title=Weapons of Desperation German Frogmen and Midget Submarines of World war II |last=Paterson |first=Lawrence |year=2006 |publisher=Chatham Publishing |isbn=978-1-86176-279-5 |page=146}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II Hellevoetsluis grew considerably. As a [[New town#Netherlands|New Town]] the population doubled in the 1970s. Today 43,000 inhabitants live in modern houses with abundant green areas nearby. It is home to many commuters working in [[Europoort]] or [[Rotterdam]].\n\nDuring the flood of 1953 Hellevoetsluis was inundated and after this flood the Netherlands implemented the \"Deltawerken\", a vast plan that put in place sea-defenses such as dams to protect vulnerable Islands in the Meuse-Rhine river delta. \n\nThe city is home to several buildings from the 16th-19th Centuries, that are listed monuments. Among these are the \"Admiraliteitsgebouw\" (currently used as city hall), the \"de Hoop\" windmill, Fort/Bastion Haerlem, \"Droogdok Jan Blanken\": a historic shipbuilding site and,  the [[Water Tower Hellevoetsluis]], designed by architect N. Biezeveld and built in 1896.\n\n==Facilities==\nHellevoetsluis has many shops: in addition to the various small (community) shopping centres, there is the covered [[shopping centre]] ''De Struytse Hoeck'', which has over 120 shops and is partly built over the Canal through Voorne. Education up to secondary school level, a library, community centres, health care, modern facilities for water sport are all available. Following the construction of the Haringvliet locks, the [[Haringvliet]] is ideal water for surfing and sailing. There are also extensive mooring facilities. Close by are the beach and the dunes at Voorne, a nature reserve.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Uitzicht vanaf brug op haven.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n[[File:Uitzicht vanaf brug op haven2.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n===Water sports===\nHellevoetsluis is one of the largest water sports centres in the country. There are 2,000 mooring places, spread over five harbours. With such a broad expanse of water as the Haringvliet and the [[North Sea]] close by, it is popular with water sports lovers and the Haringvliet is being used increasingly for national and international water sports events.\n\n[[File:Bunkers vesting Hellevoetsluis.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n[[File:Hellevoetsluis 006.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n===Entertainment===\nThe old town centre, the fortress, has many terraces that look out upon the busy harbour and plenty of bars and restaurants serving 'international' food. There are also restaurants and bars outside the fortress. A petting zoo, a sailing school, a fitness centre, tennis courts, a sauna, etc., are nearby.\n\n===Events===\nIn August the \"Fortress Days\" are held. A fleet of ships can also be seen and there is a large, varied fair, aeroplane demonstrations and a big firework display.\n\nEvery two years, the Dutch Classic Yacht Regatta is held in the harbour. A large number of classic, sharp [[yacht]]s can be seen.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are excellently preserved fortifications in the fortress. A walking tour leads to historical buildings such as the lighthouse, the Prinsehuis, Corn Mill ''De Hoop'' and a number of museums. The museum ''Gesigt van 't Dok'' situated at Oostzanddijk contains a replica of 1834 of town, fortress and naval shipyard. This replica forms the heart of an exhibition on the development of Hellevoetsluis into a modern naval port at the beginning of the previous century.\n\nThe National Firefighting Museum, located in what used to be the Kuiperij and Grootmagazijn on Industriehaven, contains a rich collection ranging from the most primitive fire fighting equipment from centuries ago to the highly sophisticated equipment of today. Water buckets, fire hoses, water barrels, uniforms hand and [[steam engines]], every device that marks a point in the history of fire fighting is represented.\n\nIn the ''Oudheidskamer'', also situated on the Industriehaven, there is a collection of items from daily life of the past two centuries. It includes items that relate to the past of Hellevoetsluis as naval port as well as agriculture-related articles.\n\nThe first [[dry dock]] in the Netherlands dates from 1806, and it marked a revolutionary development in the history of shipbuilding and ship repair. The dry dock is still there and has become a major historical and industrial/archaeological monument.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in The Netherlands}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities===\nHellevoetsluis is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Torbay]], England \n|}\n\nbecause on 5 November 1678 a fleet of 463 ships with 14,000 men landed [[William III of Orange]] in [[Torbay]] having sailed from Hellevoetsluis to claim thrones of Great Britain, as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] \n\n<br />\n\n== Born in Hellevoetsluis ==\n[[File:Luitenant Dirk Klop (Venlo-incident 1939) (cropped).jpg|155px|thumb|Dirk Klop, 1939]]\n* [[Jan Pieter Theodoor Huydecoper]] (1728 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1767) an administrator of the [[Dutch West India Company]] and [[List of colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast|Director-General of the Dutch Gold Coast]] 1764 to 1767 \n* [[Theodoor de Booy]] (1882 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1919) a Dutch-born American archaeologist\n* [[Jan Greshoff]] (1888 in Nieuw-Helvoet \u2013 1971) a Dutch journalist, poet, and literary critic\n* [[Dirk Klop]] (1906 in Nieuw-Helvoet \u2013 1939) a Dutch Army intelligence officer, killed in the [[Venlo incident]]\n* [[Adriaan Wesselink]] (1909 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1995) a Dutch astronomer, specialising in [[variable stars]] \n* Anthony van Kampen (1911 in Hellevoetsluis -

There are 2,000 mooring places, spread over five harbours. With such a broad expanse of water as the Haringvliet and the [[North Sea]] close by, it is popular with water sports lovers and the Haringvliet is being used increasingly for national and international water sports events.\n\n[[File:Bunkers vesting Hellevoetsluis.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n[[File:Hellevoetsluis 006.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n===Entertainment===\nThe old town centre, the fortress, has many terraces that look out upon the busy harbour and plenty of bars and restaurants serving 'international' food. There are also restaurants and bars outside the fortress. A petting zoo, a sailing school, a fitness centre, tennis courts, a sauna, etc., are nearby.\n\n===Events===\nIn August the \"Fortress Days\" are held. A fleet of ships can also be seen and there is a large, varied fair, aeroplane demonstrations and a big firework display.\n\nEvery two years, the Dutch Classic Yacht Regatta is held in the harbour. A large number of classic, sharp [[yacht]]s can be seen.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are excellently preserved fortifications in the fortress. A walking tour leads to historical buildings such as the lighthouse, the Prinsehuis, Corn Mill ''De Hoop'' and a number of museums. The museum ''Gesigt van 't Dok'' situated at Oostzanddijk contains a replica of 1834 of town, fortress and naval shipyard. This replica forms the heart of an exhibition on the development of Hellevoetsluis into a modern naval port at the beginning of the previous century.\n\nThe National Firefighting Museum, located in what used to be the Kuiperij and Grootmagazijn on Industriehaven, contains a rich collection ranging from the most primitive fire fighting equipment from centuries ago to the highly sophisticated equipment of today. Water buckets, fire hoses, water barrels, uniforms hand and [[steam engines]], every device that marks a point in the history of fire fighting is represented.\n\nIn the ''Oudheidskamer'', also situated on the Industriehaven, there is a collection of items from daily life of the past two centuries. It includes items that relate to the past of Hellevoetsluis as naval port as well as agriculture-related articles.\n\nThe first [[dry dock]] in the Netherlands dates from 1806, and it marked a revolutionary development in the history of shipbuilding and ship repair. The dry dock is still there and has become a major historical and industrial/archaeological monument.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in The Netherlands}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities===\nHellevoetsluis is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Torbay]], England \n|}\n\nbecause on 5 November 1678 a fleet of 463 ships with 14,000 men landed [[William III of Orange]] in [[Torbay]] having sailed from Hellevoetsluis to claim thrones of Great Britain, as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] \n\n<br />\n\n== Born in Hellevoetsluis ==\n[[File:Luitenant Dirk Klop (Venlo-incident 1939) (cropped).jpg|155px|thumb|Dirk Klop, 1939]]\n* [[Jan Pieter Theodoor Huydecoper]] (1728 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1767) an administrator of the [[Dutch West India Company]] and [[List of colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast|Director-General of the Dutch Gold Coast]] 1764 to 1767 \n* [[Theodoor de Booy]] (1882 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1919) a Dutch-born American archaeologist\n* [[Jan Greshoff]] (1888 in Nieuw-Helvoet \u2013 1971) a Dutch journalist, poet, and literary critic\n* [[Dirk Klop]] (1906 in Nieuw-Helvoet \u2013 1939) a Dutch Army intelligence officer, killed in the [[Venlo incident]]\n* [[Adriaan Wesselink]] (1909 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1995) a Dutch astronomer, specialising in [[variable stars]] \n* Anthony van Kampen (1911 in Hellevoetsluis - 1991) a Dutch writer <ref>[[:nl:Anthony van Kampen|Dutch Wiki, Anthony van Kampen]]</ref>\n* Ellemieke Vermolen (born 1976 in Hellevoetsluis) a Dutch actress, model and presenter <ref> [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894452/   IMDb Database] retrieved 16 December 2019 </ref> <ref>[[:nl:Ellemieke Vermolen|Dutch Wiki, Ellemieke Vermolen]]</ref>\n* [[Duncan Laurence]] (born 1994) a Dutch singer-songwriter, grew up in Hellevoetsluis\n* Lucas van Hal (Born 2006) He is an upcoming drummer with great drum skills.\n=== Sport ===\n* [[Ronald Brouwer]] (born 1979 in Hellevoetsluis) a field hockey striker, team silver medallist at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]\n* Maarten Ketting (born 1983 in Hellevoetsluis) a soccer referee <ref>[[:nl:Maarten Ketting|Dutch Wiki, Maarten Ketting]]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.hellevoetsluis.nl Official website]\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Hellevoetsluis|short=x}}\n\n<!--Please note that not all directions need to be filled-->\n<!--Please note that preferably only neighboring municipalities or bodies of water should be used-->\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Hellevoetsluis\n|North     = [[Brielle]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Nissewaard]]\n|Southeast = \n|South     = ''[[Haringvliet]]''<br>[[Goeree-Overflakkee]]\n|Southwest = \n|West      = [[Westvoorne]]\n}}\n\n{{South Holland Province}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hellevoetsluis| ]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of South Holland]]\n[[Category:Populated places in South Holland]]\n", "name_user": "Kleinelisklein", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made some changes to the born in hellevoetsluis page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellevoetsluis"}

On the Friday before, January 27, immigration authorities reportedly received information that the Mexican [[cartel]] behind the operation was threatening the lives of any agents involved with the construction or occupation of the tunnel. US Customs and Immigration, however, pledged to protect them as best they could. Authorities believe Tijuana's Arellano-Felix drug syndicate, or some other well-known drug cartel, was behind the building and operation of the tunnel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4653536.stm |title=Drug haul in secret border tunnel |work= BBC News |date=27 January 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2010, a {{convert|2600|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel was discovered linking Tijuana to [[Otay Mesa, San Diego]], California.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11850668 |title=Second Mexico-US drug tunnel found in Tijuana |work=BBC News |date=26 November 2010}}</ref> In the same month another tunnel was discovered between these two cities.

His [[discography]] comprises 12 [[studio album]]s (counting a Christmas album), six [[compilation album]]s, and 43 [[single (music)|singles]].

His first, third, and fourth albums\u2014''Country Club'', ''T-R-O-U-B-L-E'' and ''Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof'', respectively\u2014are all certified double platinum in the US, while 1996's ''The Restless Kind'', 2000's ''Down the Road I Go'' and his 1995 ''Greatest Hits: From the Beginning'' album are all certified platinum. ''It's All About to Change'' is also his highest-peaking album on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]], at #2.\n\nOf Tritt's fifty-two singles, all but two charted on ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]]. This total includes five Number Ones on that chart: \"Help Me Hold On\" (1990), \"Anymore\" (1991), \"Can I Trust You with My Heart\" (1993), \"Foolish Pride\" (1994), and \"Best of Intentions\" (2000). \"Best of Intentions\" is also his highest peak on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at #27, while its follow-ups (\"It's a Great Day to Be Alive\" and \"Love of a Woman\", both of which went to #2 on the country chart) reached #33 and #39 on the Hot 100. He has also charted three album cuts that entered the lower regions of the country chart based on unsolicited airplay.\n\nTritt has also been featured as a guest on eight singles, including two releases by his friend [[Marty Stuart]]: \"This One's Gonna Hurt You (For a Long, Long Time)\" and \"Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best\", from 1992 and 1996.
