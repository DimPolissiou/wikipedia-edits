Historians debate the causes of the purge, such as Stalin's paranoia, or his desire to remove dissenters from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] or to consolidate his authority.  The purges began in the Red Army, and the techniques developed there were quickly adapted to purges in other sectors.<ref>Peter Whitewood,  \"The Purge of the Red Army and the Soviet Mass Operations, 1937\u201338.\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' 93.2 (2015): 286-314.

The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" ([[kulak]]s), and professionals.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=250,&nbsp;257\u20138}} A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"[[fifth column]]\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the [[Polish Military Organisation]] and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Soviet citizens of Polish origin]].\n\nAccording to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\", and historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trial]]s, were based on [[forced confession]]s, often obtained through [[torture]],{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=121 which cites his secret speech}} and on loose interpretations of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by [[NKVD troika]]s.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=286}}\n\nHundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, [[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], [[sabotage]], [[anti-Soviet agitation]], conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. In Moscow, the use of [[Soviet gas van|gas van]]s used to kill the victims during their transportation to the [[Butovo firing range|Butovo firing range was documented]].<ref group=note>This information was published first in 1990 in a [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] article (October 28, 1990, p. 2).

The campaigns were carried out according to the [[general line (party)|general line]], often by direct orders of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Politburo]] headed by Stalin.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of peasants]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933|famine of 1932\u20131933]], as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\" (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).<ref name=werth/>\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Trotsky]], in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]\nThe term \"[[purge]]\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression ''purge of the Party ranks''. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\n\nThe political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], respectively. Following the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [[Ryutin Affair]] seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [[democratic centralism]].\n\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Kun]], as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|killing]] him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [[Ram\u00f3n Mercader]] was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], under the personal orders of Stalin.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|pp=86\u20137}}\n\n[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] party leader [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (and his daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]) in 1934.]]\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]] as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see {{section link||Number of people executed}}). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}} Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\n\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]], participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=239}} Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}}\n\nFrom the [[October Revolution]]{{sfn|Gellately|2007}} onward,<ref>Robert Gellately, ''Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'', 2007, Knopf, 720 pages. {{ISBN|1-4000-4005-1}}</ref> Lenin had used repression against perceived enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating social control, especially during the campaign commonly referred to as the [[Red Terror]]. This policy continued and intensified under Stalin, periods of heightened repression including the [[Dekulakization|deportation of kulaks]] who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine in Ukraine.

These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.\n\n*The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called \"Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc\",{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} held in August 1936,<ref>Rogovin (1998), pp. 17\u201318</ref> at which the chief defendants were [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], two of the most prominent former party leaders. Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.<ref name=\":0\">Rogovin (1998), pp. 36\u201338</ref>\n*The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the \"anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre\" which included [[Karl Radek]], [[Yuri Piatakov]] and [[Grigory Sokolnikov]], and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.\n*There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]]]]\nSome Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament [[D.N. Pritt]], for example, wrote: \"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties\", but \"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted\".\n\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[OGPU]] officer [[Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=87}}\n\n====Dewey Commission====\n[[File:Vassily Blokhin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The chief executioner of the NKVD, [[Vasili Blokhin]], carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]]. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=137}}\n\nFor example, [[Georgy Pyatakov]] testified that he had flown to [[Oslo]] in December 1935 to \"receive terrorist instructions\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Not guilty : report of the Commission of Inquiry Into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials|last=Dewey|first=John|publisher=Sam Sloan and Ishi Press International|others=1859-1952|year=2008|isbn=978-0923891312|location=New York|pages=154\u2013155|oclc=843206645}}</ref> Another defendant, [[Ivan N. Smirnov|Ivan Smirnov]], confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.\n\nThe Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled ''Not Guilty''. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote:\n{{quote|Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:\n*That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.\n*That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them.\n*That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.}}\n\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\n\n====Implication of the Rightists====\nIn the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937</ref> as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=164}}\n\nBy the \"third organization\", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [[Right Opposition|Rightists]], led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\n\n{{quote|I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\n===Third Moscow Trial===\n[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions:  From l. to r.: [[Yakov Agranov]]; [[Genrikh Yagoda]]; unknown; [[Stanislav Redens]]. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed.]]\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [[Communist International]], former premier [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and [[Genrikh Yagoda]], recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\n\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.\n\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\">Corey Robin, \"Fear\", Page 96</ref> For some prominent communists such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.<ref>Bertram David Wolfe, \"Breaking with communism\", p. 10</ref>{{sfn|Koestler|1940|p=258}} To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the\ndepredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\"/>\n\nThe preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.\n\n====Bukharin's confession====\n[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nikolai Bukharin]], Russian [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] executed in 1938]]\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=352}}\n\n[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \"beating permitted\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=364\u20135}}\n\nBukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror''. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\n\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case\".<ref>Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938</ref> He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words: \"the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.\"<ref>Robert Tucker, \"Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Block of Rights and Trotskyites\", pp. 667\u201368</ref>\n\n[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [[Medvedev Forest massacre|NKVD prisoner massacres]] in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.\n\n==\"De-kulakization\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\"==\nOn 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \"criminals\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \"suspect\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \"kulak and criminal elements\" among the two categories are not clear.\n\nOn 30 July 1937 the [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist regime]], former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\n\nThe following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" in inhospitable parts of the country ([[Siberia]], [[Urals]], Kazakhstan, [[Extreme North (Russia)|Far North]]), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [[White Army]], participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, [[kolkhoz]] peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the \"Kulak Operation\" just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937\u20131938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking\" (Werth, 2009).\n\n[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|170px|thumb|[[Yevgeny Miller|Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller]], one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox clergy]], including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (''spetzpereselentsy'') who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nCommon criminals such as thieves, \"violators of the passport regime\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the [[Butovo firing range]] were charged with a non-political criminal offence.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nAs soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \"to be repressed\" by 120,000 (63,000 \"in the first category\" and 57,000 \"in the second category\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.\n\nThe police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD \u2013 approximately 25,000 officers \u2013 were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or [[Komsomol]] ([[Young Communist League]]) members.\n\nEvery NKVD local unit had a \"casework minimum\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \"unmask conspiracies\". The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \"counter-revolutionary\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.\n\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in secluded areas run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.<ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=2-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref><ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=3-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref>\n\nThe \"Kulak Operation\" was largest single campaign of repression in 1937\u201338, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sge44FaZDREC&pg=PA240 240]}}\n\n==Campaigns targeting nationalities==\n{{Main|Mass operations of the NKVD}}\n[[File:Izrail Pliner NKVD.jpg|alt=|thumb|186x186px|[[Israel Pliner|Israil Pliner]]; (1896-1939)  chief of [[Gulag]] [[NKVD]] (1937-1938), later arrested and executed]]\nA series of [[mass operations of the NKVD]] was carried out from 1937 through 1938 until the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, based on NKVD directives against the so-called diversionist element, according to the notion of the \"hostile capitalist surrounding\" as defined by Nikolai Yezhov. \n\nThe [[Polish operation of the NKVD]] was the largest of this kind.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=103\u2013104}} The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records.

On 17 November 1938 a joint decree of [[Sovnarkom]] USSR and [[Central Committee]] of VKP(b) ([[Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation]]) and the subsequent order of NKVD undersigned by Beria, cancelled most of the [[Mass operations of the NKVD|NKVD orders of systematic repression]] and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges.{{Sfn|Hedeler, Wladislaw|Rosenblum, Nadja 2001|p=23}}\n\nNevertheless, the practice of mass arrest and exile continued until Stalin's death in 1953. Political executions also continued, but, with the exception of [[Katyn Massacre|Katyn]] and other [[NKVD prisoner massacres|NKVD massacres]] during [[World War II]], on a vastly smaller scale. One notorious example is the \"[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]\", in which at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on 12 August 1952. Historians such as [[Michael Parrish]] have argued that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=32}} [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' the most holistic view of the timeline of ''all'' the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918\u20131956), in which the 1936\u20131938 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity\u2014the intelligentsia\u2014by directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the [[first five-year plan|1928\u20131933 collectivization and dekulakization]], were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public.{{sfn|Solzhenitsyn|1973}} For example, in one such passage Solzhenitsyn mentions 1938 and says that 1948 was in some ways hardly better.\n\nIn some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria.

This revealed the full enormity of the Purges.

In his secret speech to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]\") in 1957. The former Politburo members [[Yan Rudzutak]] and [[Stanislav Kosior]] and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to [[Marxist theory]], was never rehabilitated by the USSR.

He elaborates:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|1996|p=1348}}</blockquote>\n\n==Soviet investigation commissions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 749019 Opening of monument to victims of political repressions.jpg|thumb|upright|Opening of monument to victims of political repressions, Moscow, 1990]]\n\nAt least two Soviet commissions investigated the show-trials after Stalin's death.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The first was headed by Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, [[Mikhail Suslov|Suslov]], [[Furtseva]], [[Nikolay Shvernik|Shvernik]], [[Averky Aristov|Aristov]], [[Pospelov]], and [[Roman Rudenko|Rudenko]]. They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956\u20131957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky ''et al.'' should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\n\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"[[Shvernik Commission]]\"). It included [[Alexander Shelepin|Shelepin]], Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}</blockquote>\n\nMolotov stated \"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value.

In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former [[Solovki prison camp]] in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all \"the victims of political repression\" since 1917.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/17/russia.gulag.grave/index.html \"Pictorial essay: Death trenches bear witness to Stalin's purges\"] [[CNN]], 17 July 1997</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2131954.stm \"Mass grave found at Ukrainian monastery\"], [[BBC]], 12 July 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1010/p01s02-woeu.html \"Wary of its past, Russia ignores mass grave site\"], by [[Fred Weir]], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 October 2002</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6584HJ20100609 Stalin-era mass grave yields tons of bones] [[Reuters]]. 9 June 2010</ref> Some, such as the killing fields [[Bykivnia]] near [[Kiev]], are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/battles.htm#Bykivnia|title=WAR STATS REDIRECT|publisher=erols.com}}</ref>{{Better source|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism.

According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).<ref name=werth>{{cite web|first=Nicolas|last=Werth |authorlink=Nicolas Werth|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937-november-1938|title=Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance \u2013 Research Network|date=15 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others.{{sfn|Harris|2017|pp=2\u20134}} His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=16}}\n\n<blockquote>So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we've misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that,  Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army.<ref>James Harris, \"Encircled by Enemies: Stalin\u2019s Perceptions of the Capitalist World, 1918\u20131941,\u201d ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 30#3 [2007]: 513\u2013545.</ref> It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.<ref>Peter Whitewood, ''The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the Soviet Military'' (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276.</ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, review, ''Historian'' (2018) 80#1:177-79.</ref><ref>For a critique of Whitewood see Alexander Hill, review, ''American Historical Review'' (2017) 122#5 pp 1713-1714.</ref> Historians often cite the disruption as factors in the Red Army's disastrous military performance during the German invasion.<ref>Roger R.

Together these two actions accounted for nine tenths of the death sentences and three fourths of Gulag sentences. Out of the operations against national minorities, the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD]] was the largest one, second only to the \"Kulak Operation\" in terms of number of victims. According to historian [[Timothy Snyder]], ethnic Poles constituted the largest group of victims in the Great Terror, comprising less than 0.5% of the country's population but comprising 12.5% of those executed.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

Historians debate the causes of the purge, such as Stalin's paranoia, or his desire to remove dissenters from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] or to consolidate his authority.  The purges began in the Red Army, and the techniques developed there were quickly adapted to purges in other sectors.<ref>Peter Whitewood,  \"The Purge of the Red Army and the Soviet Mass Operations, 1937\u201338.\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' 93.2 (2015): 286-314. [http://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/958/1/slaveasteurorev2.93.2.0286.pdf online]</ref>  Most public attention was focused on the [[purge (communist)|purge]] of certain parts of the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the armed forces, most of whom were Party members. The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" ([[kulak]]s), and professionals.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|pp=250,&nbsp;257\u20138}} A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"[[fifth column]]\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the [[Polish Military Organisation]] and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Soviet citizens of Polish origin]].\n\nAccording to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]\", and historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow show trial]]s, were based on [[forced confession]]s, often obtained through [[torture]],{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=121 which cites his secret speech}} and on loose interpretations of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by [[NKVD troika]]s.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=286}}\n\nHundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, [[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], [[sabotage]], [[anti-Soviet agitation]], conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. In Moscow, the use of [[Soviet gas van|gas van]]s used to kill the victims during their transportation to the [[Butovo firing range|Butovo firing range was documented]].<ref group=note>This information was published first in 1990 in a [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] article (October 28, 1990, p. 2).

The campaigns were carried out according to the [[general line (party)|general line]], often by direct orders of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Politburo]] headed by Stalin.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization of peasants]] and the resulting [[Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933|famine of 1932\u20131933]], as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\" (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).<ref name=werth/>\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Trotsky]], in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union.]]\nThe term \"[[purge]]\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression ''purge of the Party ranks''. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\n\nThe political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], respectively. Following the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The [[Ryutin Affair]] seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending [[democratic centralism]].\n\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Kun]], as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before [[Leon Trotsky#Assassination|killing]] him in Mexico; the NKVD agent [[Ram\u00f3n Mercader]] was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], under the personal orders of Stalin.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|2000|pp=86\u20137}}\n\n[[Image:Sergei Kirov and Joseph Stalin, 1934.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] party leader [[Sergey Kirov|Sergei Kirov]] with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] (and his daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]) in 1934.]]\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of [[Sergey Kirov]] as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see {{section link||Number of people executed}}). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}} Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|1934 Party Congress]] elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\n\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]], participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=239}} Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies.{{sfn|Conquest|1987|pp=122\u201338}}\n\nFrom the [[October Revolution]]{{sfn|Gellately|2007}} onward,<ref>Robert Gellately, ''Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'', 2007, Knopf, 720 pages. {{ISBN|1-4000-4005-1}}</ref> Lenin had used repression against perceived enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating social control, especially during the campaign commonly referred to as the [[Red Terror]]. This policy continued and intensified under Stalin, periods of heightened repression including the [[Dekulakization|deportation of kulaks]] who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine in Ukraine. [[Lev Kopelev]] wrote, \"In Ukraine 1937 began in 1933,\" referring to the comparatively early beginning of the Soviet crackdown in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite book |last= Subtelny |first= Orest |authorlink= Orest Subtelny |year= 2009 |origyear= 1988 |title= Ukraine: A History |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l5uiWHgRphQC |edition= 4th revised |location= Toronto |publisher= University of Toronto Press |isbn= 978-1-4426-0991-4 |ref= harv }}</ref>{{rp|418}} A distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first time, members of the ruling party were included on a massive scale as victims of the repression.

These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.\n\n*The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called \"Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc\",{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} held in August 1936,<ref>Rogovin (1998), pp. 17\u201318</ref> at which the chief defendants were [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], two of the most prominent former party leaders. Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.<ref name=\":0\">Rogovin (1998), pp. 36\u201338</ref>\n*The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the \"anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre\" which included [[Karl Radek]], [[Yuri Piatakov]] and [[Grigory Sokolnikov]], and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.\n*There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]]]]\nSome Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament [[D.N. Pritt]], for example, wrote: \"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties\", but \"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted\".\n\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former [[OGPU]] officer [[Alexander Mikhailovich Orlov|Alexander Orlov]] and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=87}}\n\n====Dewey Commission====\n[[File:Vassily Blokhin.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The chief executioner of the NKVD, [[Vasili Blokhin]], carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.<ref>[[Timothy Snyder|Snyder, Timothy]].

Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote:\n{{quote|Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:\n*That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain the truth.\n*That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to obtain them.\n*That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.}}\n\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\n\n====Implication of the Rightists====\nIn the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937</ref> as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=164}}\n\nBy the \"third organization\", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the [[Right Opposition|Rightists]], led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\n\n{{quote|I feel guilty of one thing more: even after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}\n\n===Third Moscow Trial===\n[[File:1934 agranov yagoda unknown redens.jpg|thumb|NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions:  From l. to r.: [[Yakov Agranov]]; [[Genrikh Yagoda]]; unknown; [[Stanislav Redens]]. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed.]]\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as [[The Trial of the Twenty-One]], is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the [[Communist International]], former premier [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and [[Genrikh Yagoda]], recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\n\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder [[Maxim Gorky]] by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.\n\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\">Corey Robin, \"Fear\", Page 96</ref> For some prominent communists such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.<ref>Bertram David Wolfe, \"Breaking with communism\", p. 10</ref>{{sfn|Koestler|1940|p=258}} To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the\ndepredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.<ref name=\"Corey Robin, Fear, Page 96\"/>\n\nThe preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.\n\n====Bukharin's confession====\n[[File:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Nikolai Bukharin]], Russian [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] executed in 1938]]\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=352}}\n\n[[Anastas Mikoyan]] and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \"beating permitted\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.{{sfn|Conquest|2008|p=364\u20135}}\n\nBukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror''. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\n\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case\".<ref>Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938</ref> He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words: \"the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.\"<ref>Robert Tucker, \"Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet \"Block of Rights and Trotskyites\", pp. 667\u201368</ref>\n\n[[Romain Rolland]] and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in [[Medvedev Forest massacre|NKVD prisoner massacres]] in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, [[Anna Larina]], was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.\n\n==\"De-kulakization\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\"==\nOn 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \"criminals\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \"suspect\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \"kulak and criminal elements\" among the two categories are not clear.\n\nOn 30 July 1937 the [[NKVD Order no. 00447]] was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist regime]], former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\n\nThe following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlements]]\" in inhospitable parts of the country ([[Siberia]], [[Urals]], Kazakhstan, [[Extreme North (Russia)|Far North]]), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the [[White Army]], participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, [[kolkhoz]] peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the \"Kulak Operation\" just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937\u20131938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking\" (Werth, 2009).\n\n[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|170px|thumb|[[Yevgeny Miller|Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller]], one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later.]]\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox clergy]], including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (''spetzpereselentsy'') who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nCommon criminals such as thieves, \"violators of the passport regime\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the [[Butovo firing range]] were charged with a non-political criminal offence.<ref name=\"sciencespo.fr\"/>\n\nAs soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \"to be repressed\" by 120,000 (63,000 \"in the first category\" and 57,000 \"in the second category\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.\n\nThe police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD \u2013 approximately 25,000 officers \u2013 were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or [[Komsomol]] ([[Young Communist League]]) members.\n\nEvery NKVD local unit had a \"casework minimum\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \"unmask conspiracies\". The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \"counter-revolutionary\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.\n\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in secluded areas run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.<ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=2-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref><ref>[[Nicolas Werth]][http://www.massviolence.org/The-NKVD-Mass-Secret-Operation-no-00447-August-1937?artpage=3-6 Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)]</ref>\n\nThe \"Kulak Operation\" was largest single campaign of repression in 1937\u201338, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.{{sfn|Figes|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sge44FaZDREC&pg=PA240 240]}}\n\n==Campaigns targeting nationalities==\n{{Main|Mass operations of the NKVD}}\n[[File:Izrail Pliner NKVD.jpg|alt=|thumb|186x186px|[[Israel Pliner|Israil Pliner]]; (1896-1939)  chief of [[Gulag]] [[NKVD]] (1937-1938), later arrested and executed]]\nA series of [[mass operations of the NKVD]] was carried out from 1937 through 1938 until the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, based on NKVD directives against the so-called diversionist element, according to the notion of the \"hostile capitalist surrounding\" as defined by Nikolai Yezhov. \n\nThe [[Polish operation of the NKVD]] was the largest of this kind.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=103\u2013104}} The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records.

One notorious example is the \"[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]\", in which at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on 12 August 1952.

In his secret speech to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]]. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]\") in 1957. The former Politburo members [[Yan Rudzutak]] and [[Stanislav Kosior]] and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s.

He elaborates:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation.{{sfn|Wheatcroft|1996|p=1348}}</blockquote>\n\n==Soviet investigation commissions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 749019 Opening of monument to victims of political repressions.jpg|thumb|upright|Opening of monument to victims of political repressions, Moscow, 1990]]\n\nAt least two Soviet commissions investigated the show-trials after Stalin's death.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The first was headed by Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, [[Mikhail Suslov|Suslov]], [[Furtseva]], [[Nikolay Shvernik|Shvernik]], [[Averky Aristov|Aristov]], [[Pospelov]], and [[Roman Rudenko|Rudenko]]. They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956\u20131957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky ''et al.'' should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\n\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"[[Shvernik Commission]]\"). It included [[Alexander Shelepin|Shelepin]], Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\n\n<blockquote>Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov....{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}</blockquote>\n\nMolotov stated \"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value.

In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former [[Solovki prison camp]] in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all \"the victims of political repression\" since 1917.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/17/russia.gulag.grave/index.html \"Pictorial essay: Death trenches bear witness to Stalin's purges\"] [[CNN]], 17 July 1997</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2131954.stm \"Mass grave found at Ukrainian monastery\"], [[BBC]], 12 July 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1010/p01s02-woeu.html \"Wary of its past, Russia ignores mass grave site\"], by [[Fred Weir]], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 October 2002</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6584HJ20100609 Stalin-era mass grave yields tons of bones] [[Reuters]]. 9 June 2010</ref> Some, such as the killing fields [[Bykivnia]] near [[Kiev]], are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/battles.htm#Bykivnia|title=WAR STATS REDIRECT|publisher=erols.com}}</ref>{{Better source|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism.

According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).<ref name=werth>{{cite web|first=Nicolas|last=Werth |authorlink=Nicolas Werth|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/nkvd-mass-secret-national-operations-august-1937-november-1938|title=Case Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n\u00b0 00447 (August 1937 \u2013 November 1938)|publisher=Mass Violence and Resistance \u2013 Research Network|date=15 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others.{{sfn|Harris|2017|pp=2\u20134}} His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution.{{sfn|Harris|2017|p=16}}\n\n<blockquote>So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/163498|title=Historian James Harris says Russian archives show we've misunderstood Stalin|last=Harris |first=James |date=July 26, 2016 |website=[[History News Network]]|access-date=December 1, 2018 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTwo major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians.  One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position.  Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that,  Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army.<ref>James Harris, \"Encircled by Enemies: Stalin\u2019s Perceptions of the Capitalist World, 1918\u20131941,\u201d ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 30#3 [2007]: 513\u2013545.</ref> It was not a ploy \u2013 Stalin truly believed it. \u201cStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat\u201d; thus \u201cStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign\u2010backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.\u201d  The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.<ref>Peter Whitewood, ''The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the Soviet Military'' (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276.</ref><ref>Ronald Grigor Suny, review, ''Historian'' (2018) 80#1:177-79.</ref><ref>For a critique of Whitewood see Alexander Hill, review, ''American Historical Review'' (2017) 122#5 pp 1713-1714.</ref> Historians often cite the disruption as factors in the Red Army's disastrous military performance during the German invasion.<ref>Roger R.

It is classified as an [[emission nebula]] and as an [[H II region]].\n\nThe Lagoon Nebula was discovered by [[Giovanni Hodierna]] before 1654<ref>{{cite web|url=http://messier.seds.org/m/m008.html|title=Messier Object 8|first=Guy McArthur, Hartmut Frommert, Christine|last=Kronberg|date=|website=messier.seds.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> and is one of only two star-forming [[nebula]]e faintly visible to the eye from mid-northern latitudes. Seen with [[binoculars]], it appears as a distinct [[oval]] cloudlike patch with a definite  core.

Kenworthy|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=2008|isbn=978-1-58381-671-4}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Lagoon Nebula is estimated to be between 4,000-6,000 [[light-year]]s away from the [[Earth]]. In the sky of Earth, it spans 90' by 40', which translates to an actual dimension of 110 by 50 light years. Like many nebulas, it appears pink in time-exposure color photos but is gray to the eye peering through [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]], human [[Visual perception|vision]] having poor color sensitivity at low light levels. The nebula contains a number of [[Bok globule]]s (dark,  collapsing clouds of protostellar material), the most prominent of which have been catalogued by [[Edward Emerson Barnard|E. E. Barnard]] as B88, B89 and B296. It also includes a funnel-like or [[tornado]]-like structure caused by a hot [[O-type star]] that emanates [[ultraviolet light]], heating and ionizing gases on the surface of the nebula. The Lagoon Nebula also contains at its centre a structure known as the Hourglass Nebula (so named by [[John Herschel]]), which should not be confused with the better known [[Engraved Hourglass Nebula]] in the constellation of [[Musca]]. In 2006 the first four [[Herbig\u2013Haro object]]s were detected within the Hourglass, also including [[HH 870]]. This provides the first direct evidence of active star formation by accretion within it.<ref name=\"Ariasetal2006\" />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Off to a strong start Lagoon Nebula.tif|Optical observation by the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Off to a strong start |url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1909a/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=4 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\nImage:Hubble's 28th birthday picture The Lagoon Nebula.jpg|Hubble's 28th birthday picture of the Lagoon Nebula.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble celebrates 28th anniversary with a trip through the Lagoon Nebula|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1808/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\nImage:New Hubble view of the Lagoon Nebula.jpg|The region is filled with winds from stars, funnels of gas, and star formation, all embedded within a haze of gas and dust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stormy seas in Sagittarius|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1517/|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>\nFile:Infrared view of Lagoon Nebula.webp|Infrared image revealing stars hidden behind dust and gas.\nImage:Messier 8.jpg|Image taken by the Wide Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble.\nImage:VISTA's infrared view of the Lagoon Nebula (Messier 8).jpg|Infrared Lagoon Nebula.\nImage:Lagoon nebula SALT.jpg|Central region of the Lagoon Nebula, showing the Hourglass Nebula to the right.\nImage:Lagoon Nebula (ESO).jpg|The Lagoon Nebula <br> Credit: [[ESO]]/S.Guisard.\nImage:GigaGalaxy Zoom composite.jpg|Three images from the [[ESO]] GigaGalaxy Zoom project.<ref>The images show the sky at different levels: from the view seen by the unaided eye to one seen through an amateur telescope, with a final zoom in onto the Lagoon Nebula as seen through a professional telescope.</ref>\nImage:Messier 8 Centre.jpg|Waves breaking in the stellar lagoon <br> Credit: [[NASA]], [[ESA]].\nFile:Diving into the Lagoon Nebula.OGG|Dive into the Lagoon Nebula.\nFile:Hourglass Nebula region of Messier 8 (M8) in the 32 inch Schulman telescope on Mt.

It is classified as an [[emission nebula]] and as an [[H II region]].\n\nThe Lagoon Nebula was discovered by [[Giovanni Hodierna]] before 1654<ref>{{cite web|url=http://messier.seds.org/m/m008.html|title=Messier Object 8|first=Guy McArthur, Hartmut Frommert, Christine|last=Kronberg|date=|website=messier.seds.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> and is one of only two star-forming [[nebula]]e faintly visible to the eye from mid-northern latitudes. Seen with [[binoculars]], it appears as a distinct [[oval]] cloudlike patch with a definite  core.

Kenworthy|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=2008|isbn=978-1-58381-671-4}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Lagoon Nebula is estimated to be between 4,000-6,000 [[light-year]]s away from the [[Earth]]. In the sky of Earth, it spans 90' by 40', which translates to an actual dimension of 110 by 50 light years. Like many nebulas, it appears pink in time-exposure color photos but is gray to the eye peering through [[binoculars]] or a [[telescope]], human [[Visual perception|vision]] having poor color sensitivity at low light levels. The nebula contains a number of [[Bok globule]]s (dark,  collapsing clouds of protostellar material), the most prominent of which have been catalogued by [[Edward Emerson Barnard|E. E. Barnard]] as B88, B89 and B296. It also includes a funnel-like or [[tornado]]-like structure caused by a hot [[O-type star]] that emanates [[ultraviolet light]], heating and ionizing gases on the surface of the nebula. The Lagoon Nebula also contains at its centre a structure known as the Hourglass Nebula (so named by [[John Herschel]]), which should not be confused with the better known [[Engraved Hourglass Nebula]] in the constellation of [[Musca]]. In 2006 the first four [[Herbig\u2013Haro object]]s were detected within the Hourglass, also including [[HH 870]]. This provides the first direct evidence of active star formation by accretion within it.<ref name=\"Ariasetal2006\" />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Off to a strong start Lagoon Nebula.tif|Optical observation by the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Off to a strong start |url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1909a/ |website=www.eso.org |accessdate=4 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\nImage:Hubble's 28th birthday picture The Lagoon Nebula.jpg|Hubble's 28th birthday picture of the Lagoon Nebula.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble celebrates 28th anniversary with a trip through the Lagoon Nebula|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1808/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\nImage:New Hubble view of the Lagoon Nebula.jpg|The region is filled with winds from stars, funnels of gas, and star formation, all embedded within a haze of gas and dust.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stormy seas in Sagittarius|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1517/|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>\nFile:Infrared view of Lagoon Nebula.webp|Infrared image revealing stars hidden behind dust and gas.\nImage:Messier 8.jpg|Image taken by the Wide Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble.\nImage:VISTA's infrared view of the Lagoon Nebula (Messier 8).jpg|Infrared Lagoon Nebula.\nImage:Lagoon nebula SALT.jpg|Central region of the Lagoon Nebula, showing the Hourglass Nebula to the right.\nImage:Lagoon Nebula (ESO).jpg|The Lagoon Nebula <br> Credit: [[ESO]]/S.Guisard.\nImage:GigaGalaxy Zoom composite.jpg|Three images from the [[ESO]] GigaGalaxy Zoom project.<ref>The images show the sky at different levels: from the view seen by the unaided eye to one seen through an amateur telescope, with a final zoom in onto the Lagoon Nebula as seen through a professional telescope.</ref>\nImage:Messier 8 Centre.jpg|Waves breaking in the stellar lagoon <br> Credit: [[NASA]], [[ESA]].\nFile:Diving into the Lagoon Nebula.OGG|Dive into the Lagoon Nebula.\nFile:Hourglass Nebula region of Messier 8 (M8) in the 32 inch Schulman telescope on Mt.

To support [[Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by an [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The Flooding of hold 1 nad 2 caused the [[bow (ship)|bow]] to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19-22 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned. Nine other ships were scuttled to from [[Mulberry_harbour#Breakwaters|Gooseberry 1]].  Some of the other ships were the ''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W.

To support [[Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by an [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The Flooding of hold 1 nad 2 caused the [[bow (ship)]] to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19-22 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned. Nine other ships were scuttled to from [[Mulberry_harbour#Breakwaters|Gooseberry 1]].  Some of the other ships were the ''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W.

''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. pp. 109\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to evaluating hypotheses, and the scientific method in general, to form a more complete system that integrates the individual concerns of each approach. Notably, [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], Karl Popper's colleague and student, respectively, have produced novel attempts at such a synthesis.\n\n==Hypotheses, concepts and measurement==\n[[Concept]]s in Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]] play a key role in the development and testing of hypotheses. Most formal hypotheses connect concepts by specifying the expected relationships between [[proposition]]s. When a set of hypotheses are grouped together they become a type of [[conceptual framework]]. When a [[conceptual framework]] is complex and incorporates causality or explanation it is generally referred to as a theory. According to noted philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] \"An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived.\"<ref>Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36</ref>\n\nHempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between a [[conceptual framework]] and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework).  \"The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory.\"<ref>Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36.</ref> Hypotheses with concepts anchored in the plane of observation are ready to be tested. In \"actual scientific practice the process of framing a theoretical structure and of interpreting it are not always sharply separated, since the intended interpretation usually guides the construction of the theoretician.\"<ref name=\"Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33\">Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 33.</ref> It is, however, \"possible and indeed desirable, for the purposes of logical clarification, to separate the two steps conceptually.\"<ref name=\"Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33\"/>\n\n===Statistical hypothesis testing===\n{{Main|Statistical hypothesis testing}}\nWhen a possible [[correlation]] or similar relation between phenomena is investigated, such as whether a proposed remedy is effective in treating a disease, the hypothesis that a relation exists cannot be examined the same way one might examine a proposed new law of nature. In such an investigation, if the tested remedy shows no effect in a few cases, these do not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. Instead, [[statistical test]]s are used to determine how likely it is that the overall effect would be observed if the hypothesized relation does not exist. If that likelihood is sufficiently small (e.g., less than 1%), the existence of a relation may be assumed. Otherwise, any observed effect may be due to pure chance.\n\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, two hypotheses are compared. These are called the [[null hypothesis]] and the [[alternative hypothesis]]. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that states that there is no relation between the phenomena whose relation is under investigation, or at least not of the form given by the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis, as the name suggests, is the alternative to the null hypothesis: it states that there ''is'' some kind of relation. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms, depending on the nature of the hypothesized relation; in particular, it can be two-sided (for example: there is ''some'' effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the hypothesized relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&pg=PA168&dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&f=false Altman. DG., ''Practical Statistics for Medical Research'', CRC Press, 1990, Section 8.5,]</ref>\n\nConventional significance levels for testing hypotheses (acceptable probabilities of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis) are .10, .05, and .01. The significance level for deciding whether the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted must be determined in advance, before the observations are collected or inspected. If these criteria are determined later, when the data to be tested are already known, the test is invalid.<ref name=\"Mellenbergh, 2008\">Mellenbergh, G.J.(2008).

Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing</ref>\n\nThe above procedure is actually dependent on the number of the participants (units or [[sample size]]) that are included in the study. For instance, to avoid having the sample size be too small to reject a null hypothesis, it is recommended that one specify a sufficient sample size from the beginning. It is advisable to define a small, medium and large effect size for each of a number of important statistical tests which are used to test the hypotheses.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&pg=PA168&dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&f=false Altman.

''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. pp. 109\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to evaluating hypotheses, and the scientific method in general, to form a more complete system that integrates the individual concerns of each approach. Notably, [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], Karl Popper's colleague and student, respectively, have produced novel attempts at such a synthesis.\n\n==Hypotheses, concepts and measurement==\n[[Concept]]s in Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]] play a key role in the development and testing of hypotheses. Most formal hypotheses connect concepts by specifying the expected relationships between [[proposition]]s. When a set of hypotheses are grouped together they become a type of [[conceptual framework]]. When a [[conceptual framework]] is complex and incorporates causality or explanation it is generally referred to as a theory. According to noted philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] \"An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived.\"<ref>Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36</ref>\n\nHempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between a [[conceptual framework]] and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework).  \"The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory.\"<ref>Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36.</ref> Hypotheses with concepts anchored in the plane of observation are ready to be tested. In \"actual scientific practice the process of framing a theoretical structure and of interpreting it are not always sharply separated, since the intended interpretation usually guides the construction of the theoretician.\"<ref name=\"Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33\">Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 33.</ref> It is, however, \"possible and indeed desirable, for the purposes of logical clarification, to separate the two steps conceptually.\"<ref name=\"Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33\"/>\n\n===Statistical hypothesis testing===\n{{Main|Statistical hypothesis testing}}\nWhen a possible [[correlation]] or similar relation between phenomena is investigated, such as whether a proposed remedy is effective in treating a disease, the hypothesis that a relation exists cannot be examined the same way one might examine a proposed new law of nature. In such an investigation, if the tested remedy shows no effect in a few cases, these do not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. Instead, [[statistical test]]s are used to determine how likely it is that the overall effect would be observed if the hypothesized relation does not exist. If that likelihood is sufficiently small (e.g., less than 1%), the existence of a relation may be assumed. Otherwise, any observed effect may be due to pure chance.\n\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, two hypotheses are compared. These are called the [[null hypothesis]] and the [[alternative hypothesis]]. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that states that there is no relation between the phenomena whose relation is under investigation, or at least not of the form given by the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis, as the name suggests, is the alternative to the null hypothesis: it states that there ''is'' some kind of relation. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms, depending on the nature of the hypothesized relation; in particular, it can be two-sided (for example: there is ''some'' effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the hypothesized relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&pg=PA168&dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&f=false Altman. DG., ''Practical Statistics for Medical Research'', CRC Press, 1990, Section 8.5,]</ref>\n\nConventional significance levels for testing hypotheses (acceptable probabilities of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis) are .10, .05, and .01. The significance level for deciding whether the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted must be determined in advance, before the observations are collected or inspected. If these criteria are determined later, when the data to be tested are already known, the test is invalid.<ref name=\"Mellenbergh, 2008\">Mellenbergh, G.J.(2008). Chapter 8: Research designs: Testing of research hypotheses. In [[H.J. Ad\u00e8r]] & [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G.J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing</ref>\n\nThe above procedure is actually dependent on the number of the participants (units or [[sample size]]) that are included in the study. For instance, to avoid having the sample size be too small to reject a null hypothesis, it is recommended that one specify a sufficient sample size from the beginning. It is advisable to define a small, medium and large effect size for each of a number of important statistical tests which are used to test the hypotheses.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&pg=PA168&dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&f=false Altman.
