{"title_page": "Criminal justice system of the Netherlands", "text_new": "{{politics of the Netherlands}}\n{{update|inaccurate=y|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe '''criminal justice system of the Netherlands''' is the system of practices and institutions of the [[Netherlands]] directed at upholding social control, deterring and mitigating crime, and sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties and rehabilitation efforts. The Netherlands' criminal code is based on the [[Napoleonic Code]], imposed during the time of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. The Dutch largely kept the Napoleonic Code after their independence, but tempered it with a significantly more [[rehabilitative justice|rehabilitative]] penological focus.\n\n[[Law enforcement in the Netherlands]] is provided by the national police force. The police make use of over 50,000 individuals, employed in a number of regional and specialist departments. The [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] crafts rules to manage the police, while the [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice and Security]] is responsible for the central administration of the police. The national police commissioner is vested with the day-to-day management of the police force.\n\nThe judiciary comprises eleven district courts, four courts of appeal, two administrative courts (Centrale Raad van Beroep and the College van beroep voor het bedrijfsleven) and a Supreme Court that has 41 judges. All judicial appointments are made by the government. Judges are nominally appointed for life, but in practice retire at age 70. The [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Council of State]] is a constitutionally established advisory body to the government, which consists of members of the royal family and Crown-appointed members generally having political, commercial, diplomatic, or military experience. The [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] is the [[supreme court|highest court]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[Curacao]], [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Aruba]]. The Court sits in [[The Hague]], Netherlands and presides over civil, criminal and tax-related cases.\n\n==Police==\n{{Main|Law enforcement in the Netherlands}}\n\n===Organization===\n\nFrom the end of 1945 until 1993, the Dutch police was composed of the ''gemeentepolitie'' (municipal police) and the ''rijkspolitie'' (state police). In 1993, the police were reorganised into 25 regional forces and the [[Korps landelijke politiediensten|Dutch National Police Agency]] (KLPD).<ref>[http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Netherlands Interpol profile on Netherlands Police]</ref> In total, the police employ over 40,000 individuals. The 25 regional forces are responsible for police care in their respective [[List of regions of the Netherlands|region]] in the Netherlands. Each force comprises a number of regional and specialist departments, such as the Juvenile and Vice Squad, the Criminal Intelligence Service and the Aliens Police. The KLPD is responsible for the supervision and surveillance of the motorways, [[Dienst Luchtvaart Politie|airways]], and waterways, as well as providing security for the [[Dutch Royal Family|Royal Family]].\n\n[[Image:Police car on Terschelling 08.JPG|thumb|Local police car in Terschelling]]\nIn the event of serious emergencies, the police cooperate with the [[fire brigade]], [[ambulance]] service and other government agencies in the security region that corresponds to the police region. The police in a municipality are available 24 hours every day for basic law enforcement. The Dutch government is keen to put more police \"[[Beat (police)|on the street]].\" The uniformed policemen on the street are those of the patrol service. Surveillance is frequently done from patrol cars, horses, and motorbikes. Since the early 1990s several police regions have been working with neighborhood teams called neighborhood supervisors.<ref name=\"Netherlands Police\">{{cite web|url= http://www.police.nl|title= The police in the Netherlands|accessdate= 2010-10-24|publisher= Capstan AV|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101101170133/http://www.police.nl/#|archive-date= 2010-11-01|url-status= dead}}</ref>\n \nThe [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] crafts rules to manage the police, while the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior]] is responsible for the central administration of the police. One of the [[burgemeester]]s in a region is the force administrator. The chief public prosecutor and the force administrator have the ultimate responsibility for the administration of the police force. The regional chief of police however, is vested with the day-to-day management of the police force. When investigating crime, police follow the instructions of the public prosecutor\u2014a member of the [[Openbaar Ministerie|Public Prosecution Service]]. The Public Prosecution Service, under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, is responsible for maintaining order. Police traditionally carry a baton, handcuffs, and a firearm; regulations are in place restricting the use of violence in general and firearms in particular.\n\n===Enforcement===\n[[File:Politie was alert tijdens het 1 april feest in Brielle.jpg|thumb|Police officers]]\nBasic police work includes responsibility for maintaining a visible presence on the street, on foot, or in a marked car. Police are also responsible for basic detective work, such as investigating thefts and burglaries. Police frequently deal with traffic issues, including those of surveillance, accidents, congestion security, and advising citizens and municipalities. Responsibility also rests with the police to maintain laws and regulations. This may take the form of checking whether foreigners are in possession of the right documents.\n\nIn 1970, the police [[clearance rate|cleared]] forty percent of all crimes; however in 1996 less than eighteen percent of crimes were cleared.<ref name=\"Tak 177\">Tak, Peter, J.

All judicial appointments are made by the Government. Judges are nominally appointed for life, but in practice retire at age 70.\n\nThe Raad van State (Council of State) is a [[constitutionally]] established advisory body to the government, which consists of members of the royal family and Crown-appointed members generally having political, commercial, diplomatic, or military experience. The Council of State must be consulted by the cabinet on proposed legislation before a law is submitted to the parliament. The Council of State Administrative Law section also serves as an appellate court for citizens against executive branch decisions. The [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King]] is President of the Council of State, but he seldom chairs meetings. The Vice-President of the Council of State chairs meetings in the King's absence. Under [[Dutch constitution|Dutch Constitutional]] Law the Vice-President of the Council is acting Head of State when there is no [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Monarch]]; e.g. if the Royal Family were to become extinct.\n\nFor criminal law, the independent Hoge Raad is the [[supreme court|highest court]] of the [[Netherlands]],  as well as [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]] and [[Sint Maarten]].<ref name=rechtspraakAntAruba>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/HogeRaad/Over+de+Hoge+Raad/Nederlandse+Antillen+en+Aruba/ |title=Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba |work=Rechtspraak.nl |publisher=De Rechtspraak |language=Dutch |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019121834/http://rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/HogeRaad/Over%2Bde%2BHoge%2BRaad/Nederlandse%2BAntillen%2Ben%2BAruba |archivedate=2009-10-19 }}</ref> The Court was established on 1 October 1838 and sits in [[The Hague]], Netherlands.<ref name=rechtspraakHistory>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/HogeRaad/Over+de+Hoge+Raad/Geschiedenis+van+de+Hoge+Raad.htm |title=Geschiedenis van de Hoge Raad |work=Rechtspraak.nl |publisher=De Rechtspraak |language=Dutch |date=2004-09-18 |accessdate=2009-12-02 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is limited primarily to civil, criminal and tax-related cases.

[[Image:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 original edition of the Napoleonic Code.]] After the Dutch gained independence, the [[Napoleonic Code]] was largely kept but the philosophy underlying these criminal sanctions changed. Specifically, a more humane system replaced [[French penal philosophy|Criminal Justice System of France]]. Nineteenth century Dutch prisons did not distinguish between adult and juvenile offenders; offenders regularly resided in common quarters. Subsequent to Dutch independence, these practices grew out of favour as they failed to conform to the Dutch conception of punishment. A group of concerned citizens assembled the Dutch Association for the Moral Improvement of Prisoners to combat the frequently harsh prison environment. The organisation's focus was to make prisons more humane by advocating training for offenders, specifically that of a religious and educational nature.<ref name=\"Tak 15\">Tak, P.J.P.

This meant that the state did not intervene in issues classified as the responsibility of the family. However, when children moved out of the home and into the factory, the state asserted a greater interest in their well-being.<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 305\">Junger-Tas, J.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-226-80865-3}}</ref> From the late 19th century to early 20th century, a variety of practices were created to stress a rehabilitative model for juveniles. The 1901 Penal Children's Act highlighted this trend by requiring the rehabilitation of delinquent children.<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 305-306\"/> Consequently, youth was now perceived as a mitigating factor in sentencing, and the [[capital punishment in the Netherlands|death penalty]] for juveniles was abolished.<ref>Junger-Tas, J.

The American decision played a large role in intellectually influencing Dutch penology. Gault fundamentally changed the penological landscape because the decision mandated an extension of [[due process]] rights to juveniles.<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 318-319\">Junger-Tas, J. (2004) ''Youth Justice in the Netherlands'', pp.&nbsp;318-319. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-226-80865-3}}</ref> This shift in ideology saw juveniles as a source of rights; and from that point on, the once virulent dividing line between juvenile and adult penology faded. The intellectual groundwork underlying Gault helped catalyze an insurgence of [[retributive justice|retributive]] principles, which influenced the penological debate in the Netherlands. Principles of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]] permeated into the system as policies which previously advocated the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents grew to disfavour.<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 318\">Junger-Tas, J.

Accordingly, concerns over the reintegration of offenders into society should be subordinate to ensuring that offenders receive their [[wikt:just deserts|\"just deserts\"]].<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 318-319\" /> These retributive principles marked a sharp divergence from the rehabilitative and therapeutic philosophies that preceded them.

Boom Juridische Uitgevers, 2003. {{ISBN|90-5454-303-5}}</ref> The fine's popularity stems from the 1983 Financial Penalties Act (FPA), which stresses the use of the fine over that of incarceration. Dutch courts imposed the fine in 51,280 cases, representing approximately one-third of all sanctions. Section 24 of the FPA stresses that a court should consider an offender's ability to pay and the nature of the crime when deciding on an appropriate amount of the fine.<ref name=\"Tak 161\">Tak, Peter, J.

(2001) ''Sentencing and Punishment in The Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;153.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> Specifically, transactions permit an offender to pay a fine to avoid further prosecution.<ref name=\"Tak 161\" /> Prosecutors have tremendous discretion to dispose of crimes through the use of transactions.<ref name=\"Tak 156-157\" /> However, transactions can only be offered in cases where the maximum statutory prison sentence is less than six years. Approximately 90% of crimes can be appropriately disposed of via a transaction. Yet, in practice, roughly 30% of all cases are settled through the use of a transaction, with prosecutorial guidelines established to minimise arbitrariness.<ref name=\"Tak 157\">Tak, Peter, J.

Critics however allege that transactions coerce the arrested to forgo the procedural safeguards required by trials.<ref name=\"Tak 156\" /> As a result, they contend arrested individuals may plead to crimes they did not commit because the risk of conviction outweighs the transaction fee.<ref name=\"Tak 157\" />\n\n====Semi-indeterminate detention====\n\nA semi-indeterminate detention of offender (TBR order) is a sanction ordering the placement of an offender in a secure clinic for an indeterminate period of time.<ref name=\"Downes 44\">Downes, David. ''Contrasts in tolerance: post-war penal policy in the Netherlands and England and Wales'', p.&nbsp;44. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-825833-X}}</ref> The frequent use of these TBR orders exemplified the rehabilitative culture of the Netherlands following World War II. In 1955 alone, one-third of all incarcerated prisoners were in [[mental institutions]]. Critics lamented their overuse, and argued the Dutch rehabilitative philosophy permitted any offence to be sanctioned by a TBR order. A shift in penological philosophy over the next two decades dramatically decreased the use of TBR orders; by 1970, only one-tenth of all incarcerated prisoners occupied mental institutions.<ref name=\"Downes 95-96\">Downes, David.

America's prison occupancy level is at an extreme 103.9%, while the Netherlands prison occupancy is a mere 68.1%. The Netherlands has a relatively low prison population rate compared to that of the U.S., at 59 per 100,000 of the nation's population. To put this number into perspective, the U.S.\u2019s prison population rate is 666 per 100,000. To be specific, the official prison capacity of the Netherlands is at 15,074, which is far less than America\u2019s prison population of 2,145,100.<ref name=\"prisonstudies.org\">\u201cNetherlands.\u201d World Prison Brief, Institute for Criminal Policy Research, 1 Jan. 1970, www.prisonstudies.org/country/netherlands. \u201cUnited States of America.\u201d United States of America | World Prison Brief, Institute for Criminal Policy Research, 1 Jan. 1970, www.prisonstudies.org/country/united-states-america.</ref>\n\nBreaking these numbers down into smaller categories, the World Prison Brief website shows that pre-trial detainees make up 20.3% of the prison population in the Netherlands. According to World Prison Brief, female prisoners make up 5.4% of the prison population. In the U.S., this number is much higher at 9.7%. Juveniles make up only 0.2% of the prison population in the Netherlands. The prison administration of the Netherlands is called the National Agency of Correctional Institutions, or NACI. The Netherlands\u2019 prison population has been steadily declining since 2006. They have so much extra room that they take in prisoners from other countries. In fact, 19.1% of their prisoners are foreigners. In the U.S., this number is only 5.2%.<ref name=\"prisonstudies.org\"/> Not only can prisons in the Netherlands house all of their prisoners comfortably, but they can also help out with overcrowding in other countries.\n\nThe Netherlands experienced an extended period of decarceration from 1947 until 1974.<ref name=\"Downes 93\">Downes, David.

Individuals were still sent to prison even in the absence of capacity.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" /> To remedy this shortfall in capacity, the Netherlands established [[waitlists]] for prisons.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" /> If the prison incarcerated more perilous offenders than the convicted, then the convict was placed on a waitlist until their crime was deemed sufficiently severe. The reason behind these waitlists was purely practical: the Dutch simply did not have enough available space in their prisons.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" /> These waitlists were not developed for rehabilitative reasons. In fact, prison sentences were voided if the convicted spent too long on the waitlist. Over 5,000 unsuspended prison sentences were voided in 1995 alone due to a lack of space in prisons.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" />\n\nFundamental changes in penal philosophy resulted from the national concern that was registered over these ever-escalating prison waitlists.<ref name=\"Downes 113-115\">Downes, David.

The Netherlands' criminal code is based on the [[Napoleonic Code]], imposed during the time of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. The Dutch largely kept the Napoleonic Code after their independence, but tempered it with a significantly more [[rehabilitative justice|rehabilitative]] penological focus.\n\n[[Law enforcement in the Netherlands]] is provided by the national police force. The police make use of over 50,000 individuals, employed in a number of regional and specialist departments. The [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] crafts rules to manage the police, while the [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice and Security]] is responsible for the central administration of the police. The national police commissioner is vested with the day-to-day management of the police force.\n\nThe judiciary comprises eleven district courts, four courts of appeal, two administrative courts (Centrale Raad van Beroep and the College van beroep voor het bedrijfsleven) and a Supreme Court that has 41 judges. All judicial appointments are made by the government. Judges are nominally appointed for life, but in practice retire at age 70. The [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Council of State]] is a constitutionally established advisory body to the government, which consists of members of the royal family and Crown-appointed members generally having political, commercial, diplomatic, or military experience. The [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] is the [[supreme court|highest court]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[Curacao]], [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Aruba]]. The Court sits in [[The Hague]], Netherlands and presides over civil, criminal and tax-related cases.\n\n==Police==\n{{Main|Law enforcement in the Netherlands}}\n\n===Organization===\n\nFrom the end of 1945 until 1993, the Dutch police was composed of the ''gemeentepolitie'' (municipal police) and the ''rijkspolitie'' (state police). In 1993, the police were reorganised into 25 regional forces and the [[Korps landelijke politiediensten|Dutch National Police Agency]] (KLPD).<ref>[http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Netherlands Interpol profile on Netherlands Police]</ref> In total, the police employ over 40,000 individuals. The 25 regional forces are responsible for police care in their respective [[List of regions of the Netherlands|region]] in the Netherlands. Each force comprises a number of regional and specialist departments, such as the Juvenile and Vice Squad, the Criminal Intelligence Service and the Aliens Police. The KLPD is responsible for the supervision and surveillance of the motorways, [[Dienst Luchtvaart Politie|airways]], and waterways, as well as providing security for the [[Dutch Royal Family|Royal Family]].\n\n[[Image:Police car on Terschelling 08.JPG|thumb|Local police car in Terschelling]]\nIn the event of serious emergencies, the police cooperate with the [[fire brigade]], [[ambulance]] service and other government agencies in the security region that corresponds to the police region. The police in a municipality are available 24 hours every day for basic law enforcement. The Dutch government is keen to put more police \"[[Beat (police)|on the street]].\" The uniformed policemen on the street are those of the patrol service. Surveillance is frequently done from patrol cars, horses, and motorbikes. Since the early 1990s several police regions have been working with neighborhood teams called neighborhood supervisors.<ref name=\"Netherlands Police\">{{cite web|url= http://www.police.nl|title= The police in the Netherlands|accessdate= 2010-10-24|publisher= Capstan AV|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101101170133/http://www.police.nl/#|archive-date= 2010-11-01|url-status= dead}}</ref>\n \nThe [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] crafts rules to manage the police, while the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior]] is responsible for the central administration of the police. One of the [[burgemeester]]s in a region is the force administrator. The chief public prosecutor and the force administrator have the ultimate responsibility for the administration of the police force. The regional chief of police however, is vested with the day-to-day management of the police force. When investigating crime, police follow the instructions of the public prosecutor\u2014a member of the [[Openbaar Ministerie|Public Prosecution Service]]. The Public Prosecution Service, under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, is responsible for maintaining order. Police traditionally carry a baton, handcuffs, and a firearm; regulations are in place restricting the use of violence in general and firearms in particular.\n\n===Enforcement===\n[[File:Politie was alert tijdens het 1 april feest in Brielle.jpg|thumb|Police officers]]\nBasic police work includes responsibility for maintaining a visible presence on the street, on foot, or in a marked car. Police are also responsible for basic detective work, such as investigating thefts and burglaries. Police frequently deal with traffic issues, including those of surveillance, accidents, congestion security, and advising citizens and municipalities. Responsibility also rests with the police to maintain laws and regulations. This may take the form of checking whether foreigners are in possession of the right documents.\n\nIn 1970, the police [[clearance rate|cleared]] forty percent of all crimes; however in 1996 less than eighteen percent of crimes were cleared.<ref name=\"Tak 177\">Tak, Peter, J.

The Council of State must be consulted by the cabinet on proposed legislation before a law is submitted to the parliament. The Council of State Administrative Law section also serves as an appellate court for citizens against executive branch decisions. The [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King]] is President of the Council of State, but he seldom chairs meetings. The Vice-President of the Council of State chairs meetings in the King's absence. Under [[Dutch constitution|Dutch Constitutional]] Law the Vice-President of the Council is acting Head of State when there is no [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Monarch]]; e.g. if the Royal Family were to become extinct.\n\nFor criminal law, the independent Hoge Raad is the [[supreme court|highest court]] of the [[Netherlands]],  as well as [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]] and [[Sint Maarten]].<ref name=rechtspraakAntAruba>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/HogeRaad/Over+de+Hoge+Raad/Nederlandse+Antillen+en+Aruba/ |title=Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba |work=Rechtspraak.nl |publisher=De Rechtspraak |language=Dutch |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019121834/http://rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/HogeRaad/Over%2Bde%2BHoge%2BRaad/Nederlandse%2BAntillen%2Ben%2BAruba |archivedate=2009-10-19 }}</ref> The Court was established on 1 October 1838 and sits in [[The Hague]], Netherlands.<ref name=rechtspraakHistory>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/HogeRaad/Over+de+Hoge+Raad/Geschiedenis+van+de+Hoge+Raad.htm |title=Geschiedenis van de Hoge Raad |work=Rechtspraak.nl |publisher=De Rechtspraak |language=Dutch |date=2004-09-18 |accessdate=2009-12-02 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is limited primarily to civil, criminal and tax-related cases.

[[Image:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 original edition of the Napoleonic Code.]] After the Dutch gained independence, the [[Napoleonic Code]] was largely kept but the philosophy underlying these criminal sanctions changed. Specifically, a more humane system replaced [[French penal philosophy|Criminal Justice System of France]]. Nineteenth century Dutch prisons did not distinguish between adult and juvenile offenders; offenders regularly resided in common quarters. Subsequent to Dutch independence, these practices grew out of favour as they failed to conform to the Dutch conception of punishment. A group of concerned citizens assembled the Dutch Association for the Moral Improvement of Prisoners to combat the frequently harsh prison environment. The organisation's focus was to make prisons more humane by advocating training for offenders, specifically that of a religious and educational nature.<ref name=\"Tak 15\">Tak, P.J.P.

(2004) ''Youth Justice in the Netherlands'', pp.&nbsp;318-319. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-226-80865-3}}</ref> This shift in ideology saw juveniles as a source of rights; and from that point on, the once virulent dividing line between juvenile and adult penology faded. The intellectual groundwork underlying Gault helped catalyze an insurgence of [[retributive justice|retributive]] principles, which influenced the penological debate in the Netherlands. Principles of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]] permeated into the system as policies which previously advocated the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents grew to disfavour.<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 318\">Junger-Tas, J. (2004) ''Youth Justice in the Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;318. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-226-80865-3}}</ref> These principles theorised that because juveniles possess [[free will]], they should therefore be responsible for the choices that they make in life. Accordingly, concerns over the reintegration of offenders into society should be subordinate to ensuring that offenders receive their [[wikt:just deserts|\"just deserts\"]].<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 318-319\" /> These retributive principles marked a sharp divergence from the rehabilitative and therapeutic philosophies that preceded them. This sharp ideological divergence transformed Dutch prosecutorial charging guidelines.<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 319-323\">Junger-Tas, J. (2004) ''Youth Justice in the Netherlands'', pp.&nbsp;319-323.

(2003) ''The Dutch Criminal Justice System: Organization and Operation'', p.&nbsp;74. Boom Juridische Uitgevers, 2003. {{ISBN|90-5454-303-5}}</ref> The fine's popularity stems from the 1983 Financial Penalties Act (FPA), which stresses the use of the fine over that of incarceration. Dutch courts imposed the fine in 51,280 cases, representing approximately one-third of all sanctions. Section 24 of the FPA stresses that a court should consider an offender's ability to pay and the nature of the crime when deciding on an appropriate amount of the fine.<ref name=\"Tak 161\">Tak, Peter, J. (2001) ''Sentencing and Punishment in The Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;161. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> Despite the fine's popularity in the Dutch system, a substantial number of fines go unpaid every year.<ref name=\"Tak 162\">Tak, Peter, J. (2001) ''Sentencing and Punishment in The Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;162. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> Similarly, transactions play a large role in the sentencing protocol of the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Tak 156-157\">Tak, Peter, J. (2001) ''Sentencing and Punishment in The Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;156-157. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> A transaction is a sanction whereby the offender is required to pay a fine or assume certain financial conditions.<ref name=\"Tak 153\">Tak, Peter, J. (2001) ''Sentencing and Punishment in The Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;153. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> Transactions are popular in the Netherlands because they provide an alternative sanction to punish offenders without congesting the jails.<ref name=\"Tak 156\">Tak, Peter, J. (2001) ''Sentencing and Punishment in The Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;156. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> Specifically, transactions permit an offender to pay a fine to avoid further prosecution.<ref name=\"Tak 161\" /> Prosecutors have tremendous discretion to dispose of crimes through the use of transactions.<ref name=\"Tak 156-157\" /> However, transactions can only be offered in cases where the maximum statutory prison sentence is less than six years. Approximately 90% of crimes can be appropriately disposed of via a transaction. Yet, in practice, roughly 30% of all cases are settled through the use of a transaction, with prosecutorial guidelines established to minimise arbitrariness.<ref name=\"Tak 157\">Tak, Peter, J. (2001) ''Sentencing and Punishment in The Netherlands'', p.&nbsp;157. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> Transactions provide an opportunity for offenders to forgo the stigmatisation that results from the more traditional disposition of cases. Critics however allege that transactions coerce the arrested to forgo the procedural safeguards required by trials.<ref name=\"Tak 156\" /> As a result, they contend arrested individuals may plead to crimes they did not commit because the risk of conviction outweighs the transaction fee.<ref name=\"Tak 157\" />\n\n====Semi-indeterminate detention====\n\nA semi-indeterminate detention of offender (TBR order) is a sanction ordering the placement of an offender in a secure clinic for an indeterminate period of time.<ref name=\"Downes 44\">Downes, David. ''Contrasts in tolerance: post-war penal policy in the Netherlands and England and Wales'', p.&nbsp;44. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-825833-X}}</ref> The frequent use of these TBR orders exemplified the rehabilitative culture of the Netherlands following World War II. In 1955 alone, one-third of all incarcerated prisoners were in [[mental institutions]]. Critics lamented their overuse, and argued the Dutch rehabilitative philosophy permitted any offence to be sanctioned by a TBR order. A shift in penological philosophy over the next two decades dramatically decreased the use of TBR orders; by 1970, only one-tenth of all incarcerated prisoners occupied mental institutions.<ref name=\"Downes 95-96\">Downes, David.

America's prison occupancy level is at an extreme 103.9%, while the Netherlands prison occupancy is a mere 68.1%. The Netherlands has a relatively low prison population rate compared to that of the U.S., at 59 per 100,000 of the nation's population. To put this number into perspective, the U.S.\u2019s prison population rate is 666 per 100,000. To be specific, the official prison capacity of the Netherlands is at 15,074, which is far less than America\u2019s prison population of 2,145,100.<ref name=\"prisonstudies.org\">\u201cNetherlands.\u201d World Prison Brief, Institute for Criminal Policy Research, 1 Jan. 1970, www.prisonstudies.org/country/netherlands. \u201cUnited States of America.\u201d United States of America | World Prison Brief, Institute for Criminal Policy Research, 1 Jan. 1970, www.prisonstudies.org/country/united-states-america.</ref>\n\nBreaking these numbers down into smaller categories, the World Prison Brief website shows that pre-trial detainees make up 20.3% of the prison population in the Netherlands. According to World Prison Brief, female prisoners make up 5.4% of the prison population. In the U.S., this number is much higher at 9.7%. Juveniles make up only 0.2% of the prison population in the Netherlands. The prison administration of the Netherlands is called the National Agency of Correctional Institutions, or NACI. The Netherlands\u2019 prison population has been steadily declining since 2006. They have so much extra room that they take in prisoners from other countries. In fact, 19.1% of their prisoners are foreigners. In the U.S., this number is only 5.2%.<ref name=\"prisonstudies.org\"/> Not only can prisons in the Netherlands house all of their prisoners comfortably, but they can also help out with overcrowding in other countries.\n\nThe Netherlands experienced an extended period of decarceration from 1947 until 1974.<ref name=\"Downes 93\">Downes, David.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-513861-9}}</ref> Notably, in the 1970s Dutch prisons operated at full capacity. Incarceration rates were kept artificially low in this era because the Dutch declined to construct the required number of prisons to suit the demands imposed by their criminal justice system.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" /> This problem was alleviated on the front-end by dismissing three-quarters of all recorded offences.<ref name=\"Junger-Tas 321\" /> Furthermore, there was no guarantee the convicted would ever spend any time in prison, even when prosecutors did not dismiss the offence and the offender was subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison. Individuals were still sent to prison even in the absence of capacity.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" /> To remedy this shortfall in capacity, the Netherlands established [[waitlists]] for prisons.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" /> If the prison incarcerated more perilous offenders than the convicted, then the convict was placed on a waitlist until their crime was deemed sufficiently severe. The reason behind these waitlists was purely practical: the Dutch simply did not have enough available space in their prisons.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" /> These waitlists were not developed for rehabilitative reasons. In fact, prison sentences were voided if the convicted spent too long on the waitlist. Over 5,000 unsuspended prison sentences were voided in 1995 alone due to a lack of space in prisons.<ref name=\"Tak 151\" />\n\nFundamental changes in penal philosophy resulted from the national concern that was registered over these ever-escalating prison waitlists.<ref name=\"Downes 113-115\">Downes, David.

Originally a parish church, it was elevated to cathedral status when the diocese was created in 1914. Sheffield Cathedral is one of five [[Grade I listed]] buildings in the city, along with [[Sheffield Town Hall|Town Hall]], [[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]], and the parish churches at [[Church of St Mary, Ecclesfield|Ecclesfield]] and [[Church of St Nicholas, Bradfield|Bradfield]]. It is located in the [[Sheffield City Centre|city centre]] on [[Church Street (Sheffield)|Church Street]] and served by [[Sheffield Supertram]]'s Cathedral stop. It is one of three stops to be served by all tram lines.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Shrewsbury Chapel.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Shrewsbury Chapel]]\n\nThe site of the cathedral has a long history of Christian use. The shaft of the 9th-century [[Sheffield Cross]], believed to have formerly been sited here, is now held by the [[British Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/stone_cross_shaft.aspx |title=Stone cross shaft |accessdate=6 December 2013 |work=British Museum |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430144349/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/stone_cross_shaft.aspx |archivedate=30 April 2011 }}</ref> It is probable that Sheffield's [[parish church]], a satellite of [[Worksop Priory]], was constructed here in the 12th century by [[William de Lovetot]] at the opposite end of the town to [[Sheffield Castle]]. This established the area of the [[parish]] of Sheffield, unchanged until the 19th century. This church was burnt down in 1266 during the [[Second Barons' War]] against [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].\n\nAnother parish church was completed in 1280, but this church was mostly demolished and rebuilt about 1430 on a [[cruciform]] floor plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was added in the next century, and a [[vestry]] chapel (now the Chapel of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Katherine]]) was added in 1777. The north and south walls of the nave were rebuilt in 1790\u201393 and a [[Victorian restoration|major restoration]] by [[Flockton & Gibbs]], which included the addition of new north and south [[transepts]], was completed in 1880. The church was originally dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], but from some time after the [[English Reformation|reformation]] into the 19th century it was dedicated to [[Holy Trinity]];<ref name=\"hunter\">{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Joseph |title=Hallamshire. The History and Topography of the Parish of Sheffield in the County of York |publisher=Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mayor & Jones |location=London |year=1819 |pages=139, 153, 294}}</ref> it has since been dedicated to both Saint Peter and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]].\n\nThe parish of Sheffield was subdivided into smaller parishes in 1848. The church is still the parish church for the smaller Parish of Sheffield, but in 1914 it was also made the cathedral church for the newly created Diocese of Sheffield. Plans were drafted by [[Sir Charles Nicholson, 2nd Baronet|Charles Nicholson]] to extend the church and reorient it on its axis, but due to [[World War II]] these were greatly scaled down. The resulting additions leave the church an awkward shape in plan, but with an impressive south elevation.\n\nOn Thursday 2 April 2015, the [[Royal Maundy]] service was held in Sheffield Cathedral. [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] distributed specially-minted Maundy money to 89 men and 89 women.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-32152147 |title=Queen hosts Maundy service at Sheffield Cathedral |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Art and architecture==\n[[Image:SheffieldLanternTower.jpg|thumb|left|The lantern tower]]\n[[Image:Sheffield Cathedral St George Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|Screen of bayonets and swords in St George's Chapel]]\n\nThe east end of the current church is the oldest. In the east wall of the sanctuary there are stones from the 13th-century church. Dating from the 15th century are the sanctuary and chancel. The 15th-century [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]] also included lofts and a rood chapel but these were ordered to be removed by Elizabeth I.<ref name=\"odom\">{{cite book |author=Odom, W. |title=Memorials of Sheffield |publisher=J.

The outstretched wings are a modern gift from the 1960s by George Bailey.\n\nIn the 1770s, rebuilding included the addition of tracery into the windows and a resurfacing of the walls with moorstone.<ref name=\"odom\" /> The addition of the vestry chapel of St Katherine destroyed the cruciform shape of the plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was constructed in order to house the Tudor monuments of the [[Earl of Shrewsbury|Earls of Shrewsbury]].\n\nThe altarpiece in this chapel is considered medieval in date. On the south wall of the Shrewsbury Chapel is the alabaster monument to [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]] with its architectural surround, armoured effigy, and Latin inscription. Several members of the family are buried in the vault. The monument on the left towards the sanctuary is to [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury]]. It is made of fine marble, carved in an Italian style to depict the Earl and his two wives in positions of prayer. They are both fine examples of Tudor monuments. The east window is a monument to [[James Montgomery (poet)|James Montgomery]].\n[[File:Sheffield Parish Church 1819.jpg|thumb|left|Sheffield Parish Church in 1819]]\n[[File:Sheffield Cathedral nave.jpg|thumb|right|Sheffield Cathedral nave in 2019]]\n\nIn the 1880s further reconstruction and rebuilding removed the galleries, moved the organ to the north transept to clear the chancel, and installed new oak pews.<ref name=\"pevsner\"/> The north and south transepts and west end were extended. A screen was constructed by local craftsmen for the Shrewsbury Chapel but was modified and moved to the north aisle in the 1900s.<ref name=\"pevsner\" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Jarvis |first=A. C. E. |title=A Guide to the Additions to the Fabric of the Cathedral Church of S. Peter and S.

However, funds and World Wars forced the designs to change. Those changes were implemented throughout the 20th century. The bulk of the changes have affected the northern part of the cathedral, which was extensively expanded. Immediately to the north of the nave is the chapel of Saint George, which commemorates the [[York and Lancaster Regiment]]. It is furnished with regiment flags and a screen made up of the bayonets and swords of the first regiment. Under the chapel of St George is the vaulted crypt chapel of All Saints and the Te Deum window, which was designed by [[Christopher Webb]]. At the furthest north end is the Chapel of the Holy Spirit with a four-part vaulting system and a beautifully painted screen. The main entrance of the church is at the expanded west end, added in 1966 when the church was rededicated. The baptism font is at this end. The [[Roof lantern|lantern tower]] was an earlier addition to improve light but its glass was replaced by an abstract design designed by [[Amber Hiscott]] in 1998\u201399. In September 2010 it was announced that the cathedral would be applying for a \u00a3980,000 [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant to fund a \u00a31.25 million scheme to make the building more attractive to visitors.<ref name=\"mvc\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-11442729 |work=BBC News|title=Sheffield Cathedral aims for \u00a3980,000 lottery grant |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Dean and chapter==\nAs of 2 January 2020:<ref>[http://www.sheffieldcathedral.org/team/] (Accessed 2 January 2020)</ref>\n*[[Dean of Sheffield|Dean]] \u2014 [[Peter Bradley (priest)|Peter Bradley]] (since 2003 installation)\n*Vice-Dean &amp; Canon Missioner \u2014 Keith Farrow (Canon &amp; Missioner since March 2014; Vice-Dean since 1 December 2019)<ref>[https://www.sheffieldcathedral.org/news/2019/11/18/vice-dean-of-sheffield-cathedral]</ref>\n*Canon Precentor \u2014 vacant since [[Chris Burke (priest)|Chris Burke]]'s 2019 collation as [[Archdeacon of Barking]]\n*vacancy \u2014 since Burke's 2013 move from Canon Residentiary \"for Learning and Development\" to Precentor\n*vacancy \u2014 since [[Joanne Grenfell]]'s 2013 collation as [[Archdeacon of Portsdown]]; she was a [[Diocesan Canon]] as [[Diocesan Director of Ordinands|DDO]]\n\n==Organs and organists==\n===Organ===\nThe pipe organ by [[Mander Organs|N.

The shaft of the 9th-century [[Sheffield Cross]], believed to have formerly been sited here, is now held by the [[British Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/stone_cross_shaft.aspx |title=Stone cross shaft |accessdate=6 December 2013 |work=British Museum |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430144349/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/stone_cross_shaft.aspx |archivedate=30 April 2011 }}</ref> It is probable that Sheffield's [[parish church]], a satellite of [[Worksop Priory]], was constructed here in the 12th century by [[William de Lovetot]] at the opposite end of the town to [[Sheffield Castle]]. This established the area of the [[parish]] of Sheffield, unchanged until the 19th century. This church was burnt down in 1266 during the [[Second Barons' War]] against [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].\n\nAnother parish church was completed in 1280, but this church was mostly demolished and rebuilt about 1430 on a [[cruciform]] floor plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was added in the next century, and a [[vestry]] chapel (now the Chapel of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Katherine]]) was added in 1777. The north and south walls of the nave were rebuilt in 1790\u201393 and a [[Victorian restoration|major restoration]] by [[Flockton & Gibbs]], which included the addition of new north and south [[transepts]], was completed in 1880. The church was originally dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], but from some time after the [[English Reformation|reformation]] into the 19th century it was dedicated to [[Holy Trinity]];<ref name=\"hunter\">{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Joseph |title=Hallamshire. The History and Topography of the Parish of Sheffield in the County of York |publisher=Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mayor & Jones |location=London |year=1819 |pages=139, 153, 294}}</ref> it has since been dedicated to both Saint Peter and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]].\n\nThe parish of Sheffield was subdivided into smaller parishes in 1848. The church is still the parish church for the smaller Parish of Sheffield, but in 1914 it was also made the cathedral church for the newly created Diocese of Sheffield. Plans were drafted by [[Sir Charles Nicholson, 2nd Baronet|Charles Nicholson]] to extend the church and reorient it on its axis, but due to [[World War II]] these were greatly scaled down. The resulting additions leave the church an awkward shape in plan, but with an impressive south elevation.\n\nOn Thursday 2 April 2015, the [[Royal Maundy]] service was held in Sheffield Cathedral. [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] distributed specially-minted Maundy money to 89 men and 89 women.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-32152147 |title=Queen hosts Maundy service at Sheffield Cathedral |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Art and architecture==\n[[Image:SheffieldLanternTower.jpg|thumb|left|The lantern tower]]\n[[Image:Sheffield Cathedral St George Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|Screen of bayonets and swords in St George's Chapel]]\n\nThe east end of the current church is the oldest. In the east wall of the sanctuary there are stones from the 13th-century church. Dating from the 15th century are the sanctuary and chancel. The 15th-century [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]] also included lofts and a rood chapel but these were ordered to be removed by Elizabeth I.<ref name=\"odom\">{{cite book |author=Odom, W. |title=Memorials of Sheffield |publisher=J.

The outstretched wings are a modern gift from the 1960s by George Bailey.\n\nIn the 1770s, rebuilding included the addition of tracery into the windows and a resurfacing of the walls with moorstone.<ref name=\"odom\" /> The addition of the vestry chapel of St Katherine destroyed the cruciform shape of the plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was constructed in order to house the Tudor monuments of the [[Earl of Shrewsbury|Earls of Shrewsbury]].\n\nThe altarpiece in this chapel is considered medieval in date. On the south wall of the Shrewsbury Chapel is the alabaster monument to [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]] with its architectural surround, armoured effigy, and Latin inscription. Several members of the family are buried in the vault. The monument on the left towards the sanctuary is to [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury]]. It is made of fine marble, carved in an Italian style to depict the Earl and his two wives in positions of prayer. They are both fine examples of Tudor monuments. The east window is a monument to [[James Montgomery (poet)|James Montgomery]].\n[[File:Sheffield Parish Church 1819.jpg|thumb|left|Sheffield Parish Church in 1819]]\n[[File:Sheffield Cathedral nave.jpg|thumb|right|Sheffield Cathedral nave in 2019]]\n\nIn the 1880s further reconstruction and rebuilding removed the galleries, moved the organ to the north transept to clear the chancel, and installed new oak pews.<ref name=\"pevsner\"/> The north and south transepts and west end were extended. A screen was constructed by local craftsmen for the Shrewsbury Chapel but was modified and moved to the north aisle in the 1900s.<ref name=\"pevsner\" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Jarvis |first=A. C.

However, funds and World Wars forced the designs to change. Those changes were implemented throughout the 20th century. The bulk of the changes have affected the northern part of the cathedral, which was extensively expanded. Immediately to the north of the nave is the chapel of Saint George, which commemorates the [[York and Lancaster Regiment]]. It is furnished with regiment flags and a screen made up of the bayonets and swords of the first regiment. Under the chapel of St George is the vaulted crypt chapel of All Saints and the Te Deum window, which was designed by [[Christopher Webb]]. At the furthest north end is the Chapel of the Holy Spirit with a four-part vaulting system and a beautifully painted screen. The main entrance of the church is at the expanded west end, added in 1966 when the church was rededicated. The baptism font is at this end. The [[Roof lantern|lantern tower]] was an earlier addition to improve light but its glass was replaced by an abstract design designed by [[Amber Hiscott]] in 1998\u201399. In September 2010 it was announced that the cathedral would be applying for a \u00a3980,000 [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant to fund a \u00a31.25 million scheme to make the building more attractive to visitors.<ref name=\"mvc\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-11442729 |work=BBC News|title=Sheffield Cathedral aims for \u00a3980,000 lottery grant |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Dean and chapter==\nAs of 2 January 2020:<ref>[http://www.sheffieldcathedral.org/team/] (Accessed 2 January 2020)</ref>\n*[[Dean of Sheffield|Dean]] \u2014 [[Peter Bradley (priest)|Peter Bradley]] (since 2003 installation)\n*Vice-Dean &amp; Canon Missioner \u2014 Keith Farrow (Canon &amp; Missioner since March 2014; Vice-Dean since 1 December 2019)<ref>[https://www.sheffieldcathedral.org/news/2019/11/18/vice-dean-of-sheffield-cathedral]</ref>\n*Canon Precentor \u2014 vacant since [[Chris Burke (priest)|Chris Burke]]'s 2019 collation as [[Archdeacon of Barking]]\n*vacancy \u2014 since Burke's 2013 move from Canon Residentiary \"for Learning and Development\" to Precentor\n*vacancy \u2014 since [[Joanne Grenfell]]'s 2013 collation as [[Archdeacon of Portsdown]]; she was a [[Diocesan Canon]] as [[Diocesan Director of Ordinands|DDO]]\n\n==Organs and organists==\n===Organ===\nThe pipe organ by [[Mander Organs|N.

The treaty prohibits child conscription, ensures that military recruits are no younger than 16, and forbids the use of child recruits in hostilities. The treaty also forbids non-state armed groups from recruiting anyone under the age of 18 for any purpose.<ref name=\":1\" /> Although most states negotiating OPAC supported a ban on recruiting children, some states, led by the US in alliance with the UK, objected to this.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":24\" /> As such, the treaty does not ban the recruitment of children aged 16 or 17, although it allows states to bind themselves to a higher standard in law.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== 2000s-present ====\n\n[[File:Red Hand Day - Kinder sind keine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|[[Red Hand Day]], the International Day Against Use of Child Soldiers, is often marked by displaying red handprints.]]\n\nAfter the adoption of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, a campaign for global ratification made swift progress.<ref name=\":02\" /> As of 2018 OPAC had been ratified by 167 states.<ref name=\":20\" /> The campaign also successfully encouraged many states not to recruit children at all. In 2001 83 states only allowed adult enlistment, by 2016 this had increased to 126, which is 71 percent of countries with armed forces.<ref name=\":5\" /> Approximately 60 non-state armed groups have also entered agreements to stop or scale back their use of children, often brokered by the UN or the NGO [[Geneva Call]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nChild Soldiers International reports that the success of the OPAC treaty, combined with the gradual decline in child recruitment by state armed forces, has led to a reduction of children in military organisations worldwide.<ref name=\":5\" /> {{as of|2018}} the recruitment and use of children remains widespread. In particular, militant Islamist organisations such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] and [[Boko Haram]], as well as armed groups fighting them, have used children extensively.<ref name=\":19\" /> In addition, the three most populous states \u2013 China, India and the United States \u2013 still allow their armed forces to enlist children aged 16 or 17, as do five of the Group of Seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, again.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Events ===\n[[Red Hand Day]] (also known as the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers) on 12{{nbsp}}February is an annual commemoration day to draw public attention to the practice of using children as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts.

Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]].

Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]]. Vidyapati influenced the religious literature of Asama, Bangal, Utkala and gave birth to a new [[Brajabuli]] language.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe earliest reference to Maithili or Tirhutiya is in Amaduzzi's preface to Beligatti's ''Alphabetum Brammhanicum'', published in 1771.<ref name=\"Tourutiana\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Djfl_uZqLAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tourutiana&f=false |last=Ded.

It blocked its membership for people outside from the Maithil Brahmin and Karna Kayastha castes. Maithil Mahasabha campaigned for the official recognition of Maithili as a regional language.

(registered on {{start date|df=yes|1882|11|16}}) on {{start date|df=yes|1886|8|16}} allowing rail access to the lead mining workings around the village of [[Foxdale, Isle of Man|Foxdale]].  The company had close ties to the [[Manx Northern Railway]] (MNR), many of whose directors were also on the board of the smaller company. The line was leased from the outset by the MNR.\n\nShortly after the line had opened, the lead mining industry started to decline and in {{end date|df=yes|1891|7}} the Foxdale company went into [[liquidation]]. The fortunes of the MNR were closely tied to the Foxdale line due to the terms of the lease being favourable to the smaller concern. Much of the MNR's freight revenue originated in Foxdale, with loaded wagons of lead being transported to the harbour in Ramsey and coal and mine supplies ferried back to the mines.\n\nThe MNR operated the line on behalf of the liquidators until, following an investigation by a  [[Tynwald]] committee, the [[Isle of Man Railway]] (IMR) took over all operations on the MNR including the Foxdale line on {{start date|df=yes|1904|2|26}}. The IMR was then authorised to purchase both the MNR and the Foxdale line a few months later on {{start date|df=yes|1905|4|19}}.\n\n== Decline and closure ==\n\nThe last lead mine in the area closed in 1911 and from then on only spoil trains and the infrequent passenger and general goods services used the line. From {{start date|df=yes|1912|6|3}}, tickets were no longer sold at Foxdale station, the station building being converted into a private dwelling during the 1920s. The last regular passenger train worked the branch in 1940, after which the service was replaced by buses. The line saw some troop specials during the [[Second World War]] as well as spoil trains and the occasional passenger service, run due to bus shortages. The last train reported to have used the branch was an engineering working in {{end date|df=yes|1960|1}} which removed rails and other material from Foxdale to be used elsewhere on the system. The rails were finally removed during the mid-1970s and much of the route is now a [[List of rail trails|designated public walkway]].\n\nToday, the station building at St. John's is still in place but now a private dwelling, similarly at the other end of the line the station is extant, but now forms part of a youth club for local children.  The stanchions of the former [[viaduct]] also remain in place and there are still some rails visible in the road at the outer terminus. It is little known that the famous Scissors crossing behind the station is actually still in situ to this day, although unknown to most people as it was buried underneath a bank of hardcore from the mines(there are actually images  which shows this happening). This possibly means that Foxdale has the distinction of being the station on the IoM's closed network which still has most of the original station trackwork surviving!\n\n==The route and services==\nThe line ran from an end-on junction with the MNR west of St. John's, then passed to the north of the IMR station before curving south and crossing the IMR's line from Douglas via an overbridge (the only place where railway crossed railway on the Isle of Man unless one counts the 19-inch gauge Great Laxey Mines Railway tunnel under the Manx Electric Railway) to the east of the station. The line had a fairly constant incline through [[Waterfall railway station (Isle of Man)|Waterfall Halt]], the only intermediate station, to the terminus in Upper Foxdale. The tracks extended beyond Foxdale into the mine workings area. There were at one time plans to extend the line to join with the IMR's Port Erin line at [[Ballasalla railway station|Ballasalla]], but these came to nothing.\n\nThe railway initially used the MNR station at St. John's, situated to the west of the IMR station. Later, in 1886, the MNR abandoned this and built a new platform and station building on the alignment of the Foxdale Railway more closely adjacent to the IMR station. Foxdale line trains used this facility until 1927, after which trains reversed in and out of the IMR station.\n\nUpon the opening of the railway, the MNR ran some services from Ramsey to Foxdale, but passenger traffic on the line was always light and these services gave way to local shuttles between St. John's and Foxdale. Latterly, passenger services consisted of a loco and one coach. The coach used was specifically made for the branch and survives today (see [[Isle of Man Railway rolling stock#The Foxdale Coach|The Foxdale Coach]]).\n\nThe MNR purchased a more powerful locomotive to work goods services over the branch and its steep gradients (see [[Isle of Man Railway locomotives#No. 15 \"Caledonia\"|Caledonia]]).\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Foxdale]]\n*[[Manx Northern Railway]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book\n| author = Anon.\n| title = Railways in the Isle of Man\n| publisher = The Isle of Man Tourist Board\n| year = 1968\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n| last = Heavyside\n| first = Tom\n| publisher = Middleton Press\n| title = Narrow Gauge Branch Lines Douglas to Ramsey\n| year = 2004\n| isbn=1-904474-39-X\n}}\n\n[[Category:Railway lines in the Isle of Man]]\n[[Category:3 ft gauge railways in the Isle of Man]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2017}}\n{{coord|54.201|-4.639|display=title|region:IM_type:railwaystation}}\nThe '''Foxdale Railway''' was a {{RailGauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] branch line which ran from [[St. John's railway station|St. John's]] to [[Foxdale railway station|Foxdale]]<ref>{{coord|54.169|-4.639|display=inline|region:GB_scale:10000}}</ref> on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Foxdale Railway 1888.jpg|thumb|Share of the Foxdale Railway Company Ltd, issued 1888]]\nThe line was officially opened by the Foxdale Railway Company Ltd.

As its work involved interference with the private affairs of residents it was unpopular with property owners and with the Chinese generally. It could however only make proposals. Their implementation was a matter for the Government.\n\nOriginally it consisted solely of official members but subsequently provision was made for nominated unofficial members, and two members elected by ratepayers on the special and common jury lists.\n\nOf the 669 persons on the jury lists for the year, 187 voted.<ref name=\"hkupress\"/>\n\nIt was the first ever election held in the history of Hong Kong. The elections continued as the Sanitary Board transformed into the Urban Council in 1936 and marked the beginning of the Hong Kong constitutional reform in the post-war period. The ''[[Daily Press (Hong Kong)|Daily Press]]'' hailed the occasion saying the day would be ranked as a day of note by the future historians of Hong Kong; for the first time the ratepayers of the Colony had been given a voice in the management of their own affairs.<ref name=\"hkupress\">{{cite book|author1=George B.

As its work involved interference with the private affairs of residents it was unpopular with property owners and with the Chinese generally. It could however only make proposals. Their implementation was a matter for the Government.\n\nOriginally it consisted solely of official members but subsequently provision was made for nominated unofficial members, and two members elected by ratepayers on the special and common jury lists.\n\nOf the 669 persons on the jury lists for the year, 187 voted.<ref name=\"hkupress\"/>\n\nIt was the first ever election held in the history of Hong Kong.

It is held each year on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's Famous Corporation]]'s original, and best-known restaurant at the corner of Surf and [[Stillwell Avenue]]s in [[Coney Island]], a  neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].\n\nThe contest has gained public attention in recent years due to the stardom of [[Takeru Kobayashi]] and [[Joey Chestnut]]. The defending men's champion is Joey Chestnut, who ate 71 hot dogs in the 2019 contest. The defending women's champion is [[Miki Sudo]], who ate 31 hot dogs in the 2019 contest.\n\n== Rules ==\n\n[[File:NathansHotDog-5_(48034119781).jpg|thumb|[[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] original [[Coney Island]] location]]\n\n[[Major League Eating]] (MLE), sanctioned by the [[International Federation of Competitive Eating]] (IFOCE), has sanctioned the event since 1997. Today, only entrants currently under contract by MLE can compete in the contest.\n\nThe field of about 20 contestants typically includes the following:\n\n* the defending champion;\n* winners of a regional qualifying contest for that season;\n* individuals qualifying as one of two [[Wild card (sports)|wildcards]] (highest two average qualifier scores without winning a single qualifier); and\n* those invited by special invitation of the MLE. ''(See [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest#Controversies|\"Controversies\" section]] below.)''\n\nThe competitors stand on a raised platform behind a long table with drinks and Nathan's Famous hot dogs in buns. Most contestants have water on hand, but other kinds of drinks can and have been used. Condiments are allowed, but usually are not used. The hot dogs are allowed to cool slightly after grilling to prevent possible mouth burns. The contestant that consumes (and keeps down) the most hot dogs and buns (HDB) in ten minutes is declared the winner. The length of the contest has changed over the years, previously 12 minutes, and in some years, only three and a half minutes; since 2008, 10 minutes.\n\nSpectators watch and cheer the eaters on from close proximity. A designated scorekeeper is paired with each contestant, flipping a number board counting each hot dog consumed. Partially eaten hot dogs count and the [[granularity]] of measurement is eighths of a length. Hot dogs still in the mouth at the end of regulation count if they are subsequently swallowed. [[Penalty card#Yellow card|Yellow penalty cards]] can be issued for \"messy eating,\"<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\">{{Cite episode| title=2011 Hot Dog Eating Contest (Live Television Broadcast)| network= ESPN| airdate = 2011-07-04|series=Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest}}</ref> and red penalty cards can be issued for \"[[regurgitation (digestion)|reversal of fortune]]\", which results in disqualification.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/> If there is a tie, the contestants go to a 5-hot-dog eat-off to see who can eat that many more quickly. Further ties will result in a sudden-death eat-off of eating one more hot dog in the fastest time.\n\nAfter the winner is declared, a plate showing the number of hot dogs eaten by the winner is brought out for photo opportunities.\n\n==Awards==\nThe winner of the men's competition is given possession of the coveted international \"bejeweled\" mustard-yellow belt. The belt is of \"unknown age and value\" according to IFOCE co-founder George Shea and rests in the country of its owner. In 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] won the inaugural women's competition and its \"bejeweled\" pink belt.\n\nVarious other prizes have been awarded over the years. For example, in 2004 [[Orbitz]] donated a travel package to the winner. Starting in 2007, cash prizes have been awarded to the top finishers.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the [[Nathan's Famous|original location]] on [[Coney Island]] most years since about 1972, usually in conjunction with [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web| url=http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts| title=Famous Facts| publisher=Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs| accessdate=December 11, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080803005044/http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts |archivedate = August 3, 2008}}</ref> Nathan's promoter Mortimer Matz claimed that on July 4, 1916, four immigrants held a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's Famous stand on Coney Island to settle an argument about who was the most [[patriotism|patriotic]]. He also made the spurious claim that the contest has been held each year since then except 1941 (\"as a protest to the war in Europe\") and 1971 (as a protest to political unrest in the U.S.).

In 2001, Kobayashi transformed the competition and the world of competitive eating by downing 50 hot dogs\u2014smashing the previous record of 25.5. The Japanese eater introduced advanced eating and training techniques that shattered previous [[competitive eating]] world records. The rise in popularity of the event coincided with the surge in popularity of the worldwide competitive eating circuit.\n\nOn July 4, 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] became the champion of the first Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitney Holtzman |url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/features/article/6721754/nathan-evens-playing-field |title=Nathan's evens playing field |publisher=ESPN |date=2 July 2011| accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref> Previously, women and men had competed against each other, except for one all-female Memorial Day competition held in 1975.<ref name=\"New York Times no. 2\"/> Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural Pepto-Bismol-sponsored pink belt and won $10,000.<ref name=\"First Nathan Champ for Women\">{{cite web\n |title      = Sonya Thomas, The First Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Women's Champion!\n |url        = http://gothamist.com/2011/07/04/first_nathans_hot_dog_eating_contes.php\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171106064124/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/04/first_nathans_hot_dog_eating_contes.php\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2017-11-06\n |publisher  = Gothamist\n |author     = Jen Chung\n |accessdate = 2011-07-04\n}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, a considerable amount of pomp and circumstance have surrounded the days leading up to the event, which has become an annual [[spectacle]] of [[Sports entertainment|competitive entertainment]]. The event is presented on an extravagant stage complete with colorful live announcers and an overall party atmosphere. The day before the contest is a public weigh-in with the [[mayor of New York City]]. Some competitors don flamboyant costumes and/or [[makeup]], while others may promote themselves with eating-related [[List of competitive eaters|nicknames]]. On the morning of the event, they have a heralded arrival to Coney Island on the \"bus of champions\" and are called to the stage individually during introductions. In 2013, six-time defending champion [[Joey Chestnut]] was escorted to the stage in a [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chair]].\n\nThe competition draws many spectators and worldwide press coverage. In 2007, an estimated 50,000 came out to witness the event. In 2004 a three-story-high \"Hot Dog Eating Wall of Fame\" was erected at the site of the annual contest. The wall lists past winners, and has a digital clock which counts down the minutes until the next contest. Despite substantial damage suffered at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] due to [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012, the location was repaired, reopened, and the 2013 event was held as scheduled.\n\nESPN has long enjoyed solid ratings from its broadcast of the Hot Dog Eating Contest on Independence Day, and on July 1, 2014, the network announced it had extended its agreement with [[Major League Eating]] and will broadcast the contest through 2024.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-espn-hot-dog-eating-contest-20140701,0,7676919.story |title=ESPN Locks In Hot Dog Eating Contest through 2024 |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> The event continues to be recognized for its power as a marketing tool.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/07/03/nathans-famous-contest-is-fourth-of-july-marketing-magic |title=Nathan's Famous Contest is Fourth of July Marketing Magic |publisher=[[Forbes.com]] |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Controversies ===\n\nControversies usually revolve around supposed breaches of rules that are missed by the judges. For example, [[NY1]] television news editor Phil Ellison reviewed taped footage of the 1999 contest and thought that [[Steve Keiner]] started eating at the count of one, but the judge, [[Michael DeVito|Mike DeVito]]\u2014himself the champion of the 1990, 1993, and 1994 contests\u2014was stationed directly in front of Keiner and disputed it, saying it was incorrect. Keiner ate 21 1/2 dogs, as shown on the Wall of Fame located at Nathan's flagship store at the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in Coney Island. This controversy was created by George Shea, the chief publicist for Nathan's, because it created much more publicity for the contest. Shea assured Keiner at the end of the contest that he would clear the confusion up but never did. Keiner never participated in any advertising or contests set up by Shea because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAnother controversy occurred in 2003 when former [[National Football League|NFL]] player [[William Perry (American football)|William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry]] competed as a celebrity contestant. Though he had won a qualifier by eating twelve hot dogs, he ate only four at the contest, stopping after just five minutes. Shea stated that the celebrity contestant experiment will likely not be repeated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAt the 2007 contest, the results were delayed to review whether defending champion [[Takeru Kobayashi]] had vomited (also known as a \"Roman method incident\" or \"reversal of fortune\") in the final seconds of regulation. Such an incident results in the disqualification of the competitor under the rules of the IFOCE. The judges ruled in Kobayashi's favor. A similar incident occurred involving Kobayashi in 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/rovell/020704.html |title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Accusations hurled at hot dog contest |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> in a victory over [[Eric Booker|Eric \"Badlands\" Booker]].\n\nTakeru Kobayashi has not competed in the contest since 2009 due to his refusal to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating, which is the current sanctioning body of the contest. In 2010, he was arrested by police after attempting to jump on the stage after the contest was over and disrupt the proceedings.

[[Darren Rovell]], of ESPN, has competed in a qualifier.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=rovell/040507|title=Athletes with appetite|publisher=ESPN.com|first=Darren|last=Rovell|accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==Tactics and training==\nEach contestant has his or her own eating method. [[Takeru Kobayashi]] pioneered the \"Solomon Method\" at his first competition in 2001. The Solomon method consists of breaking each hot dog in half, eating the two halves at once, and then eating the bun.\n\n\"Dunking\" is the most prominent method used today. Because buns absorb water, many contestants dunk the buns in water and squeeze them to make them easier to swallow, and slide down the throat more efficiently.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/>\n\nOther methods used include the \"Carlene Pop,\" where the competitor jumps up and down while eating, to force the food down to the stomach.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/> \"Buns & Roses\" is a similar trick, but the eater sways from side to side instead.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/> \"Juliet-ing\" is a cheating method in which players simply throw the hot dog buns over their shoulders.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/>\n\nContestants train and prepare for the event in different ways. Some [[Fasting|fast]], others prefer liquid-only diets before the event. Takeru Kobayashi meditates, drinks water and eats cabbage, then fasts before the event. Several contestants, such as Ed \"Cookie\" Jarvis, aim to be \"hungry, but not too hungry\" and have a light breakfast the morning of the event.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|New York City|Sports}}\n*[[Glutton Bowl]]\n*[[Krystal Square Off]]\n*''[[Horsemen of the Esophagus]]''\n*[[Man v.

It is held each year on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's Famous Corporation]]'s original, and best-known restaurant at the corner of Surf and [[Stillwell Avenue]]s in [[Coney Island]], a  neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].\n\nThe contest has gained public attention in recent years due to the stardom of [[Takeru Kobayashi]] and [[Joey Chestnut]]. The defending men's champion is Joey Chestnut, who ate 71 hot dogs in the 2019 contest. The defending women's champion is [[Miki Sudo]], who ate 31 hot dogs in the 2019 contest.\n\n== Rules ==\n\n[[File:NathansHotDog-5_(48034119781).jpg|thumb|[[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] original [[Coney Island]] location]]\n\n[[Major League Eating]] (MLE), sanctioned by the [[International Federation of Competitive Eating]] (IFOCE), has sanctioned the event since 1997. Today, only entrants currently under contract by MLE can compete in the contest.\n\nThe field of about 20 contestants typically includes the following:\n\n* the defending champion;\n* winners of a regional qualifying contest for that season;\n* individuals qualifying as one of two [[Wild card (sports)|wildcards]] (highest two average qualifier scores without winning a single qualifier); and\n* those invited by special invitation of the MLE. ''(See [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest#Controversies|\"Controversies\" section]] below.)''\n\nThe competitors stand on a raised platform behind a long table with drinks and Nathan's Famous hot dogs in buns. Most contestants have water on hand, but other kinds of drinks can and have been used. Condiments are allowed, but usually are not used. The hot dogs are allowed to cool slightly after grilling to prevent possible mouth burns. The contestant that consumes (and keeps down) the most hot dogs and buns (HDB) in ten minutes is declared the winner. The length of the contest has changed over the years, previously 12 minutes, and in some years, only three and a half minutes; since 2008, 10 minutes.\n\nSpectators watch and cheer the eaters on from close proximity. A designated scorekeeper is paired with each contestant, flipping a number board counting each hot dog consumed. Partially eaten hot dogs count and the [[granularity]] of measurement is eighths of a length. Hot dogs still in the mouth at the end of regulation count if they are subsequently swallowed. [[Penalty card#Yellow card|Yellow penalty cards]] can be issued for \"messy eating,\"<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\">{{Cite episode| title=2011 Hot Dog Eating Contest (Live Television Broadcast)| network= ESPN| airdate = 2011-07-04|series=Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest}}</ref> and red penalty cards can be issued for \"[[regurgitation (digestion)|reversal of fortune]]\", which results in disqualification.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/> If there is a tie, the contestants go to a 5-hot-dog eat-off to see who can eat that many more quickly. Further ties will result in a sudden-death eat-off of eating one more hot dog in the fastest time.\n\nAfter the winner is declared, a plate showing the number of hot dogs eaten by the winner is brought out for photo opportunities.\n\n==Awards==\nThe winner of the men's competition is given possession of the coveted international \"bejeweled\" mustard-yellow belt. The belt is of \"unknown age and value\" according to IFOCE co-founder George Shea and rests in the country of its owner. In 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] won the inaugural women's competition and its \"bejeweled\" pink belt.\n\nVarious other prizes have been awarded over the years. For example, in 2004 [[Orbitz]] donated a travel package to the winner. Starting in 2007, cash prizes have been awarded to the top finishers.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the [[Nathan's Famous|original location]] on [[Coney Island]] most years since about 1972, usually in conjunction with [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web| url=http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts| title=Famous Facts| publisher=Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs| accessdate=December 11, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080803005044/http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts |archivedate = August 3, 2008}}</ref> Nathan's promoter Mortimer Matz claimed that on July 4, 1916, four immigrants held a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's Famous stand on Coney Island to settle an argument about who was the most [[patriotism|patriotic]]. He also made the spurious claim that the contest has been held each year since then except 1941 (\"as a protest to the war in Europe\") and 1971 (as a protest to political unrest in the U.S.). A man by the name of Jim Mullen is said to have won the first contest,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Fagone|date=2007|title=Horsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y7fSMRrkUEC&pg=PT271&dq=%22Jim+Mullen*+is+the+original+hot-dog+champion.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMkeaBtd3NAhXLOz4KHWytARgQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Jim%20Mullen*%20is%20the%20original%20hot-dog%20champion.%22&f=false|publisher=Crown/Archetype |page=215}}</ref> although accounts vary.

In 2001, Kobayashi transformed the competition and the world of competitive eating by downing 50 hot dogs\u2014smashing the previous record of 25.5. The Japanese eater introduced advanced eating and training techniques that shattered previous [[competitive eating]] world records. The rise in popularity of the event coincided with the surge in popularity of the worldwide competitive eating circuit.\n\nOn July 4, 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] became the champion of the first Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitney Holtzman |url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/features/article/6721754/nathan-evens-playing-field |title=Nathan's evens playing field |publisher=ESPN |date=2 July 2011| accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref> Previously, women and men had competed against each other, except for one all-female Memorial Day competition held in 1975.<ref name=\"New York Times no. 2\"/> Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural Pepto-Bismol-sponsored pink belt and won $10,000.<ref name=\"First Nathan Champ for Women\">{{cite web\n |title      = Sonya Thomas, The First Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Women's Champion!\n |url        = http://gothamist.com/2011/07/04/first_nathans_hot_dog_eating_contes.php\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171106064124/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/04/first_nathans_hot_dog_eating_contes.php\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2017-11-06\n |publisher  = Gothamist\n |author     = Jen Chung\n |accessdate = 2011-07-04\n}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, a considerable amount of pomp and circumstance have surrounded the days leading up to the event, which has become an annual [[spectacle]] of [[Sports entertainment|competitive entertainment]]. The event is presented on an extravagant stage complete with colorful live announcers and an overall party atmosphere. The day before the contest is a public weigh-in with the [[mayor of New York City]]. Some competitors don flamboyant costumes and/or [[makeup]], while others may promote themselves with eating-related [[List of competitive eaters|nicknames]]. On the morning of the event, they have a heralded arrival to Coney Island on the \"bus of champions\" and are called to the stage individually during introductions. In 2013, six-time defending champion [[Joey Chestnut]] was escorted to the stage in a [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chair]].\n\nThe competition draws many spectators and worldwide press coverage. In 2007, an estimated 50,000 came out to witness the event. In 2004 a three-story-high \"Hot Dog Eating Wall of Fame\" was erected at the site of the annual contest. The wall lists past winners, and has a digital clock which counts down the minutes until the next contest. Despite substantial damage suffered at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] due to [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012, the location was repaired, reopened, and the 2013 event was held as scheduled.\n\nESPN has long enjoyed solid ratings from its broadcast of the Hot Dog Eating Contest on Independence Day, and on July 1, 2014, the network announced it had extended its agreement with [[Major League Eating]] and will broadcast the contest through 2024.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-espn-hot-dog-eating-contest-20140701,0,7676919.story |title=ESPN Locks In Hot Dog Eating Contest through 2024 |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> The event continues to be recognized for its power as a marketing tool.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/07/03/nathans-famous-contest-is-fourth-of-july-marketing-magic |title=Nathan's Famous Contest is Fourth of July Marketing Magic |publisher=[[Forbes.com]] |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Controversies ===\n\nControversies usually revolve around supposed breaches of rules that are missed by the judges. For example, [[NY1]] television news editor Phil Ellison reviewed taped footage of the 1999 contest and thought that [[Steve Keiner]] started eating at the count of one, but the judge, [[Michael DeVito|Mike DeVito]]\u2014himself the champion of the 1990, 1993, and 1994 contests\u2014was stationed directly in front of Keiner and disputed it, saying it was incorrect. Keiner ate 21 1/2 dogs, as shown on the Wall of Fame located at Nathan's flagship store at the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in Coney Island. This controversy was created by George Shea, the chief publicist for Nathan's, because it created much more publicity for the contest. Shea assured Keiner at the end of the contest that he would clear the confusion up but never did. Keiner never participated in any advertising or contests set up by Shea because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAnother controversy occurred in 2003 when former [[National Football League|NFL]] player [[William Perry (American football)|William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry]] competed as a celebrity contestant. Though he had won a qualifier by eating twelve hot dogs, he ate only four at the contest, stopping after just five minutes. Shea stated that the celebrity contestant experiment will likely not be repeated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAt the 2007 contest, the results were delayed to review whether defending champion [[Takeru Kobayashi]] had vomited (also known as a \"Roman method incident\" or \"reversal of fortune\") in the final seconds of regulation. Such an incident results in the disqualification of the competitor under the rules of the IFOCE. The judges ruled in Kobayashi's favor. A similar incident occurred involving Kobayashi in 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/rovell/020704.html |title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Accusations hurled at hot dog contest |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> in a victory over [[Eric Booker|Eric \"Badlands\" Booker]].\n\nTakeru Kobayashi has not competed in the contest since 2009 due to his refusal to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating, which is the current sanctioning body of the contest.

[[Darren Rovell]], of ESPN, has competed in a qualifier.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=rovell/040507|title=Athletes with appetite|publisher=ESPN.com|first=Darren|last=Rovell|accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\n==Tactics and training==\nEach contestant has his or her own eating method. [[Takeru Kobayashi]] pioneered the \"Solomon Method\" at his first competition in 2001. The Solomon method consists of breaking each hot dog in half, eating the two halves at once, and then eating the bun.\n\n\"Dunking\" is the most prominent method used today. Because buns absorb water, many contestants dunk the buns in water and squeeze them to make them easier to swallow, and slide down the throat more efficiently.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/>\n\nOther methods used include the \"Carlene Pop,\" where the competitor jumps up and down while eating, to force the food down to the stomach.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/> \"Buns & Roses\" is a similar trick, but the eater sways from side to side instead.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/> \"Juliet-ing\" is a cheating method in which players simply throw the hot dog buns over their shoulders.<ref name=\"2011 ESPN broadcast\"/>\n\nContestants train and prepare for the event in different ways. Some [[Fasting|fast]], others prefer liquid-only diets before the event. Takeru Kobayashi meditates, drinks water and eats cabbage, then fasts before the event. Several contestants, such as Ed \"Cookie\" Jarvis, aim to be \"hungry, but not too hungry\" and have a light breakfast the morning of the event.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|New York City|Sports}}\n*[[Glutton Bowl]]\n*[[Krystal Square Off]]\n*''[[Horsemen of the Esophagus]]''\n*[[Man v.
