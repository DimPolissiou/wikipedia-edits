It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained.

The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained.
