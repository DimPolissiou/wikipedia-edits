The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThe first artist to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor) for ''TV Comic'' was Neville Main. And Main also wrote the stories - so is also the first writer to publish a non-TV based ''Doctor Who'' story. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThe first artist to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor) for ''TV Comic'' was Neville Main. And Main also wrote the stories - so is also the first writer to publish a non-TV based ''Doctor Who'' story. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

He is best known for his work in [[lattice theory]].\n\nThe mathematician [[George Birkhoff]] (1884&ndash;1944) was his father.\n\n==Life==\nThe son of the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]], Garrett was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref>Staff. [https://library.ias.edu/files/pdfs/hs/cos.pdf#page=90 ''A COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS: The Institute for Advanced Study Faculty and Members 1930-1980''], p. 90. [[Institute for Advanced Study]], 1980. Accessed November 20, 2015. \"Birkhoff, Garrett 40s M Born 1911 Princeton, NJ.\"</ref> He began the [[Harvard University]] BA course in 1928 after less than seven years of prior formal education. Upon completing his Harvard BA in 1932, he went to [[Cambridge University]] in England to study [[mathematical physics]] but switched to studying [[abstract algebra]] under [[Philip Hall]]. While visiting the [[University of Munich]], he met [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory|Carath\u00e9odory]] who pointed him towards two important texts, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|Van der Waerden]] on [[abstract algebra]] and [[Andreas Speiser|Speiser]] on [[group theory]].\n\nBirkhoff held no Ph.D., a qualification British higher education did not emphasize at that time, and did not even bother obtaining an M.A. Nevertheless, after being a member of Harvard's [[Society of Fellows]], 1933&ndash;36, he spent the rest of his career teaching at Harvard. From these facts can be inferred the number and quality of Birkhoff's papers published by his 25th year.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Birkhoff, along with his Harvard colleagues [[Marshall Stone]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], substantially advanced American teaching and research in [[abstract algebra]]. In 1941 he and Mac Lane published ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'', the second undergraduate textbook in English on the subject ([[Cyrus Colton MacDuffee]]'s ''An Introduction to Abstract Algebra'' was published in 1940). Mac Lane and Birkhoff's ''Algebra'' (1967) is a more advanced text on [[abstract algebra]]. A number of papers he wrote in the 1930s, culminating in his monograph, ''Lattice Theory'' (1940; the third edition remains in print), turned [[lattice theory]] into a major branch of [[abstract algebra]]. His 1935 paper, \"On the Structure of Abstract Algebras\" founded a new branch of mathematics, [[universal algebra]]. Birkhoff's approach to this development of universal algebra and lattice theory acknowledged prior ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]; in fact, Whitehead had written an 1898 monograph entitled ''Universal Algebra''. Further, in 1935, Birkhoff showed that any equivalence between expressions that holds for all possible forms of operator subject to some equational axioms must have a finite proof using certain underlying rules about equality. However, frequently it remains [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] whether or not a particular equivalence holds (for the reason that the proofs can become very long).<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1172 1172]|isbn=1-57955-008-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1172}}</ref>\n\nDuring and after [[World War II]], Birkhoff's interests gravitated towards what he called \"engineering\" mathematics. During the war, he worked on radar aiming and ballistics, including the [[bazooka]]. In the development of weapons, mathematical questions arose, some of which had not yet been addressed by the literature on [[fluid dynamics]]. Birkhoff's research was presented in his texts on fluid dynamics, ''Hydrodynamics'' (1950) and ''Jets, Wakes and Cavities'' (1957).\n\nBirkhoff, a friend of [[John von Neumann]], took a close interest in the rise of the electronic computer. Birkhoff supervised the Ph.D. thesis of [[David M. Young, Jr.|David M. Young]] on the numerical solution of [[Poisson's equation|the partial differential equation of Poisson]], in which Young proposed the [[successive over-relaxation]] (SOR) method. Birkhoff then worked with [[Richard S. Varga]], a former student, who was employed at [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]] of the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electronic Corporation]] in Pittsburgh and was helping to design nuclear reactors. Extending the results of Young, the Birkhoff\u2013Varga collaboration led to many publications on [[positive operator]]s and [[iterative method]]s for ''p''-cyclic matrices.\n\nBirkhoff's research and consulting work (notably for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]) developed computational methods besides numerical linear algebra, notably the representation of smooth curves via [[cubic spline]]s.\n\nBirkhoff published more than 200 papers and supervised more than 50 Ph.D.s. He was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] for the academic year 1948\u20131949 and the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics#Presidents|president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] for 1966\u20131968.

He is best known for his work in [[lattice theory]].\n\nThe mathematician [[George Birkhoff]] (1884&ndash;1944) was his father.\n\n==Life==\nThe son of the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]], Garrett was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref>Staff. [https://library.ias.edu/files/pdfs/hs/cos.pdf#page=90 ''A COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS: The Institute for Advanced Study Faculty and Members 1930-1980''], p. 90. [[Institute for Advanced Study]], 1980. Accessed November 20, 2015. \"Birkhoff, Garrett 40s M Born 1911 Princeton, NJ.\"</ref> He began the [[Harvard University]] BA course in 1928 after less than seven years of prior formal education. Upon completing his Harvard BA in 1932, he went to [[Cambridge University]] in England to study [[mathematical physics]] but switched to studying [[abstract algebra]] under [[Philip Hall]]. While visiting the [[University of Munich]], he met [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory|Carath\u00e9odory]] who pointed him towards two important texts, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|Van der Waerden]] on [[abstract algebra]] and [[Andreas Speiser|Speiser]] on [[group theory]].\n\nBirkhoff held no Ph.D., a qualification British higher education did not emphasize at that time, and did not even bother obtaining an M.A. Nevertheless, after being a member of Harvard's [[Society of Fellows]], 1933&ndash;36, he spent the rest of his career teaching at Harvard. From these facts can be inferred the number and quality of Birkhoff's papers published by his 25th year.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Birkhoff, along with his Harvard colleagues [[Marshall Stone]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], substantially advanced American teaching and research in [[abstract algebra]]. In 1941 he and Mac Lane published ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'', the second undergraduate textbook in English on the subject ([[Cyrus Colton MacDuffee]]'s ''An Introduction to Abstract Algebra'' was published in 1940). Mac Lane and Birkhoff's ''Algebra'' (1967) is a more advanced text on [[abstract algebra]]. A number of papers he wrote in the 1930s, culminating in his monograph, ''Lattice Theory'' (1940; the third edition remains in print), turned [[lattice theory]] into a major branch of [[abstract algebra]]. His 1935 paper, \"On the Structure of Abstract Algebras\" founded a new branch of mathematics, [[universal algebra]]. Birkhoff's approach to this development of universal algebra and lattice theory acknowledged prior ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]; in fact, Whitehead had written an 1898 monograph entitled ''Universal Algebra''. Further, in 1935, Birkhoff showed that any equivalence between expressions that holds for all possible forms of operator subject to some equational axioms must have a finite proof using certain underlying rules about equality. However, frequently it remains [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] whether or not a particular equivalence holds (for the reason that the proofs can become very long).<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1172 1172]|isbn=1-57955-008-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1172}}</ref>\n\nDuring and after [[World War II]], Birkhoff's interests gravitated towards what he called \"engineering\" mathematics. During the war, he worked on radar aiming and ballistics, including the [[bazooka]]. In the development of weapons, mathematical questions arose, some of which had not yet been addressed by the literature on [[fluid dynamics]]. Birkhoff's research was presented in his texts on fluid dynamics, ''Hydrodynamics'' (1950) and ''Jets, Wakes and Cavities'' (1957).\n\nBirkhoff, a friend of [[John von Neumann]], took a close interest in the rise of the electronic computer. Birkhoff supervised the Ph.D. thesis of [[David M. Young, Jr.|David M. Young]] on the numerical solution of [[Poisson's equation|the partial differential equation of Poisson]], in which Young proposed the [[successive over-relaxation]] (SOR) method. Birkhoff then worked with [[Richard S. Varga]], a former student, who was employed at [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]] of the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electronic Corporation]] in Pittsburgh and was helping to design nuclear reactors. Extending the results of Young, the Birkhoff\u2013Varga collaboration led to many publications on [[positive operator]]s and [[iterative method]]s for ''p''-cyclic matrices.\n\nBirkhoff's research and consulting work (notably for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]) developed computational methods besides numerical linear algebra, notably the representation of smooth curves via [[cubic spline]]s.\n\nBirkhoff published more than 200 papers and supervised more than 50 Ph.D.s. He was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] for the academic year 1948\u20131949 and the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics#Presidents|president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] for 1966\u20131968. He won a [[Lester R. Ford Award]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Birkhoff, Garrett|title=Current trends in algebra|journal=Amer. Math.

The buildings in blue indicate that they are currently under construction.]]\n\nThis '''list of skyscrapers in Taiwan''' ranks [[skyscraper]]s in Taiwan by height. The tallest building in Taiwan is currently the 101\u2013[[Storey|story]] [[Taipei 101]], which rises {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0}} and was completed in 2004. It was officially classified as the world's tallest from 2004 to 2010. Now, it is still the tallest building in Taiwan, [[list of tallest buildings in Asia|Asia's 6th tallest building]], and the [[list of tallest buildings in the world|world's 9th tallest building]]. There are currently six buildings over 200m under construction in Taiwan, including the [[Gate of Taipei| Taipei Twin Tower 1]], which is under planning and will reach {{convert|337|m|ft|0}}, and the [[Taipei Sky Tower]], which is under construction in [[Taipei]] and will reach {{convert|280|m|ft|0}}. \n\nUnlike other Asian countries with numerous skyscrapers exceeding 400 meters in height, Taiwan's skyscrapers are, on average, relatively shorter (except for [[Taipei 101]]). This is because construction is difficult since Taiwan's geographical position is, similar to [[Japan]], located very close to the boundary between the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philipine Plate]], thus it is prone to many earthquakes. Therefore, all buildings above 50 metres must be as earthquake-proof as possible and adhere to numerous strict structural standards set by the government to ensure safety.\n\n==Locations==\n{{Location

The buildings in blue indicate that they are currently under construction.]]\n\nThis '''list of skyscrapers in Taiwan''' ranks [[skyscraper]]s in Taiwan by height. The tallest building in Taiwan is currently the 101\u2013[[Storey|story]] [[Taipei 101]], which rises {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0}} and was completed in 2004. It was officially classified as the world's tallest from 2004 to 2010. Now, it is still the tallest building in Taiwan, [[list of tallest buildings in Asia|Asia's 6th tallest building]], and the [[list of tallest buildings in the world|world's 9th tallest building]]. There are currently six buildings over 200m under construction in Taiwan, including the [[Gate of Taipei| Taipei Twin Tower 1]], which is under planning and will reach {{convert|337|m|ft|0}}, and the [[Taipei Sky Tower]], which is under construction in [[Taipei]] and will reach {{convert|280|m|ft|0}}. \n\nUnlike other Asian countries with numerous skyscrapers exceeding 400 meters in height, Taiwan's skyscrapers are, on average, relatively shorter (except for [[Taipei 101]]). This is because construction is difficult since Taiwan's geographical position is, similar to [[Japan]], located very close to the boundary between the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philipine Plate]], thus it is prone to many earthquakes. Therefore, all buildings above 50 metres must be as earthquake-proof as possible and adhere to numerous strict structural standards set by the government to ensure safety.\n\n==Locations==\n{{Location

He took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore, this is considered a unique avatar. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy Kaliyan and the evil in Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as Dharma yuga.\n\n[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] says, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named [[Avathara Pathi|Avathara pathi]].\n\nGod says this prophecy, \n\n\"I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" \u2013 [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]]\n\nHe had the power to abolish the rule of the evil force Kaliyan from the world and for the subsequent end of Kali yuga. Lord did many mighty miracles. These incude, curing all the diseases for those people who came to get blessing from him. He baught eighteen-caste people together for peace and equality. Lord Vaikundar had five disciples ([[Seedars|Citars]]). According to Akilattirattu, the Pandavas of previous Dwapara yuga were made to take birth in this Kali yuga as Citars of Vaikundar. The holy book [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] was compiled by his fifth citar - Hari Gopalan alias Sahadeva.\n\n==Penance==\n\nIn the name of Vaikundar, Lord came towards Swamithopu as Pantaram. Lord Vaikundar as a Pantaram, had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on forehead, tied a turban on his head and carried a cane. He also revealed that, ''I had born as the son of Narayana for fulfilling the needs of Santror and to rule them forever.\u201d''{{sfn|Ponnu|2002|p=58,59}}After making the proclamations, Vaikundar proceeded towards [[Kanyakumari]]. There he instructed the people to give-up the [[rituals]] and religious ceremonies {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} and reached Poovandanthope .{{sfn|Vivekanandan|2003|p=84}} It appears that few incidents in which he was ill-treated happened on the way.{{sfn|Ponnu|2002|pp=62-63}} On the other hand he was also warmly welcomed at some places.{{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} He was also said to have performed [[miracle]]s at various places through the way {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=37-41}} As per writer Amalan, Vaikundar stayed at [[Udangudi]] on Masi 21 and reached Poovandanthoppe on 22 Masi 1008 M.E. .{{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=43-44}} The news about the Thiruchendur incident spread all around the Villages nearby. After this incident people started calling him devoutly as \u2018Ayya\u2019 {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=44}} means Father in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. He also travelled northwards to various parts of [[Tirunelveli]] to reveal his arrival. He travelled northwards up to [[Kadambankulam]], through Pillaiyar Kudiyiruppu, [[Avaraikulam]], [[Vadakkankulam]], and [[Nizhal Thangal of Pambankulam|Pambankulam]]. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=45-48}} At [[Kadambankulam]], the northernmost venue to which Vaikundar travelled, today stands one among the  rare [[Nizhal Thangal]]s which face geographic north. Vaikundar selected five [[Seedars]]. Two among them, Dharma Seedar and Bheeman Seedar were selected before his northwards travel, Arjunan Seedar was identified during the travel while the remaining two of them, Sahadevan Seedar, and Nakulan Seedar were selected after the travel. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=45-48}}  Though Arjunan Seedar was identified earlier he was selected only afterwards. The episode of his northwards travel was documented  in very few sources.\n\nAfter concluding his travel he returned to [[Swamithope]] by December 1833 {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=51}} and commenced his [[penance]] {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} to get grace and power of Lord Shiva by mid January 1834 {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=51}} during the auspicious month of [[Margazhi]]. It consists of three phases. The first phase of his penance last for two years from January 1843 to December 1835. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=53}} The ''Phase I'' is named [[Yuga]] Thavasu and was intended to abolish the rule of the evil force, Kali and for the subsequent end of Kali Yuga. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} The Yuga Thavasu is performed in a standing posture {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}} within a 6 feet-deep pit. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} During this phase he use to talk less and believed to have taken no food. {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}} The second Phase is dedicated for the elimination of the case based and other discriminations among human communities and for the upliftment of [[The Santror|Santror]]. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} The second phase too lasted for two years beginning on December 1835 till December 1837. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=54}} This phase is performed at the ground level in a sitting posture. {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}} He took only [[rice gruel]] .{{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|pp=45-46}} However, some sources claimed that he took milk and fruits during ''Phase II'' .{{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}}\n\n''Phase III'' of the penance began by January 1838. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=54}}  This last phase is meant for the upliftment of women and for the betterment of his [[offspring|progeny]]. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} Phase III is performed by him on a raised pedestal. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} The last phase too was intended to extend for two complete years but was interrupted by the [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|King of Travancore]]. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=54}}\n\n== Mendicant==\n\nBy this time it is believed that so many miracles began to happen around him and people started believing his as their saviour.{{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}}  The news began to spread like wild-fire and thousands of people from every section of the society {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=46}} from the surrounding villages began to visit Swamithope, believing that their grievances be addressed by him. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} He is believed to have cured various diseases during this period. {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=46}} People witnessed mysterious experience and influence while standing before him {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} Some accounts suggests that attempts were made by the upper classes during this time to dispel his popularity. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=47}} During this time he also believed to have incinerated the [[demon]]s and also seized the power of the [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] etc in front of his devotees.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|pp=80-81}}\n\nVaikundar characterised himself as a [[Mendicant]]. He was addressed by the worshippers as ''\u2018Narayana Pandaram\u2019''.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}}  It was during these days he preached several revolutionary ideas which are considered as historically unparalleled. He emphasized the importance of [[Charity (practice)|Charity]], [[Truth]] and [[love]] and induced these values into the [[ritual]]s.{{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=47}}  Most of his teachings and rituals he advocated has both religious and social implications. Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the inequalities, mainly caste-based, prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as 'Anna Dharmam' , physical as well as spiritual cleanliness through [[Thuvayal Thavasu]],<ref name=\"Mythic society\">{{cite journal|last1=Society|first1=Mythic|title=The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society|date=1986|volume=77|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zBa2AAAAIAAJ&dq=Sami+thope&q=Sami+thope|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> eliminating untouchability through [[Thirunamam|Thottunamam]], self-respect and courage through headgear,{{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|pp=93-96}} and unifying various castes through [[Muthirikkinaru]]. His revolutionary doctrine caused great excitement among the people and prepared them to fight for their rights. (SFSE 48)   During this time he also believed to have incinerated the demons and also seized the power of the [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] etc. in front of his devotees. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|pp=80-81}}\n\n== Arrest ==\n\nThe teachings of Vaikundar created an excitement among the people and it began to reflect in the socio-religious arena of the 19th century South Travancore and South [[Tirunelveli]]. The lower classes began to resist several oppressions all of them until then remained unchallenged.

He, who already had doubts about the [[divinity]] of Vaikundar, intended to test his [[supernatural]] ability {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}} by hiding his ring in his hand and asking him to name it. {{sfn|Ponnu|2002|p=76}} Vaikundar preferred not to answer and to remain silent {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}} The king ordered his imprisonment immediately {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=51}} He was imprisoned in a confinement filled with sewage infested with worms {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}} It is also noted by some that he was asked to take alcohol in which various poisonous herbs  was mixed up.

That night he was kept imprisoned at [[Manalikkara]] .{{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=61}} The next day the soldiers took him to Thiruvananthapuram via [[Balaramapuram]].

However, he continued preaching and healing there too. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=50}} He also said to have performed various miracles at the prison {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=70-71}} Attempts were also made to burn him in lime [[kiln]] and in Chilli go-down. He had overcome all these miraculously. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=67-73}} He was finally thrown into the cage of a hungry [[Tiger]] in front of the administrators, army staff and public. Contrary to the expectation of the officials the tiger did not jump onto its prey. One of the soldiers tried to prod it with a spear in order to provoke it. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=83}} The tiger caught hold of the spear and in no time left it abruptly when the other end of the spear ripped the abdomen of a priest and he died on the spot.

He also directed 700 families to undertake [[Thuvayal Thavasu]], the Washing Penance. They concluded the penance at two Phases. Phase I last for 6 months and was conducted at [[Vakaippathi]] and Phase II lasts another 6 months at Muttapathi. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=79-86}} By the same time the final phase of Tavam of Vaikundar too completed at Poovandanthope. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=86}} After the conclusion of the Tavam he consecrated the [[Muthirikkinaru]], historically the first ever well in South India which was allowed to be used by all castes.

He took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore, this is considered a unique avatar. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy Kaliyan and the evil in Kali Yuga. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as Dharma yuga.\n\n[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] says, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named [[Avathara Pathi|Avathara pathi]].\n\nGod says this prophecy, \n\n\"I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" \u2013 [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]]\n\nHe had the power to abolish the rule of the evil force Kaliyan from the world and for the subsequent end of Kali yuga. Lord did many mighty miracles. These incude, curing all the diseases for those people who came to get blessing from him. He baught eighteen-caste people together for peace and equality. Lord Vaikundar had five disciples ([[Seedars|Citars]]). According to Akilattirattu, the Pandavas of previous Dwapara yuga were made to take birth in this Kali yuga as Citars of Vaikundar. The holy book [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] was compiled by his fifth citar - Hari Gopalan alias Sahadeva.\n\n==Penance==\n\nIn the name of Vaikundar, Lord came towards Swamithopu as Pantaram. Lord Vaikundar as a Pantaram, had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on forehead, tied a turban on his head and carried a cane. He also revealed that, ''I had born as the son of Narayana for fulfilling the needs of Santror and to rule them forever.\u201d''{{sfn|Ponnu|2002|p=58,59}}After making the proclamations, Vaikundar proceeded towards [[Kanyakumari]]. There he instructed the people to give-up the [[rituals]] and religious ceremonies {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} and reached Poovandanthope .{{sfn|Vivekanandan|2003|p=84}} It appears that few incidents in which he was ill-treated happened on the way.{{sfn|Ponnu|2002|pp=62-63}} On the other hand he was also warmly welcomed at some places.{{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} He was also said to have performed [[miracle]]s at various places through the way {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=37-41}} As per writer Amalan, Vaikundar stayed at [[Udangudi]] on Masi 21 and reached Poovandanthoppe on 22 Masi 1008 M.E. .{{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=43-44}} The news about the Thiruchendur incident spread all around the Villages nearby. After this incident people started calling him devoutly as \u2018Ayya\u2019 {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=44}} means Father in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. He also travelled northwards to various parts of [[Tirunelveli]] to reveal his arrival. He travelled northwards up to [[Kadambankulam]], through Pillaiyar Kudiyiruppu, [[Avaraikulam]], [[Vadakkankulam]], and [[Nizhal Thangal of Pambankulam|Pambankulam]]. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=45-48}} At [[Kadambankulam]], the northernmost venue to which Vaikundar travelled, today stands one among the  rare [[Nizhal Thangal]]s which face geographic north. Vaikundar selected five [[Seedars]]. Two among them, Dharma Seedar and Bheeman Seedar were selected before his northwards travel, Arjunan Seedar was identified during the travel while the remaining two of them, Sahadevan Seedar, and Nakulan Seedar were selected after the travel. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=45-48}}  Though Arjunan Seedar was identified earlier he was selected only afterwards. The episode of his northwards travel was documented  in very few sources.\n\nAfter concluding his travel he returned to [[Swamithope]] by December 1833 {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=51}} and commenced his [[penance]] {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} to get grace and power of Lord Shiva by mid January 1834 {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=51}} during the auspicious month of [[Margazhi]]. It consists of three phases. The first phase of his penance last for two years from January 1843 to December 1835. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=53}} The ''Phase I'' is named [[Yuga]] Thavasu and was intended to abolish the rule of the evil force, Kali and for the subsequent end of Kali Yuga. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} The Yuga Thavasu is performed in a standing posture {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}} within a 6 feet-deep pit. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} During this phase he use to talk less and believed to have taken no food. {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}} The second Phase is dedicated for the elimination of the case based and other discriminations among human communities and for the upliftment of [[The Santror|Santror]]. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} The second phase too lasted for two years beginning on December 1835 till December 1837. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=54}} This phase is performed at the ground level in a sitting posture. {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}} He took only [[rice gruel]] .{{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|pp=45-46}} However, some sources claimed that he took milk and fruits during ''Phase II'' .{{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}}\n\n''Phase III'' of the penance began by January 1838. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=54}}  This last phase is meant for the upliftment of women and for the betterment of his [[offspring|progeny]]. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} Phase III is performed by him on a raised pedestal. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=79}} The last phase too was intended to extend for two complete years but was interrupted by the [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|King of Travancore]]. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=54}}\n\n== Mendicant==\n\nBy this time it is believed that so many miracles began to happen around him and people started believing his as their saviour.{{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=45}}  The news began to spread like wild-fire and thousands of people from every section of the society {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=46}} from the surrounding villages began to visit Swamithope, believing that their grievances be addressed by him. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} He is believed to have cured various diseases during this period. {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=46}} People witnessed mysterious experience and influence while standing before him {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=46}} Some accounts suggests that attempts were made by the upper classes during this time to dispel his popularity. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=47}} During this time he also believed to have incinerated the [[demon]]s and also seized the power of the [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] etc in front of his devotees.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|pp=80-81}}\n\nVaikundar characterised himself as a [[Mendicant]]. He was addressed by the worshippers as ''\u2018Narayana Pandaram\u2019''.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}}  It was during these days he preached several revolutionary ideas which are considered as historically unparalleled. He emphasized the importance of [[Charity (practice)|Charity]], [[Truth]] and [[love]] and induced these values into the [[ritual]]s.{{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=47}}  Most of his teachings and rituals he advocated has both religious and social implications. Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the inequalities, mainly caste-based, prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as 'Anna Dharmam' , physical as well as spiritual cleanliness through [[Thuvayal Thavasu]],<ref name=\"Mythic society\">{{cite journal|last1=Society|first1=Mythic|title=The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society|date=1986|volume=77|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zBa2AAAAIAAJ&dq=Sami+thope&q=Sami+thope|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> eliminating untouchability through [[Thirunamam|Thottunamam]], self-respect and courage through headgear,{{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|pp=93-96}} and unifying various castes through [[Muthirikkinaru]]. His revolutionary doctrine caused great excitement among the people and prepared them to fight for their rights. (SFSE 48)   During this time he also believed to have incinerated the demons and also seized the power of the [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] etc. in front of his devotees. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|pp=80-81}}\n\n== Arrest ==\n\nThe teachings of Vaikundar created an excitement among the people and it began to reflect in the socio-religious arena of the 19th century South Travancore and South [[Tirunelveli]]. The lower classes began to resist several oppressions all of them until then remained unchallenged. The upper classes viewed this as a challenge against them as they believed that the collapse of the existing system may undermine their social status seriously. Numerous complaints were made before the King of Travancore by the upper classes against Vaikundar and his activities. {{sfn|Ponnu|2002|p=68}} But the king seems to ignore all of them initially. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}} The issue was brought before the king [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma]] once again during his [[Suchindrum]] visit. {{sfn|Ponnu|2002|p=69}} Being a staunch believer of the Varna system, it seems hard for the King to believe Vaikundar, whose community was outside the caste-fold, to be the [[avatar]] of [[Narayana]]. {{sfn|Vivekanandan|2003|p=90}} Moreover, the claim made by Vaikundar that himself will rule the world as an undisputed King misled the king. He suspected that Vaikundar was provoking the people and was plotting for a revolt against the Kingdom. {{sfn|Ponnu|2002|p=70}} Fearing a revolution he sent the armed forces immediately to arrest Vaikundar {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=50}} <ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasturi|first1=Prema|last2=Madhavan|first2=Chithra|title=South India heritage: An introduction|date=2007|publisher=East West Books (Madras)|isbn=9788188661640|page=107}}</ref>  The large gathering around Vaikundar confronted with the army. Vaikundar refrained them from getting violent {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=50}} and appealed them to pave the way for the forces. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=58-59}} The soldiers arrested him and took him to Suchindrum. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}}\n\nAt Suchindrum, Vaikundar was brought in front of the king. He, who already had doubts about the [[divinity]] of Vaikundar, intended to test his [[supernatural]] ability {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}} by hiding his ring in his hand and asking him to name it. {{sfn|Ponnu|2002|p=76}} Vaikundar preferred not to answer and to remain silent {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}} The king ordered his imprisonment immediately {{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=51}} He was imprisoned in a confinement filled with sewage infested with worms {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=82}} It is also noted by some that he was asked to take alcohol in which various poisonous herbs  was mixed up. Miraculously Vaikundar remained unaffected {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=61}} He was imprisoned there for two days. Then the king ordered him to be taken to [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the capital of [[Travancore]]. The forces proceed towards Thiruvananthapuram through [[Kottar]], [[Parvathipuram, Tamil Nadu|Parvathipuram]], [[Chungankadai]] and reached [[Thuckalay]]. That night he was kept imprisoned at [[Manalikkara]] .{{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=61}} The next day the soldiers took him to Thiruvananthapuram via [[Balaramapuram]]. At Thiruvananthapuram, Vaikundar was jailed at Singarathope open prison. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=61}} Jubliant followers of Vaikundar accompanied him all through his way and stayed at the prison premises {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=62}}\n\nDuring his imprisonment period people in large numbers rushed to Singarathope to avail his blessings. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=50}} Vaikundar was subjected to several severe tribulations and cruel treatments. However, he continued preaching and healing there too. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=50}} He also said to have performed various miracles at the prison {{sfn|Amalan|2000|pp=70-71}} Attempts were also made to burn him in lime [[kiln]] and in Chilli go-down. He had overcome all these miraculously. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=67-73}} He was finally thrown into the cage of a hungry [[Tiger]] in front of the administrators, army staff and public. Contrary to the expectation of the officials the tiger did not jump onto its prey. One of the soldiers tried to prod it with a spear in order to provoke it. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=83}} The tiger caught hold of the spear and in no time left it abruptly when the other end of the spear ripped the abdomen of a priest and he died on the spot. This event shocked the king as he believed that killing a priest would fetch divine wrath.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=83}} He ordered the release of Vaikundar immediately upon the condition that he would restrict his activities and preaching only to his caste. Vaikundar not only refused to sign the condition but also refused to accept his release. He tore the royal writ into pieces since his mission was the betterment and equality of all castes.{{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=51}} He proclaimed that he would be accepting the release only after the completion imprisonment period.\n\nHe remained in jail as a prisoner for the full 3&thinsp;\u00be months. He was released after 110 days, in the first week of March. These events enhanced the fame of Vaikundar further all over the kingdom. {{sfn|Ponnu|2000|p=51}} His followers carried him back as a procession and they reached Poovandanthope on 19 Masi 1013 [[Malayalam Era|M.E]] (1 March 1838), a day before the 5th anniversary of his incarnation.\n\n==Later life==\n\nAs the Phase III of his [[Tavam of Vaikundar|Tavam]] was disrupted by the King he decided to fulfil the penance. He also directed 700 families to undertake [[Thuvayal Thavasu]], the Washing Penance. They concluded the penance at two Phases. Phase I last for 6 months and was conducted at [[Vakaippathi]] and Phase II lasts another 6 months at Muttapathi. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=79-86}} By the same time the final phase of Tavam of Vaikundar too completed at Poovandanthope. {{sfn|Amalan|2000|p=86}} After the conclusion of the Tavam he consecrated the [[Muthirikkinaru]], historically the first ever well in South India which was allowed to be used by all castes. He was also believed to be received the Second [[Vinchai]] from Lord Narayana at ''Theerthakkarai'', [[Muttapathi]]. Then he moved westwards to the place which was now known to be as Ambala Pathi.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nAt [[Ambalappathi]], he portrayed himself as a reigning King under a grand roof similar to the ones in the then Travancore palace. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=83}} He was also believed to have unified various deighties into himself there by conducting a grand ceremony, Ikanai manam. .{{sfn|Krishnanathan|2000|p=56}} Afterwards he also laid foundation stones for several [[Nizhal Thangal]]s throughout South Travancore and South Tirunelvely. {{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=84}} He breathed his last in 21 [[Tamil calendar|Vaikasi]] 1026.[[Malayalam Era|M.E]] His '' \u2018Sacred Golden Body\u2019 '' was interned at Poovandanthope which was now the [[Palliyarai]] of [[Swamithope Pathi]].{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Vivekanandan |first=Siva |date=December 2003 |title=Ayya Vaikundar : Vazhvum Vazhibadum |publisher=Kavya |edition=1st |language=Tamil |trans-title=Ayya Vaikundar : Life and Worship }}\n* G.
