In most years, it is absorbed into the earth, goes to fill channels and the many permanent [[Depression (geology)|waterhole]]s and lakes such as [[Lake Yamma Yamma]], or simply evaporates without reaching Lake Eyre. \n\nIn very wet years, however, it manages to flood the entire [[Channel Country]] and reaches Lake Eyre after flowing through the dry areas of [[Strzelecki Desert]], [[Sturt Stony Desert]] and the [[Tirari Desert]].<ref name=\"bom\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/flood/brochures/cooper/cooper.shtml |title=Flood Warning System for the Cooper Creek Catchment |accessdate=2009-10-19 |publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] }}</ref> Studies have clearly shown that, although with a mean annual flow of around {{convert|2.3|km3}} (ranging at Barcoo from an estimated {{convert|0.02|km3|acre.ft|disp=or|abbr=on}} in 1902 to an estimated {{convert|12|km3|cumi|disp=or|abbr=on}} in 1950) the Cooper carries twice as much runoff as the [[Diamantina River|Diamantina]] and three times as much as the [[Georgina River|Georgina]], over the past ten thousand years it has reached Lake Eyre much less frequently than those rivers. This is because much more water is absorbed along its course than with the Diamantina or Georgina, but may also be because of centennial or multicentennial wet and dry cycles in those basins causing them to regularly reach the lake during wet periods (there is some evidence from terraces around Lake Eyre that this occurred during the [[Medieval Warm Period]]).

It is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bologna|archdiocese of Bologna]].\n\nThe episcopal seat was transferred from Vicohabentia (Voghenza) to the newly founded Ferrara in 657.<ref>Ughelli, II, p. 507.</ref> The earliest known bishop of Vicohabentia is Marcellinus, who was consecrated c. 429\u2013431.<ref>Lanzoni (1927), pp. 812-813.</ref>\n\nOriginally, it seems, the diocese (or at least the diocese of Vicohabentia) was a suffragan of the metropolitanate of Ravenna. Ferrara repeatedly contested that opinion, and claimed to be directly dependent upon the Holy See (the Pope). [[Pope John XIII]], in April 967, confirmed that Ferrara was under papal jurisdiction, as far as election, consecration, investiture, and jurisdiction were concerned. [[Pope Benedict VII]], in April 978, again confirmed the papal jurisdiction in much the same language.<ref>Kehr, pp. 203, 208-209 nos. 5-6.</ref> At some point between 1106 and 1123, however, the diocese of Ferrara fell under the control of the metropolitan of Ravenna, and Bishop Landolfo was suspended from office because of his refusal to submit to Archbishop Walter of Ravenna.<ref>Kehr, pp. 203, 211. This change was apparently connected with the suppression of the schism of the [[Antipope Clement III]] (Wibert of Ravenna).</ref> [[Pope Innocent II]] restored the original independence of the diocese of Ferrara on 11 March 1133; but on the death of Bishop Landolfo in 1138, the Archbishop of Ravenna asserted the right to consecrate his successor. The Ferrarese were required to produce their documentary proofs before the Pope, who issued a decree in favor of Ferrara as directly dependent upon the Holy See on 22 April 1139.<ref>Kehr, pp. 203-204; 212-213, nos. 20-22. Cf. Cappelletti, IV, pp. 52, 57-61.</ref>\n\nFerrara became an archdiocese, though without suffragans, by the Bull ''Paterna pontificii'' of [[Pope Clement XII]] on 27 July 1735.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 169-176.</ref> Pope Clement goes out of his way to state that the diocese had always been directly subject to the Holy See, citing the decree ''Ad hoc'' of Pope Innocent II at the Lateran Council of 1139, and recalling subsequent similar rulings of Celestine II, Lucius II, Gregory VIII, Clement III, Celestine III, Innocent IV, Alexander VIII, Innocent XII, and Clement XI. This fortunate arrangement continued until 1976. In a decree of the Vatican Sacred Congregation of Bishops of 8 December 1976, a new arrangement of certain dioceses in ecclesiastical provinces was announced; the diocese of Ferrara was made a suffragan of the Archbishop of Bologna, though the Archbishop of Ferrara was allowed to keep the title of archbishop.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' [https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-69-1977-ocr.pdf Vol. LXIX] (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1977), pp. 157-158: ''Ferrariensem Ecclesiam, quin aliquid immutetur de archiepiscopali dignitate, Metropolitanae Ecclesiae Bononiensi adnectit.''</ref>\n\nAs part of a project begun on orders from [[Pope John XXIII]], and continued under his successors, to reduce the number of dioceses in Italy and to rationalize their borders in terms of modern population changes and shortages of clergy, the diocese of Comacchio was united to the diocese of Ferrara by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops, on 30 September 1986. There was to be one bishop, and one curia, one cathedral, one Council of Consultors and one Council of Priests, and one seminary. The former cathedral of Comacchio was granted the title of Co-cathedral, and its Chapter was retained and not united with the Chapter of the Cathedral of Ferrara.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' [https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-79-1987-ocr.pdf Vol. LXXIX] (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1987), pp. 707-710.</ref>\n\nThe old diocesan name of ''Vicohabentia'' (Voghenza) was revived in 1967, as a titular See.

It is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bologna|archdiocese of Bologna]].\n\nThe episcopal seat was transferred from Vicohabentia (Voghenza) to the newly founded Ferrara in 657.<ref>Ughelli, II, p. 507.</ref> The earliest known bishop of Vicohabentia is Marcellinus, who was consecrated c. 429\u2013431.<ref>Lanzoni (1927), pp. 812-813.</ref>\n\nOriginally, it seems, the diocese (or at least the diocese of Vicohabentia) was a suffragan of the metropolitanate of Ravenna. Ferrara repeatedly contested that opinion, and claimed to be directly dependent upon the Holy See (the Pope). [[Pope John XIII]], in April 967, confirmed that Ferrara was under papal jurisdiction, as far as election, consecration, investiture, and jurisdiction were concerned. [[Pope Benedict VII]], in April 978, again confirmed the papal jurisdiction in much the same language.<ref>Kehr, pp. 203, 208-209 nos. 5-6.</ref> At some point between 1106 and 1123, however, the diocese of Ferrara fell under the control of the metropolitan of Ravenna, and Bishop Landolfo was suspended from office because of his refusal to submit to Archbishop Walter of Ravenna.<ref>Kehr, pp. 203, 211. This change was apparently connected with the suppression of the schism of the [[Antipope Clement III]] (Wibert of Ravenna).</ref> [[Pope Innocent II]] restored the original independence of the diocese of Ferrara on 11 March 1133; but on the death of Bishop Landolfo in 1138, the Archbishop of Ravenna asserted the right to consecrate his successor. The Ferrarese were required to produce their documentary proofs before the Pope, who issued a decree in favor of Ferrara as directly dependent upon the Holy See on 22 April 1139.<ref>Kehr, pp. 203-204; 212-213, nos. 20-22. Cf. Cappelletti, IV, pp. 52, 57-61.</ref>\n\nFerrara became an archdiocese, though without suffragans, by the Bull ''Paterna pontificii'' of [[Pope Clement XII]] on 27 July 1735.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 169-176.</ref> Pope Clement goes out of his way to state that the diocese had always been directly subject to the Holy See, citing the decree ''Ad hoc'' of Pope Innocent II at the Lateran Council of 1139, and recalling subsequent similar rulings of Celestine II, Lucius II, Gregory VIII, Clement III, Celestine III, Innocent IV, Alexander VIII, Innocent XII, and Clement XI. This fortunate arrangement continued until 1976. In a decree of the Vatican Sacred Congregation of Bishops of 8 December 1976, a new arrangement of certain dioceses in ecclesiastical provinces was announced; the diocese of Ferrara was made a suffragan of the Archbishop of Bologna, though the Archbishop of Ferrara was allowed to keep the title of archbishop.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' [https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-69-1977-ocr.pdf Vol. LXIX] (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1977), pp. 157-158: ''Ferrariensem Ecclesiam, quin aliquid immutetur de archiepiscopali dignitate, Metropolitanae Ecclesiae Bononiensi adnectit.''</ref>\n\nAs part of a project begun on orders from [[Pope John XXIII]], and continued under his successors, to reduce the number of dioceses in Italy and to rationalize their borders in terms of modern population changes and shortages of clergy, the diocese of Comacchio was united to the diocese of Ferrara by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops, on 30 September 1986. There was to be one bishop, and one curia, one cathedral, one Council of Consultors and one Council of Priests, and one seminary. The former cathedral of Comacchio was granted the title of Co-cathedral, and its Chapter was retained and not united with the Chapter of the Cathedral of Ferrara.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' [https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-79-1987-ocr.pdf Vol. LXXIX] (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1987), pp. 707-710.</ref>\n\nThe old diocesan name of ''Vicohabentia'' (Voghenza) was revived in 1967, as a titular See. It has been held by an auxiliary bishop of Cortona and an auxiliary bishop of Rome.<ref>Santolaria de Puey y Cruells, Jos\u00e9-Apeles.

The synod had been summoned to deal with the case of Bishop John of Ravenna, who had excommunicated innocent persons and opposed pious works, and who, after having been admonished and summoned to a synod, refused to appear.<ref>J.

Ughelli, p. 518, assigns a date of 634. Cappelletti, p. 25, and Gams, p. 694, give the date of 686 for the beginning of his episcopate.</ref> Some think that the bishops of Ferrara are the successors to those of Voghenza (the ancient Vicus Haventia). \n\nOn 25 March 1210, the [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto IV]], residing at Ferrara, issued an edict against heretics in Ferrara: ''...omnes hereticos Ferrarie commorantes, Patharenos sive Gazaros, Imperiali banno subjacere...et domus destruantur.''<ref>Cittadella, p. 385.</ref>\n\n[[Pope Alexander III]] visited Ferrara during his Venetian trip, from 10 April to 9 May 1177. At the end of his visit, on 8 May, he dedicated the High Altar in the Cathedral.<ref>Ughelli, p. 539. Barotti, p. 26. P. Jaffe and S.

He was buried in the Cathedral.<ref>P. Jaffe and S. Loewenfeld, p. 528.</ref> The Conclave to elect his successor began (and ended) on the next day with the election of Cardinal Alberto di Morro, who took the name [[Pope Gregory VIII]]. He left Ferrara for Rome on November 16, and died at Pisa on 17 December 1187.<ref>F.

The bishop had two brothers, Filippo and Alberto, and a sister Giovanna, who was married to [[Alberto d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara]] (died 1393). Suddenly, on 22 January 1400, Alberto's son, [[Niccol\u00f2 III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara]], ordered the arrest of Alberto de' Roberti, the President of the Council; his brother Filippo; their mother Margherita; and Marco de' Pii da Carpi, who was married to the Bishop's sister Taddea. Alberto and Margherita's property was confiscated, and both were beheaded on 6 March 1400. The Bishop's brother Filippo was sent into exile, and Marco Pio was kept in prison. Bishop Niccol\u00f2 was deposed from his bishopric, though [[Pope Boniface IX]] issued a decree vouching for his absolute innocence.<ref>Barotti, pp. 66-67. Ferranti, III, pp. 10-13, who states, on the authority of Ughelli and without evidence, that the Pope transferred Bishop Niccol\u00f2 to another See.</ref> The cause of the Marchese's violent actions is unknown. \n\nOn 8 January 1438, [[Pope Eugene IV]] opened the seventeenth ecumenical [[Council of Florence|council in Ferrara]], but the plague of 1439 compelled him to move the sessions to Florence.<ref>The Pope had been planning the move anyway. The plague was a fortuitous incentive. {{cite book|author=Basil Popoff|editor=J. M.

The High Altar was consecrated by [[Pope Alexander III]] on 18 May 1177. It also served as a parish church, and the Archpriest of the Cathedral Chapter served as the pastor of the congregation. In 1735, when the diocese became a metropolitanate with an Archbishop, the Cathedral became a metropolitan cathedral.<ref>Santolaria de Puey y Cruells, [https://books.google.it/books?id=UT1KDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=it#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Annuario Diocesano 2017''], p. 123.</ref> It was granted the title and privileges of a Minor Basilica by [[Pope John XXIII]] on 13 November 1959.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' LX (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1960), pp. 145-147.</ref>\n\n[[Pope Paul III]] visited the city of Ferrara along with seventeen cardinals in April 1543. At the Solemn Mass held in the Cathedral on 24 April, the Feast of Saint George, he granted to all the Canons the right to call themselves ''Monsignor''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Giuseppe Antenore Scalabrini|title=Memorie istoriche delle chiese di Ferrara e de' suoi borghi: Munite, ed illustrate con antichi inediti monumenti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4BYAAAAcAAJ|year=1773|publisher=per C.

It was restored in 1799, but abolished again in 1800. [[Napoleon]] restored the Chapter by a decree of 8 June 1805, but also reordered its composition. According to his orders, there were to be: the Archpriest, the Provost, the Treasurer, the Theologus, the Penitentiary, and ten additional Canons. The arrangement still holds good, with the addition of ''Honorary Canons'', currently five in number, with two ''Emeriti'' and three ''Supernumerarii''; there are also seven ''Mansionarii'', each with a five year term.<ref>Santolaria de Puey y Cruells, [https://books.google.it/books?id=UT1KDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=it#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Annuario Diocesano 2017''], pp. 129-133.

In 1723, Cardinal Tommaso Ruffo (1717\u20131738) purchased the Palazzo Costabili-Trotti, to which he transferred the personnel of the seminary in 1724. In 1755, Cardinal Marcello Crescenzi (1746\u20131768) added the Palazzo Libanori-Guastavillari. The seminary was closed in 1798 by the French occupation officials, though it was allowed to reopen in the next year. In 1955, the seminary moved to its present quarters, a completely modern building.<ref>Archdiocese of Ferrara, ''Annuario Diocesano 2011'' (Ferrara 2011), p. 53.</ref>\n\n===Synods===\n\nA diocesan synod was an irregular but important meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

He married Helen Theresa Crank (1874\u20131955) on 23 October 1895.<ref name=ODNB/>\nFor several years, in addition to his laboratory work, he studied at home and later in formal evening classes, to specialize in steel production techniques and associated chemical analysis methods.\n\nBy his early thirties, Brearley had earned a reputation as an experienced professional and for being very astute in the resolution of practical, industrial, metallurgical problems.  It was in 1908, when two of Sheffield's principal [[steelmaking]] companies innovatively agreed to jointly finance a common research laboratory ([[Firth Brown Steels|Brown Firth Laboratories]]) that Harry Brearley was asked to lead the project.\n\nAfter leaving Brown Firth, Brearley joined [[Brown Bayley Steels|Brown Bayley's Steel Works]], also in Sheffield; he became a director of the firm in 1925.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1941 Brearley created a charitable trust The Freshgate Trust Foundation, a grantmaking charity operating in Sheffield and South Yorkshire. His aim was to provide a \"Fresh Gate\" or new opportunity to people like him born into modest circumstances so that they may experience the finer things in life such as travel, education, the arts and music. The foundation is still operating as a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] awarding grants for charitable purposes in South Yorkshire.<ref>{{EW charity|221467|The Freshgate Trust Foundation}}</ref>\n\nBrearley died on 14 July 1948, at [[Torquay]], a [[seaside resort|coastal resort town]] in Devon, south west England. He was cremated at Efford Crematorium, Efford, near [[Plymouth]] on 16 July 1948<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> and his ashes were scattered in the Efford Crematorium Garden of Remembrance.<ref>Confirmed in a letter dated 30 September 1994 from the City of Plymouth Cemeteries Manager to Dr Peter Beeley of Cookridge, Leeds</ref>\n\nIn 2013, in the Sheffield University Varsity Brewing Challenge, Sheffield University named their beer \u2013 brewed by Thornbridge \u2013 Brearleys, to commemorate 100 years since Harry Brearley invented stainless steel.\n\n== Stainless steel==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2015}}\nIn the troubled years immediately before the [[First World War]], arms manufacturing increased significantly in the UK, but practical problems were encountered due to erosion (excessive wear) of the internal surfaces of gun barrels. Brearley began to research new steels which could better resist the erosion caused by high temperatures (rather than corrosion, as is often mentioned in this regard). He began to examine the addition of [[chromium]] to steel, which was known to raise the material's melting point, as compared to the standard [[carbon]] steels.\n\nThe research concentrated on quantifying the effects of varying the levels of [[carbon]] (C, at concentrations around 0.2 weight %) and [[chromium]] (Cr, in the range of 6 to 15 weight %).\n\n===The accidental discovery ===\n[[Image:Stainless steel nyt 1-31-1915.jpg|right|thumb|Announcement of Brearley's stainless steel discovery as it appeared in the 1915 ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite journal|journal=New York Times|title=A non-rusting steel|date=31 January 1915}}</ref>]]\nIn order to undertake [[metallography]] to study the [[microstructure]] of the experimental alloys (the main factor responsible for a steel's mechanical properties) it was necessary to [[polishing|polish]] and [[Chemical milling|etch]] the metallic samples produced. For a carbon steel, a dilute solution of [[nitric acid]] in [[ethanol|alcohol]] is sufficient to produce the required etching, but Brearley found that the new chromium steels were very resistant to chemical attack.\nhe was poo poo head\n===Development===\nIt was probably Harry Brearley's upbringing in Sheffield, a city famous for the manufacture of [[cutlery]] since the 16th century, which led him to appreciate the potential of these new steels for applications not only in high-temperature service, as originally envisioned, but also in the mass-production of food-related applications such as cutlery, [[saucepan]]s and processing equipment etc. Up to that time carbon-steel knives were prone to unhygienic [[rust]]ing if they were not frequently polished and only expensive [[sterling silver]] or [[nickel silver|EPNS]] cutlery was generally available to avoid such problems. With this in mind Brearley extended his examinations to include tests with food acids such as [[vinegar]] and [[lemon juice]], with very promising results.\n\nBrearley initially called the new alloy \"rustless steel\"; the more [[euphony|euphonic]] \"stainless steel\" was suggested by Ernest Stuart of [[R.F. Mosley's]], a local cutlery manufacturer at [[Portland Works]], and eventually prevailed although Mosley's used the \"Rusnorstain\" trademark for many years. It is reported<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stainlesssteel.or.kr/english/stsinfo/develop.asp |title=The development of stainless steel |publisher=Stainless Steel Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827005100/http://www.stainlesssteel.or.kr/english/stsinfo/develop.asp |archivedate=27 August 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> that the first true stainless steel, a 0.24wt% C, 12.8wt% Cr ferrous [[alloy]], was produced by Brearley in an electric [[furnace]] on 13 August 1913.

Brearley had left the Brown Firth Laboratories in 1915, following disagreements regarding [[patent]] rights, but the research continued under the direction of his successor, Dr. [[W. H. Hatfield]]. It is Hatfield who is credited with the development, in 1924, of a stainless steel which even today is probably the widest-used alloy of this type, the so-called \"[[18/8 stainless steel|18/8]]\", which in addition to chromium, includes [[nickel]] (Ni) in its composition (18wt% Cr, 8wt% Ni).\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nA {{convert|42|ft|m}} mural of Brearley, marking the 100th anniversary of his invention of stainless steel, was commissioned for the side of a building on Howard Street, Sheffield, and was painted by the artist [[Sarah Yates]] (aka \"Faunagraphic\").<ref name=\"SAS\">{{cite web |title=Harry Brearley |url=http://streetartsheffield.com/gallery/harry-brearley |publisher=Street Art Sheffield |accessdate=30 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* H.

Based in [[Sheffield]], his invention brought affordable [[cutlery]] to the masses, and saw an expansion of the city\u2019s traditional cutlery trade.<ref>{{cite news |title=Made in Great Britain, Series 1, Steel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bpz4ks |accessdate=28 March 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBrearley was born on 18 February 1871 in [[Sheffield]], [[England]], the son of John Brearley, a steelworker, and his wife, Jane Brearley n\u00e9e Senior.<ref name=ODNB>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, accessed 2 April 2013</ref> He left Woodside school at the age of twelve to enter his first employment as a labourer in his father's steelworks, later getting the post of general assistant in the company's chemical laboratory.  He married Helen Theresa Crank (1874\u20131955) on 23 October 1895.<ref name=ODNB/>\nFor several years, in addition to his laboratory work, he studied at home and later in formal evening classes, to specialize in steel production techniques and associated chemical analysis methods.\n\nBy his early thirties, Brearley had earned a reputation as an experienced professional and for being very astute in the resolution of practical, industrial, metallurgical problems.  It was in 1908, when two of Sheffield's principal [[steelmaking]] companies innovatively agreed to jointly finance a common research laboratory ([[Firth Brown Steels|Brown Firth Laboratories]]) that Harry Brearley was asked to lead the project.\n\nAfter leaving Brown Firth, Brearley joined [[Brown Bayley Steels|Brown Bayley's Steel Works]], also in Sheffield; he became a director of the firm in 1925.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1941 Brearley created a charitable trust The Freshgate Trust Foundation, a grantmaking charity operating in Sheffield and South Yorkshire. His aim was to provide a \"Fresh Gate\" or new opportunity to people like him born into modest circumstances so that they may experience the finer things in life such as travel, education, the arts and music. The foundation is still operating as a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] awarding grants for charitable purposes in South Yorkshire.<ref>{{EW charity|221467|The Freshgate Trust Foundation}}</ref>\n\nBrearley died on 14 July 1948, at [[Torquay]], a [[seaside resort|coastal resort town]] in Devon, south west England. He was cremated at Efford Crematorium, Efford, near [[Plymouth]] on 16 July 1948<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> and his ashes were scattered in the Efford Crematorium Garden of Remembrance.<ref>Confirmed in a letter dated 30 September 1994 from the City of Plymouth Cemeteries Manager to Dr Peter Beeley of Cookridge, Leeds</ref>\n\nIn 2013, in the Sheffield University Varsity Brewing Challenge, Sheffield University named their beer \u2013 brewed by Thornbridge \u2013 Brearleys, to commemorate 100 years since Harry Brearley invented stainless steel.\n\n== Stainless steel==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2015}}\nIn the troubled years immediately before the [[First World War]], arms manufacturing increased significantly in the UK, but practical problems were encountered due to erosion (excessive wear) of the internal surfaces of gun barrels. Brearley began to research new steels which could better resist the erosion caused by high temperatures (rather than corrosion, as is often mentioned in this regard). He began to examine the addition of [[chromium]] to steel, which was known to raise the material's melting point, as compared to the standard [[carbon]] steels.\n\nThe research concentrated on quantifying the effects of varying the levels of [[carbon]] (C, at concentrations around 0.2 weight %) and [[chromium]] (Cr, in the range of 6 to 15 weight %).\n\n===The accidental discovery ===\n[[Image:Stainless steel nyt 1-31-1915.jpg|right|thumb|Announcement of Brearley's stainless steel discovery as it appeared in the 1915 ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite journal|journal=New York Times|title=A non-rusting steel|date=31 January 1915}}</ref>]]\nIn order to undertake [[metallography]] to study the [[microstructure]] of the experimental alloys (the main factor responsible for a steel's mechanical properties) it was necessary to [[polishing|polish]] and [[Chemical milling|etch]] the metallic samples produced. For a carbon steel, a dilute solution of [[nitric acid]] in [[ethanol|alcohol]] is sufficient to produce the required etching, but Brearley found that the new chromium steels were very resistant to chemical attack.\n\n===Development===\nIt was probably Harry Brearley's upbringing in Sheffield, a city famous for the manufacture of [[cutlery]] since the 16th century, which led him to appreciate the potential of these new steels for applications not only in high-temperature service, as originally envisioned, but also in the mass-production of food-related applications such as cutlery, [[saucepan]]s and processing equipment etc. Up to that time carbon-steel knives were prone to unhygienic [[rust]]ing if they were not frequently polished and only expensive [[sterling silver]] or [[nickel silver|EPNS]] cutlery was generally available to avoid such problems. With this in mind Brearley extended his examinations to include tests with food acids such as [[vinegar]] and [[lemon juice]], with very promising results.\n\nBrearley initially called the new alloy \"rustless steel\"; the more [[euphony|euphonic]] \"stainless steel\" was suggested by Ernest Stuart of [[R.F. Mosley's]], a local cutlery manufacturer at [[Portland Works]], and eventually prevailed although Mosley's used the \"Rusnorstain\" trademark for many years. It is reported<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stainlesssteel.or.kr/english/stsinfo/develop.asp |title=The development of stainless steel |publisher=Stainless Steel Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827005100/http://www.stainlesssteel.or.kr/english/stsinfo/develop.asp |archivedate=27 August 2005 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> that the first true stainless steel, a 0.24wt% C, 12.8wt% Cr ferrous [[alloy]], was produced by Brearley in an electric [[furnace]] on 13 August 1913.

Brearley had left the Brown Firth Laboratories in 1915, following disagreements regarding [[patent]] rights, but the research continued under the direction of his successor, Dr. [[W. H. Hatfield]]. It is Hatfield who is credited with the development, in 1924, of a stainless steel which even today is probably the widest-used alloy of this type, the so-called \"[[18/8 stainless steel|18/8]]\", which in addition to chromium, includes [[nickel]] (Ni) in its composition (18wt% Cr, 8wt% Ni).\n\n== Memorials ==\n\nA {{convert|42|ft|m}} mural of Brearley, marking the 100th anniversary of his invention of stainless steel, was commissioned for the side of a building on Howard Street, Sheffield, and was painted by the artist [[Sarah Yates]] (aka \"Faunagraphic\").<ref name=\"SAS\">{{cite web |title=Harry Brearley |url=http://streetartsheffield.com/gallery/harry-brearley |publisher=Street Art Sheffield |accessdate=30 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* H.

Scotia]] that runs from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] to [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]].\n\nThe highway follows a route of {{convert|291|km|mi}} along the province's [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]] region fronting the Atlantic coast. The route parallels its predecessor, local [[Nova Scotia Trunk 3|Trunk&nbsp;3]]. The highway varies from 2-lane controlled access to 2-lane local secondary roads on the section between Yarmouth and [[Hebbville, Nova Scotia|Hebbville]]. East of Hebbville to [[Upper Tantallon, Nova Scotia|Upper Tantallon]], the highway is 2-lane controlled access, with the exception of a {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} 4-lane [[divided highway|divided freeway]] near [[Chester Basin, Nova Scotia|Chester]]. From Upper Tantallon (Exit 5), to the interchange with [[Nova Scotia Highway 102|Highway&nbsp;102]] (near Bayers Lake) in Halifax, the highway is 4-lane divided freeway. Similar to [[Nova Scotia Highway 101|Highway&nbsp;101]], kilometer markers increase run west-to-east, increasing from Yarmouth to Halifax; however, exit numbers run east-to-west, increasing from Halifax to Yarmouth.\n\nIn 2013, Highway 103 was redesignated as the '''Fishermen's Memorial Highway'''.\n\n==History==\nThe highway has developed sporadically since the 1970s, with the 2-lane controlled access portion to Bridgewater being largely responsible for the abandonment of [[Canadian National Railway|CN Rail]]'s South Shore line, the former [[Halifax and Southwestern Railway]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In November 2006, construction was completed that twinned 15 kilometers of highway between Exit 3 and Exit 5.<ref>[https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20061211005 Highway 103 Greatly Improved]</ref> In December 2006, an 8.3 kilometre bypass around [[Barrington, Nova Scotia (community)|Barrington]] was completed.<ref>[https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20061221008 Barrington Bypass Completed] Government of Nova Scotia</ref>\n\nIn late September 2015 a new section of highway was opened to bypass the Port Joli area.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Verge|first1=Brittany W.|title=Smoothing out Highway 103: Port Joli bypass opens to traffic|url=http://www.theadvance.ca/news/local/2015/10/12/port-joli-bypass-opens-to-traffic.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=Queens County Advance|publisher=Transcontinental Media|date=October 14, 2015}}</ref> In November 2016, a new section was completed which bypassed Port Mouton. Residents complained that the single exit east of the community had lengthened the trip for people heading west from Port Mouton.\n\nThe new interchange in Ingramport (Exit 5A) opened in January 2017.\n\nWork on twinning Highway 103 from Exit 5 (Tantallon) to Exit 5A (Ingramport) began in February, 2018. Construction is expected to be completed by Fall 2020. Twinning from Exit 5A (Ingramport) to Exit 6 (Hubbards) will start in 2020 with an expected completion date of 2023.\n\n==Names of Highway 103==\n\n* Fishermen's Memorial Highway - June 2013\n* Barrington Bypass - [[Barrington, Nova Scotia (community)|Barrington]] to [[Oak Park, Nova Scotia|Oak Park]], [[Shelburne County, Nova Scotia|Shelburne County]] \n* Nine Mile Road - [[Sable River, Nova Scotia|Sable River]] to [[Jordan Falls, Nova Scotia|Jordan Falls]], [[Shelburne County, Nova Scotia|Shelburne County]]\n\n==Safety concerns==\nBetween 2006 and 2009, there were 29 deaths on the highway.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-most-notorious-highways-1.1321147 Canada's most notorious highways] CBC.ca</ref> In 2009, it was considered Nova Scotia's deadliest highway and was ranked the second most dangerous highway in Canada by the [[Canadian Automobile Association]].<ref name=\"cbcnews\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-s-highway-101-to-be-widened-1.807138|title=Nova Scotia's Highway 101 to be widened|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2017-06-26 | date=March 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://caaneo.ca/about/blog/driving/the-top-12-most-dangerous-highways-in-canada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428001133/http://caaneo.ca/about/blog/driving/the-top-12-most-dangerous-highways-in-canada |archivedate=2012-04-28 }} \"The Top 12 Most Dangerous Highways in Canada\"</ref> In 2009 alone, ten people died in automobile accidents on the highway, according to the [[Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal]].<ref>[http://autos.ca.msn.com/specials/road-trip-guide/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=25920211&page=9 10 most dangerous roads in Canada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021045326/http://autos.ca.msn.com/specials/road-trip-guide/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=25920211&page=9 |date=2010-10-21 }} MSN.ca</ref> Between 2008 and 2012, there were 22 fatalities on the highway.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/highway-103-safety-review-launched-in-nova-scotia-1.2816113 Highway 103 safety review launched in Nova Scotia] CBC.ca</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, local residents raised concern over the presence of a road sign on the highway, near the turnoff to [[Port Mouton]], that had a very confusing appearance, looking like a patchwork of several other road signs.

Part of this can be explained by the slow hydrolysis of ATP by DnaA, a protein that binds to repeats in the oriC to initiate replication.  Dam methylase also plays a role because the oriC has 11 5'-GATC-3' sequences (in ''E. coli'').  Immediately after DNA replication, the oriC is hemimethylated and sequestered for a period of time.  Only after this, the oriC is released and must be fully methylated by Dam methylase before DnaA binding occurs.\n\n==Role in regulation of protein expression==\n\nDam also plays a role in the promotion and repression of [[RNA transcription]].

Occurring around parental [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]], such parental or familial child abduction may include [[parental alienation]], a form of child abuse seeking to disconnect a child from targeted parent and denigrated side of [[family]].  This is, by far, the most common form of child abduction.\n* [[Kidnapping|Abduction or kidnapping]] by strangers (by people unknown to the child and outside the child's family) is rare.  Some of the reasons why a stranger might kidnap an unknown child include:\n**[[extortion]] to elicit a [[ransom]] from the parents for the child's return\n** illegal [[adoption]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to rear the child as their own or to sell to a prospective adoptive parent\n** [[human trafficking]], stealing a child with the intent to exploit the child themselves or through trade to someone who will abuse the child through [[child slavery|slavery]], [[child labor|forced labor]], or [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]].\n** [[murder]]\n\n== Parental child abduction ==\n{{Main|Parental child abduction}}\nBy far the most common kind of child abduction is parental child abduction (200,000 in 2010 alone).<ref>{{cite book|last=Maureen|first=Dabbagh|title=Parental Kidnapping in America|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-6533-0|page=1|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6533-0|access-date=2012-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509022012/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6533-0|archive-date=2012-05-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It often occurs when the parents separate or begin [[divorce]] proceedings. A parent may remove or retain the child from the other seeking to gain an advantage in expected or pending child-custody proceedings or because that parent fears losing the child in those expected or pending child-custody proceedings; a parent may refuse to return a child at the end of an [[contact (law)|access]] visit or may flee with the child to prevent an access visit or fear of [[domestic violence]] and abuse.\n\nParental child abductions may result in the child be kept within the same city, within the state or region, within the same country, or sometimes may result in the child being taken to a different country. \n\nMost parental abductions are resolved fairly quickly.

Another related situation is retention where children are taken on an alleged vacation to a foreign country and are not returned.\n\nWhile the number of cases which is over 600,000 a year consists of international child abduction is small in comparison to domestic cases, they are often the most difficult to resolve due to the involvement of conflicting international jurisdictions.  Two-thirds of international parental abduction cases involve mothers who often allege domestic violence. Even when there is a treaty agreement for the return of a child, the court may be reluctant to return the child if the return could result in the permanent separation of the child from their primary caregiver. This could occur if the abducting parent faced criminal prosecution or deportation by returning to the child's home country.\n\nThe [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] is an international human rights treaty and legal mechanism to recover children abducted to another country. The Hague Convention does not provide relief in many cases, resulting in some parents hiring private parties to recover their children. Covert recovery was first made public when Don Feeney, a former Delta Commando, responded to a desperate mother's plea to locate and recover her daughter from Jordan in the 1980s. Feeney successfully located and returned the child. A movie and book about Feeney's exploits lead to other desperate parents seeking him out for recovery services.<ref>{{cite web|author=&#8250 Donya Al-Nahi |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671769340 |title=Rescue My Child: The Story of the Ex-Delta Commandos Who Bring Home Children Abducted Overseas: Neil C.

The primary focus was on Hague Cases. Development of mediation in Hague cases, suitable for such an approach, had been tested and reported by REUNITE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reunite.org/ |title=Reunite International |publisher=Reunite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> a London Based NGO which provides support in international child abduction cases, as successful.

Margaret Pool, 20-months-old, was kidnapped on May 20 by Nancy Gamble (19-years-old) and secreted with the assistance of Marie Thomas. On May 22, the parents, James and Mary Pool, placed an ad in the ''Baltimore Patriot'' newspaper offering a $20 reward for Mary's return. When the child was recovered on May 23\u2014through the efforts of members of the community who conducted a search\u2014it was revealed that the child had been badly whipped by Gamble and bore bloody wounds. Both Gamble and Thomas were tried for the crime of kidnapping and found guilty. The motive for the crime was demonstrated to be financial. She had kidnapped the child with the intention of waiting for a reward to be offered, then would return the child and collect the money. This is a technique favored by many ransom child kidnappers before the use of written ransom demands became the favored method.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Nancy Gamble's crime and subsequent trial were reported in detail in ''Baltimore Patriot'' (June 26, 1819).

Occurring around parental [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]], such parental or familial child abduction may include [[parental alienation]], a form of child abuse seeking to disconnect a child from targeted parent and denigrated side of [[family]].  This is, by far, the most common form of child abduction.\n* [[Kidnapping|Abduction or kidnapping]] by strangers (by people unknown to the child and outside the child's family) is rare.  Some of the reasons why a stranger might kidnap an unknown child include:\n**[[extortion]] to elicit a [[ransom]] from the parents for the child's return\n** illegal [[adoption]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to rear the child as their own or to sell to a prospective adoptive parent\n** [[human trafficking]], stealing a child with the intent to exploit the child themselves or through trade to someone who will abuse the child through [[child slavery|slavery]], [[child labor|forced labor]], or [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]].\n** [[murder]]\n\n== Parental child abduction ==\n{{Main|Parental child abduction}}\nBy far the most common kind of child abduction is parental child abduction (200,000 in 2010 alone).<ref>{{cite book|last=Maureen|first=Dabbagh|title=Parental Kidnapping in America|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-6533-0|page=1|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6533-0|access-date=2012-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509022012/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6533-0|archive-date=2012-05-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It often occurs when the parents separate or begin [[divorce]] proceedings. A parent may remove or retain the child from the other seeking to gain an advantage in expected or pending child-custody proceedings or because that parent fears losing the child in those expected or pending child-custody proceedings; a parent may refuse to return a child at the end of an [[contact (law)|access]] visit or may flee with the child to prevent an access visit or fear of [[domestic violence]] and abuse.\n\nParental child abductions may result in the child be kept within the same city, within the state or region, within the same country, or sometimes may result in the child being taken to a different country. \n\nMost parental abductions are resolved fairly quickly.

Another related situation is retention where children are taken on an alleged vacation to a foreign country and are not returned.\n\nWhile the number of cases which is over 600,000 a year consists of international child abduction is small in comparison to domestic cases, they are often the most difficult to resolve due to the involvement of conflicting international jurisdictions.  Two-thirds of international parental abduction cases involve mothers who often allege domestic violence. Even when there is a treaty agreement for the return of a child, the court may be reluctant to return the child if the return could result in the permanent separation of the child from their primary caregiver. This could occur if the abducting parent faced criminal prosecution or deportation by returning to the child's home country.\n\nThe [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] is an international human rights treaty and legal mechanism to recover children abducted to another country. The Hague Convention does not provide relief in many cases, resulting in some parents hiring private parties to recover their children. Covert recovery was first made public when Don Feeney, a former Delta Commando, responded to a desperate mother's plea to locate and recover her daughter from Jordan in the 1980s. Feeney successfully located and returned the child. A movie and book about Feeney's exploits lead to other desperate parents seeking him out for recovery services.<ref>{{cite web|author=&#8250 Donya Al-Nahi |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671769340 |title=Rescue My Child: The Story of the Ex-Delta Commandos Who Bring Home Children Abducted Overseas: Neil C.

The primary focus was on Hague Cases. Development of mediation in Hague cases, suitable for such an approach, had been tested and reported by REUNITE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reunite.org/ |title=Reunite International |publisher=Reunite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> a London Based NGO which provides support in international child abduction cases, as successful.

A case of international child abduction has been documented aboard the Titanic. However, the incidence of international child abduction continues to increase due to the ease of international travel, increase in bi-cultural marriages and a high divorce rate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dominguez |first1=C.R. |title=Psychological assessment and international law: Cross border relocations and abduction of children |journal=Papeles del Psic\u00f3logo |date=2015 |volume=36 |issue=1 |page=46 |url=https://doaj.org/article/e6a1bf01536b4c60b99fa1a43e882f4c |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Abductions by strangers ==\nThe stereotypical version of kidnapping by a stranger is the classic form of \"[[kidnapping]],\" exemplified by the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], in which the child is detained, transported some distance, held for ransom or with intent to keep the child permanently.

Margaret Pool, 20-months-old, was kidnapped on May 20 by Nancy Gamble (19-years-old) and secreted with the assistance of Marie Thomas. On May 22, the parents, James and Mary Pool, placed an ad in the ''Baltimore Patriot'' newspaper offering a $20 reward for Mary's return. When the child was recovered on May 23\u2014through the efforts of members of the community who conducted a search\u2014it was revealed that the child had been badly whipped by Gamble and bore bloody wounds. Both Gamble and Thomas were tried for the crime of kidnapping and found guilty. The motive for the crime was demonstrated to be financial. She had kidnapped the child with the intention of waiting for a reward to be offered, then would return the child and collect the money. This is a technique favored by many ransom child kidnappers before the use of written ransom demands became the favored method.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Nancy Gamble's crime and subsequent trial were reported in detail in ''Baltimore Patriot'' (June 26, 1819). The June 26 article, as well as others on the case that had appeared in the ''Patriot'', were reprinted in newspapers in other states including: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington D.C.\n\n=== Children abducted for slavery ===\n{{Main|Child slavery}}\n{{Child soldiers}}\nIn 1597, [[Elizabeth I of England]] licensed the abduction of children for use as chapel choristers and theatre performers.<ref name=\"bbc130617\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22938866|title=Elizabethan child actors 'kidnapped and whipped'|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|date=17 June 2013|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nThere are reports that abduction of children to be used or sold as [[slavery|slaves]] is common in parts of Africa.\n\nThe [[Lord's Resistance Army]], a rebel paramilitary group operating mainly in northern [[Uganda]], is notorious for its abductions of children for use as [[child soldier]]s or [[sex slave]]s.

The archdiocese contains 199 parishes and has three Catholic colleges: [[Loras College]] and [[Clarke University]] in Dubuque and [[Mount Mercy University]] in Cedar Rapids. A number of religious orders maintain a presence in the archdiocese.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNotable orders include the Trappist monastery [[New Melleray Abbey]] (male) southwest of Dubuque, and the Trappistine monastery [[Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey]] (female) south of Dubuque. The archdiocese is also home to the motherhouse of the [[Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]. The [[Basilica of St. Francis Xavier, Dyersville|Basilica of St. Francis Xavier]] is located in the archdiocese, located in [[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]], about {{convert|25|mi|km}} west of Dubuque.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Prior to the founding===\nDuring the years prior to the founding of the Dubuque Diocese, the area was under the jurisdiction of a number of bishops.  Many of these were purely academic as no Catholic presence yet existed in the area.  Most notable among these was the St. Louis Diocese under [[Bishop]] Rosati.  During the early 1830s it was under his jurisdiction that the early missionaries arrived in what would become the state of Iowa.\n\nIn the 1830s, the church studied how to address the expansion of the [[United States]] into the western frontiers.  Those conducting the study recommended to the pope that three new dioceses be created, one of which was the Dubuque Diocese. Father Charles Fitzmaurice established the Saint Raphael's parish at Dubuque in 1833.  This was the first church of any [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination in the territory that would become the state of Iowa.\n\n[[Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli]] was one of the most famous missionaries to work in the Dubuque area.  He established a number of parishes in Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin; several were named after the Archangels: Saint Raphael's in Dubuque, Saint Michael's at Galena, Illinois, and Saint Gabriel's at [[Prairie du Chien]], Wisconsin.  [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Father Mazzuchelli ''[[The Venerable|Venerable]]'' in 1993, and his case for sainthood is pending.\n\n===Early years===\n[[Pope Gregory XVI]] created the Dubuque Diocese on July 28, 1837, and named [[Bishop Mathias Loras]] as its first bishop.  Loras gathered funds and personnel for the new diocese, and he arrived in 1839. St. Raphael's became the cathedral parish in August of that year. He oversaw the expansion of the church in the early years of the diocese, first in the Iowa territory, then after 1846 in the new state of Iowa.\n\nBishop Loras encouraged immigration to the area, especially German and Irish settlers. He oversaw the creation of new parishes and also he invited several religious orders to the area. This included the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] order that built the [[New Melleray Abbey|New Melleray Monastery]] south of Dubuque. Shortly before his death, he directed the construction of the third structure to house St. Raphael's Cathedral which remains today.\n\n{{anchor|Uptown}}A second catholic parish was planned as the Uptown Catholic Parish to be located on the west side of Main Street between 7th and 8th streets in Dubuque. Loras planned the parish due to crowded conditions at the Cathedral. A cornerstone was laid for the parish church, but construction work never proceeded past the laying of the foundation. In 1850, [[Pope Pius IX]] separated territory from the Diocese of Dubuque to form the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Diocese of Saint Paul]], serving [[Minnesota Territory]] (later [[Minnesota]] and [[the Dakotas]]).\n\n===Expansion and elevation===\nIn 1858, Bishop Smyth established Saint Francis Catholic Church in [[Balltown, Iowa|Balltown]]. Rev. Clement Smyth, [[Trappists|OCSO]] served as bishop from February 1858 to September 1865  and oversaw continued expansion of the Catholic Church in the diocese.  During his episcopacy the German Catholics of the city of Dubuque began construction of a new Saint Mary's church to replace the too-small Church of the Holy Trinity.\n\nIn 1863, Smyth learned of the existence of the pro-Southern [[Knights of the Golden Circle]], with headquarters in Dubuque. He gave members who might be Catholic two weeks to withdraw from the organization or be automatically excommunicated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Knights of the Golden Circle|url=http://knightofthegoldencircle.wordpress.com|date=June 13, 2014|first=Rudi|last=Keller}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bishop Smyth died in 1865, John Hennessey succeeded him as Bishop of Dubuque.  During Hennessey's tenure, the population of Dubuque exploded as the Milwaukee Railroad Shops came to the city.  Hennessey created several parishes in Dubuque: Sacred Heart, Holy Ghost, St. Anthony's, and Holy Trinity to deal with this population explosion. During this time, Bishop Hennessey proposed separating territory from the diocese to create a new diocese for southern Iowa.  While he proposed [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] as the seat of the new diocese, [[Pope Leo XIII]] selected [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] as the site.\n\nNicholas E. Gonner (1835\u20131892), a Catholic immigrant from [[Luxembourg]], founded the Catholic Publishing Company of Dubuque. His son Nicholas E. Gonner (1835\u20131892) took over in 1892, editing two German language weeklies, an English language weekly, and the ''Daily Tribune,'' the only Catholic daily newspaper ever published in the United States.<ref>{{cite book| editor-first=Thomas|editor-last=Adam|title=Germany and the Americas|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA458|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=458|isbn=978-1851096282}}</ref>\n\nOn June 15, 1893, Pope Leo XIII elevated the Dubuque Diocese to an archdiocese, and Bishop Hennessey became the first archbishop.  Archbishop Hennessey died in 1900 and was buried at the cathedral.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAfter the death of Archbishop Hennessey, Archbishop [[John Joseph Keane|John J. Keane]] led the archdiocese for eleven years until poor health forced him to retire in 1911.  During his tenure, the archdiocese lost its western territory to form the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sioux City|Diocese of Sioux City]] and achieved its current size.\n[[Image:ArchbishopHennessy.jpg|thumbnail|right|215px|Archbishop [[John Hennessy (Archbishop)|John Hennessy]], became third Bishop of Dubuque in 1866, and its first archbishop upon elevation of Dubuque to an archdiocese in 1893.]]\n\n===The Great Depression and World War II===\nDuring the years of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], Archbishop Francis J.L. Beckman occupied the see. In the years leading up to the war, Beckman opposed military action. A collector of fine art pieces, he had placed a number of art pieces in a museum at Columbia (now Loras) College and perhaps, thinking he could gain funds to further his collection, involved the archdiocese in what turned out to be a dubious gold mine scheme. Beckman signed notes on behalf of the archdiocese, which suffered a loss of more than $500,000 when the scheme fell apart and the perpetrator of the scheme (Phillip Suetter, of California) was arrested. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] directed the [[FBI]] to investigate Beckman to determine his role in the financial scheme. Most of Beckman's collection was sold to pay the notes.\n\nBecause of Beckman's troubles, Bishop Henry Rohlman returned from the Davenport, Iowa, diocese to become [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor archbishop]] in 1944. Beckman was allowed to retain his office, but was informed that Rohlman now led the archdiocese. Beckman retired in 1947, and left Dubuque for Cincinnati.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, [[Japan]] bombed [[Pearl Harbor]]. One of the casualties in that attack was [[Father Aloysius Schmitt]], a priest of the archdiocese, who was serving on board the [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'']].  The boat capsized during the attack, leaving Schmitt and other men trapped below with only a small porthole for escape. Schmitt declined to be pulled from the ship, and instead helped other men, twelve in all, to escape, but perished himself. Schmitt was the first chaplain of any denomination to die in World War II. For his actions, he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and a destroyer was named in his honor.\n\n===Postwar era===\nSoon after the war, Admiral Byrd led an expedition to the Antarctica. The [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|chaplain]] on his flagship, [[William Menster|Fr. William Menster]], was a priest of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. Menster became the first priest to set foot on the continent, and later consecrated Antarctica in 1947. One of the effects of the post-war [[baby boom]] was an increase in the number of students at some Catholic schools.  In Dubuque, the Sacred Heart parish school had the largest student population of such schools in the midwest.  On December 2, 1954, Archbishop Leo Binz succeeded Archbishop Rohlman as Archbishop of Dubuque and served in that capacity until December 16, 1961, when he became [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Archbishop of Saint Paul, Minnesota]].\n\n===Second Vatican Council and the aftermath===\nJames Byrne was named the next archbishop of Dubuque on March 7, 1962, and was formally installed at St. Raphael's on May 8, 1962.  He attended all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Archbishop Byrne implemented the changes brought about by the council in the Archdiocese of Dubuque and quickly established the Priests Senate, a clergy advisory board, as well as another advisory board dealing with assignment of priests. These were among the first such boards founded in the United States. Archbishop Byrne retired from office on August 23, 1983, and remained in Dubuque until his death August 2, 1996.\n\n===Late 20th-early 21st centuries===\nOn February 23, 1984, [[Daniel Kucera|Daniel William Kucera]], OSB, was installed as the tenth bishop and eighth archbishop of Dubuque.  Archbishop Kucera had earned a doctorate in education.  At 36, he had become the youngest president of St. Procopius College (now known as [[Benedictine University]]).  His background in education led Vatican officials, including the [[pope]], to seek his advice.\n\nDuring Kucera's tenure as archbishop, he remodeled St. Raphael's Cathedral, revised and published the guidelines for the sacrament of [[Confirmation]], reduced the number of deaneries from 16 to 14, reorganized the structure of the archdiocese and created an archbishop's cabinet to coordinate administration of the archdiocese.\n\nIn 1987, Kucera also launched a plan that divided the archdiocese into three regions with a resident bishop in each. The [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] Region was served by retired Archbishop James Byrne and Archbishop Kucera; the [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]] Region by Bishop Francis Dunn, and [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]] Region by Fr. William Franklin who was consecrated as a bishop in April 1987. However, Bishop Kucera eventually dropped the plan after the death of Bishop Dunn in 1989 and Bishop Franklin's nomination as the head of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport|Diocese of Davenport]].\n\nIn 1986 the archdiocese celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding; Archbishop Kucera received an honorary degree from the [[University of Dubuque]].

In recent years many smaller, rural parishes have had to close and their congregations had been absorbed into other nearby parishes. Some rural parishes have been clustered together where one priest will serve two or more parishes. Some parishes have no resident priest.\n\nAnother effect is that some duties that a priest would have performed in the past are performed by either religious ([[Religious sister (Catholic)|sister]] or deacon) individuals, or by the laity.\n\n===Education issues===\nIn recent years, many questions have been raised about the future of Catholic schools.  With parishes closing or combining services, schools were also combined together.  In recent times, schools in a given geographical area have all been joined together into a school system.\n\nIn Dubuque, the Catholic schools are all part of the Holy Family system. There has been much controversy recently about how to best run the schools. The administrators of the system had recently made plans to reorganize the schools. This was due to factors such as a declining number of students attending Catholic schools. An especially controversial move that was proposed was to turn St. Anthony's school into a central school for certain grades. Parents of the parish felt that their concerns were being ignored.  Eventually, the Archdiocesan Board of Education vetoed the plan, and told the school system to continue work on planning the system's future.\n\n===Controversy over ''The Passion of the Christ''===\nThe [[Mel Gibson]] film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' caused controversy in the archdiocese as well. That controversy has long since passed. One of the main issues raised by the film was an editorial cartoon on the movie that the ''[[Dubuque Telegraph-Herald]]'' published in its editorial section. This cartoon featured a religious sister using corporal punishment. Some in the community have felt that this was a slight against the sisters and all their years of hard work.  Others, mainly middle age to older adults, have said that this was representative of the sisters who taught them while they were in school.\n\n==Early parishes==\n===Saint Francis Catholic Church===\nSaint Francis Catholic Church is located in [[Balltown, Iowa|Balltown]]. As of 2006, the church did not have a resident pastor.  The parish is part of a cluster of several other rural parishes in northern [[Dubuque County, Iowa]], that share a pastor and other facilities.\n\nThe parish traces its history back to 1858. A number of area residents had petitioned [[Bishop]] [[Mathias Loras]] to establish a Catholic parish in the Balltown area. Loras came to the area and offered Mass in a [[log cabin]] near Balltown. Residents gathered the funds to build a church and school.\n\nIn 1891, local resident Andreas Rapp and his wife donated some land, which allowed for the construction of a brick building containing a school and a convent for the sisters, as well as the establishment of a cemetery.  The school opened in September of that year with 45 children attending. Another local resident, Peter Cremer, donated land for a new church, and in 1892 the cornerstone for the second St. Francis Church building was laid.\n\nThe second St. Francis Church building would serve the parish until August 27, 1976, when [[lightning]] struck the steeple, causing a fire which destroyed the church building. In the aftermath a new St. Francis Church was constructed, while the old convent building was torn down to make room for the new church.\n\n===Saint John the Baptist Catholic Church===\nSaint John the Baptist Catholic Church is located in [[Peosta, Iowa|Peosta]] on Sundown Road, just to the north of [[U.S. Highway 20]].  The church building is a newer structure, having been built in the late 1980s.  As a result, it reflects some of the more recent trends in the church, including having the congregation arranged in a semicircle around the altar.\n\nCurrently, the pastor of St. John the Baptist Church is Father Richard Kuhn, who also covers Holy Family Catholic Church located about three miles away. The offices for both parishes are located at St. John's.  The archdiocese has indicated that when Fr. Kuhn retires this arrangement will probably be changed due to the [[priest shortage]], and St. John's would be clustered with several other nearby parishes. The parish has recently grown to the point where it is considering expanding or replacing the current church building.\n\n===Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church===\n[[File:SsPeterPaulIADec03.JPG|thumbnail|250px|Side view of Saints Peter and Paul Church, from the cemetery.]]\nSaints Peter and Paul Catholic Church is the parish for the Dubuque County town of [[Sherrill, Iowa|Sherrill]].  It is part of a cluster of rural parishes that share a pastor and other facilities.\n\n====History====\n[[File:Geschenk.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|Panel in the church's window donated by Catharina Gansemer (1824\u20131904), an early parishioner and area pioneer. \"Geschenk von\" means \"gift of\".]]\nThe parish was founded in 1852 as St. William's. Prior to this, residents living in the Sherrill area needed to travel to Dubuque about 15 miles away to attend Mass, a considerable distance at the time.  In response to the need for a local church to accommodate the heavy German Catholic immigration to the rural districts surrounding Sherrill, Dubuque [[Bishop]] [[Mathias Loras]] established the parish.\n\nBy the 1860s the name of Saints Peter and Paul had been adopted, and in 1889 the original wooden church was replaced by a large, brick and stone [[Romanesque Revival]] structure, which remains in use today. During the 1970s, the church's original carved wood [[altar]]s were removed and its 19th-century wood trim was painted over. Recently parish members completed a renovation of the building that restored the wood trim and added decorative details suggestive of its past. Inscriptions on the church's [[stained glass]] windows and on the older [[headstone]]s in its adjoining [[cemetery]] are in [[German language|German]], reflecting the culture of the parish's founding members.\n\nFor well over 100 years the parish school was operated by the [[Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration]] (FSPA) of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], [[Wisconsin]], and many girls of the parish who felt a calling to religious life joined that order. The school is still operated on the premises of the parish by the [[Archdiocese of Dubuque]], as a consolidation of the original school and the Catholic school which once served the nearby community of [[Balltown, Iowa|Balltown]], [[Iowa]].\n\n==Other==\nOther early parishes in the diocese include [[Saint Mary's Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|Saint Mary's]], [[Sacred Heart Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|Sacred Heart]], [[Holy Ghost Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|Holy Ghost]], and Saint Anthony's.\n\n==Schools==\n===High schools===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Dubuquensis}}) is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the northeastern quarter of the state of [[Iowa]] in the [[United States]].  \n\nIt includes all the Iowa counties north of [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk]], [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper]], [[Poweshiek County, Iowa|Poweshiek]], [[Iowa County, Iowa|Iowa]], [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]], [[Cedar County, Iowa|Cedar]], and [[Clinton County, Iowa|Clinton]] counties, and east of [[Kossuth County, Iowa|Kossuth]], [[Humboldt County, Iowa|Humboldt]], [[Webster County, Iowa|Webster]] and [[Boone County, Iowa|Boone]] counties.  The archdiocese has an area of about {{convert|17,400|sqmi|km2}}.\n\n==Background==\nThe seat of the archdiocese is [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral, Dubuque]], named in honor of the [[Archangel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]].  \n\nThe twelfth and current [[archbishop]] is [[Michael Owen Jackels]].<ref name=CNA>{{cite news|title=Pope appoints Bishop Jackels to lead Dubuque archdiocese|date=April 8, 2013| url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-appoints-bishop-jackels-to-lead-dubuque-archdiocese|first=David|last=Uebbing|publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]}}</ref> \n\nJackels completed a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|Doctorate in Sacred Theology]] at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in [[Rome]] in 1989. \n\nOn April 4, 2005, he was consecrated bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita]], USA.<ref name=Bulletin>{{cite news| title=Rinunce e Nomine: Nomina dell'Arcivescovo Metropolito di Dubuque (U.S.A.)| url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2013/04/08/0208/00466.pdf| date=April 8, 2013|trans-title=Waivers and Nominations: Appointment of the Metropolitan Archbishop of Dubuque (U.S.A.)| work=Daily Bulletin| publisher=[[Holy See Press Office]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Archdiocese of Dubuque is one of only a handful of [[List_of_Catholic_archdioceses#Current_Latin_in_North_America|US archdioceses]] not based in a major metropolitan area.  The archdiocese contains 199 parishes and has three Catholic colleges: [[Loras College]] and [[Clarke University]] in Dubuque and [[Mount Mercy University]] in Cedar Rapids. A number of religious orders maintain a presence in the archdiocese.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nNotable orders include the Trappist monastery [[New Melleray Abbey]] (male) southwest of Dubuque, and the Trappistine monastery [[Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey]] (female) south of Dubuque. The archdiocese is also home to the motherhouse of the [[Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]. The [[Basilica of St. Francis Xavier, Dyersville|Basilica of St. Francis Xavier]] is located in the archdiocese, located in [[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]], about {{convert|25|mi|km}} west of Dubuque.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n===Prior to the founding===\nDuring the years prior to the founding of the Dubuque Diocese, the area was under the jurisdiction of a number of bishops.  Many of these were purely academic as no Catholic presence yet existed in the area.  Most notable among these was the St. Louis Diocese under [[Bishop]] Rosati.  During the early 1830s it was under his jurisdiction that the early missionaries arrived in what would become the state of Iowa.\n\nIn the 1830s, the church studied how to address the expansion of the [[United States]] into the western frontiers.  Those conducting the study recommended to the pope that three new dioceses be created, one of which was the Dubuque Diocese. Father Charles Fitzmaurice established the Saint Raphael's parish at Dubuque in 1833.  This was the first church of any [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination in the territory that would become the state of Iowa.\n\n[[Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli]] was one of the most famous missionaries to work in the Dubuque area.  He established a number of parishes in Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin; several were named after the Archangels: Saint Raphael's in Dubuque, Saint Michael's at Galena, Illinois, and Saint Gabriel's at [[Prairie du Chien]], Wisconsin.  [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Father Mazzuchelli ''[[The Venerable|Venerable]]'' in 1993, and his case for sainthood is pending.\n\n===Early years===\n[[Pope Gregory XVI]] created the Dubuque Diocese on July 28, 1837, and named [[Bishop Mathias Loras]] as its first bishop.  Loras gathered funds and personnel for the new diocese, and he arrived in 1839. St. Raphael's became the cathedral parish in August of that year. He oversaw the expansion of the church in the early years of the diocese, first in the Iowa territory, then after 1846 in the new state of Iowa.\n\nBishop Loras encouraged immigration to the area, especially German and Irish settlers. He oversaw the creation of new parishes and also he invited several religious orders to the area. This included the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] order that built the [[New Melleray Abbey|New Melleray Monastery]] south of Dubuque. Shortly before his death, he directed the construction of the third structure to house St. Raphael's Cathedral which remains today.\n\n{{anchor|Uptown}}A second catholic parish was planned as the Uptown Catholic Parish to be located on the west side of Main Street between 7th and 8th streets in Dubuque. Loras planned the parish due to crowded conditions at the Cathedral. A cornerstone was laid for the parish church, but construction work never proceeded past the laying of the foundation. In 1850, [[Pope Pius IX]] separated territory from the Diocese of Dubuque to form the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Diocese of Saint Paul]], serving [[Minnesota Territory]] (later [[Minnesota]] and [[the Dakotas]]).\n\n===Expansion and elevation===\nIn 1858, Bishop Smyth established Saint Francis Catholic Church in [[Balltown, Iowa|Balltown]]. Rev. Clement Smyth, [[Trappists|OCSO]] served as bishop from February 1858 to September 1865  and oversaw continued expansion of the Catholic Church in the diocese.  During his episcopacy the German Catholics of the city of Dubuque began construction of a new Saint Mary's church to replace the too-small Church of the Holy Trinity.\n\nIn 1863, Smyth learned of the existence of the pro-Southern [[Knights of the Golden Circle]], with headquarters in Dubuque. He gave members who might be Catholic two weeks to withdraw from the organization or be automatically excommunicated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Knights of the Golden Circle|url=http://knightofthegoldencircle.wordpress.com|date=June 13, 2014|first=Rudi|last=Keller}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bishop Smyth died in 1865, John Hennessey succeeded him as Bishop of Dubuque.  During Hennessey's tenure, the population of Dubuque exploded as the Milwaukee Railroad Shops came to the city.  Hennessey created several parishes in Dubuque: Sacred Heart, Holy Ghost, St. Anthony's, and Holy Trinity to deal with this population explosion. During this time, Bishop Hennessey proposed separating territory from the diocese to create a new diocese for southern Iowa.  While he proposed [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] as the seat of the new diocese, [[Pope Leo XIII]] selected [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] as the site.\n\nNicholas E. Gonner (1835\u20131892), a Catholic immigrant from [[Luxembourg]], founded the Catholic Publishing Company of Dubuque. His son Nicholas E. Gonner (1835\u20131892) took over in 1892, editing two German language weeklies, an English language weekly, and the ''Daily Tribune,'' the only Catholic daily newspaper ever published in the United States.<ref>{{cite book| editor-first=Thomas|editor-last=Adam|title=Germany and the Americas|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA458|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=458|isbn=978-1851096282}}</ref>\n\nOn June 15, 1893, Pope Leo XIII elevated the Dubuque Diocese to an archdiocese, and Bishop Hennessey became the first archbishop.  Archbishop Hennessey died in 1900 and was buried at the cathedral.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAfter the death of Archbishop Hennessey, Archbishop [[John Joseph Keane|John J. Keane]] led the archdiocese for eleven years until poor health forced him to retire in 1911.  During his tenure, the archdiocese lost its western territory to form the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sioux City|Diocese of Sioux City]] and achieved its current size.\n[[Image:ArchbishopHennessy.jpg|thumbnail|right|215px|Archbishop [[John Hennessy (Archbishop)|John Hennessy]], became third Bishop of Dubuque in 1866, and its first archbishop upon elevation of Dubuque to an archdiocese in 1893.]]\n\n===The Great Depression and World War II===\nDuring the years of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], Archbishop Francis J.L. Beckman occupied the see. In the years leading up to the war, Beckman opposed military action. A collector of fine art pieces, he had placed a number of art pieces in a museum at Columbia (now Loras) College and perhaps, thinking he could gain funds to further his collection, involved the archdiocese in what turned out to be a dubious gold mine scheme. Beckman signed notes on behalf of the archdiocese, which suffered a loss of more than $500,000 when the scheme fell apart and the perpetrator of the scheme (Phillip Suetter, of California) was arrested. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] directed the [[FBI]] to investigate Beckman to determine his role in the financial scheme. Most of Beckman's collection was sold to pay the notes.\n\nBecause of Beckman's troubles, Bishop Henry Rohlman returned from the Davenport, Iowa, diocese to become [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor archbishop]] in 1944. Beckman was allowed to retain his office, but was informed that Rohlman now led the archdiocese. Beckman retired in 1947, and left Dubuque for Cincinnati.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, [[Japan]] bombed [[Pearl Harbor]]. One of the casualties in that attack was [[Father Aloysius Schmitt]], a priest of the archdiocese, who was serving on board the [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'']].  The boat capsized during the attack, leaving Schmitt and other men trapped below with only a small porthole for escape. Schmitt declined to be pulled from the ship, and instead helped other men, twelve in all, to escape, but perished himself. Schmitt was the first chaplain of any denomination to die in World War II. For his actions, he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and a destroyer was named in his honor.\n\n===Postwar era===\nSoon after the war, Admiral Byrd led an expedition to the Antarctica. The [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|chaplain]] on his flagship, [[William Menster|Fr. William Menster]], was a priest of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. Menster became the first priest to set foot on the continent, and later consecrated Antarctica in 1947. One of the effects of the post-war [[baby boom]] was an increase in the number of students at some Catholic schools.  In Dubuque, the Sacred Heart parish school had the largest student population of such schools in the midwest.  On December 2, 1954, Archbishop Leo Binz succeeded Archbishop Rohlman as Archbishop of Dubuque and served in that capacity until December 16, 1961, when he became [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Archbishop of Saint Paul, Minnesota]].\n\n===Second Vatican Council and the aftermath===\nJames Byrne was named the next archbishop of Dubuque on March 7, 1962, and was formally installed at St. Raphael's on May 8, 1962.  He attended all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Archbishop Byrne implemented the changes brought about by the council in the Archdiocese of Dubuque and quickly established the Priests Senate, a clergy advisory board, as well as another advisory board dealing with assignment of priests. These were among the first such boards founded in the United States. Archbishop Byrne retired from office on August 23, 1983, and remained in Dubuque until his death August 2, 1996.\n\n===Late 20th-early 21st centuries===\nOn February 23, 1984, [[Daniel Kucera|Daniel William Kucera]], OSB, was installed as the tenth bishop and eighth archbishop of Dubuque.  Archbishop Kucera had earned a doctorate in education.  At 36, he had become the youngest president of St. Procopius College (now known as [[Benedictine University]]).  His background in education led Vatican officials, including the [[pope]], to seek his advice.\n\nDuring Kucera's tenure as archbishop, he remodeled St. Raphael's Cathedral, revised and published the guidelines for the sacrament of [[Confirmation]], reduced the number of deaneries from 16 to 14, reorganized the structure of the archdiocese and created an archbishop's cabinet to coordinate administration of the archdiocese.\n\nIn 1987, Kucera also launched a plan that divided the archdiocese into three regions with a resident bishop in each. The [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] Region was served by retired Archbishop James Byrne and Archbishop Kucera; the [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]] Region by Bishop Francis Dunn, and [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]] Region by Fr. William Franklin who was consecrated as a bishop in April 1987. However, Bishop Kucera eventually dropped the plan after the death of Bishop Dunn in 1989 and Bishop Franklin's nomination as the head of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport|Diocese of Davenport]].\n\nIn 1986 the archdiocese celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding; Archbishop Kucera received an honorary degree from the [[University of Dubuque]].  On October 16, 1995, Archbishop Kucera retired, moved to Aurora, Colorado, and then subsequently returned to live in Dubuque.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Bishops of Dubuque===\n# [[Mathias Loras]] (1837\u20131858)\n# [[Clement Smyth]], OCSO (1858\u20131865)\n\n===Archbishops of Dubuque===\n# [[John Hennessy (Archbishop)|John Hennessey]] (1866\u20131900), elevated to [[Archbishop]] in 1893\n# [[John Keane (Archbishop)|John Keane]] (1900\u20131911)\n# [[James Keane (Archbishop)|James Keane]] (1911\u20131929)\n# [[Francis Beckman]] (1930\u20131946)\n# [[Henry Rohlman]] (1946\u20131954)\n# [[Leo Binz]] (1954\u20131961), appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]]\n# [[James Byrne (Archbishop)|James Byrne]] (1962\u20131983)\n# [[Daniel Kucera]], OSB (1983\u20131995)\n# [[Jerome Hanus]], OSB (1995\u20132013)\n# [[Michael Owen Jackels]] (2013\u2013present)\n\n===Coadjutor Archbishops===\n* [[Henry Rohlman]] (1944\u20131946)\n* [[Jerome Hanus]], OSB (1994)\n\n===Auxiliary bishops===\n* [[Edward Aloysius Fitzgerald]] (1946\u20131949), appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Winona|Bishop of Winona]]\n* [[Loras Thomas Lane]] (1951\u20131956), appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockford|Bishop of Rockford]]\n* [[George Biskup]] (1957\u20131965), appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Des Moines|Bishop of Des Moines]] and later Coadjutor Archbishop and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis|Archbishop of Indianapolis]]\n* [[Loras Joseph Watters]] (1965\u20131969), appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Winona|Bishop of Winona]]\n* [[Francis John Dunn]] (1969\u20131989)\n* [[William Edwin Franklin]] (1987\u20131993), appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport|Bishop of Davenport]]\n\n===Other priests of this diocese who became bishops===\n*[[Joseph Cr\u00e9tin]], appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Bishop of Saint Paul]] in 1850\n* [[J.

In recent years many smaller, rural parishes have had to close and their congregations had been absorbed into other nearby parishes. Some rural parishes have been clustered together where one priest will serve two or more parishes. Some parishes have no resident priest. \n\nAnother effect is that some duties that a priest would have performed in the past are performed by either religious ([[Religious sister (Catholic)|sister]] or deacon) individuals, or by the laity.\n\n===Education issues===\nIn recent years, many questions have been raised about the future of Catholic schools.  With parishes closing or combining services, schools were also combined together.  In recent times, schools in a given geographical area have all been joined together into a school system.\n\nIn Dubuque, the Catholic schools are all part of the Holy Family system. There has been much controversy recently about how to best run the schools. The administrators of the system had recently made plans to reorganize the schools. This was due to factors such as a declining number of students attending Catholic schools. An especially controversial move that was proposed was to turn St. Anthony's school into a central school for certain grades. Parents of the parish felt that their concerns were being ignored.  Eventually, the Archdiocesan Board of Education vetoed the plan, and told the school system to continue work on planning the system's future.\n\n===Controversy over ''The Passion of the Christ''===\nThe [[Mel Gibson]] film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' caused controversy in the archdiocese as well. That controversy has long since passed. One of the main issues raised by the film was an editorial cartoon on the movie that the ''[[Dubuque Telegraph-Herald]]'' published in its editorial section. This cartoon featured a religious sister using corporal punishment. Some in the community have felt that this was a slight against the sisters and all their years of hard work.  Others, mainly middle age to older adults, have said that this was representative of the sisters who taught them while they were in school.\n\n==Early parishes==\n===Saint Francis Catholic Church===\nSaint Francis Catholic Church is located in [[Balltown, Iowa|Balltown]]. As of 2006, the church did not have a resident pastor.  The parish is part of a cluster of several other rural parishes in northern [[Dubuque County, Iowa]], that share a pastor and other facilities.\n\nThe parish traces its history back to 1858. A number of area residents had petitioned [[Bishop]] [[Mathias Loras]] to establish a Catholic parish in the Balltown area. Loras came to the area and offered Mass in a [[log cabin]] near Balltown. Residents gathered the funds to build a church and school.\n\nIn 1891, local resident Andreas Rapp and his wife donated some land, which allowed for the construction of a brick building containing a school and a convent for the sisters, as well as the establishment of a cemetery.  The school opened in September of that year with 45 children attending. Another local resident, Peter Cremer, donated land for a new church, and in 1892 the cornerstone for the second St. Francis Church building was laid.\n\nThe second St. Francis Church building would serve the parish until August 27, 1976, when [[lightning]] struck the steeple, causing a fire which destroyed the church building. In the aftermath a new St. Francis Church was constructed, while the old convent building was torn down to make room for the new church.\n\n===Saint John the Baptist Catholic Church===\nSaint John the Baptist Catholic Church is located in [[Peosta, Iowa|Peosta]] on Sundown Road, just to the north of [[U.S. Highway 20]].  The church building is a newer structure, having been built in the late 1980s.  As a result, it reflects some of the more recent trends in the church, including having the congregation arranged in a semicircle around the altar.\n\nCurrently, the pastor of St. John the Baptist Church is Father Richard Kuhn, who also covers Holy Family Catholic Church located about three miles away. The offices for both parishes are located at St. John's.  The archdiocese has indicated that when Fr. Kuhn retires this arrangement will probably be changed due to the [[priest shortage]], and St. John's would be clustered with several other nearby parishes. The parish has recently grown to the point where it is considering expanding or replacing the current church building.\n\n===Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church===\n[[File:SsPeterPaulIADec03.JPG|thumbnail|250px|Side view of Saints Peter and Paul Church, from the cemetery.]]\nSaints Peter and Paul Catholic Church is the parish for the Dubuque County town of [[Sherrill, Iowa|Sherrill]].  It is part of a cluster of rural parishes that share a pastor and other facilities.\n\n====History====\n[[File:Geschenk.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|Panel in the church's window donated by Catharina Gansemer (1824\u20131904), an early parishioner and area pioneer. \"Geschenk von\" means \"gift of\".]]\nThe parish was founded in 1852 as St. William's. Prior to this, residents living in the Sherrill area needed to travel to Dubuque about 15 miles away to attend Mass, a considerable distance at the time.  In response to the need for a local church to accommodate the heavy German Catholic immigration to the rural districts surrounding Sherrill, Dubuque [[Bishop]] [[Mathias Loras]] established the parish.\n\nBy the 1860s the name of Saints Peter and Paul had been adopted, and in 1889 the original wooden church was replaced by a large, brick and stone [[Romanesque Revival]] structure, which remains in use today. During the 1970s, the church's original carved wood [[altar]]s were removed and its 19th-century wood trim was painted over. Recently parish members completed a renovation of the building that restored the wood trim and added decorative details suggestive of its past. Inscriptions on the church's [[stained glass]] windows and on the older [[headstone]]s in its adjoining [[cemetery]] are in [[German language|German]], reflecting the culture of the parish's founding members.\n\nFor well over 100 years the parish school was operated by the [[Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration]] (FSPA) of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], [[Wisconsin]], and many girls of the parish who felt a calling to religious life joined that order. The school is still operated on the premises of the parish by the [[Archdiocese of Dubuque]], as a consolidation of the original school and the Catholic school which once served the nearby community of [[Balltown, Iowa|Balltown]], [[Iowa]].\n\n==Other==\nOther early parishes in the diocese include [[Saint Mary's Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|Saint Mary's]], [[Sacred Heart Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|Sacred Heart]], [[Holy Ghost Catholic Church (Dubuque, Iowa)|Holy Ghost]], and Saint Anthony's.\n\n==Schools==\n===High schools===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Throughout the first half of the novel, Miles and his friends Chip \"The Colonel\" Martin, Alaska Young, and Takumi Hikohito grow very close and the section culminates in Alaska's death. In the second half of the novel, Miles and his friends work to discover the missing details of the night Alaska died. While struggling to reconcile Alaska's death, Miles grapples with  Sim\u00f3n Bolivar's last words and the meaning of life, leaving the conclusion to these topics unresolved.\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a coming-of-age novel that touches on themes of meaning, grief, hope, and youth-adult relationships. The novel won the 2006 [[Michael L. Printz Award]] from the [[American Library Association]], and led the association's list of most-challenged books in 2015 due to profanity and a sexually explicit scene.<ref name=\":8\" /> Schools in Kentucky, Tennessee, and several other states have attempted to place bans on the book.

He also noted that his inspiration for the possessed swan in Culver Creek derived from a similar swan he remembers at Indian Springs. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at school, but Green emphasizes that while the setting is based on his life, the novel is entirely fictional.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JLuF8GmtH4|title=John Green's Legendary High School Prank|date=8 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Green became infatuated with famous last words, specifically those of [[John Adams]].

Alaska sets Pudge up with a Romanian classmate, Lara. Unfortunately, Pudge and Lara have a disastrous date, ending with a concussed Pudge throwing up on Lara. Alaska and Pudge grow closer and he begins to fall in love with her, although she insists on keeping their relationship [[Platonic love|platonic]] because she has a boyfriend at [[Vanderbilt University]] whom she insists she loves.\n\nOn his first night at Culver Creek, Pudge is kidnapped and thrown into a lake by the \"Weekday Warriors,\" a group of rich schoolmates who blame the Colonel and his friends for the expulsion of their friend, Paul. Paul's expulsion created tension between Pudge's friends and the Weekday Warriors. Takumi claims that they are innocent because their friend Marya was also [[expulsion (education)#United States and Canada|expelled]] during the incident.  However, Alaska later admits that she told on both Marya and Paul to the dean, Mr. Starnes, to save herself from being expelled.\n\nThe gang celebrates a successful series of pranks by drinking and partying, and an inebriated Alaska confides about her mother's death from an [[aneurysm]] when she was eight years old. Although she didn't understand at the time, she feels guilty for not calling 911. Pudge figures that her mother's death made Alaska impulsive and rash. He concludes that the labyrinth was a person's suffering and that humans must try to find their way out. Afterwards, Pudge grows closer to Lara, and they start dating. A week later, after another 'celebration', an intoxicated Alaska and Pudge spend the night with each other, when suddenly Alaska receives a phone call which causes her to go into hysterics. Insisting that she has to leave, Alaska drives away while drunk with Pudge and the Colonel distracting Mr. Starnes. They later learn that Alaska was [[driving under the influence|DUI]] and died.\n\nThe Colonel and Pudge are devastated and blame themselves, wondering about her reasons for undertaking the urgent drive and even contemplating that she might have deliberately killed herself. The Colonel insists on questioning Jake, her boyfriend, but Pudge refuses, fearing that he might learn that Alaska never loved him. They argue and the Colonel accuses Pudge of only loving an idealized Alaska that Pudge made up in his head. Pudge realizes the truth of this and reconciles with the Colonel.\n\nAs a way of celebrating Alaska's life, Pudge, the Colonel, Takumi, and Lara team up with the Weekday Warriors to hire a male stripper to speak at Culver's Speaker Day. The whole school finds it hilarious; Mr. Starnes even acknowledges how clever it was. Pudge finds Alaska's copy of ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' with the labyrinth quote underlined and notices the words \"straight and fast\" written in the margins. He remembers Alaska died on the morning after the anniversary of her mother's death and concludes that Alaska felt guilty for not visiting her mother's grave and, in her rush, might have been trying to reach the cemetery. On the last day of school, Takumi confesses in a note that he was the last person to see Alaska, and he let her go as well. Pudge realizes that letting her go doesn't matter as much anymore. He forgives Alaska for dying, as he knows Alaska forgives him for letting her go.\n\n== Style ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' is divided into two halves and narrated by main character Miles Halter. Rather than the typical numerical system, each chapter is denoted through the number of days before Alaska's death or the number of days after.

Miles is attracted to Alaska Young, who mostly does not reciprocate his feelings.

While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession with finding answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel. When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the \"Great Perhaps,'\" meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar from the University of Northern British Columbia Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because this investigation turns into something that is used to deal with the harsh reality of losing Alaska, it leads to Pudge finding his way through his own personal labyrinth of suffering and finding deeper meaning to his life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=31}}</ref>\n\n===Grief===\nWhen Alaska dies unexpectedly, the repercussions in the lives of her friends are significant, especially for Pudge and the Colonel. Barb Dean concludes that it is normal to seek answers about what happened and why.<ref name=\":15\" /> She also points out that in writing ''Looking for Alaska'', John Green wished to dive deeper into the grieving process by asking the question \"how does one rationalize the harshness and messiness of life when one has, through stupid, thoughtless, and very human actions, contributed to that very harshness?\" <ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's Looking for Alaska|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=29}}</ref> Pudge and the Colonel blame themselves for Alaska's death because they do not stop her from driving while intoxicated. Because of this, their grieving process consists of seeking answers surrounding her death since they feel that they are responsible. Ultimately, Miles is able to come to the conclusion that Alaska would forgive him for any fault of his in her death and thus his grief is resolved in a healthy way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking for Alaska|last=Green|first=John|publisher=Dutton Juvenile|year=2005|isbn=978-0-525-47506-4|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221 221]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221}}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age ===\nThroughout the book, the events that Miles and other characters experience are typical coming-of-age situations. Book reviews often note this theme, bringing up the instances in the book such as grief that cause the characters to look at life from a new and more mature perspective.<ref>Barkdoll, Jayme K., and Lisa Scherff. \"\"Literature is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green.\" ''English Journal'' 97.3 (2008): 67-71. ''ProQuest Central, Research Library.'' Web.</ref> Reviews also mention that the characters themselves resemble coming-of-age figures as they are relatable to readers going through similar experiences.<ref name=\"Heryani 136\"/>  Barb Dean also concludes that the characters grow up faster than expected while investigating Alaska's death because exploring the concept of the labyrinth of suffering is Miles' \"rite of passage\" into adulthood, and he learns more about himself through grieving for Alaska.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reviews also note activities such as drinking and smoking, which, though controversial, are often viewed as rites of passage by the teenagers in this novel.<ref name=\":3\">Ritchie, John. \"Looking for Alaska.\" ''ALAN Review'' 32.3 (2005): 36. ''ProQuest Central.'' Web.</ref>\n\n===Hope===\nThe theme of hope plays a major role in ''Looking for Alaska''. Even though some of the novel's prominent themes are about death, grief and loss, Green ties hope into the end of the novel to solve Pudge's internal conflict that is incited by Alaska's death. In Barb Dean's chapter about the novel, she takes a closer look into Mr. Hyde's theology class where he discusses the similarity of the idea of hope between the founding figures of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mr. Hyde also asks the class what their call for hope is, and Pudge decides his is his escape of his personal labyrinth of suffering. For Pudge, his call for hope is understanding the reality of suffering while also acknowledging that things like friendship and forgiveness can help diminish this suffering. Dean notes that Green has said that he writes fiction in order to \"'keep that fragile strand of radical hope [alive], to build a fire in the darkness.'\" <ref name=\"Dean Article\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n=== Youth-adult relationships ===\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a novel that exposes readers to the interpersonal relationships between the youth and adult characters in the novel. Green presents specific adult characters, like The Eagle who is the dean of students, whose main focus is to eliminate the rebellious tendencies of various students.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite document|title=Reaching Reluctant Readers (Aka Books for Boys)|last=Jeffery|first=Dwayne|id = {{ProQuest|212246506}}}}</ref> On the contrary, certain characters, like Dr. Hyde, the school's religious studies teacher, express positive beliefs in his students, while still maintaining an authoritative role within the classroom environment. The relationship that exists between Dr. Hyde and his students' illustrates how mutual respect can lead to positive interpersonal relationships between the youth and adults.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' has received both positive reviews and attempts at censorship in multiple school districts.

In May 2012, Sumner County in Tennessee also banned the teaching of ''Looking for Alaska''. The school's spokesman argued that two pages of the novel included enough explicit content to ban the novel.\n\n==== Depew High School, Buffalo, New York ====\nTwo teachers at [[Depew Union Free School District|Depew High School]] near [[Buffalo, New York]], used the book for eleventh grade instruction in 2008. ''Looking for Alaska'' was challenged by parents for its sexual content and moral disagreements with the novel. Despite the teachers providing an alternate book, parents still argued for it to be removed from curriculum due to its inappropriate content such as offensive language, sexually explicit content, including a scene described as \"pornographic\", and references to homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The book was ultimately kept in the curriculum by the school board after a unanimous school board vote with the stipulation that the teachers of the 11th grade class give the parents a decision to have their children read an alternate book. ''Looking for Alaska'' was defended by the school district because they felt it dealt with themes relevant to students of this age, such as death, drinking and driving, and peer pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11EC3D5A88D1F710?p=AWNB|title=Committee will review controversial teenage book - Board will then decide if novel can be textbook|last1=Winchester|first1=Laura E.|website=The Buffalo news|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Controversy due to cover design ====\nFurther controversy came from the cover art. In August 2012, Green acknowledged that the extinguished candle on the cover leads to \"an improbable amount of smoke\", and explained that the initial cover design did not feature the candle. Green said that certain book chains were uncomfortable with displaying or selling a book with a cover that featured cigarette smoke, so the candle was added beneath the smoke.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coAa_HtrmNk|title=In Which the Candle Dies|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> In Green's box set, released on October 25, 2012, the candle has been removed from the cover. Further paperback releases of the book also have the candle removed.\n\n==== West Ada School District, Idaho ====\nIn 2016, the [[West Ada School District]] in [[Meridian, Idaho]] removed ''Looking for Alaska'' from all of its middle school libraries.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=David R.|date=2018-07-06|title=Censorship Dateline|journal=Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24|doi=10.5860/jifp.v3i1.6740|issn=2474-7459}}</ref> The school district found the content of the book to be too inappropriate for middle school students. The school district originally received a complaint from a parent on the grounds of the presence of foul language and mentions of actions like smoking and suicide. The district librarian looked into parental complaints along with reviews of the novel suggesting that it was best suited for high schoolers and made the decision to pull the book from the middle school library.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Marion County, Kentucky ====\nIn 2016 in [[Marion County, Kentucky]], parents urged schools to drop it from the curriculum, referring to it as influencing students \"to experiment with pornography, sex, drugs, alcohol and profanity.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/battle-keep-looking-for-alaska-kentucky-school-curriculum-john-green-ya|title=US battle over banning Looking for Alaska continues in Kentucky|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2016-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Although the teacher offered an opt-out book for the class, one parent still felt as though the book should be banned entirely and filed a formal complaint. After the challenge, students were given an alternate book for any parents who were not comfortable with their children reading the book. One parent still insisted on getting the book banned and filed a Request for Reconsideration on the basis that ''Looking for Alaska'' would tempt students to experiment with drugs, alcohol, and sex despite the decisions made after the challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/15CBB52D43D0E208?p=AWNB|title=The heart of education - Students need opportunities to think through situations for themselves|website=Lebanon Enterprise (KY)|publisher=NewsBank|url-access=subscription|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Author's response to controversy ===\nGreen defended his book in his [[vlog]], [[Vlogbrothers]]. The video, entitled \"I Am Not A Pornographer\", describes the Depew High School challenge of ''Looking for Alaska'' and his frustration at the description of his novel as pornography. Green explains the inclusion of the oral sex scene in ''Looking for Alaska'' stating, \"The whole reason that scene in question exists in ''Looking for Alaska'' is because I wanted to draw a contrast between that scene, when there is a lot of physical intimacy, but it is ultimately very emotionally empty, and the scene that immediately follows it, when there is not a serious physical interaction, but there's this intense emotional connection.\" Green argues that the misunderstanding of his book is the reason for its controversy, and urges people to understand the actual literary content before judging specific scenes. He also disagrees with the way that groups of parents underestimate the intelligence of teenagers and their ability to analyze literature. He ends with encouraging his viewers to attend the Depew School Board hearing to support the choice of parents, students, and teachers to have ''Looking for Alaska'' included in public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMPtYvZ8tM|title=I Am Not A Pornographer|last1=Green|first1=John|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{main|Looking for Alaska (TV series)}}\nThe film rights to the novel were acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 2005.

Based on his time at [[Indian Springs School]]<nowiki/>, Green wrote the novel as a result of his desire to create meaningful [[young adult fiction]].<ref name=\":7\" /> The characters and events of the plot are grounded in Green's life, while the story itself is fictional.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' follows the novel's main character and narrator Miles Halter, or \"Pudge,\" to boarding school where he goes to seek the \"Great Perhaps,\" the famous last words of [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]. Throughout the first half of the novel, Miles and his friends Chip \"The Colonel\" Martin, Alaska Young, and Takumi Hikohito grow very close and the section culminates in Alaska's death. In the second half of the novel, Miles and his friends work to discover the missing details of the night Alaska died. While struggling to reconcile Alaska's death, Miles grapples with  Sim\u00f3n Bolivar's last words and the meaning of life, leaving the conclusion to these topics unresolved.\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a coming-of-age novel that touches on themes of meaning, grief, hope, and youth-adult relationships. The novel won the 2006 [[Michael L. Printz Award]] from the [[American Library Association]], and led the association's list of most-challenged books in 2015 due to profanity and a sexually explicit scene.<ref name=\":8\" /> Schools in Kentucky, Tennessee, and several other states have attempted to place bans on the book.

Growing up, Green always loved writing, but when it came to his [[Middle school#United States|middle school]] experience, he classified life as a middle schooler as \"pretty bleak\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite document|title=John Green: From Bad Boy to Printz Award Winner|last=MacPherson|first=Karen|id = {{ProQuest|390783985}}}}{{subscription required|via=[[ProQuest}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=Cannot verify from info provided}}</ref> As a student, Green describes that he was \"unbearable\" to parents and teachers; however, he always worked hard to fit in with his peers.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite document|title=\"Literature Is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green|last=Barkdoll|first=Jayme|id = {{ProQuest|237309696}}}}{{subscription required|via=[[ProQuest}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=Cannot verify from info provided}}</ref> Green's situation did not improve after his transition to high school, so he asked his parents if he could attend [[Indian Springs School]], a boarding school outside of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. His parents agreed, and he spent the remainder of his time in high school at Indian Springs School forming valuable relationships with teachers, relationships that Green says still exist today.<ref name=\":0\" /> Green's experience at boarding school inspired him to write ''Looking for Alaska.'' Many of the characters and events that take place in the novel are based on what Green experienced at Indian Springs,<ref name=\":0\" /> including the death of a central character in the novel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&id=GALE%7CA131082448&v=2.1&it=r&sid=LitRC&asid=be97446d |title=Last Words From a First Novelist |last=Cooper |first=Ilene |access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\nDuring a [[book talk]] at [[Rivermont Collegiate]] on October 19, 2006, Green shared that the idea of Takumi's \"fox hat\" in ''Looking for Alaska'' originated from a Filipino friend who wore a similar hat while playing pranks at the school. He also noted that his inspiration for the possessed swan in Culver Creek derived from a similar swan he remembers at Indian Springs. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at school, but Green emphasizes that while the setting is based on his life, the novel is entirely fictional.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JLuF8GmtH4|title=John Green's Legendary High School Prank|date=8 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Green became infatuated with famous last words, specifically those of [[John Adams]]. His fascination with last words lead him to finding other famous last words, including those of [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&id=GALE%7CA131082448&v=2.1&it=r&sid=LitRC&asid=be97446d|title=Last Words From a First Novelist|last=Cooper|first=Ilene|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref> Green passes this love of last words onto the main character, Miles, and uses Bolivar's last words to inspire a search for meaning in the face of tragedy for the characters of his novel.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Plot==\nMiles Halter, a teenage boy obsessed with last words, leaves his normal high school in Florida to attend Culver Creek Preparatory High School in Alabama for his junior year.

Learning of Pudge's obsession with famous last words, Alaska informs him of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's]]: \"Damn it. How will I ever get out of this labyrinth!\"<ref name=\"Book\">{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Looking for Alaska|date=28 December 2006|publisher=Penguin Young Readers Group|isbn=9780142402511|page=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00john/page/25 25]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00john/page/25}}</ref> The two make a deal that if Pudge figures out what the labyrinth is and how to escape it, Alaska will find him a girlfriend. Alaska sets Pudge up with a Romanian classmate, Lara. Unfortunately, Pudge and Lara have a disastrous date, ending with a concussed Pudge throwing up on Lara. Alaska and Pudge grow closer and he begins to fall in love with her, although she insists on keeping their relationship [[Platonic love|platonic]] because she has a boyfriend at [[Vanderbilt University]] whom she insists she loves.\n\nOn his first night at Culver Creek, Pudge is kidnapped and thrown into a lake by the \"Weekday Warriors,\" a group of rich schoolmates who blame the Colonel and his friends for the expulsion of their friend, Paul. Paul's expulsion created tension between Pudge's friends and the Weekday Warriors. Takumi claims that they are innocent because their friend Marya was also [[expulsion (education)#United States and Canada|expelled]] during the incident.  However, Alaska later admits that she told on both Marya and Paul to the dean, Mr. Starnes, to save herself from being expelled.\n\nThe gang celebrates a successful series of pranks by drinking and partying, and an inebriated Alaska confides about her mother's death from an [[aneurysm]] when she was eight years old. Although she didn't understand at the time, she feels guilty for not calling 911. Pudge figures that her mother's death made Alaska impulsive and rash. He concludes that the labyrinth was a person's suffering and that humans must try to find their way out. Afterwards, Pudge grows closer to Lara, and they start dating. A week later, after another 'celebration', an intoxicated Alaska and Pudge spend the night with each other, when suddenly Alaska receives a phone call which causes her to go into hysterics. Insisting that she has to leave, Alaska drives away while drunk with Pudge and the Colonel distracting Mr. Starnes. They later learn that Alaska was [[driving under the influence|DUI]] and died.\n\nThe Colonel and Pudge are devastated and blame themselves, wondering about her reasons for undertaking the urgent drive and even contemplating that she might have deliberately killed herself. The Colonel insists on questioning Jake, her boyfriend, but Pudge refuses, fearing that he might learn that Alaska never loved him. They argue and the Colonel accuses Pudge of only loving an idealized Alaska that Pudge made up in his head. Pudge realizes the truth of this and reconciles with the Colonel.\n\nAs a way of celebrating Alaska's life, Pudge, the Colonel, Takumi, and Lara team up with the Weekday Warriors to hire a male stripper to speak at Culver's Speaker Day. The whole school finds it hilarious; Mr. Starnes even acknowledges how clever it was. Pudge finds Alaska's copy of ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' with the labyrinth quote underlined and notices the words \"straight and fast\" written in the margins. He remembers Alaska died on the morning after the anniversary of her mother's death and concludes that Alaska felt guilty for not visiting her mother's grave and, in her rush, might have been trying to reach the cemetery. On the last day of school, Takumi confesses in a note that he was the last person to see Alaska, and he let her go as well. Pudge realizes that letting her go doesn't matter as much anymore. He forgives Alaska for dying, as he knows Alaska forgives him for letting her go.\n\n== Style ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' is divided into two halves and narrated by main character Miles Halter. Rather than the typical numerical system, each chapter is denoted through the number of days before Alaska's death or the number of days after. The genesis of this structure resulted from John Green's influence of public reactions to the events on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001.]] <ref name=\":33\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292717/looking-for-alaska-by-john-green/9780593109069|title=Looking for Alaska by John Green - Reading Guide: 9780593109069 - PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/65089-john-green-celebrates-10-years-of-looking-for-alaska.html|title=John Green Celebrates 10 Years of 'Looking for Alaska'|last=Maughan|first=Shannon|date=2014|website=Publisher's Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an interview with [[Random House|Random House Publishing]], Green recalled that newscasters stated that people would now view the world through the lens of either before or after 9/11.<ref name=\":33\"/> Green says in the same interview, \u201cWe look back to the most important moment in our history, and that becomes the dividing line between what we were and what we are now.

While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession with finding answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel. When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the \"Great Perhaps,'\" meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar from the University of Northern British Columbia Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because this investigation turns into something that is used to deal with the harsh reality of losing Alaska, it leads to Pudge finding his way through his own personal labyrinth of suffering and finding deeper meaning to his life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=31}}</ref>\n\n===Grief===\nWhen Alaska dies unexpectedly, the repercussions in the lives of her friends are significant, especially for Pudge and the Colonel. Barb Dean concludes that it is normal to seek answers about what happened and why.<ref name=\":15\" /> She also points out that in writing ''Looking for Alaska'', John Green wished to dive deeper into the grieving process by asking the question \"how does one rationalize the harshness and messiness of life when one has, through stupid, thoughtless, and very human actions, contributed to that very harshness?\" <ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's Looking for Alaska|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=29}}</ref> Pudge and the Colonel blame themselves for Alaska's death because they do not stop her from driving while intoxicated. Because of this, their grieving process consists of seeking answers surrounding her death since they feel that they are responsible. Ultimately, Miles is able to come to the conclusion that Alaska would forgive him for any fault of his in her death and thus his grief is resolved in a healthy way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking for Alaska|last=Green|first=John|publisher=Dutton Juvenile|year=2005|isbn=978-0-525-47506-4|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221 221]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221}}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age ===\nThroughout the book, the events that Miles and other characters experience are typical coming-of-age situations. Book reviews often note this theme, bringing up the instances in the book such as grief that cause the characters to look at life from a new and more mature perspective.<ref>Barkdoll, Jayme K., and Lisa Scherff. \"\"Literature is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green.\" ''English Journal'' 97.3 (2008): 67-71. ''ProQuest Central, Research Library.'' Web.</ref> Reviews also mention that the characters themselves resemble coming-of-age figures as they are relatable to readers going through similar experiences.<ref name=\"Heryani 136\"/>  Barb Dean also concludes that the characters grow up faster than expected while investigating Alaska's death because exploring the concept of the labyrinth of suffering is Miles' \"rite of passage\" into adulthood, and he learns more about himself through grieving for Alaska.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reviews also note activities such as drinking and smoking, which, though controversial, are often viewed as rites of passage by the teenagers in this novel.<ref name=\":3\">Ritchie, John. \"Looking for Alaska.\" ''ALAN Review'' 32.3 (2005): 36. ''ProQuest Central.'' Web.</ref>\n\n===Hope===\nThe theme of hope plays a major role in ''Looking for Alaska''. Even though some of the novel's prominent themes are about death, grief and loss, Green ties hope into the end of the novel to solve Pudge's internal conflict that is incited by Alaska's death. In Barb Dean's chapter about the novel, she takes a closer look into Mr. Hyde's theology class where he discusses the similarity of the idea of hope between the founding figures of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mr. Hyde also asks the class what their call for hope is, and Pudge decides his is his escape of his personal labyrinth of suffering. For Pudge, his call for hope is understanding the reality of suffering while also acknowledging that things like friendship and forgiveness can help diminish this suffering. Dean notes that Green has said that he writes fiction in order to \"'keep that fragile strand of radical hope [alive], to build a fire in the darkness.'\" <ref name=\"Dean Article\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n=== Youth-adult relationships ===\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a novel that exposes readers to the interpersonal relationships between the youth and adult characters in the novel.

In May 2012, Sumner County in Tennessee also banned the teaching of ''Looking for Alaska''. The school's spokesman argued that two pages of the novel included enough explicit content to ban the novel.\n\n==== Depew High School, Buffalo, New York ====\nTwo teachers at [[Depew Union Free School District|Depew High School]] near [[Buffalo, New York]], used the book for eleventh grade instruction in 2008. ''Looking for Alaska'' was challenged by parents for its sexual content and moral disagreements with the novel. Despite the teachers providing an alternate book, parents still argued for it to be removed from curriculum due to its inappropriate content such as offensive language, sexually explicit content, including a scene described as \"pornographic\", and references to homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The book was ultimately kept in the curriculum by the school board after a unanimous school board vote with the stipulation that the teachers of the 11th grade class give the parents a decision to have their children read an alternate book. ''Looking for Alaska'' was defended by the school district because they felt it dealt with themes relevant to students of this age, such as death, drinking and driving, and peer pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11EC3D5A88D1F710?p=AWNB|title=Committee will review controversial teenage book - Board will then decide if novel can be textbook|last1=Winchester|first1=Laura E.|website=The Buffalo news|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Controversy due to cover design ====\nFurther controversy came from the cover art. In August 2012, Green acknowledged that the extinguished candle on the cover leads to \"an improbable amount of smoke\", and explained that the initial cover design did not feature the candle. Green said that certain book chains were uncomfortable with displaying or selling a book with a cover that featured cigarette smoke, so the candle was added beneath the smoke.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coAa_HtrmNk|title=In Which the Candle Dies|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> In Green's box set, released on October 25, 2012, the candle has been removed from the cover. Further paperback releases of the book also have the candle removed.\n\n==== West Ada School District, Idaho ====\nIn 2016, the [[West Ada School District]] in [[Meridian, Idaho]] removed ''Looking for Alaska'' from all of its middle school libraries.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=David R.|date=2018-07-06|title=Censorship Dateline|journal=Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24|doi=10.5860/jifp.v3i1.6740|issn=2474-7459}}</ref> The school district found the content of the book to be too inappropriate for middle school students. The school district originally received a complaint from a parent on the grounds of the presence of foul language and mentions of actions like smoking and suicide. The district librarian looked into parental complaints along with reviews of the novel suggesting that it was best suited for high schoolers and made the decision to pull the book from the middle school library.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Marion County, Kentucky ====\nIn 2016 in [[Marion County, Kentucky]], parents urged schools to drop it from the curriculum, referring to it as influencing students \"to experiment with pornography, sex, drugs, alcohol and profanity.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/battle-keep-looking-for-alaska-kentucky-school-curriculum-john-green-ya|title=US battle over banning Looking for Alaska continues in Kentucky|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2016-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Although the teacher offered an opt-out book for the class, one parent still felt as though the book should be banned entirely and filed a formal complaint. After the challenge, students were given an alternate book for any parents who were not comfortable with their children reading the book. One parent still insisted on getting the book banned and filed a Request for Reconsideration on the basis that ''Looking for Alaska'' would tempt students to experiment with drugs, alcohol, and sex despite the decisions made after the challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/15CBB52D43D0E208?p=AWNB|title=The heart of education - Students need opportunities to think through situations for themselves|website=Lebanon Enterprise (KY)|publisher=NewsBank|url-access=subscription|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Author's response to controversy ===\nGreen defended his book in his [[vlog]], [[Vlogbrothers]]. The video, entitled \"I Am Not A Pornographer\", describes the Depew High School challenge of ''Looking for Alaska'' and his frustration at the description of his novel as pornography. Green explains the inclusion of the oral sex scene in ''Looking for Alaska'' stating, \"The whole reason that scene in question exists in ''Looking for Alaska'' is because I wanted to draw a contrast between that scene, when there is a lot of physical intimacy, but it is ultimately very emotionally empty, and the scene that immediately follows it, when there is not a serious physical interaction, but there's this intense emotional connection.\" Green argues that the misunderstanding of his book is the reason for its controversy, and urges people to understand the actual literary content before judging specific scenes. He also disagrees with the way that groups of parents underestimate the intelligence of teenagers and their ability to analyze literature. He ends with encouraging his viewers to attend the Depew School Board hearing to support the choice of parents, students, and teachers to have ''Looking for Alaska'' included in public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMPtYvZ8tM|title=I Am Not A Pornographer|last1=Green|first1=John|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{main|Looking for Alaska (TV series)}}\nThe film rights to the novel were acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 2005.
