They were attracted to each other, and Kennedy wrote to her regularly after leaving Donegal.\n\nKennedy was advised by a friend that he should learn an instrument if he intended to court N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, and so he got a [[tin whistle|whistle]] and taught himself to play. Later he learned the flute, a somewhat louder instrument, so that he could hear himself in sessions. His love for N\u00ed Mhaonaigh coupled with perfectionist tendencies turned him into a well-respected flute player.\n\nKennedy and N\u00ed Mhaonaigh married in 1981.\n\nThe new couple continued to play at sessions in Donegal, and this formed the basis for their musical partnership. They made their recording debut on Albert Fry's [[eponym]]ous record in 1979 and later formed a short-lived group called Ragairne which also included Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Maonaigh, N\u00ed Mhaonaigh's brother, on guitar, Donal O'Hanlon from Newry on guitar, vocals and cittern and was rejoined in 1981 by singer Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in, later known as [[Enya]].\n\nJoined by [[bouzouki]] player [[Ciar\u00e1n Curran]] and Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in, now known as [[Enya]], on synthesizer, Frankie Kennedy and Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh released a recording entitled ''[[Ceol Aduaidh]]'' on [[Gael-Linn Records|Gael-Linn]] records in 1983.\n\nAt the time, Kennedy and N\u00ed Mhaonaigh were earning their living by teaching at St. Oliver Plunkett National School in [[Malahide]], north [[County Dublin]]. But live performances in 1984 and 1985, particularly in the United States, convinced them that there was an audience for \"no-compromise traditional music played with heart and drive,\" and they were persuaded to give up teaching.\n\nDuring this time, the group added guitarist Mark Kelly and released in 1987 a record called ''[[Altan (album)|Altan]]'', named after a lake in Donegal, although the name Altan wasn't used for the band on that release. ''Altan'' was produced by [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]], who subsequently appeared as either a producer or guest musician on every Altan album which followed.\n\n===1987\u2013present: Altan===\n{{main|Altan (band)}}\nForsaking their jobs as teachers, N\u00ed Mhaonaigh and Kennedy formed the band [[Altan (band)|Altan]] during the late 1980s.

They were attracted to each other, and Kennedy wrote to her regularly after leaving Donegal.\n\nKennedy was advised by a friend that he should learn an instrument if he intended to court N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, and so he got a [[tin whistle|whistle]] and taught himself to play. Later he learned the flute, a somewhat louder instrument, so that he could hear himself in sessions. His love for N\u00ed Mhaonaigh coupled with perfectionist tendencies turned him into a well-respected flute player.\n\nKennedy and N\u00ed Mhaonaigh married in 1981.\n\nThe new couple continued to play at sessions in Donegal, and this formed the basis for their musical partnership. They made their recording debut on Albert Fry's [[eponym]]ous record in 1979 and later formed a short-lived group called Ragairne which also included Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Maonaigh, N\u00ed Mhaonaigh's brother, on guitar, Donal O'Hanlon from Newry on guitar, vocals and cittern and was rejoined in 1981 by singer Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in, later known as [[Enya]].\n\nJoined by [[bouzouki]] player [[Ciar\u00e1n Curran]] and Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in, now known as [[Enya]], on synthesizer, Frankie Kennedy and Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh released a recording entitled ''[[Ceol Aduaidh]]'' on [[Gael-Linn Records|Gael-Linn]] records in 1983.\n\nAt the time, Kennedy and N\u00ed Mhaonaigh were earning their living by teaching at St. Oliver Plunkett National School in [[Malahide]], north [[County Dublin]]. But live performances in 1984 and 1985, particularly in the United States, convinced them that there was an audience for \"no-compromise traditional music played with heart and drive,\" and they were persuaded to give up teaching.\n\nDuring this time, the group added guitarist Mark Kelly and released in 1987 a record called ''[[Altan (album)|Altan]]'', named after a lake in Donegal, although the name Altan wasn't used for the band on that release. ''Altan'' was produced by [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]], who subsequently appeared as either a producer or guest musician on every Altan album which followed.\n\n===1987\u2013present: Altan===\n{{main|Altan (band)}}\nForsaking their jobs as teachers, N\u00ed Mhaonaigh and Kennedy formed the band [[Altan (band)|Altan]] during the late 1980s. Kennedy's death from cancer in 1994 put the band's future in question, but she decided to continue at Kennedy's explicit request.\n\nAs well as her work with Altan, N\u00ed Mhaonaigh over the years has presented traditional music programmes on radio and television, including the radio show, ''The Long Note'' and the television series, ''The Pure Drop''.\n\n===2005\u2013present: String Sisters===\n{{main|String Sisters}}\nN\u00ed Mhaonaigh is a member of the fiddle ensemble [[String Sisters]] active as a band since 2005.\n\n===2007\u2013present: T with the Maggies===\n{{main|T with the Maggies}}\nN\u00ed Mhaonaigh along with friends [[Moya Brennan]], [[Maighread N\u00ed Dhomhnaill]] and [[Tr\u00edona N\u00ed Dhomhnaill]] came together as [[T with the Maggies]] in 2007, and released their debut album ''[[T with the Maggies (album)|T with the Maggies]]'' in October 2010.\n\n===2007\u2013present: Solo work & solo live performances===\n[[File:Francie2002.jpg|thumb|Mair\u00e9ad performing with her father.]]\nIn 2007/08, N\u00ed Mhaonaigh recorded ''[[Imeall]]'', her debut (studio) album in the home studio of her friend and musician/co-producer [[Manus Lunny]] in T\u00edr Chonaill, [[County Donegal]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

They have been compared to [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada]], in that they brought the Irish language into popular culture through their music.

Along with the highs of success in the music business, she also recounts low periods where alcohol, drugs and an abortion made her re-evaluate her life. She emerged from her \"dark years\" as a committed Christian, with rekindled faith.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} She remarried in 1991, having previously been married to a Dublin musician,{{who|date=January 2018}} and now lives in Dublin with her husband, photographer Tim Jarvis, and children, Aisling and Paul.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMoya Brennan is also a philanthropist.\n[[File:Mairebrennan2.jpg|thumb|Brennan performing in New York, 2008]]\n\n===Christian Blind Mission===\nIn 2003, Moya Brennan became Goodwill Ambassador to [[Christian Blind Mission]] Ireland (CBM). Brennan's first trip was to [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]], with a group of five others. Due to violence, Moya and her team fled civil unrest and were evacuated to [[Kenya]]. She later promised to return to the Congo, which she did in 2005 to airlift three children from isolated jungle villages to [[Kinshasa]].<ref name=\"PreasRaiteas\">[http://bannonandbannon.com/home/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=64 RT\u00c9 journeys to the Congo with Moya Brennan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928134328/http://bannonandbannon.com/home/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=64 |date=28 September 2008 }}.

In 2005, she made an Irish-language documentary for [[TG4]] during her visit to Congo, which was broadcast in 2007, and again in 2008 on both TG4 and [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]].\n\nMoya also travelled to [[shanty-town]]s in Brazil and performed a fund-raising event in the country with [[Assiria Nascemento]] in 2007. From there Moya travelled to [[Belize]] for the opening of a school for abused children, run by the [[Liberty Foundation]] and backed by CBM.<ref name=\"ChristianToday2\" /> At the opening, Brennan brought together the Belizean Prime Minister [[Said Musa]], Minister of Finance, Leader of the Opposition and UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] member and businessman with extensive business interest in Belize, [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft]].<ref name=\"ChristianToday2\" />\n\nThe following year, Brennan travelled to [[Tanzania]] and has played a major role in bringing the missions of the charity to the forefront. She has also performed concerts worldwide with other Christian Blind Mission Goodwill Ambassadors from Europe.<ref name=\"PastTourDates\">[http://www.clannad.org.uk/tour/archive/ Tour Date Archive] Brennan family</ref>\n\n===Helping those with addiction===\nBrennan performs various concerts in aid of charities and groups that work to rehabilitate those affected by drug addiction and alcohol dependency. She also practices religion with her family in [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], at a church which also reaches out to young people affected by drug and alcohol misuse.\n\n===Nature preservation===\nWith family band Clannad, Brennan has recorded numerous songs about the needed protection of the landscapes in Ireland and the devastation of pollution around the world. The first song about the matter was recorded for their debut album and was called \"An Ph\u00e1irc\". Throughout Moya's solo career, she has recorded various songs on the issue including \"[[Big Yellow Taxi single|Big Yellow Taxi]]\".\n\nIn July 2005, Brennan took part in a protest alongside poet [[Cathal \u00d3 Searcaigh]] and locals of [[County Donegal]] to protest against the installation of electric cables across various areas of the county due to the harm it could cause to both people and the landscape.<ref>[http://www.donegalcounty.com/nw62.html Donegal County.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117034226/http://www.donegalcounty.com/nw62.html |date=17 November 2007 }} Newsletter July 2005</ref>\n\n===Other appointments and music===\nIn 1985, Brennan along with her band members in Clannad donated their song \"[[Almost Seems (Too Late To Turn)]]\" to [[Children in Need]], becoming the British charity appeal's first official single.\n\nIn 1986, Brennan performed alongside Bono, [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Chris de Burgh]] for Self Aid. She also performed with Clannad at the concert. Moya and Clannad have long been supporters of [[Amnesty International]] and contributed their single \"[[R\u00ed na Cruinne]]\" to the organisation. Brennan has also attended various benefits in both Ireland and England, most notably alongside [[Van Morrison]] in 1996.\n\nMoya has recorded dozens charitable singles and on many more albums with various artists, including \"Raphael's Journey\" by [[Joanne Hogg]] in 2008, \"Songs for Luca\" and \"Songs for Luca 2\" by [[Iona (band)|Iona]], and the official anthem for Ireland's 2008 Olympic bid, \"[[Green to Gold (song)|Green to Gold]]\". Moya also donated her b-side \"Ceolfaidh M\u00e9\" to the ''Field of Hope'' album, which also features Bono and [[The Corrs]]. In October 2008, Brennan was appointed director for Ireland's first [[Christian radio|Christian satellite radio]] station, UCB Ireland, which operates from [[Dublin]]. Moya also recorded a song under her birth name \"M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in\" on the 2009 ''[[Ceol Cheann Dubhrann]]'' album with [[Manus Lunny]] to raise funds for \u00c1islann Rann na Feirste and Scoil N\u00e1isi\u00fanta Rann na Feirste.<ref name=\"17April\">[http://www.clannad.org.uk/2009/04/moya-brennan-directs-new-christian-radio-station/ Moya Brennan directs new Christian radio station].

She emerged from her \"dark years\" as a committed Christian, with rekindled faith.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} She remarried in 1991, having previously been married to a Dublin musician,{{who|date=January 2018}} and now lives in Dublin with her husband, photographer Tim Jarvis, and children, Aisling and Paul.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMoya Brennan is also a philanthropist.\n[[File:Mairebrennan2.jpg|thumb|Brennan performing in New York, 2008]]\n\n===Christian Blind Mission===\nIn 2003, Moya Brennan became Goodwill Ambassador to [[Christian Blind Mission]] Ireland (CBM). Brennan's first trip was to [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]], with a group of five others. Due to violence, Moya and her team fled civil unrest and were evacuated to [[Kenya]]. She later promised to return to the Congo, which she did in 2005 to airlift three children from isolated jungle villages to [[Kinshasa]].<ref name=\"PreasRaiteas\">[http://bannonandbannon.com/home/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=64 RT\u00c9 journeys to the Congo with Moya Brennan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928134328/http://bannonandbannon.com/home/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=64 |date=28 September 2008 }}.

She also practices religion with her family in [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], at a church which also reaches out to young people affected by drug and alcohol misuse.\n\n===Nature preservation===\nWith family band Clannad, Brennan has recorded numerous songs about the needed protection of the landscapes in Ireland and the devastation of pollution around the world. The first song about the matter was recorded for their debut album and was called \"An Ph\u00e1irc\". Throughout Moya's solo career, she has recorded various songs on the issue including \"[[Big Yellow Taxi single|Big Yellow Taxi]]\".\n\nIn July 2005, Brennan took part in a protest alongside poet [[Cathal \u00d3 Searcaigh]] and locals of [[County Donegal]] to protest against the installation of electric cables across various areas of the county due to the harm it could cause to both people and the landscape.<ref>[http://www.donegalcounty.com/nw62.html Donegal County.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117034226/http://www.donegalcounty.com/nw62.html |date=17 November 2007 }} Newsletter July 2005</ref>\n\n===Other appointments and music===\nIn 1985, Brennan along with her band members in Clannad donated their song \"[[Almost Seems (Too Late To Turn)]]\" to [[Children in Need]], becoming the British charity appeal's first official single.\n\nIn 1986, Brennan performed alongside Bono, [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Chris de Burgh]] for Self Aid. She also performed with Clannad at the concert. Moya and Clannad have long been supporters of [[Amnesty International]] and contributed their single \"[[R\u00ed na Cruinne]]\" to the organisation. Brennan has also attended various benefits in both Ireland and England, most notably alongside [[Van Morrison]] in 1996.\n\nMoya has recorded dozens charitable singles and on many more albums with various artists, including \"Raphael's Journey\" by [[Joanne Hogg]] in 2008, \"Songs for Luca\" and \"Songs for Luca 2\" by [[Iona (band)|Iona]], and the official anthem for Ireland's 2008 Olympic bid, \"[[Green to Gold (song)|Green to Gold]]\".

What I remember most is the heavy ochre make-up the performers had to wear. I was excused the make-up for some reason; maybe mine was such a long shot that it was not deemed necessary. If you blink you miss me! However, June Malo, the Henderson Twins, [[Peggy Dell]], Bruce Trent and Freddie Schweitzer had this heavy ochre make-up plastered on them. Plastered is the only word! Having toured with them for over 12-months and used to seeing them in stage make-up they looked very strange. Mr Hylton was excused also. He was always Mr Hylton to me. He called me \"Morine\", (the American pronunciation, and was a kind man who made such a difference to my career. He always wore those two-tone shoes that were so popular at the time. It is wonderful to see him so trim and dapper in the tape, which Simon Vaughan has sent me.\"<ref>Maureen Potter letter to APTS Archivist \u2013 March 2001</ref><ref>{{YouTube|0z1iLiTuV1M|APTS footage

memories:<blockquote>''\"I was 13 years of age when I appeared with the Jack Hylton Band in RadiOlympia, a programme that went out on television all those years ago. What I remember most is the heavy ochre make-up the performers had to wear. I was excused the make-up for some reason; maybe mine was such a long shot that it was not deemed necessary. If you blink you miss me! However, June Malo, the Henderson Twins, [[Peggy Dell]], Bruce Trent and Freddie Schweitzer had this heavy ochre make-up plastered on them. Plastered is the only word! Having toured with them for over 12-months and used to seeing them in stage make-up they looked very strange. Mr Hylton was excused also. He was always Mr Hylton to me. He called me \"Morine\", (the American pronunciation, and was a kind man who made such a difference to my career. He always wore those two-tone shoes that were so popular at the time. It is wonderful to see him so trim and dapper in the tape, which Simon Vaughan has sent me.\"<ref>Maureen Potter letter to APTS Archivist \u2013 March 2001</ref><ref>{{YouTube|0z1iLiTuV1M|APTS footage containing interview with Maureen Potter}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Later life and death ==\n{{external media|align=right|width=180px|image1 = [http://www.photopol.com/signs/maureen_potter_grave_xmas.jpg Potter's gravestone at St. John the Baptist cemetery in Clontarf]}}\nPotter first appeared professionally with [[Jimmy O'Dea]] in pantomime and appeared frequently on television and in [[cabaret]].<ref name=irishtimesobit>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/actress-and-comedienne-maureen-potter-dies-1.975853|title=Actress and comedienne Maureen Potter dies|date=7 April 2004|work=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=10 January 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200110214042/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/actress-and-comedienne-maureen-potter-dies-1.975853|archive-date=10 January 2020}}</ref> She played the role of Dante Riordan in [[Joseph Strick]]'s film, ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (film)|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1977).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2baa84a489|title=Maureen Potter|website=BFI}}</ref> She was conferred with the [[Freedom of the City of Dublin]] in 1984, and was later awarded an honorary degree from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1988.<ref name=guardianobit>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Maureen Potter|last=Dixon|first=Stephen|date=12 April 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=10 January 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306090624/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> She died in her sleep at her home in [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]] on 7 April 2004, at the age of 79.<ref name=irishtimesobit/> She was survived by her husband, Jack O'Leary and her sons, John and Hugh.<ref name=guardianobit/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* {{imdb name|693322}}\n*{{IBDB name|84549}}\n* {{Find a Grave|9793971}}\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1 ''The Guardian'' obituary]\n*[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maureen-potter-38304.html ''The Independent'' obituary]\n*{{YouTube|NanQgFB_avY|Potter duetting with Patricia Cahill on RT\u00c9 Television in 1977}}\n*{{YouTube|qRQwbTg5ze8|Potter as Sister Gonzaga}}\n*{{YouTube|W7FujZBN-Ts|Potter in a sketch with Patricia Cahill on RT\u00c9 Television in 1969}}\n*{{YouTube|apNG4Kc4f84|RT\u00c9 Television 1969 Christmas with Potter}}\n*{{YouTube|0z1iLiTuV1M|APTS footage containing interview with Potter}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Potter, Maureen}}\n[[Category:1925 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:Irish comedy musicians]]\n[[Category:Irish female singers]]\n[[Category:Irish stage actresses]]\n[[Category:Irish television actresses]]\n[[Category:Irish women comedians]]\n[[Category:People from Clontarf, Dublin]]\n[[Category:20th-century Irish singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century Irish women singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century women singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century comedians]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing fromCategory:20th-century women singersusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_Potter"}

The player then encounters the voice of one of The Architects, letting the player know that Jeff is gone; the Alien Facility then gets locked off and requires a White Tablet to enter. The Alien Facility is then struck by a meteor and begins re-routing its power to Sanctuary. The player is told to get to the escape ship back at base, however, the ship takes off, and the player has to take shelter in Research Base Zero. After the meteor shower triggers an Avalanche, the ice breaks below the player causing them to have to swim out into open water, and head to a Lifepod launched by Sam Goodall on the Vesper Station, just before The Vesper is struck by a meteorite damaging its communication ability. \n\nShortly after, the player receives a message tracked to the Alien Sanctuary Site in the Twist Bridges.

The player offers their PDA for the consciousnesses to transfer into, however, it transfers into the players Cerebral Cortex. The Alien Voice then lets the player knows its name is Al-an.\n\nAs the player approaches Rocket Island, their PDA informs them that repairing the communications tower will reestablish contact with The Vesper, requiring the player to explore the Mercury II wreck, a ship that crashed anywhere from 30 to 100 years ago. After The Player repairs the communications tower, they are told the ship that took off at the beginning of the game crash-landed in the Glacial Basin and that they have three objectives: Find Jeff, extract a sample of the Kharaa sample and retrieve research data from Research Base Omega.\n\nIn the Glacial Basin, the player finds the crashed escape ship. The player can locate Jeff's base in the Glacial Basin and is informed that Jeff is most likely in another sector. The player is then told to head to the Leviathan Genetic Research Program to receive a sample of the Kharaa Bacterium and send it up to The Vesper. As the player explores the Glacial Basin, they find a Cache with one of The Architect body parts.  A while after the player sends the Kharaa Bacterium, they get a message saying that it never arrived. The player then gets a supply drop in the Lilypad Islands leading them towards Research Base Omega. Throughout the player's adventure, they find two more caches, each containing one of the other parts to The Architect's body. When the player arrives in the Fabricator Base, they are told that they are able to construct Al-an a body and transfer his consciousness back into it.\n\nThe Player gets contacted by Sam to be told that The Vesper's supply of Enzyme 42 deteriorated overnight and that they need a sample from a nearby Sea Emperor Leviathan. As the player sends the Enzyme up to The Vesper, an Architect shield covers the planet causing the rocket containing the cure to explode. The player then calls Robin and the Mission director about what happened, Jeff then joins the call and says his intention to hold the Vesper crew hostage as they are most likely exposed to the Kharaa bacterium, alongside The Player being trapped on the surface. The Player then learns from Al-an that they need to head to the Mountain Alien Facility \n\n'''From here on, the Story is not implemented, and won't be.

Alterra is funding a smaller company called XenoWorks, which the player works for.

They tease, ponder, reminisce, philosophize and invent parables, and she sings them in a plush, changeable mezzo-soprano that usually holds a kindly twinkle\". Jon Pareles also described her songs as, \"\u2026songs that set character studies and philosophical musings in elaborate musical confections, often with long, internally rhymed lines.\" He continued, \"Ms. Feeney's music draws on sources across centuries. Her ensemble, including strings, trumpet and sometimes a recorder, often sounds like a Baroque consort, spinning contrapuntal arpeggios; it also hints at folk-pop, Minimalism and the metrical gamesmanship of progressive rock. \"One More Tune\" used syncopated handclaps reminiscent of Steve Reich and a trumpet line hinting at a village brass band, while a new song, \"If I Lose You Tonight,\" which she sang accompanied only by a few notes from a mandolin, had the melodic purity of a traditional Irish ballad. Her best-known song, 'Impossibly Beautiful' could almost be a pop motet, with vocal harmonies from her band members\". About her theatricality he commented, \"\u2026transforming her face from otherworldly composure to private mourning to nutty intensity, song by song. But the showmanship was a bonus; her songs easily stood on their own...Theatrical on the Shell, Intricate at the Core\".

The Huffington Post commented, \"Feeney presents an entrancing and startling evening of poetic imagery, well crafted stories, delicate emotions, unexpected cadences, sudden silences, coy humor and tightly-wound tunes with hit-caliber hooks, sometimes delivered with cool detachment, at other times with a riveting directness...It's high-wire performance art in a well-crafted show\u2013blocked, lighted and rehearsed like a theater piece\u2013that flows and eddies on shifts in tempo, mood, dynamics and instrumentation\". In relation to other performers it continued, \"Vocally, she's been compared to Sinead O'Connor and Bj\u00f6rk (a fellow traveler in extreme fashion) and to musicians ranging from Laurie Anderson to Elvis Costello, from David Bowie to Tori Amos. Other iconic musical performers came to mind\u2013Leonard Cohen, Paolo Conte, Tom Waits\u2014singers and songwriters with their own original hard-to-categorize, highly original styles.

They tease, ponder, reminisce, philosophize and invent parables, and she sings them in a plush, changeable mezzo-soprano that usually holds a kindly twinkle\". Jon Pareles also described her songs as, \"\u2026songs that set character studies and philosophical musings in elaborate musical confections, often with long, internally rhymed lines.\" He continued, \"Ms. Feeney's music draws on sources across centuries. Her ensemble, including strings, trumpet and sometimes a recorder, often sounds like a Baroque consort, spinning contrapuntal arpeggios; it also hints at folk-pop, Minimalism and the metrical gamesmanship of progressive rock. \"One More Tune\" used syncopated handclaps reminiscent of Steve Reich and a trumpet line hinting at a village brass band, while a new song, \"If I Lose You Tonight,\" which she sang accompanied only by a few notes from a mandolin, had the melodic purity of a traditional Irish ballad. Her best-known song, 'Impossibly Beautiful' could almost be a pop motet, with vocal harmonies from her band members\". About her theatricality he commented, \"\u2026transforming her face from otherworldly composure to private mourning to nutty intensity, song by song. But the showmanship was a bonus; her songs easily stood on their own...Theatrical on the Shell, Intricate at the Core\".

The Huffington Post commented, \"Feeney presents an entrancing and startling evening of poetic imagery, well crafted stories, delicate emotions, unexpected cadences, sudden silences, coy humor and tightly-wound tunes with hit-caliber hooks, sometimes delivered with cool detachment, at other times with a riveting directness...It's high-wire performance art in a well-crafted show\u2013blocked, lighted and rehearsed like a theater piece\u2013that flows and eddies on shifts in tempo, mood, dynamics and instrumentation\". In relation to other performers it continued, \"Vocally, she's been compared to Sinead O'Connor and Bj\u00f6rk (a fellow traveler in extreme fashion) and to musicians ranging from Laurie Anderson to Elvis Costello, from David Bowie to Tori Amos. Other iconic musical performers came to mind\u2013Leonard Cohen, Paolo Conte, Tom Waits\u2014singers and songwriters with their own original hard-to-categorize, highly original styles. I also heard echoes of French film soundtracks, Pachelbel's Canon, Nino Rota (known for his Fellini and The Godfather scores) Philip Glass and a long forgotten carousel ride.\" In relation to Feeney's microphone technique The Huffington Post commented, \"And her technique in using the microphone almost as a musical instrument reminded me of jazz legend Betty Carter\".\n\n==''13 songs'' (2005)==\nThe self-produced debut album won the [[Choice Music Prize]] for Irish Album of the Year in 2006 and garnered glowing 4 and five stars in all major UK and Irish press.\n\nA multi-instrumentalist, Feeney plays eleven instruments on ''13 songs'', including keyboards, alto recorder, treble recorder, [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[accordion]], violin, harmonica, [[melodica]], [[xylophone]] and a clock.
