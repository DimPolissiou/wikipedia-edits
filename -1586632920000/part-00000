The neighborhood is bounded by [[Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn|Manhattan Beach]] to its east, [[Lower New York Bay]] to the south and west, and [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]] to the north, and includes the subsections of [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn|Sea Gate]] to its west and [[Brighton Beach]] to its east. Coney Island was formerly the westernmost of the [[Outer Barrier]] islands on the southern shore of [[Long Island]], but in the early 20th century it became a peninsula, connected to the rest of Long Island by [[Land reclamation|land fill]].\n\nThe origin of Coney Island's name is disputed, but the area was originally part of the colonial town of Gravesend. By the mid-19th century it had become a [[seaside resort]], and by the late 19th century, [[amusement park]]s had also been built at the location. The attractions reached a historical peak during the first half of the 20th century. However, they declined in popularity after [[World War II]], and following years of neglect, several structures were torn down. Various redevelopment projects were proposed for Coney Island in the 1970s through the 2000s, though most of these were not carried out. The area was revitalized with the opening of [[MCU Park]] in 2001 and several amusement rides in the 2010s.\n\nConey Island has 31,965 residents as of the [[2010 United States Census]]. The neighborhood is ethnically diverse, and the neighborhood's poverty rate of 27% is slightly higher than that of the city as a whole.\n\nConey Island is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 13|Brooklyn Community District 13]] and its primary [[ZIP Code]] is 11224.<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\" /> It is patrolled by the 60th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]].<ref name=\"NYPD 60th Precinct\" /> Fire services are provided by the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s Engine 245/Ladder 161/Battalion 43 and Engine 318/Ladder 166.<ref name=\"fdny-locs\" /> Politically, Coney Island is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 47th District.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dc/downloads/pdf/brooklyn.pdf Current City Council Districts for Kings County], [[New York City]].

The peninsula is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} long and {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} wide. It extends into [[Lower New York Bay]] with [[Sheepshead Bay]] to its northeast, Gravesend Bay and [[Coney Island Creek]] to its northwest, and the main part of Brooklyn to its north. At its highest it is {{convert|7|feet|m}} above sea level. Coney Island was formerly an actual island, separated from greater Brooklyn by Coney Island Creek, and was the westernmost of the Outer Barrier islands. A large section of the creek was filled in the 1920s and 1930s, turning the island into a peninsula.<ref name=\"auto\" /> A narrower definition of the Coney Island neighborhood is given by the ''[[Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', which only considers the area west of Ocean Parkway (including Sea Gate and [[Nortons Point Light]]) to be part of that neighborhood.<ref>{{cite enc-nyc2|page=299}}</ref>\n\nThe perimeter of Coney Island features manmade structures designed to maintain its current shape.

Coney Island was formerly the westernmost of the [[Outer Barrier]] islands on the southern shore of [[Long Island]], but in the early 20th century it became a peninsula, connected to the rest of Long Island by [[Land reclamation|land fill]].\n\nThe origin of Coney Island's name is disputed, but the area was originally part of the colonial town of Gravesend. By the mid-19th century it had become a [[seaside resort]], and by the late 19th century, [[amusement park]]s had also been built at the location. The attractions reached a historical peak during the first half of the 20th century. However, they declined in popularity after [[World War II]], and following years of neglect, several structures were torn down. Various redevelopment projects were proposed for Coney Island in the 1970s through the 2000s, though most of these were not carried out. The area was revitalized with the opening of [[MCU Park]] in 2001 and several amusement rides in the 2010s.\n\nConey Island has 31,965 residents as of the [[2010 United States Census]]. The neighborhood is ethnically diverse, and the neighborhood's poverty rate of 27% is slightly higher than that of the city as a whole.\n\nConey Island is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 13|Brooklyn Community District 13]] and its primary [[ZIP Code]] is 11224.<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\" /> It is patrolled by the 60th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]].<ref name=\"NYPD 60th Precinct\" /> Fire services are provided by the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s Engine 245/Ladder 161/Battalion 43 and Engine 318/Ladder 166.<ref name=\"fdny-locs\" /> Politically, Coney Island is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 47th District.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dc/downloads/pdf/brooklyn.pdf Current City Council Districts for Kings County], [[New York City]].

The peninsula is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} long and {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} wide. It extends into [[Lower New York Bay]] with [[Sheepshead Bay]] to its northeast, Gravesend Bay and [[Coney Island Creek]] to its northwest, and the main part of Brooklyn to its north. At its highest it is {{convert|7|feet|m}} above sea level. Coney Island was formerly an actual island, separated from greater Brooklyn by Coney Island Creek, and was the westernmost of the Outer Barrier islands. A large section of the creek was filled in the 1920s and 1930s, turning the island into a peninsula.<ref name=\"auto\" /> A narrower definition of the Coney Island neighborhood is given by the ''[[Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', which only considers the area west of Ocean Parkway (including Sea Gate and [[Nortons Point Light]]) to be part of that neighborhood.<ref>{{cite enc-nyc2|page=299}}</ref>\n\nThe perimeter of Coney Island features manmade structures designed to maintain its current shape.

Panaigialios has a long tradition in Greek football championships and has several appearances in the Greek Super League (former A' Ethniki), 2nd Division and 3rd Division. Additionally the team has reached twice the semi-finals of the Greek Cup competition. Panegialios is one of the most successful and popular teams in Achaea and [[Peloponnese]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded on 25 February 1927 in Egio by local selected community members. The man who inspired the idea of the formation of a football club in Egio was Zisimos Livas. Livas, a well-known architect, together with Nick Gardeniotis, C. Sakellaropoulos, Ir. Anastasopoulos, K. Eliopoulos, K. Liritzis, Chr. Papandianos, etc. have established Panegialios G.S. It is worth to mention that the effort for the formation of a football club in Egio had begun from Livas in 1924. Until 1927 Livas and the other co-founders have raised money in order to establish the club. Finally in February 1927 they submitted the statute foundation of the club to the local judicial authorities.\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nPanegialios nickname since the late-1950s was Mavri Thiella (Black Storm). Also his players called Pasades tou Aigiou because they were very well paid for that era.\n\n=== Greek cup ===\nPanegialios has a big tradition in Greek Cup and twice reached the semi finals, in 1959 and 1981. Both has lost the qualification in the final from Olympiacos Piraeus. Additionally the club has reached the quarter finals twice.\n\n==Crest and colours==\nLike most old football clubs, Panegialios did not initially have any badge displayed on their shirts. The club's crest depicts two wrestlers of Greco-Roman wrestling. It is quite unusual for a football club to have a crest that refers to wrestling but the explanation has to do with Panegialios founder, Zisimos Livas. Livas was a lover Greco-Roman wrestling and had been an athlete of wrestling in [[Panellinios G.S]]. So in 1954 after the death of Zisimos Livas, the President of the Club Sotirios Panagiotopoulos in order to honor him, has decided to adopt the club the two wrestlers as a crest.\nThe colours of the team are black and white since 1927.\n\n==Stadium==\nPanegialios home ground is Aeghio Municipal (formerly \"National\") Stadium which has two stands along the sides of the pitch. The stadium has two almost identical stands, with electronic projectors, a modern canteen as well as a caf\u00e9. The stadium was inaugurated on April 29, 1949. In this location the stadium was formerly a football stadium, with no stands and surrounding arenas and other infrastructure, which was the seat of Panegyalos since its foundation in 1927. In 1983, it was placed on turf and 2011 plastic coating on the arena that surrounds the pitch of the football field. The stadium also had two similar small petals that raised the capacity of over 11,000 spectators. The petals were demolished during its refurbishment in 1985 except for a small section double of the western platform.\n\nThe record at the stage was 1963 in a match for the First National Division ([[Alpha Ethniki]]), between Panegialios and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], with 14,119 spectators.\n\n==Supporters==\nPanegialios F.C. has always had loyal supporters. The first fan club was created during the 1970s. It was called Sindesmos Filathlon Aigiou (S.F.A.) and later changed in Sindesmos Filathlon Panaigialeiou. In 2006 Bianconeri Club has established with strong presence in Panaigialios matches until nowadays.\n\n==League divisions==\n===League appearances ===\nPanegialos league appearances in national divisions since 1958-59.

Panaigialios has a long tradition in Greek football championships and has several appearances in the Greek Super League (former A' Ethniki), 2nd Division and 3rd Division. Additionally the team has reached twice the semi-finals of the Greek Cup competition. Panegialios is one of the most successful and popular teams in Achaea and [[Peloponnese]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded on 25 February 1927 in Egio by local selected community members. The man who inspired the idea of the formation of a football club in Egio was Zisimos Livas. Livas, a well-known architect, together with Nick Gardeniotis, C. Sakellaropoulos, Ir. Anastasopoulos, K. Eliopoulos, K. Liritzis, Chr. Papandianos, etc. have established Panegialios G.S. It is worth to mention that the effort for the formation of a football club in Egio had begun from Livas in 1924. Until 1927 Livas and the other co-founders have raised money in order to establish the club. Finally in February 1927 they submitted the statute foundation of the club to the local judicial authorities.\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nPanegialios nickname since the late-1950s was Mavri Thiella (Black Storm). Also his players called Pasades tou Aigiou because they were very well paid for that era.\n\n=== Greek cup ===\nPanegialios has a big tradition in Greek Cup and twice reached the semi finals, in 1959 and 1981. Both has lost the qualification in the final from Olympiacos Piraeus. Additionally the club has reached the quarter finals twice.\n\n==Crest and colours==\nLike most old football clubs, Panegialios did not initially have any badge displayed on their shirts. The club's crest depicts two wrestlers of Greco-Roman wrestling. It is quite unusual for a football club to have a crest that refers to wrestling but the explanation has to do with Panegialios founder, Zisimos Livas. Livas was a lover Greco-Roman wrestling and had been an athlete of wrestling in [[Panellinios G.S]]. So in 1954 after the death of Zisimos Livas, the President of the Club Sotirios Panagiotopoulos in order to honor him, has decided to adopt the club the two wrestlers as a crest.\nThe colours of the team are black and white since 1927.\n\n==Stadium==\nPanegialios home ground is Aeghio Municipal (formerly \"National\") Stadium which has two stands along the sides of the pitch. The stadium has two almost identical stands, with electronic projectors, a modern canteen as well as a caf\u00e9. The stadium was inaugurated on April 29, 1949. In this location the stadium was formerly a football stadium, with no stands and surrounding arenas and other infrastructure, which was the seat of Panegyalos since its foundation in 1927. In 1983, it was placed on turf and 2011 plastic coating on the arena that surrounds the pitch of the football field. The stadium also had two similar small petals that raised the capacity of over 11,000 spectators. The petals were demolished during its refurbishment in 1985 except for a small section double of the western platform.\n\nThe record at the stage was 1963 in a match for the First National Division ([[Alpha Ethniki]]), between Panegialios and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], with 14,119 spectators.\n\n==Supporters==\nPanegialios F.C. has always had loyal supporters. The first fan club was created during the 1970s. It was called Sindesmos Filathlon Aigiou (S.F.A.) and later changed in Sindesmos Filathlon Panaigialeiou. In 2006 Bianconeri Club has established with strong presence in Panaigialios matches until nowadays.\n\n==League divisions==\n===League appearances ===\nPanegialos league appearances in national divisions since 1958-59. It is one of the few clubs that has participated in all four national Greek divisions.\n* [[Alpha Ethniki]] - 7 appearances\n* [[Football League (Greece)|Beta Ethniki]] - 21 appearances \n* [[Football League 2 (Greece)|Gamma Ethniki]] - 15 appearances \n* [[Delta Ethniki]] - 15 appearances\n\n===National===\n*[[Gamma Ethniki 2012-13|2012-13]]: [[Gamma Ethniki|Gamma Ethniki (Third division)]] (South Group) 1st\n*[[Football League (Greece) 2013-14|2013-14]]: [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]] (South Group): 5th\n*[[Football League (Greece) 2014-15|2014-15]]: [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]] (South Group): 6th\n*[[Football League (Greece) 2015-16|2015-16]]: [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]]: 12th\n*[[Football League (Greece) 2016-17|2016-17]]: [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]]:  8th\n*[[Football League (Greece) 2017-18|2017-18]]: [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]]: 16th\n*[[Gamma Ethniki 2018-19|2018-19]]: [[Gamma Ethniki|Gamma Ethniki (Third division)]] 12th\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|16 October 2018}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=GK | name=[[Panagiotis Dounis]]}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=GK | name=George Panagiotopoulos}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=GK | name=Dimitris Mouzos}}\n----\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=DF | name=Marios Tzanoulinos }}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=DF | name=Giannis Gramatikas}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=DF | name=Stavros Christodoulopoulos}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=DF | name=Dimitris Kyriakopoulos}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=DF | name=Lefteris Mero }}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=ALB| pos=DF | name=Erion Aintin }}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=ALB| pos=DF | name=Armirad Kola }}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE| pos=DF | name=Vasilis Papaspiliopoulos }}\n----\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=MF| name=Giorgos Mpakatselos }}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=MF | name=Nikos Lougos }}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=ARG | pos=MF | name=Franco Toresani}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=MF | name=Vasilis Tsouris}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=MF | name=Thodoros Kotsokolos}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=MF | name=Philipos Roros}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=MF | name=Giannis Koutropoulos}}\n----\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=POR | pos=FW | name=[[Jos\u00e9 Em\u00edlio Furtado]]}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=FW | name=Miltiadis Mitropoulos}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=RUS | pos=FW | name=[[Sergey Kundik]]}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE| pos=FW | name=Panagiotis Skoutas}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=FW | name=Dionisis Kaloudis}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=FW | name=Dimitris Mazis}}\n{{Fs player| no= | nat=GRE | pos=FW | name=Thanasis Spiropoulos}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Notable players==\n[[File:Panaigialeios1927omada.jpg|thumb|340px|Old team, 1927]]\n\n*{{flagicon|Argentina}}Sergio Espinosa\n*{{flagicon|Estonia}} [[Kristen Viikm\u00e4e]]\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Nikos Alefantos]]\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Savvas Papazoglou]]\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Grigoris Aganian]]\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} Lakis Sofianos\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Nikos Karamanlis (soccer player)|Nikos Karamanlis]]\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} [[Kostas Davourlis]]\n*{{flagicon|Greece}} Mixalis Kritikopoulos\n*{{Flagicon|Nicaragua}} [[Armanto Gkoufas]]\n\n==Personnel==\n\n===Management===\n{{Fb cs header}}\n{{Fb cs staff |bg=    |p=President|s= {{flagicon|Greece}} Dimitris Balafoutis}}\n{{Fb cs staff |bg=y   |p=Vice-President |s= {{flagicon|Greece}} Nikos kiriazopoulos}}\n|}\n\n===Coaching staff===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n|-\n!

It has since spent six weeks in the top 20, and twenty-four weeks in the top 100, peaking at number 13 in the UK charts and number 5 in the UK R&B charts. Later that year, he released \"079ME\" and \"Juice\", which both also entered the UK charts. 079ME peaked at number 23 in the UK charts, and number 12 in the UK R&B charts. It spent 16 weeks in the top 100. Juice reached number 96 in the UK charts.<ref name=offcharts />\n\n===2019: Gucci Demon===\nIn July 2019, B Young released Gucci Demon, which peaked at number 44 in the UK charts. Other than that, it was a quiet year for B Young, as he was barely active on any social media platforms and released just one single.\n\n===2020: Return===\nOn 13 February 2020, B Young released \"Wine\". It has been his only release as of yet in 2020. He has pledged to release music more often this year.

According to a Khatri legend of the 19th century, they continued their military service until the time of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, when the death of many of their number during the emperor's Deccan Campaign caused him to order their [[Women in Hinduism#Widowhood and remarriage|widows to be remarried]]. The order was made out of sympathy for the widows but when the Khatri community leaders refused to obey it, Aurangzeb terminated their military service and said that they should be shopkeepers and brokers. This legend is probably fanciful: John McLane notes that a more likely explanation for their revised position was that a Sikh rebellion against the Mughals in the early 1700s severely compromised the Khatri's ability to trade and forced them to take sides. Those who were primarily dependent on the Mughals went to significant lengths to assert that allegiance in the face of accusations that they were in fact favouring the rebel [[Jat Sikh]]s, led by [[Banda Singh Bahadur|Banda]]. The outcome of their assertions - which included providing financial support to the Mughals and shaving their beards - was that the Khatris became still more important to the Mughal rulers as administrators at various levels, in particular because of their skills in financial management and their historic connections with bankers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth-Century Bengal |first=John R. |last=McLane |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YH6ijJnUPmcC&pg=PA132 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-52654-8 |pages=132\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Suresh Kumar described Khatris as silk weavers.<ref>{{Cite book|editor1-first=Kumar Suresh |editor1-last=Singh |editor1-link=Kumar Suresh Singh |year=1998|title=India's Communities |volume=2 H\u2013M |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi, India|pages=1722, 1729|isbn=978-0-19-563354-2}}</ref> Author Purnima Dhawan described that together with [[Jat people|Jat]] community, the Khatris gained considerably from the expansion of the Mughal empire, although both groups supported [[Guru Hargobind]] in his campaign for Sikh self-government in the Punjab plains.<ref>{{cite book |title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799 |first=Purnima |last=Dhavan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19987-717-1 |pages=3, 30\u201331 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q0ZpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA31}}</ref> The khatris played an important role in India's trans-regional trade during the period,<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Indian diasporas |first=Gijsbert |last=Oonk |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2007 |page=43 |isbn=978-90-5356-035-8}}</ref> being described by Scott Cameron Levi as among the \"most important merchant communities of early modern India.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Indian Diaspora in Central Asia and Its Trade, 1550\u20131900 |first=Scott Cameron |last=Levi |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2002 |isbn=978-90-04-12320-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qVkNBge8mIC}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nKhatris consider themselves to be of pure [[Vedic]] descent and thus superior to the [[Rajput]]s who, like them, claim the [[Kshatriya]] status of the Hindu [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna system]].<ref name=\"syan\">{{cite book |last=Syan |first=Hardip Singh |year=2013 |title=Sikh Militancy in the Seventeenth Century: Religious Violence in Mughal and Early Modern India |publisher=I.

According to a Khatri legend of the 19th century, they continued their military service until the time of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, when the death of many of their number during the emperor's Deccan Campaign caused him to order their [[Women in Hinduism#Widowhood and remarriage|widows to be remarried]]. The order was made out of sympathy for the widows but when the Khatri community leaders refused to obey it, Aurangzeb terminated their military service and said that they should be shopkeepers and brokers. This legend is probably fanciful: John McLane notes that a more likely explanation for their revised position was that a Sikh rebellion against the Mughals in the early 1700s severely compromised the Khatri's ability to trade and forced them to take sides. Those who were primarily dependent on the Mughals went to significant lengths to assert that allegiance in the face of accusations that they were in fact favouring the rebel [[Jat Sikh]]s, led by [[Banda Singh Bahadur|Banda]]. The outcome of their assertions - which included providing financial support to the Mughals and shaving their beards - was that the Khatris became still more important to the Mughal rulers as administrators at various levels, in particular because of their skills in financial management and their historic connections with bankers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth-Century Bengal |first=John R. |last=McLane |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YH6ijJnUPmcC&pg=PA132 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-52654-8 |pages=132\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Suresh Kumar described Khatris as silk weavers.<ref>{{Cite book|editor1-first=Kumar Suresh |editor1-last=Singh |editor1-link=Kumar Suresh Singh |year=1998|title=India's Communities |volume=2 H\u2013M |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi, India|pages=1722, 1729|isbn=978-0-19-563354-2}}</ref> Author Purnima Dhawan described that together with [[Jat people|Jat]] community, the Khatris gained considerably from the expansion of the Mughal empire, although both groups supported [[Guru Hargobind]] in his campaign for Sikh self-government in the Punjab plains.<ref>{{cite book |title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799 |first=Purnima |last=Dhavan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19987-717-1 |pages=3, 30\u201331 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q0ZpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA31}}</ref> The khatris played an important role in India's trans-regional trade during the period,<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Indian diasporas |first=Gijsbert |last=Oonk |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2007 |page=43 |isbn=978-90-5356-035-8}}</ref> being described by Scott Cameron Levi as among the \"most important merchant communities of early modern India.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Indian Diaspora in Central Asia and Its Trade, 1550\u20131900 |first=Scott Cameron |last=Levi |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2002 |isbn=978-90-04-12320-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qVkNBge8mIC}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nKhatris consider themselves to be of pure [[Vedic]] descent and thus superior to the [[Rajput]]s who, like them, claim the [[Kshatriya]] status of the Hindu [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna system]].<ref name=\"syan\">{{cite book |last=Syan |first=Hardip Singh |year=2013 |title=Sikh Militancy in the Seventeenth Century: Religious Violence in Mughal and Early Modern India |publisher=I.
