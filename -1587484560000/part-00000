A recent age estimate for TW PsA ({{val|400|70|u=million years}}) agrees very well with the isochronal age for Fomalhaut ({{val|450|40|u=million years}}), further arguing for the two stars forming a physical binary.<ref name=\"age_mam\"/>\n\nThe designation TW Piscis Austrini is astronomical nomenclature for a [[variable star]]. Fomalhaut B is a [[flare star]] of the type known as a [[BY Draconis variable]]. It varies slightly in [[apparent magnitude]], ranging from 6.44 to 6.49 over a 10.3 day period. While smaller than the [[Sun]], it is relatively large for a flare star. Most flare stars are red [[stellar classification|M-type]] dwarfs.\n\nIn 2019 a team of researchers analyzing the astrometry, radial velocity measurements, and images of Fomalhaut B suggested the existence of a planet orbiting the star with a mass of {{val|1.2|0.7|0.6}} Jupiter Masses, and an poorly defined orbital period of up to 80 years.<ref>{{cite arxiv |last1=De Rosa |first1=Robert J. |last2=Esposito |first2=Thomas M. |last3=Hirsch |first3=Lea A. |last4=Nielsen |first4=Eric L. |last5=Marley |first5=Mark S. |last6=Kalas |first6=Paul |last7=Wang |first7=Jason J. |last8=Macintosh |first8=Bruce |title=The Possible Astrometric Signature of a Planetary-mass Companion to the Nearby Young Star TW Piscis Austrini (Fomalhaut B): Constraints from Astrometry, Radial Velocities, and Direct Imaging |date=7 October 2019 |eprint=1910.02965 |class=astro-ph.EP }}</ref>\n\n{{OrbitboxPlanet begin\n| name = Fomalhaut B\n| table_ref =<ref name=\"FomalhautBb\">{{cite web |title=Exo.MAST |url=https://exo.mast.stsci.edu/exomast_planet.html?planet=TIC206686962TCE1 |website=exo.mast.stsci.edu |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n{{OrbitboxPlanet hypothetical\n| exoplanet = Bb\n| period = <30000 days\n|mass (Jupiter masses)=1.2 +/- 0.7}}\n{{Orbitbox end}}\n\n==Fomalhaut C (LP 876-10)==\n{{main|Fomalhaut C}}\nLP 876-10 is also associated with the Fomalhaut system, making it a trinary star. In October 2013, Eric Mamajek and collaborators from the [[RECONS]] consortium announced that the previously known high-proper-motion star [[LP 876-10]] had a distance, velocity, and color-magnitude position consistent with being another member of the Fomalhaut system.<ref name=\"Mamajek2013\" /> LP 876-10 was originally catalogued as a high-proper-motion star by [[Willem Luyten]] in his 1979 [[NLTT#Proper motion catalogues|NLTT]] catalogue; however, a precise trigonometric parallax and radial velocity was only measured quite recently. [[LP 876-10]] is a [[red dwarf]] of spectral type M4V, and located even further from Fomalhaut A than TW PsA\u2014about 5.7\u00b0 away from Fomalhaut A in the sky, in the neighbouring constellation [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], whereas both Fomalhaut A and TW PsA are located in constellation [[Piscis Austrinus]]. Its current separation from Fomalhaut A is about {{convert|0.77|pc|ly|abbr=off}}, and it is currently located {{convert|0.987|pc|ly|abbr=off}} away from TW PsA (Fomalhaut B). LP 876-10 is located well within the tidal radius of the Fomalhaut system, which is {{convert|1.9|pc|ly|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"Mamajek2013\" /> Although LP 876-10 is itself catalogued as a binary star in the [[Washington Double Star Catalog]] (called \"WSI 138\"), there was no sign of a close-in stellar companion in the imaging, spectral, or astrometric data in the Mamajek et al. study.<ref name=\"Mamajek2013\" /> In December 2013, Kennedy et al. reported the discovery of a cold dusty debris disk associated with Fomalhaut C, using infrared images from the [[Herschel Space Observatory]].

Its declination is greater than that of [[Sirius]] and similar to that of [[Antares]]. At 40\u00b0N, Fomalhaut rises above the horizon for eight hours and reaches only 20\u00b0 above the horizon, while [[Capella (star)|Capella]], which rises at approximately the same time, will stay above the horizon for twenty hours.

He is a three-time Olympic medalist, is an [[African records in swimming|African record]] holder, and trains with the USC Trojans team based at the [[University of Southern California]], where he studied as a computer science undergraduate and swam collegiately.\n\nSince returning from an Adderall related drugs ban, Oussama Mellouli has been the 1500 m freestyle World champion at the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships]] with a winning time of 14:37.28, then the second best performance of all time.

He swam for the USC Trojans and graduated in 2007 with a computer science bachelor's degree. He is a scholarship holder with the [[Olympic Solidarity]] program.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Swimming Timeline==\n===2001===\nMellouli won 1 silver medal in the 400m IM at the [[2001 Mediterranean Games]], in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].\n\n===2003===\nMellouli first established himself on the world scene at the [[2003 World Aquatics Championships|2003 World Championships]] in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]] where he won a bronze in the 400m Individual Medley finishing behind [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cseh]] and a world record performance from [[Michael Phelps]].\n\n===2004===\nAt the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] he finished 5th in the 400 IM, setting the [[African records in swimming|African Record]] in the process. He further distinguished himself at the [[2004 FINA Short Course World Championships]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, USA]] where he won the first international-level gold medal in swimming for [[Tunisia]], in the 400m IM, finishing over a second ahead of second and third-place finishers [[Robin Francis]] and [[Eric Shanteau]]. Later on at the meet he would go on to win bronze in the 200m IM.\n\n===2005===\nHe was able to better his Athens mark with his bronze-medal swim in the 400 IM event at the [[2005 World Aquatics Championships]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]].  He also won the bronze-medal in the 400 freestyle at that same event. He also won three gold medals (800 m freestyle, 400m medley, 200m medley) at the [http://www.almeria2005.es XVth Mediterranean Games] in Almer\u00eda, Spain.\n\n===2006===\nOn 1 December 2006 Elias beat Michael Phelps in the 400m IM at the U.S. Open in West Lafayette: Mellouli clocked 4:15.61, ahead of Phelps with 4:18.32.<ref>[http://www.usaswimming.org/USASWeb/_Rainbow/Documents/601b51f2-d2a0-46fb-aef3-e1e9772b519b/061130F020.htm US Open 2006 results: Men's 400 IM final]. Archived on the [[USA Swimming]] website and retrieved 2009-07-23.</ref> This swim however was subsequently placed within Mellouli's 18-month doping ban, and the results nullified, as the drug test where the banned substance was found occurred at this meet (see section below for further information).\n\n===2007===\nOn 19 February 2007 he broke his own African Record in the 200m individual medley for the fourth time since 2003 at the [[USA Swimming]] Grand Prix meet, held at the [[Mizzou Aquatic Center]] at the [[University of Missouri]]. He also set a new African record in the 400 meter individual medley.\n\nOn 25 March 2007 he won the silver in the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 m freestyle]] (3:45.12) at the [[2007 World Aquatics Championships|2007 World Championships]] in Melbourne, Australia. Three days later, on 28 March, he swam to the first Tunisian World Championship in swimming in winning the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's 800 metre freestyle|800m freestyle]] in a then [[List of African records in swimming|African Record]] of 7:46.95 \u2014 one of the top 10 fastest times ever. However, due to his positive drug-testing result from a in-competition test from December 2006 and the 18-month competition ban imposed on him on 11 September 2007 by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS), retroactive from 30 November 2006 forward, his 2007 World Championships results have been nullified. He was also a finalist in the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metre individual medley|400 m individual medley]], where he originally finished fourth in 4:11.68.\n\nFollowing the 11 September 2007 ruling by CAS, Mellouli was not allowed to compete again up mid-2008. All of Mellouli's results from 2007 have been nullified, per his September 2007 doping suspension, related to his positive test from December 2006 (see section below).\n\n===2008 Olympics===\nMellouli came into the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] in Beijing, China entered in two events, the 400m and 1500m freestyle events. In his first event, the 400m free despite setting a new African record in the final, he could only manage fifth place in a time of 3:43.45. Mellouli would however go on to win the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metre freestyle|1500m freestyle]] and set a new African record. In doing so, he became the first African male swimmer to ever win an Olympic gold medal in an individual swimming event (the South African men's 4 \u00d7 100 m Free Relay won the event at the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]]).\n\n===2009===\nMellouli won 5 gold medals (200m and 400m individual medley, and 200m, 400m and 1500m freestyles) at the [[Swimming at the 2009 Mediterranean Games|XVI Mediterranean Games]] in Pescara, Italy.\n\nIn the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships]], held in Rome during the summer, Mellouli won a gold medal in the 1500 meter freestyle and 2 silver medals in the 400 meter freestyle and 800 meter freestyle.\n\n===2010===\nMellouli won 4 medals ( 1 gold in the 1500 freestyle; 1 silver in the 400 medley and 2 bronzes in the 200 m freestyle and the 400 m freestyle) at the  [[2010 FINA Short Course World Championships]] (25m) in Dubai, UAE.\n\n===2011===\nMellouli won 16 medals ( 15 gold and 1 silver ) at the [[2011 Pan Arab Games]] in Doha, Qatar.\n\n===2012===\nMellouli won 2 medals (1 gold in the [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's marathon 10 kilometre|10km marathon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/london-olympics-2012/news/Mellouli-wins-mens-10km-swimming-marathon/articleshow/15436220.cms|title=Mellouli wins men's 10km swimming marathon|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref> and 1 bronze in the [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metre freestyle|1500m freestyle]]) at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] held in London, UK. He became the first person to win medals in both pool and open-water swimming in the same Olympics.\n\n===2013===\nMellouli won 1 gold medal in the [[Open water swimming at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's 5 km|5km marathon]] at the [[2013 World Aquatics Championships|2013 World Championships]], in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]].\n\n===2016===\nMellouli participated in two competitions in [[Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]] but did not win any medals. In the [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics - Men's 1500 metre freestyle|1500m freestyle]] he came first in his heat with 15:07.78 (considerably slower than his [[London 2012 Summer Olympics]] time of 14:40.31<ref>[https://www.olympic.org/oussama-mellouli Oussama MELLOULI - Olympic Swimming | Tunisia], olympic.org. Accessed August 23, 2016.</ref>) but ranked 21st in the competition thus did not qualify for the final. He also competed in the [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics - Men's marathon 10 kilometre|10km marathon]] finishing in the 12th place with 1:53:06 (+0:00:07 of the gold winner).<ref>https://www.rio2016.com/en/athlete/oussama-mellouli</ref>.\n\n==Positive drug test==\nA few weeks after the conclusion of the [[2007 World Aquatics Championships|2007 World Championships]], reports began to surface that Mellouli had tested positive for a banned substance at the 2006 U.S. Open, 30 November \u2013 2 December 2006. These reports surfaced because [[FINA]], the international governing body of the sport, had discovered that Tunisian authorities had known about the positive test but had only given him a warning. FINA/WADA rules state that when an athlete tests positive for a banned substance, he or she must be given a 2-year ban from the sport.  Accordingly, FINA took the case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS), demanding stiffer sanction.\n\nMellouli has since admitted that he took the [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]] medication [[Adderall]], a [[stimulant]] and a form of [[amphetamine]]. (Already in June 2006, an American sports commentator wrote: ''Various studies show rampant use of Adderall, Ritalin and other drugs normally used for attention deficit disorder instead applied toward all-night cramming sessions.''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615032317/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13214435/ \"Consider ending drug policies in sports: Maybe best solution is just to let pro athletes take whatever they want\"], Commentary by Bob Cook, ''[[MSNBC.com]]'', 10 June 2006. Retrieved on 2007-09-13.</ref> ) Mellouli did not have a prescription for the drug, having claimed to have received it from another [[University of Southern California|USC]] student shortly before the US Open.

He further distinguished himself at the [[2004 FINA Short Course World Championships]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, USA]] where he won the first international-level gold medal in swimming for [[Tunisia]], in the 400m IM, finishing over a second ahead of second and third-place finishers [[Robin Francis]] and [[Eric Shanteau]]. Later on at the meet he would go on to win bronze in the 200m IM.\n\n===2005===\nHe was able to better his Athens mark with his bronze-medal swim in the 400 IM event at the [[2005 World Aquatics Championships]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]].  He also won the bronze-medal in the 400 freestyle at that same event. He also won three gold medals (800 m freestyle, 400m medley, 200m medley) at the [http://www.almeria2005.es XVth Mediterranean Games] in Almer\u00eda, Spain.\n\n===2006===\nOn 1 December 2006 Oussama Mellouli beat Michael Phelps in the 400m IM at the U.S. Open in West Lafayette: Mellouli clocked 4:15.61, ahead of Phelps with 4:18.32.<ref>[http://www.usaswimming.org/USASWeb/_Rainbow/Documents/601b51f2-d2a0-46fb-aef3-e1e9772b519b/061130F020.htm US Open 2006 results: Men's 400 IM final]. Archived on the [[USA Swimming]] website and retrieved 2009-07-23.</ref> This swim however was subsequently placed within Mellouli's 18-month doping ban, and the results nullified, as the drug test where the banned substance was found occurred at this meet (see section below for further information).\n\n===2007===\nOn 19 February 2007 he broke his own African Record in the 200m individual medley for the fourth time since 2003 at the [[USA Swimming]] Grand Prix meet, held at the [[Mizzou Aquatic Center]] at the [[University of Missouri]]. He also set a new African record in the 400 meter individual medley.\n\nOn 25 March 2007 he won the silver in the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 m freestyle]] (3:45.12) at the [[2007 World Aquatics Championships|2007 World Championships]] in Melbourne, Australia. Three days later, on 28 March, he swam to the first Tunisian World Championship in swimming in winning the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's 800 metre freestyle|800m freestyle]] in a then [[List of African records in swimming|African Record]] of 7:46.95 \u2014 one of the top 10 fastest times ever. However, due to his positive drug-testing result from a in-competition test from December 2006 and the 18-month competition ban imposed on him on 11 September 2007 by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS), retroactive from 30 November 2006 forward, his 2007 World Championships results have been nullified. He was also a finalist in the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metre individual medley|400 m individual medley]], where he originally finished fourth in 4:11.68.\n\nFollowing the 11 September 2007 ruling by CAS, Mellouli was not allowed to compete again up mid-2008. All of Mellouli's results from 2007 have been nullified, per his September 2007 doping suspension, related to his positive test from December 2006 (see section below).\n\n===2008 Olympics===\nMellouli came into the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] in Beijing, China entered in two events, the 400m and 1500m freestyle events. In his first event, the 400m free despite setting a new African record in the final, he could only manage fifth place in a time of 3:43.45. Mellouli would however go on to win the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metre freestyle|1500m freestyle]] and set a new African record. In doing so, he became the first African male swimmer to ever win an Olympic gold medal in an individual swimming event (the South African men's 4 \u00d7 100 m Free Relay won the event at the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]]).\n\n===2009===\nMellouli won 5 gold medals (200m and 400m individual medley, and 200m, 400m and 1500m freestyles) at the [[Swimming at the 2009 Mediterranean Games|XVI Mediterranean Games]] in Pescara, Italy.\n\nIn the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships]], held in Rome during the summer, Mellouli won a gold medal in the 1500 meter freestyle and 2 silver medals in the 400 meter freestyle and 800 meter freestyle.\n\n===2010===\nMellouli won 4 medals ( 1 gold in the 1500 freestyle; 1 silver in the 400 medley and 2 bronzes in the 200 m freestyle and the 400 m freestyle) at the  [[2010 FINA Short Course World Championships]] (25m) in Dubai, UAE.\n\n===2011===\nMellouli won 16 medals ( 15 gold and 1 silver ) at the [[2011 Pan Arab Games]] in Doha, Qatar.\n\n===2012===\nMellouli won 2 medals (1 gold in the [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's marathon 10 kilometre|10km marathon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/london-olympics-2012/news/Mellouli-wins-mens-10km-swimming-marathon/articleshow/15436220.cms|title=Mellouli wins men's 10km swimming marathon|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref> and 1 bronze in the [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metre freestyle|1500m freestyle]]) at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] held in London, UK.

He also competed in the [[Swimming at the 2016 Summer Olympics - Men's marathon 10 kilometre|10km marathon]] finishing in the 12th place with 1:53:06 (+0:00:07 of the gold winner).<ref>https://www.rio2016.com/en/athlete/oussama-mellouli</ref>.\n\n==Positive drug test==\nA few weeks after the conclusion of the [[2007 World Aquatics Championships|2007 World Championships]], reports began to surface that Mellouli had tested positive for a banned substance at the 2006 U.S. Open, 30 November \u2013 2 December 2006. These reports surfaced because [[FINA]], the international governing body of the sport, had discovered that Tunisian authorities had known about the positive test but had only given him a warning. FINA/WADA rules state that when an athlete tests positive for a banned substance, he or she must be given a 2-year ban from the sport.  Accordingly, FINA took the case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS), demanding stiffer sanction.\n\nMellouli has since admitted that he took the [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]] medication [[Adderall]], a [[stimulant]] and a form of [[amphetamine]]. (Already in June 2006, an American sports commentator wrote: ''Various studies show rampant use of Adderall, Ritalin and other drugs normally used for attention deficit disorder instead applied toward all-night cramming sessions.''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615032317/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13214435/ \"Consider ending drug policies in sports: Maybe best solution is just to let pro athletes take whatever they want\"], Commentary by Bob Cook, ''[[MSNBC.com]]'', 10 June 2006.

He argued that he took the pill in order to help himself with writing a [[term paper]] (to sustain or enhance his academic performance) in the days leading up to the weekend US Open meet, and that the drug was not intended as a performance-enhancing substance for competitive swimming.

Kang's ship, the ''Damocles'', launches devices which cause a section of Xandar to disappear. Meanwhile, at [[Avengers Mansion]], [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] presents the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with several missions: [[Captain America]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] fight the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]] in [[Siberia]]; [[Iron Man]] and [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat [[Attuma]] at his underwater base; and [[Spider-Man]], [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]], and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] battle several escaped supervillains on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. The Guardians arrive just before Kang, who uses his devices to steal [[Manhattan]] with the heroes inside it and makes it part of his battle arena called [[Chronopolis (Marvel Comics)|Chronopolis]], consisting of various locales that he has stolen from across time and space with his citadel at its center.\n\nCaptain America leads a team through a portal to Medieval England, where they help [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Sir Percy]] reclaim his castle from the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]. A team led by She-Hulk follows [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] through a portal to [[Wakanda]], where [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] joins them to fight [[Man-Ape]] in the [[vibranium]] mines. The heroes converge in a version of Manhattan ruled by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], where they battle Klaw and vibranium soldiers created by [[Arnim Zola]], and defeat [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] in a [[dogfight]]. Thor, Captain Marvel, and She-Hulk travel to a swamp where they vanquish [[Man-Thing]]. Kang reveals that Man-Thing was guarding the Nexus of All Realities, which kept the various realms of Chronopolis separated. Kang destroys the Nexus and challenges the heroes to rise up and face him.\n\nRegrouping at Avengers Mansion, the heroes detect a faint signal from outside Chronopolis. Searching for a device to boost its strength, the Guardians travel to the [[American frontier|Old West]] where they battle [[MODOK]] and the [[Circus of Crime]]. Retrieving the device, they learn that the signal is being sent from [[Knowhere]] by [[Cosmo the Spacedog]]. The heroes plan to retrieve the fragments of the Nexus in order to bring Knowhere into Chronopolis and use its energies to bring down the barrier surrounding Kang's citadel. In preparation, [[Doctor Strange]] leads a team to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] where they fight [[Baron Mordo]] and retrieve the Book of the Vishanti, while Thor leads a party to apocalyptic [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to enlist the aid of [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], facing [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] in the process.\n\nThe search for the five Nexus fragments again splits the heroes into teams. Captain America's group travels to the underwater city of Lemuria, but falls into a trap and must battle the Red King and several versions of the [[Hulk]] in Sakaar. Joined by the Hulk and [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], they return to Lemuria and defeat Attuma, retrieving a fragment. Moving on to [[Ancient Egypt]], they enter a [[Sphinx]] and join Horus of the [[Heliopolitans]] in facing [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] and [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] to obtain another. Spider-Man's group visits the ''[[Marvel Noir]]'' version of Manhattan, where they help [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], and [[Spider-Man Noir]] defeat the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]. Iron Fist accompanies them to K'un-L'un, where they fight [[Steel Serpent]] to free [[Shou-Lao]] and retrieve a Nexus fragment. Proceeding to the [[Alchemax]] building in ''[[Marvel 2099]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nueva York, [[Spider-Gwen]] and [[Spider-Man 2099]] help them defeat the ''2099'' version of [[Green Goblin]] and a fusion of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] to obtain another fragment. In the [[Kree]] home world of Hala, the Guardians battle [[Ronan the Accuser]]. Meanwhile, in Attilan, the [[Inhumans]] defeat [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. [[Black Bolt]] and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] then head to Hala, where they free the Guardians from the control of the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and help them retrieve another fragment. As Kang observes the heroes' exploits and plots to destroy them, his assistant [[Ravonna]] becomes increasingly disturbed by his actions.\n\nWith the fragments gathered, the heroes assemble a device to bring Knowhere through a portal opened by Doctor Strange. Their first attempt nearly brings [[Ego the Living Planet]] through instead. Once Knowhere is in Chronopolis, they use an [[electromagnetic pulse]] to knock out the energy shield protecting Kang's citadel. As they begin their assault, Kang summons the ''Damocles''. Iron Man, Spider-Man, and [[Star-Lord]] disable the ship, battling [[Korvac]] and escaping before it crashes. Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, and Star-Lord enter the citadel and face Kang, who grows to gigantic size, uses the time crystal to reverse the ''Damocles''<nowiki>'</nowiki> destruction, and wields it as a sword. Captain America creates a giant solid hologram of himself and uses it to defeat Kang. Ravonna betrays Kang and uses the time crystal to turn him into a baby.

Kang's ship, the ''Damocles'', launches devices which cause a section of Xandar to disappear. Meanwhile, at [[Avengers Mansion]], [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] presents the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with several missions: [[Captain America]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] fight the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]] in [[Siberia]]; [[Iron Man]] and [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] defeat [[Attuma]] at his underwater base; and [[Spider-Man]], [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]], and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] battle several escaped supervillains on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. The Guardians arrive just before Kang, who uses his devices to steal [[Manhattan]] with the heroes inside it and makes it part of his battle arena called [[Chronopolis (Marvel Comics)|Chronopolis]], consisting of various locales that he has stolen from across time and space with his citadel at its center.\n\nCaptain America leads a team through a portal to Medieval England, where they help [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Sir Percy]] reclaim his castle from the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]. A team led by She-Hulk follows [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] through a portal to [[Wakanda]], where [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] joins them to fight [[Man-Ape]] in the [[vibranium]] mines. The heroes converge in a version of Manhattan ruled by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], where they battle Klaw and vibranium soldiers created by [[Arnim Zola]], and defeat [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] in a [[dogfight]]. Thor, Captain Marvel, and She-Hulk travel to a swamp where they vanquish [[Man-Thing]]. Kang reveals that Man-Thing was guarding the Nexus of All Realities, which kept the various realms of Chronopolis separated. Kang destroys the Nexus and challenges the heroes to rise up and face him.\n\nRegrouping at Avengers Mansion, the heroes detect a faint signal from outside Chronopolis. Searching for a device to boost its strength, the Guardians travel to the [[American frontier|Old West]] where they battle [[MODOK]] and the [[Circus of Crime]]. Retrieving the device, they learn that the signal is being sent from [[Knowhere]] by [[Cosmo the Spacedog]]. The heroes plan to retrieve the fragments of the Nexus in order to bring Knowhere into Chronopolis and use its energies to bring down the barrier surrounding Kang's citadel. In preparation, [[Doctor Strange]] leads a team to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] where they fight [[Baron Mordo]] and retrieve the Book of the Vishanti, while Thor leads a party to apocalyptic [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to enlist the aid of [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], facing [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] in the process.\n\nThe search for the five Nexus fragments again splits the heroes into teams. Captain America's group travels to the underwater city of Lemuria, but falls into a trap and must battle the Red King and several versions of the [[Hulk]] in Sakaar. Joined by the Hulk and [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], they return to Lemuria and defeat Attuma, retrieving a fragment. Moving on to [[Ancient Egypt]], they enter a [[Sphinx]] and join Horus of the [[Heliopolitans]] in facing [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] and [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] to obtain another. Spider-Man's group visits the ''[[Marvel Noir]]'' version of Manhattan, where they help [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], and [[Spider-Man Noir]] defeat the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]. Iron Fist accompanies them to K'un-L'un, where they fight [[Steel Serpent]] to free [[Shou-Lao]] and retrieve a Nexus fragment. Proceeding to the [[Alchemax]] building in ''[[Marvel 2099]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nueva York, [[Spider-Gwen]] and [[Spider-Man 2099]] help them defeat the ''2099'' version of [[Green Goblin]] and a fusion of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] to obtain another fragment. In the [[Kree]] home world of Hala, the Guardians battle [[Ronan the Accuser]]. Meanwhile, in Attilan, the [[Inhumans]] defeat [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. [[Black Bolt]] and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] then head to Hala, where they free the Guardians from the control of the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and help them retrieve another fragment. As Kang observes the heroes' exploits and plots to destroy them, his assistant [[Ravonna]] becomes increasingly disturbed by his actions.\n\nWith the fragments gathered, the heroes assemble a device to bring Knowhere through a portal opened by Doctor Strange. Their first attempt nearly brings [[Ego the Living Planet]] through instead. Once Knowhere is in Chronopolis, they use an [[electromagnetic pulse]] to knock out the energy shield protecting Kang's citadel. As they begin their assault, Kang summons the ''Damocles''. Iron Man, Spider-Man, and [[Star-Lord]] disable the ship, battling [[Korvac]] and escaping before it crashes. Captain America, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, and Star-Lord enter the citadel and face Kang, who grows to gigantic size, uses the time crystal to reverse the ''Damocles''<nowiki>'</nowiki> destruction, and wields it as a sword. Captain America creates a giant solid hologram of himself and uses it to defeat Kang. Ravonna betrays Kang and uses the time crystal to turn him into a baby. The heroes celebrate their victory, and Ravonna promises to return the components of Chronopolis to their original places in time and space once the remaining villains are dealt with.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], with everything restored to normal, Iron Man, Captain America, and Captain Marvel are visited by Ravonna in her new alias as Terminatrix. She is accompanied by an elderly Kang, the Supreme Intelligence, Cosmo, and Man-Thing, who inform the Avengers of a \"chronal fracture incident\".\n\n==Audio==\nDue to the game being affected by the [[2016\u201317 video game voice actor strike]], the cast from the previous game as well from ''[[Lego Marvel's Avengers]]'' did not return to reprise their roles as they were affiliated with the [[SAG-AFTRA|Screen Actors Guild\u2010American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nintendoeverything.com/lego-marvel-2-spotted-on-voice-actor-strike-document/ |title=\"LEGO Marvel 2\" spotted on voice actor strike document |author=Brian |date=3 November 2016 |website=Nintendo Everything}}</ref> While in favor of a new voice cast, [[Greg Miller (Internet celebrity)|Greg Miller]] voices [[Howard the Duck]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/agentm/status/888135929151447040 |title=#LEGOMarvel2 reveal: @GameOverGreggy voicing Howard the Duck who becomes the Iron Duck.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

This gender contribution has received significant attention from researchers and the media. A group of researchers and practitioners offered several opinions on why this has been an issue. The gender research literature  suggests that  the  difference  in  contribution  rates  could  be  due  to three factors:  (1) the high levels of conflict in discussions, (2)  dislike  of  critical  environments,  and  (3)  lack  of confidence in editing other contributors' work.<ref>https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2145204.2145265</ref><ref name=nytimes20jun2015>{{cite web |author1 = Andrew Lih |title = Can Wikipedia Survive? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |website = www.nytimes.com |accessdate = 21 June 2015 |location = Washington |date = 20 June 2015 |quote = ...the considerable and often-noted gender gap among Wikipedia editors; in 2011, less than 15 percent were women. |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150621032208/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |archivedate = 21 June 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=EditorSurveys>Statistics based on Wikimedia Foundation Wikipedia editor surveys [https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AEditor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf&page=1 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702163818/https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AEditor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf&page=1 |date=2 July 2017 }} (Nov. 2010-April 2011) and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011 November 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605124632/https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011 |date=5 June 2016 }} (April \u2013 October 2011)</ref><ref name=PLOS>{{cite journal |last1 = Hill |first1 = Benjamin Mako |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |last3 = S\u00e1nchez |first3 = Angel |title = The Wikipedia Gender Gap Revisited: Characterizing Survey Response Bias with Propensity Score Estimation |journal = PLoS ONE |date = 26 June 2013 |volume = 8 |issue = 6 |pages = e65782 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0065782 |pmid = 23840366 |pmc = 3694126 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...865782H |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Consequently, Wikipedia has been criticized by some academics and journalists for having primarily male contributors,<ref name=Cohen110130 /><ref>{{cite web |url = http://firstmonday.org/article/view/4291/3381 |title = \"Free as in sexist?\": Free culture and the gender gap |work = [[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |accessdate = 10 October 2015 |author = Reagle, Joseph |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150520205049/http://firstmonday.org/article/view/4291/3381 |archivedate = 20 May 2015 |df = dmy-all |author-link = Joseph Reagle }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2/ |title = Joseph Reagle on the gender gap in geek culture |date = 26 February 2013 |accessdate = 10 October 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015917/http://surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2/ |archivedate = 17 November 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> and for having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to use more words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the \"null gender\" (in other words, that \"male\" is assumed unless otherwise specified, an example of [[male as norm]]).<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |title = Computational Linguistics Reveals How Wikipedia Articles Are Biased Against Women |last = arXiv |first = Emerging Technology from the |work = MIT Technology Review |access-date = 21 August 2017 |archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170927024309/https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |archive-date = 27 September 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref> Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about \"what matters\".

The authors found that when editors determine if a subject is notable enough to include on Wikipedia, they hold women to a higher standard of notability, resulting in women on Wikipedia being slightly more notable than men on Wikipedia. As for topical bias, biographies about women tend to focus more on family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics. This is especially true for biographies of women born before 1900. The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.\n\nA 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]].

Editing on Wikipedia requires \"particular forms of [[Sociotechnical system|sociotechnical]] expertise and authority that constitute the knowledge or [[epistemological]] infrastructure of Wikipedia\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Heather|last2=Wajcman|first2=Judy|date=August 2017|title='Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia's infrastructure and the gender gap|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=47|issue=4|pages=511\u2013527|doi=10.1177/0306312717692172|pmid=28791929|issn=0306-3127|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/1/Wajcman_Anyone%20can%20edit_Final_2017.pdf|access-date=8 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919063205/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/1/Wajcman_Anyone%20can%20edit_Final_2017.pdf|archive-date=19 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  People who are equipped with this expertise and skill are considered more likely to reach positions with power in Wikipedia. These are proposed to be predominantly men.\n\nStudies have also considered the gender bias in Wikipedia from a historical perspective. Konieczny and Klein indicated that Wikipedia is just a part of our biased society which has a long history of [[gender inequality]].<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Konieczny|first=Piotr|last2=Klein|first2=Maximilian|date=December 2018|title=Gender gap through time and space: A journey through Wikipedia biographies via the Wikidata Human Gender Indicator|journal=New Media & Society|volume=20|issue=12|pages=4608\u20134633|doi=10.1177/1461444818779080|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> As Wikipedia records daily activities by individual editors, it serves as both \"a reflection of the world\" and \"a tool used to produce our world\".<ref name=\":12\" /> Even though gender bias is reducing slowly, it remains an existing problem.\n\n== Reactions ==\n\nThe [[Wikimedia Foundation]] has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that \"in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia.

This gender contribution has received significant attention from researchers and the media. A group of researchers and practitioners offered several opinions on why this has been an issue. The gender research literature  suggests that  the  difference  in  contribution  rates  could  be  due  to three factors:  (1) the high levels of conflict in discussions, (2)  dislike  of  critical  environments,  and  (3)  lack  of confidence in editing other contributors' work.<ref>https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2145204.2145265</ref><ref name=nytimes20jun2015>{{cite web |author1 = Andrew Lih |title = Can Wikipedia Survive? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |website = www.nytimes.com |accessdate = 21 June 2015 |location = Washington |date = 20 June 2015 |quote = ...the considerable and often-noted gender gap among Wikipedia editors; in 2011, less than 15 percent were women. |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150621032208/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |archivedate = 21 June 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=EditorSurveys>Statistics based on Wikimedia Foundation Wikipedia editor surveys [https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AEditor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf&page=1 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702163818/https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AEditor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf&page=1 |date=2 July 2017 }} (Nov. 2010-April 2011) and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011 November 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605124632/https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011 |date=5 June 2016 }} (April \u2013 October 2011)</ref><ref name=PLOS>{{cite journal |last1 = Hill |first1 = Benjamin Mako |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |last3 = S\u00e1nchez |first3 = Angel |title = The Wikipedia Gender Gap Revisited: Characterizing Survey Response Bias with Propensity Score Estimation |journal = PLoS ONE |date = 26 June 2013 |volume = 8 |issue = 6 |pages = e65782 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0065782 |pmid = 23840366 |pmc = 3694126 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...865782H |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Consequently, Wikipedia has been criticized by some academics and journalists for having primarily male contributors,<ref name=Cohen110130 /><ref>{{cite web |url = http://firstmonday.org/article/view/4291/3381 |title = \"Free as in sexist?\": Free culture and the gender gap |work = [[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |accessdate = 10 October 2015 |author = Reagle, Joseph |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150520205049/http://firstmonday.org/article/view/4291/3381 |archivedate = 20 May 2015 |df = dmy-all |author-link = Joseph Reagle }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2/ |title = Joseph Reagle on the gender gap in geek culture |date = 26 February 2013 |accessdate = 10 October 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015917/http://surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2/ |archivedate = 17 November 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> and for having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

Conflict means [[online harassment]], [[trolling]] and competition which women generally do not like; Criticism refers to women's unwillingness to edit someone else's work and to let their work be edited by someone else; Confidence shows that women are often not too confident about their own expertise and ability in editing and contributing to a certain work.<ref name=\":04\" /> Wikipedia's free to edit policy gives Internet users an open platform, while also unconsciously breeding a competitive and critical environment that limits women's incentives to participate.\n\nThrough examining the power infrastructure of Wikipedia, Ford and Wajcman pointed out another cause that may reinforce Wikipedia's gender bias.

Electrified track was laid to the station site and quarterly proving cars ran for nearly twentyfive years, but no revenue-earning car ever travelled to or from the halt.\n\n==Overview==\nThe electric railway was built primarily to carry workers between [[Grimsby]] and [[Immingham Dock]] which the [[Great Central Railway]] had built on a greenfield site in a sparsely populated area. The line was built by the Great Central and remained in railway ownership up to closure in 1961. It therefore appeared in railway timetables{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|page=717}} and it was possible to buy through tickets between any of the stops on the line and anywhere on the national railway network,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=112}} though there never was any physical connection with any conventional track, nor with the tramways in Grimsby and Cleethorpes.\n\nIn modern parlance the vehicles would be described as trams, but they were typically referred to locally as \"tramcars\", with related things being called names such as \"tramcar halt\" and \"tramcar bridge\" with \"car\" a more common short form than \"tram.\"\n\n==Location and facilities==\n[[Immingham Town electric railway station|Immingham Town]] - known locally as \"Tramcar Halt\" - was situated outside the dock estate in what in 2012 was still open country. It was the nearest point to the line for its two lesser markets - railwaymen travelling to and from [[Immingham engine shed]] and residents of the village of Immingham,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=69}} by far the greatest market being dock workers. The station was nevertheless a third of a mile from the engine shed and a good mile from the village proper.\n\nWhen the line was proposed it included plans to continue from Immingham Town southwest along Queens Road to a point near the footpath to [[Immingham engine shed|engine shed]], or \"Loco\" as it was called locally. A 1966 aerial photograph shows a single decker bus in the near foreground very close to where the tramcar halt would have been.{{sfn|King|Hewins|1989|loc=Photo 43}}\n\nWhen the line was completed in 1913 the extension was omitted. Influential fingers were wagged so the [[Great Central Railway|company]] grudgingly built it to what would have been Queens Road Halt.

Electrified track was laid to the station site and quarterly proving cars ran for nearly twentyfive years, but no revenue-earning car ever travelled to or from the halt.\n\n==Overview==\nThe electric railway was built primarily to carry workers between [[Grimsby]] and [[Immingham Dock]] which the [[Great Central Railway]] had built on a greenfield site in a sparsely populated area. The line was built by the Great Central and remained in railway ownership up to closure in 1961. It therefore appeared in railway timetables{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|page=717}} and it was possible to buy through tickets between any of the stops on the line and anywhere on the national railway network,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=112}} though there never was any physical connection with any conventional track, nor with the tramways in Grimsby and Cleethorpes.\n\nIn modern parlance the vehicles would be described as trams, but they were typically referred to locally as \"tramcars\", with related things being called names such as \"tramcar halt\" and \"tramcar bridge\" with \"car\" a more common short form than \"tram.\"\n\n==Location and facilities==\n[[Immingham Town electric railway station|Immingham Town]] - known locally as \"Tramcar Halt\" - was situated outside the dock estate in what in 2012 was still open country. It was the nearest point to the line for its two lesser markets - railwaymen travelling to and from [[Immingham engine shed]] and residents of the village of Immingham,{{sfn|Price|1991|page=69}} by far the greatest market being dock workers. The station was nevertheless a third of a mile from the engine shed and a good mile from the village proper.\n\nWhen the line was proposed it included plans to continue from Immingham Town southwest along Queens Road to a point near the footpath to [[Immingham engine shed|engine shed]], or \"Loco\" as it was called locally. A 1966 aerial photograph shows a single decker bus in the near foreground very close to where the tramcar halt would have been.{{sfn|King|Hewins|1989|loc=Photo 43}}\n\nWhen the line was completed in 1913 the extension was omitted. Influential fingers were wagged so the [[Great Central Railway|company]] grudgingly built it to what would have been Queens Road Halt. The extension was single track with a passing loop at the halt.{{sfn|Price|1991|page=77}} Proving tramcars ran along the extension every quarter to maintain the right of way, but no revenue earning vehicle ever traversed it.{{sfn|Dow|1965|page=242}} The overhead wires and points were removed in the Second World War{{sfn|Price|1991|page=77}}{{sfn|WEA|1994|p=24}} and all trace of the unused branch had gone by 1955.\n\n==Services==\nUnusually among British tramways, services ran round the clock, particularly to provide for railway workers based at [[Immingham engine shed]], whose duties often involved starting or finishing at unsocial hours. Traffic was highly peaked, with convoys of tramcars leaving and arriving to match shift changes at the dock.
