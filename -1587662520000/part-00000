The Broncos fell behind 14\u20130 in the first half against the [[2019 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] on [[Monday Night Football]]. On the game's opening drive, Raiders' quarterback [[Derek Carr]] threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Tyrell Williams]], and running back [[Josh Jacobs]] added a 2-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Broncos placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] missed short on a 63-yard field goal attempt just before halftime. The Broncos reached the red zone on their first three possessions of the second half, but were forced to settle for field goals by McManus on each drive\u2014two 26-yarders in the third quarter and a 39-yarder midway through the fourth quarter. Wide receiver [[DaeSean Hamilton]] dropped a potential touchdown pass on the second drive. Following the second field goal, the Raiders increased their lead to 21\u20136, with Jacobs' second touchdown run of the game (a 4-yarder), and then to 24\u20139, with a 29-yard field goal by placekicker [[Daniel Carlson (American football)|Daniel Carlson]] at the 4:41 mark of the third quarter. After three red zone attempts that all resulted in short field goals, the Broncos finally reached the end zone with 2:18 remaining in the fourth quarter. [[Joe Flacco]], in his debut as the Broncos' starting quarterback, connected on a 1\u2013yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] to narrow the Raiders' lead to 24\u201316.

The Bears increased their lead to 13\u20133 late in the third quarter, with running back [[David Montgomery (American football)|David Montgomery]] diving for a 1-yard touchdown. For a second consecutive week, the Broncos were held without a touchdown for the first three quarters, and were once again plagued by red-zone woes. The Broncos reached the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but were forced to settle on a 32-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within a 13\u20136 deficit. After forcing a Bears' punt, the Broncos were attempting to tie the game and reached the Bears' 2-yard line with 4:51 remaining; however, quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was intercepted by Bears' cornerback [[Kyle Fuller]]. The Broncos forced another Bears' punt, and got the football back at their own 38-yard line with 2:48 remaining in the game. After burning all of their timeouts, the Broncos finally reached the end zone with 37 seconds remaining, with Flacco connecting with wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] on a 7-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos were initially planning to go for the two-point conversion, but a delay-of-game penalty pushed them back five yards. The Broncos then attempted the game-tying extra point, which McManus missed wide right; however, Bears' cornerback [[Buster Skrine]] was whistled for an offsides penalty. The Broncos attempted another two-point conversion, which was successful, with a Flacco completion to Sanders. The Bears had one final drive, which began at their own 25-yard line with 31 seconds remaining. On the first play, Broncos' linebacker [[Bradley Chubb]] was whistled for a questionable roughing the passer penalty on Bears' quarter [[Mitchell Trubisky]], which added 15 yards to a 5-yard completion to tight end [[Trey Burton]]. After three consecutive incomplete passes and a 5-yard penalty for having too many men on the field, the Bears faced a 4th-and-15 from their own 40-yard line. Trubisky completed a 25-yard pass to wide receiver [[Allen Robinson]] in the middle of the field to the Broncos' 35-yard line, and the Bears' final timeout was called with one second remaining.

Broncos return specialist [[Diontae Spencer]] returned the ensuing kickoff to the Packers' 43-yard line, but the Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their initial possession. After forcing a Green Bay punt, the Broncos pulled even early in the second quarter, with running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The next two scoring plays came from each placekicker\u2014a 42-yard field goal by the Packers' [[Mason Crosby]], followed by one from 30 yards by the Broncos' [[Brandon McManus]]. The Broncos suffered turnovers on two of their next three possessions, and the Packers capitalized as a result. First, Broncos quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was strip-sacked by Packers linebacker [[Preston Smith (linebacker)|Preston Smith]] at the Denver 5-yard line. The Packers reclaimed the lead just before halftime, with a 7-yard touchdown run by running back [[Aaron Jones (running back)|Aaron Jones]]. Then early in the third quarter, linebacker [[Jaire Alexander]] forced a fumble off Broncos tight end [[Noah Fant]] at the Denver 37-yard line, and Jones' second rushing touchdown\u2014from 1 yard out\u2014increased the Packers' lead to 24\u201310. The Broncos responded with a 12-play, 75-yard drive, with Lindsay's second 1-yard touchdown run\u2014this one on a 4th-and-goal. However, McManus hit the left upright on his extra point attempt, leaving the score at 24\u201316. After forcing the Packers to punt, the Broncos advanced to the Green Bay 38-yard line late in the third quarter; however, Flacco was intercepted by safety [[Darnell Savage Jr.]] The Packers increased their lead to 27\u201316 with less than 6 minutes to play, thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Crosby. The Broncos had two more possessions, but could not reach midfield on either drive\u2014both ending with Flacco getting sacked and turning over the football on downs. Flacco was sacked six times, and for a third consecutive game, the Broncos' defense failed to record a sack or force a turnover.

The Broncos elected for a two-point conversion attempt at the 1-yard line following an offside penalty against the Chiefs on the extra-point attempt. However, running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] was denied by the Chiefs' defense, and it was all downhill for the Broncos after that, as the Chiefs scored the final 30 points of the game.

He threw two touchdown passes\u2014the first one to wide receiver [[Courtland Sutton]] for 21 yards in the first quarter, and the second one a 75-yarder to tight end [[Noah Fant]] early in the second quarter. The Broncos' defense yielded four red zone opportunities by the [[2019 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]]' offense in the second quarter, but forced the Browns to settle for four field goals by placekicker [[Austin Seibert]] in the second quarter\u2014the third one occurred after the Browns' defense forced a fumble deep in Broncos' territory. Broncos' placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] added a 43-yard field goal just after the two-minute warning for a 17\u201312 halftime lead. The Broncos' defense subdued the Browns on another red zone opportunity at the 5:23 mark of the third quarter, with linebackers [[Todd Davis (American football)|Todd Davis]] and [[Von Miller]] denying Browns' quarterback [[Baker Mayfield]] on a 4th-and-1 at the 5-yard line. The Browns unsuccessfully challenged the ruling on the field, and seven plays later, the Broncos increased their lead to 24\u201312, with a 30-yard run by running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] late in the third quarter. The Browns responded on their next drive, and with 10:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, Mayfield connected with wide receiver [[Jarvis Landry]] on a 9-yard touchdown to narrow the Broncos' lead to 24\u201319. The drive was aided by a defensive pass interference penalty on cornerback [[Chris Harris, Jr.]] on a 3rd-and-7 at the Broncos' 19-yard line. After forcing a Broncos' punt, the Browns reached the Broncos' 28-yard line with 3:23 remaining in the game and no timeouts, facing a 4th-and-4. However, Mayfield's pass intended for Landry was incomplete, and the Broncos' ran out the clock, thanks to a critical third-down conversion by Lindsay on a wildcat formation.

The Broncos fell behind 14\u20130 in the first half against the [[2019 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] on [[Monday Night Football]]. On the game's opening drive, Raiders' quarterback [[Derek Carr]] threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Tyrell Williams]], and running back [[Josh Jacobs]] added a 2-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Broncos placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] missed short on a 63-yard field goal attempt just before halftime. The Broncos reached the red zone on their first three possessions of the second half, but were forced to settle for field goals by McManus on each drive\u2014two 26-yarders in the third quarter and a 39-yarder midway through the fourth quarter. Wide receiver [[DaeSean Hamilton]] dropped a potential touchdown pass on the second drive. Following the second field goal, the Raiders increased their lead to 21\u20136, with Jacobs' second touchdown run of the game (a 4-yarder), and then to 24\u20139, with a 29-yard field goal by placekicker [[Daniel Carlson (American football)|Daniel Carlson]] at the 4:41 mark of the third quarter. After three red zone attempts that all resulted in short field goals, the Broncos finally reached the end zone with 2:18 remaining in the fourth quarter. [[Joe Flacco]], in his debut as the Broncos' starting quarterback, connected on a 1\u2013yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] to narrow the Raiders' lead to 24\u201316.

The Bears increased their lead to 13\u20133 late in the third quarter, with running back [[David Montgomery (American football)|David Montgomery]] diving for a 1-yard touchdown. For a second consecutive week, the Broncos were held without a touchdown for the first three quarters, and were once again plagued by red-zone woes. The Broncos reached the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but were forced to settle on a 32-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within a 13\u20136 deficit. After forcing a Bears' punt, the Broncos were attempting to tie the game and reached the Bears' 2-yard line with 4:51 remaining; however, quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was intercepted by Bears' cornerback [[Kyle Fuller]]. The Broncos forced another Bears' punt, and got the football back at their own 38-yard line with 2:48 remaining in the game. After burning all of their timeouts, the Broncos finally reached the end zone with 37 seconds remaining, with Flacco connecting with wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] on a 7-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos were initially planning to go for the two-point conversion, but a delay-of-game penalty pushed them back five yards. The Broncos then attempted the game-tying extra point, which McManus missed wide right; however, Bears' cornerback [[Buster Skrine]] was whistled for an offsides penalty. The Broncos attempted another two-point conversion, which was successful, with a Flacco completion to Sanders. The Bears had one final drive, which began at their own 25-yard line with 31 seconds remaining. On the first play, Broncos' linebacker [[Bradley Chubb]] was whistled for a questionable roughing the passer penalty on Bears' quarter [[Mitchell Trubisky]], which added 15 yards to a 5-yard completion to tight end [[Trey Burton]]. After three consecutive incomplete passes and a 5-yard penalty for having too many men on the field, the Bears faced a 4th-and-15 from their own 40-yard line. Trubisky completed a 25-yard pass to wide receiver [[Allen Robinson]] in the middle of the field to the Broncos' 35-yard line, and the Bears' final timeout was called with one second remaining.

Broncos return specialist [[Diontae Spencer]] returned the ensuing kickoff to the Packers' 43-yard line, but the Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their initial possession. After forcing a Green Bay punt, the Broncos pulled even early in the second quarter, with running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The next two scoring plays came from each placekicker\u2014a 42-yard field goal by the Packers' [[Mason Crosby]], followed by one from 30 yards by the Broncos' [[Brandon McManus]]. The Broncos suffered turnovers on two of their next three possessions, and the Packers capitalized as a result. First, Broncos quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] was strip-sacked by Packers linebacker [[Preston Smith (linebacker)|Preston Smith]] at the Denver 5-yard line. The Packers reclaimed the lead just before halftime, with a 7-yard touchdown run by running back [[Aaron Jones (running back)|Aaron Jones]]. Then early in the third quarter, linebacker [[Jaire Alexander]] forced a fumble off Broncos tight end [[Noah Fant]] at the Denver 37-yard line, and Jones' second rushing touchdown\u2014from 1 yard out\u2014increased the Packers' lead to 24\u201310. The Broncos responded with a 12-play, 75-yard drive, with Lindsay's second 1-yard touchdown run\u2014this one on a 4th-and-goal. However, McManus hit the left upright on his extra point attempt, leaving the score at 24\u201316. After forcing the Packers to punt, the Broncos advanced to the Green Bay 38-yard line late in the third quarter; however, Flacco was intercepted by safety [[Darnell Savage Jr.]] The Packers increased their lead to 27\u201316 with less than 6 minutes to play, thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Crosby. The Broncos had two more possessions, but could not reach midfield on either drive\u2014both ending with Flacco getting sacked and turning over the football on downs. Flacco was sacked six times, and for a third consecutive game, the Broncos' defense failed to record a sack or force a turnover.

The Broncos elected for a two-point conversion attempt at the 1-yard line following an offside penalty against the Chiefs on the extra-point attempt. However, running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] was denied by the Chiefs' defense, and it was all downhill for the Broncos after that, as the Chiefs scored the final 30 points of the game.

He threw two touchdown passes\u2014the first one to wide receiver [[Courtland Sutton]] for 21 yards in the first quarter, and the second one a 75-yarder to tight end [[Noah Fant]] early in the second quarter. The Broncos' defense yielded four red zone opportunities by the [[2019 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]]' offense in the second quarter, but forced the Browns to settle for four field goals by placekicker [[Austin Seibert]] in the second quarter\u2014the third one occurred after the Browns' defense forced a fumble deep in Broncos' territory. Broncos' placekicker [[Brandon McManus]] added a 43-yard field goal just after the two-minute warning for a 17\u201312 halftime lead. The Broncos' defense subdued the Browns on another red zone opportunity at the 5:23 mark of the third quarter, with linebackers [[Todd Davis (American football)|Todd Davis]] and [[Von Miller]] denying Browns' quarterback [[Baker Mayfield]] on a 4th-and-1 at the 5-yard line. The Browns unsuccessfully challenged the ruling on the field, and seven plays later, the Broncos increased their lead to 24\u201312, with a 30-yard run by running back [[Phillip Lindsay]] late in the third quarter. The Browns responded on their next drive, and with 10:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, Mayfield connected with wide receiver [[Jarvis Landry]] on a 9-yard touchdown to narrow the Broncos' lead to 24\u201319. The drive was aided by a defensive pass interference penalty on cornerback [[Chris Harris, Jr.]] on a 3rd-and-7 at the Broncos' 19-yard line. After forcing a Broncos' punt, the Browns reached the Broncos' 28-yard line with 3:23 remaining in the game and no timeouts, facing a 4th-and-4. However, Mayfield's pass intended for Landry was incomplete, and the Broncos' ran out the clock, thanks to a critical third-down conversion by Lindsay on a wildcat formation.

It is the first series to be produced by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, and is currently co-produced with Studio SOI in [[Germany]] and Great Marlborough Productions Limited.\n\nOne unique feature of the series is its lack of stylistic unity.

Gumball attends school with his siblings at Elmore Junior High, where throughout the series he interacts with his various middle school classmates, most prominently his love interest Penny Fitzgerald (also Gallagher).\n\nOne prominent feature of the series since its third season is \"The Void\", a dimension inside of Elmore where all the universe's mistakes reside.

He pitched ''The Amazing World of Gumball'' to the network and [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]] executive Daniel Lennard subsequently greenlit production of the series. It is the first series to be produced by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, and is currently co-produced with Studio SOI in [[Germany]] and Great Marlborough Productions Limited.\n\nOne unique feature of the series is its lack of stylistic unity. Characters are designed, filmed, and animated using multiple styles and techniques (stylised [[traditional animation]], [[puppetry]], [[computer animation|CGI]], [[stop motion]], [[Flash animation]], [[live-action]], etc.)<ref>[http://www.toonzone.net/2011/04/toonzone-interviews-the-amazing-world-of-gumball-creator-ben-bocquelet/ Interview with Ben Bocquelet] in Toonzone</ref>\n\nThe series has made multiple stylistic changes throughout its production, specifically in the transition between its first and second seasons. Such changes include character redesigns, an increase in the use of [[Visual effects|VFX]], higher quality animation, and a shift towards a much darker, more [[Satire|satirical]] comedic style.\n\nBocquelet later stated on September 6, 2016 that the sixth season would be his last time working on the show and that production could continue without him.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} 2 years later, on October 7, 2018, he retweeted a blog post from RegularCapital stating that the sixth season will be the last, though the author would make a follow-up post saying that more seasons are still possible according to Turner Northern Europe.<ref name=\"regularcapital.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.regularcapital.com/2018/10/more-seasons-of-the-amazing-world-of-gumball-is-still-a-possiblity/|title=More Seasons Of The Amazing World Of Gumball Is Still A Possibility|website=RegularCapital|date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> A six-episode miniseries titled ''Darwin's Yearbook'' was announced for the series in November.<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cn-brings-back-gumball-with-special-darwins-yearbook-episodes/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWhen [[Cartoon Network Studios Europe]] was created in 2007, [[Ben Bocquelet]] was hired to help people pitch their projects to [[Cartoon Network|the network]].

Gumball attends school with his siblings at Elmore Junior High, where throughout the series he interacts with his various middle school classmates, most prominently his love interest Penny Fitzgerald (also Gallagher).\n\nOne prominent feature of the series since its third season is \"The Void\", a dimension inside of Elmore where all the universe's mistakes reside.
