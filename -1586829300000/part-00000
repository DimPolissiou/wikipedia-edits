His first album of photographs, published in 1886, was entitled ''Life and Landscape on the Norfolk Broads'', and it consisted of 40 platinum prints that were informed by these ideas.

In 1889 he published a controversial and influential book ''Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art'', in which he explained his philosophy of art and straightforward photography. The book was described by one writer as \"the bombshell dropped at the tea party\" because of the case it made that truthful and realistic photographs would replace contrived photography.<ref name=LEG /> This was a direct attack on the popular tradition of [[combination printing|combining many photographs]] to produce one image that had been pioneered by [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Reijlander]] and [[Henry Peach Robinson]] in the 1850s. Some of Robinson's photographs were of twenty or more separate photographs combined to produce one image. This allowed the production of images that, especially in early days, could not have been produced indoors in low light, and it also made possible the creation of highly dramatic images, often in imitation of allegorical paintings. Emerson denounced this technique as false and claimed that photography should be seen as a genre of its own, not one that seeks to imitate other art forms.\n\nAll Emerson's own pictures were taken in a single shot and without [[retouching]], which was another form of manipulation that he strongly disagreed with, calling it \"the process by which a good, bad, or indifferent photograph is converted into a bad drawing or painting\".<ref name=LEG />\n[[File:Peter Henry Emerson - The Poacher - A Hare in View - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=the hunters, ph emerson, a hare in view, photography|thumb|402x402px|This is a photo from Emerson's album \"The Hunters\" depicting a hunter and his dog sourced from Nancy Newhall's book \"P.H.

Following contemporary optical theories, he produced photographs with one area of sharp focus while the remainder was unsharp. He vehemently pursued this argument about the nature of seeing and its representation in photography, to the discomfort of the photographic establishment.\n\nAnother of Emerson's passionate beliefs was that photography was an art and not a mechanical reproduction. An argument with the establishment ensued on this point as well, but Emerson found that his defence of photography as art failed, and he had to allow that photography was probably a form of mechanical reproduction.

Noire''''' is a [[neo-noir]] [[Detective fiction|detective]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Team Bondi]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It was released in May 2011 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], in November 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in November 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. The story is set in [[Los Angeles]] in 1947 and follows a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) officer, who solves a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects; the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe open-world design lets players freely roam Los Angeles's open landscape, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The story is centred on the case sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. It is played through a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. ''L.A. Noire'' also contains elements found in [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] games, such as side missions and a branching storyline. The game uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio, and features an original score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/13771/rockstar-recommends-chinatown.html |title=Rockstar Recommends: \"Chinatown\" |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Development of L.A. Noire|development of ''L.A. Noire'']] began in 2004, shortly after the founding of Team Bondi, and was shared between the multiple Rockstar studios around the world. The game was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio was met with public complaints from staff members, and Team Bondi closed shortly after the game's initial release. The development team found influence from the plot and aesthetic elements of [[film noir]]\u2014stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity\u2014along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes of the time for its in-game cases.<ref name=\"RealLife_Crime\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/14351/the-red-lipstick-murder-real-crime-stories-of-1947-los-angeles-t.html |title=Real Life \"Red Lipstick Murder\" of 1947 |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe game is notable for being the first to use the newly developed MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis.

Each desk gives the player a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns the player with cases that they must solve. After each case, the player receives a rating of 1\u20135 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, the player can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps's war memories. Near the end of the final desk, the player assumes control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the [[player character]] for most of the rest of the game; although different in appearance and personality, his controls are identical to Phelps.\n\n[[File:LA Noire interrogation.jpg|left|thumb|250px|When interrogating witnesses and suspects, the player has the option to believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying.]]\nThe game blends investigative elements with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights.<ref name=\"Gamespot-Review\"/> The player character uses [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks and firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the world. In combat, [[auto-aim]] and a [[cover system]] can be used as assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's [[Health (gaming)|health]] will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, the player has the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. The player can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, the player may engage in optional side investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.\n\nSuspects and witnesses in a case can be interrogated for information. When the interviewee responds, the player is given the option to either believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying.{{efn|These options are presented as \"Truth\", \"Doubt\", and \"Lie\" in the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows versions.

Noire characters}}\nFollowing the end of [[World War II]], Cole Phelps ([[Aaron Staton]]), a decorated [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]], returns to Los Angeles, California, to live with his family while taking on work as a patrol officer of the [[LAPD]]. After successfully solving a major murder case in 1947 and being promoted to [[detective]], Phelps earns a reputation over the next six months for solving difficult cases for both the [[Moving violation|Traffic]] and [[Homicide#Criminal_homicide|Homicide]] divisions; he most notably concludes the [[Black Dahlia]] case.\n\nUpon being promoted into the [[Vice#Vice_squad|Vice]] division, he becomes involved in the investigation into [[military surplus]] [[morphine]] [[syrette]]s being sold on the street, stolen from the ship that had brought home his former Marine unit. He eventually learns that several members of his former unit had stolen and distributed the morphine, only for them to be assassinated on the orders of [[Mickey Cohen]] ([[Patrick Fischler]]), who controlled the Los Angeles drug trade and resented the competition. During this time, Phelps falls for German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann ([[Erika Heynatz]]) and soon has an affair with her.\n\nRoy Earle ([[Adam J. Harrington]]), his partner in Vice and a [[Police corruption|corrupt cop]], helps several prominent figures in the city draw attention away from [[Brenda Allen|a major scandal]] by exposing Phelps's adultery before he can further question Courtney Sheldon, a member of Phelps's former unit, over his involvement with the stolen morphine. In exchange, Earle is given a place in a syndicate known as the Suburban Redevelopment Fund (SRF)\u2014a program founded under the pretense of providing affordable housing for returning World War II [[veteran]]s, financially supported by the same people. Phelps's marriage ends, he becomes disgraced in the LAPD, and he is demoted to the [[Arson]] desk, where he is tasked with investigating a number of suspicious house fires. Despite noting a strong connection between them and a housing development that the SRF operates, Phelps is warned off by Earle from pursuing the syndicate and its founder, tycoon developer Leland Monroe ([[John Noble]]). Seeking help to investigate the development, Phelps prompts an old comrade, Jack Kelso ([[Gil McKinney]]), now an investigator for the California Fire & Life Insurance Company, to look into the matter.\n\nKelso quickly discovers that the development is using unsuitable building materials and that his boss Curtis Benson, a member of the SRF, is insuring them despite this fact. Following this discovery, Kelso is kidnapped by hitmen hired by Monroe. Following his escape and subsequent hospitalization, Kelso agrees to become an investigator for Leonard Petersen ([[Larry Sullivan]]) \u2013 assistant to the [[district attorney]] \u2013 and informs him of the SRF's misdemeanors, with the idea that exposing the fund would aid Petersens' campaign to become the new district attorney. Following a shootout at Monroe's mansion, Kelso learns that the syndicate used a patient of prominent [[psychiatrist]] Harlan Fontaine, a member of the SRF, to burn down the homes of those who would not agree to sell their property to the fund; eventually, his patient accidentally killed four people in one such fire and became irreversibly traumatised. Confronting Fontaine at his [[clinic]], the patient murders Fontaine and kidnaps Elsa. \n\nInvestigating Fontaine's clinic, Phelps discovers that the syndicate was merely a front to defraud the US Federal Government \u2014 Monroe would acquire land with money invested by the syndicate and build surreptitiously cheap houses on them to increase their value, knowing the government would later purchase the plots through [[eminent domain]] to make space for a new freeway. Phelps also discovers that Sheldon had provided Fontaine with the stolen morphine, under the pretense that Fontaine would legally provide the morphine to medical facilities with the profits being reinvested into the SRF; Sheldon is later murdered by Fontaine after gaining knowledge of Kelso's investigation into the SRF.\n\nFollowing an investigation into the patient responsible for the fires, Kelso realises that Fontaine's patient was Ira Hogeboom, a former [[flamethrower]] operator from his and Phelps' unit who became [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|severely traumatised]] after unintentionally burning out a cave of civilians on Phelps's orders. Phelps and Kelso pursue Hogeboom and Elsa into the [[Los Angeles River]] Tunnels as intense rainfall begins. The pair rescue Elsa, and Kelso executes the obviously incapacitated Hogeboom to [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|end his suffering]]. As the water rises within the tunnels following the intense rainfall, the group attempt to escape; Phelps is unable to reach the exit, and drowns. Petersen later makes a deal with several members of the SRF to testify against Monroe and Benson in exchange for [[legal immunity|immunity]].\n\nAs Earle delivers a eulogy for Phelps, Elsa leaves his funeral in disgust. Herschel Biggs, Phelps's Arson partner, tells Kelso that while Kelso and Phelps were never friends, they were not enemies either. In a closing [[Post-credits scene|epilogue]] flashback, Kelso is revealed to have known about the stolen morphine but refused to be involved in its distribution, knowing the trouble it would cause.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Development of L.A.

Each of the game's cases features at least a few of the real-life elements that were reported in newspaper articles of that time, with one example of a case that developers found inspiration for being the \"''Red Lipstick Murder''\". The case, part of the game's Homicide Desk, is based upon the facts and elements that were mentioned in articles about the real-life, unsolved murder of Jeanne French, a woman who was found dead in exactly the same conditions as the victim of the in-game case is found in, including the M.O. used on the victim, the state the body was left in, the lipstick message found on the body, and the initial suspect being the victim's husband, yet the in-game case differs from this in that it is closed by the main protagonist and not becoming a cold case towards the end of its investigation.<ref name=\"RealLife_Crime\"/>\n\n[[File:LA Noire logo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The original (top) and the final (bottom) logo for the game.

McNamara felt that people were responding to the realism in the faces and it made the bodies look lifeless by comparison because of the lack of animation on characters' clothing. In the same interview McNamara also noted that Phelps responds aggressively to certain prompts because the game was originally written as \"coax, force, and lie\".

Noire''''' is a [[neo-noir]] [[Detective fiction|detective]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Team Bondi]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It was released in May 2011 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], in November 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in November 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. The story is set in [[Los Angeles]] in 1947 and follows a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) officer, who solves a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects; the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe open-world design lets players freely roam Los Angeles's open landscape, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The story is centred on the case sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. It is played through a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. ''L.A. Noire'' also contains elements found in [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] games, such as side missions and a branching storyline. The game uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio, and features an original score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/13771/rockstar-recommends-chinatown.html |title=Rockstar Recommends: \"Chinatown\" |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Development of L.A.

The game was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio was met with public complaints from staff members, and Team Bondi closed shortly after the game's initial release. The development team found influence from the plot and aesthetic elements of [[film noir]]\u2014stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity\u2014along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes of the time for its in-game cases.<ref name=\"RealLife_Crime\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/14351/the-red-lipstick-murder-real-crime-stories-of-1947-los-angeles-t.html |title=Real Life \"Red Lipstick Murder\" of 1947 |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe game is notable for being the first to use the newly developed MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis.

Each desk gives the player a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns the player with cases that they must solve. After each case, the player receives a rating of 1\u20135 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, the player can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps's war memories. Near the end of the final desk, the player assumes control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the [[player character]] for most of the rest of the game; although different in appearance and personality, his controls are identical to Phelps.\n\n[[File:LA Noire interrogation.jpg|left|thumb|250px|When interrogating witnesses and suspects, the player has the option to believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying.]]\nThe game blends investigative elements with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights.<ref name=\"Gamespot-Review\"/> The player character uses [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks and firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the world.

Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, the player has the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. The player can also ask the partner for directions.

Noire characters}}\nFollowing the end of [[World War II]], Cole Phelps ([[Aaron Staton]]), a decorated [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]], returns to Los Angeles, California, to live with his family while taking on work as a patrol officer of the [[LAPD]]. After successfully solving a major murder case in 1947 and being promoted to [[detective]], Phelps earns a reputation over the next six months for solving difficult cases for both the [[Moving violation|Traffic]] and [[Homicide#Criminal_homicide|Homicide]] divisions; he most notably concludes the [[Black Dahlia]] case.\n\nUpon being promoted into the [[Vice#Vice_squad|Vice]] division, he becomes involved in the investigation into [[military surplus]] [[morphine]] [[syrette]]s being sold on the street, stolen from the ship that had brought home his former Marine unit. He eventually learns that several members of his former unit had stolen and distributed the morphine, only for them to be assassinated on the orders of [[Mickey Cohen]] ([[Patrick Fischler]]), who controlled the Los Angeles drug trade and resented the competition. During this time, Phelps falls for German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann ([[Erika Heynatz]]) and soon has an affair with her.\n\nRoy Earle ([[Adam J. Harrington]]), his partner in Vice and a [[Police corruption|corrupt cop]], helps several prominent figures in the city draw attention away from [[a major scandal|Brenda Allen]] by exposing Phelps's adultery before he can further question Courtney Sheldon, a member of Phelps's former unit, over his involvement with the stolen morphine. In exchange, Earle is given a place in a syndicate known as the Suburban Redevelopment Fund (SRF)\u2014a program founded under the pretense of providing affordable housing for returning World War II [[veteran]]s, financially supported by the same people. Phelps's marriage ends, he becomes disgraced in the LAPD, and he is demoted to the [[Arson]] desk, where he is tasked with investigating a number of suspicious house fires. Despite noting a strong connection between them and a housing development that the SRF operates, Phelps is warned off by Earle from pursuing the syndicate and its founder, tycoon developer Leland Monroe ([[John Noble]]). Seeking help to investigate the development, Phelps prompts an old comrade, Jack Kelso ([[Gil McKinney]]), now an investigator for the California Fire & Life Insurance Company, to look into the matter.\n\nKelso quickly discovers that the development is using unsuitable building materials and that his boss Curtis Benson, a member of the SRF, is insuring them despite this fact. Following this discovery, Kelso is kidnapped by hitmen hired by Monroe. Following his escape and subsequent hospitalization, Kelso agrees to become an investigator for Leonard Petersen ([[Larry Sullivan]]) \u2013 assistant to the [[district attorney]] \u2013 and informs him of the SRF's misdemeanors, with the idea that exposing the fund would aid Petersens' campaign to become the new district attorney. Following a shootout at Monroe's mansion, Kelso learns that the syndicate used a patient of prominent [[psychiatrist]] Harlan Fontaine, a member of the SRF, to burn down the homes of those who would not agree to sell their property to the fund; eventually, his patient accidentally killed four people in one such fire and became irreversibly traumatised. Confronting Fontaine at his [[clinic]], the patient murders Fontaine and kidnaps Elsa. \n\nInvestigating Fontaine's clinic, Phelps discovers that the syndicate was merely a front to defraud the US Federal Government \u2014 Monroe would acquire land with money invested by the syndicate and build surreptitiously cheap houses on them to increase their value, knowing the government would later purchase the plots through [[eminent domain]] to make space for a new freeway. Phelps also discovers that Sheldon had provided Fontaine with the stolen morphine, under the pretense that Fontaine would legally provide the morphine to medical facilities with the profits being reinvested into the SRF; Sheldon is later murdered by Fontaine after gaining knowledge of Kelso's investigation into the SRF.\n\nFollowing an investigation into the patient responsible for the fires, Kelso realises that Fontaine's patient was Ira Hogeboom, a former [[flamethrower]] operator from his and Phelps' unit who became [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|severely traumatised]] after unintentionally burning out a cave of civilians on Phelps's orders. Phelps and Kelso pursue Hogeboom and Elsa into the [[Los Angeles River]] Tunnels as intense rainfall begins. The pair rescue Elsa, and Kelso executes the obviously incapacitated Hogeboom to [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|end his suffering]]. As the water rises within the tunnels following the intense rainfall, the group attempt to escape; Phelps is unable to reach the exit, and drowns. Petersen later makes a deal with several members of the SRF to testify against Monroe and Benson in exchange for [[legal immunity|immunity]].\n\nAs Earle delivers a eulogy for Phelps, Elsa leaves his funeral in disgust. Herschel Biggs, Phelps's Arson partner, tells Kelso that while Kelso and Phelps were never friends, they were not enemies either. In a closing [[Post-credits scene|epilogue]] flashback, Kelso is revealed to have known about the stolen morphine but refused to be involved in its distribution, knowing the trouble it would cause.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Development of L.A.

MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face.

Each of the game's cases features at least a few of the real-life elements that were reported in newspaper articles of that time, with one example of a case that developers found inspiration for being the \"''Red Lipstick Murder''\". The case, part of the game's Homicide Desk, is based upon the facts and elements that were mentioned in articles about the real-life, unsolved murder of Jeanne French, a woman who was found dead in exactly the same conditions as the victim of the in-game case is found in, including the M.O. used on the victim, the state the body was left in, the lipstick message found on the body, and the initial suspect being the victim's husband, yet the in-game case differs from this in that it is closed by the main protagonist and not becoming a cold case towards the end of its investigation.<ref name=\"RealLife_Crime\"/>\n\n[[File:LA Noire logo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The original (top) and the final (bottom) logo for the game.

Noire'' a perfect score, praising its similarity to film.<ref name=\"GuardianReview\"/> GameZone also compared the game to [[Classical Hollywood cinema|older movies]] and felt that its attention to detail set it apart from other games.<ref name=\"GameZoneReview\"/> ''[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]]'' compared ''L.A. Noire'' to an [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series that slowly builds and gets viewers hooked.<ref name=\"PTOM\"/>\n\n''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' praised the facial technology, and pointed out that while there are no other major aspects of the game that had not been done better elsewhere, the fact that Team Bondi had brought together such a wide range of game genres in such a stylish, atmospheric, and cohesive manner was an achievement that few developers had managed.<ref name=\"EdgeReview\"/> [[GameSpot]]'s Carolyn Petit praised the game's investigation system and overall style,<ref name=\"Gamespot-Review\"/> while ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' concluded that ''L.A.

Noire'' resembled ''[[Heavy Rain]]'', albeit a poorer version. They did feel that the game \"almost succeeds\" at creating a new structure for video games.<ref name=\"IGN-Review\"/> ''[[Joystiq]]'' stated that \"''L.A.

McNamara felt that people were responding to the realism in the faces and it made the bodies look lifeless by comparison because of the lack of animation on characters' clothing. In the same interview McNamara also noted that Phelps responds aggressively to certain prompts because the game was originally written as \"coax, force, and lie\". When the game came out, it was changed to \"truth, doubt, or lie\" which made Phelps commonly take awkward stances from what the player expected.<ref name=\"EG2011_11_09\"/>\n\nAt the 2012 BAFTA Video Game Awards, ''L.A.
