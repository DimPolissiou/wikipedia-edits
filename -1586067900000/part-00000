Shokoufeh Provided the opportunity for women and girls to be trained and informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]] for both women and men. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhtaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanayeh Mazineyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by women. She translated several French books into [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate the girls, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying the student registration fee, this was done with one out of every two student and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) which were taught, and the condition of admission and degree was a test and test success that was held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (Carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nIn a time where reading and writing was uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools.

This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper could be mentioned in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, was originally written in four pages with the Traditional version writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also on the final page of each issue it was decorated with a [[caricature]], tailored to the subject of the page that the issue was about.  Of course, from the third year and onwards, the caricatures were not included, since the publication lost its pattern at the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nHemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at the same time, the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. Therefore, it came to a result that nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting with old traditions especially among women was one of the actions of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to convey the voice of suppression and reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning the women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and raised the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially the situation of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [[Fundamentalism|fundamental]] way of women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Maryam Amid Semnani''' ({{lang-fa|\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0639\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}), was an intellectual and a journalist during the [[Qajar era]]. \nIn 1913, she published the second Iranian women's magazine named the ''Shokoufeh Newspaper''. \n\n== Biography ==\nMaryam Amid was the only daughter of Mir Seyed Razi Semnani, the first representative of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] in the [[National Assembly]].

afterwards, Divac focused on three fields: humanitarian work, sport management, and investment.\n\n===KK Partizan president===\nIn late 2000, following the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] whose policies Divac had been openly critical of throughout mid-to-late 1990s,<ref name=\"si-may1999-Rick Reilly\">{{cite

}}</ref> Divac and former teammate [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107]] took over their former club [[KK Partizan]]. They did so on initiative by [[Ivica Da\u010di\u0107]], the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, was forced to leave his post at the club. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from r\u00e9gime change, Da\u010di\u0107 saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Divac became the club's president while Danilovi\u0107 took the vice-president role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/61059/Divac-savetuje-Dacica |title=Divac savetuje Da\u010di\u0107a |work=[[Blic]] |date=October 16, 2008 |author=\u017d. Jevti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nFreshly retired from playing, Danilovi\u0107 was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The head coach they inherited, [[Darko Russo]], finished out the 2000\u201301 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor [[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]] to be the new head coach.\n\nThough the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian parliament]]. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilovi\u0107 appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.\n\n===LA Lakers scout===\nIn October 2005, right after ending his playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac got hired as the Lakers' European scout, reporting directly to the team's general manager [[Mitch Kupchak]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2196445|title=Divac to serve as scout, liaison in Europe|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=October 19, 2005|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref> He left the position in 2006.\n\n===Real Madrid Baloncesto club management===\nIn June 2006, through his friendship with [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], Divac linked up with [[Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n]] as part of the lawyer's candidate bid for the presidency of [[Real Madrid]] [[polideportivo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/06/05/actualidad/1149492115_850215.html|title=Calder\u00f3n presenta su proyecto para el Real Madrid con Mijatovic como director deportivo|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref> When Calder\u00f3n closely won the club elections on July 2, 2006, Divac was announced as the head of operations at [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] basketball club though the scope of his job description soon got reduced to consulting duties as president Calder\u00f3n's adviser for basketball and club's international coordinator.<ref name=\"elmundo\">{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2008/04/02/baloncesto/1207128247.html|title=El incre\u00edble caso de Vlade Divac|agency=''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/09/22/actualidad/1158909714_850215.html|title=Divac llega al Real Madrid como \"asesor\" y con el \"gran reto de traer la NBA a Europa\"|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Divac's role in the club's day-to-day operations turned out to be largely symbolic, and he even admitted as much in a March 2007 interview for Croatian weekly ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'': \"I literally do nothing and I only serve as part of the ''royal club'''s image.

Divac's company \"Apurna\", in a joint venture with French dairy giant [[Danone]], ostensibly proposed the best bid, but the takeover was aborted by the Serbia's Securities Commission, because Danone/Apurna allegedly offered extra money to small shareholders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?id=56547&n=wh49&c=%23emailcode |title=Knjaz Milos auction descends into chaos |publisher=CEE-foodindustry.com |date=December 3, 2004 |accessdate=September 25, 2007 |author=Chris Mercer}}</ref>\nIn the repeated bid, Divac and Danone eventually withdrew and the sale went to [[FPP Balkan Ltd.]], a privatization fund from the [[Cayman Islands]].

However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted what should have been a mere technical move.  While the attempted takeover was a \"backdoor\" one indeed, it was legal and similar cases had already occurred. The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily.

However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]]. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a [[double dribble]], the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer. In the overtime, the Soviets easily prevailed against the shocked Yugoslavs, who had to be content with the bronze.<ref name=\"vreme\" />\n\nThe next year, Divac participated in the team that took the gold at the [[1987 FIBA Under-19 World Cup|1987 FIBA Junior World Championship]] (which was later split into separate [[FIBA Under-19 World Championship|under-19]] and [[FIBA Under-21 World Championship|under-21]] events) in [[Bormio]], Italy.

One of them was holding a [[Croatia]]n flag, one of the six republics that made up Yugoslavia. Divac claims that he told the man that he should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia. Divac claims the man made a derogatory remark about the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war. The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians. Divac has stated that he did not mean it as an act against Croatia and he would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.<ref name=once>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/once-brothers,46215/| title=Once Brothers |publisher=A.

Divac became the club's president while Danilovi\u0107 took the vice-president role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/61059/Divac-savetuje-Dacica |title=Divac savetuje Da\u010di\u0107a |work=[[Blic]] |date=October 16, 2008 |author=\u017d. Jevti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nFreshly retired from playing, Danilovi\u0107 was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The head coach they inherited, [[Darko Russo]], finished out the 2000\u201301 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor [[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]] to be the new head coach.\n\nThough the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian parliament]]. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilovi\u0107 appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.\n\n===LA Lakers scout===\nIn October 2005, right after ending his playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac got hired as the Lakers' European scout, reporting directly to the team's general manager [[Mitch Kupchak]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2196445|title=Divac to serve as scout, liaison in Europe|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=October 19, 2005|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref> He left the position in 2006.\n\n===Real Madrid Baloncesto club management===\nIn June 2006, through his friendship with [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], Divac linked up with [[Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n]] as part of the lawyer's candidate bid for the presidency of [[Real Madrid]] [[polideportivo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/06/05/actualidad/1149492115_850215.html|title=Calder\u00f3n presenta su proyecto para el Real Madrid con Mijatovic como director deportivo|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref> When Calder\u00f3n closely won the club elections on July 2, 2006, Divac was announced as the head of operations at [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] basketball club though the scope of his job description soon got reduced to consulting duties as president Calder\u00f3n's adviser for basketball and club's international coordinator.<ref name=\"elmundo\">{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2008/04/02/baloncesto/1207128247.html|title=El incre\u00edble caso de Vlade Divac|agency=''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/09/22/actualidad/1158909714_850215.html|title=Divac llega al Real Madrid como \"asesor\" y con el \"gran reto de traer la NBA a Europa\"|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Divac's role in the club's day-to-day operations turned out to be largely symbolic, and he even admitted as much in a March 2007 interview for Croatian weekly ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'': \"I literally do nothing and I only serve as part of the ''royal club'''s image.
