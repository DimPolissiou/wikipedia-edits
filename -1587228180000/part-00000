She departed for a training cruise to drill new navy officers. <ref name=cunat33 />  From that time till the beginning of the [[War of American Independence]] he commanded vessels in the squadron of evolution which the French government had established for the purpose of training its officers. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n\n=== War of American independence ===\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance|Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Naval battles of the American Revolutionary War}}\nTensions mounted between France and England in early 1778 in the context of the [[American Revolutionary War]], with the [[Action of 17 June 1778]] constituting a step up announcing the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]]. Suffren was appointed to a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[French ship Fantasque (1758)|''Fantasque'']] and the frigates [[French frigate Aimable (1776)|''Aimable'']], [[French frigate Chim\u00e8re (1758)|''Chim\u00e8re'']] and [[French frigate Engageante (1766)|''Engageante'']].<ref name=cunat37>Cunat, p.37</ref> The mission of the force was to support Franco-American efforts in the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] by striking a 5-frigate British squadron anchored in [[Narragansett Bay]], off [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]],<ref name=hennequin291 /> comprising [[HMS Juno (1757)|HMS ''Juno'']], [[French ship Vestale (1756)|''Flora'']], [[HMS Lark (1762)|''Lark'']], [[HMS Orpheus (1773)|''Orpheus'']] and [[HMS Cerberus (1758)|''Cerebus'']].

He led the line in the [[Battle of Grenada|action]] with [[John Byron|Admiral John Byron]] off [[Grenada]], and his ship, ''Fantasque'' (64), lost 62 men. His letters to his admiral show that he strongly disapproved of D'Estaing's half-hearted methods.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1780, he was captain of {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} (74), in the combined French and Spanish fleets which [[Action of 9 August 1780|captured a great English]] convoy in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. His candour towards his chief, [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], had done him no harm in the opinion of D'Estaing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt is said to have been largely by the advice of this admiral that Suffren was chosen to command a squadron of five ships of the line sent out to help the Dutch who had joined France and Spain to defend the Cape against an expected English attack, and then to go on to the East Indies. He sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on March 22. On April 16, 1781 he found the English expedition on its way to the Cape under the command of Commodore, commonly called Governor, [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]] (1730\u20131787), at anchor in [[Porto Praya]], [[Cape Verde Islands]]. Remembering how little respect Boscawen had shown for the neutrality of [[Portugal]] at [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Lagos]], he attacked at once, in the [[Battle of Porto Praya]]. No serious losses were sustained by either side. Suffren pushed on to the Cape, which he saved from capture by Johnstone, and then made his way to the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]), then held by the French. M. D'Orves, his superior officer, died as the united squadrons, now eleven sail of the line, were on their way to the Bay of Bengal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Campaign against Sir Edward Hughes===\n{{Main|Franco-Indian alliances}}\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

His letters to his admiral show that he strongly disapproved of D'Estaing's half-hearted methods.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1780, he was captain of {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} (74), in the combined French and Spanish fleets which [[Action of 9 August 1780|captured a great English]] convoy in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. His candour towards his chief, [[Luis de C\u00f3rdova y C\u00f3rdova]], had done him no harm in the opinion of D'Estaing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIt is said to have been largely by the advice of this admiral that Suffren was chosen to command a squadron of five ships of the line sent out to help the Dutch who had joined France and Spain to defend the Cape against an expected English attack, and then to go on to the East Indies. He sailed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] on March 22. On April 16, 1781 he found the English expedition on its way to the Cape under the command of Commodore, commonly called Governor, [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]] (1730\u20131787), at anchor in [[Porto Praya]], [[Cape Verde Islands]]. Remembering how little respect Boscawen had shown for the neutrality of [[Portugal]] at [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Lagos]], he attacked at once, in the [[Battle of Porto Praya]]. No serious losses were sustained by either side. Suffren pushed on to the Cape, which he saved from capture by Johnstone, and then made his way to the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]), then held by the French. M. D'Orves, his superior officer, died as the united squadrons, now eleven sail of the line, were on their way to the Bay of Bengal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Campaign against Sir Edward Hughes===\n{{Main|Franco-Indian alliances}}\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.
