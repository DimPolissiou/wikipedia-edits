Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican [[Randy Neugebauer]]. A few months later, the [[Texas Legislature]] [[2003 Texas redistricting|redrew the state's districts]] in an effort engineered by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in part because [[Texas House]] Speaker [[Tom Craddick]] was from that area. This district is heavily Republican&nbsp;\u2013 by some accounts, the most Republican district in Texas.  Republican candidates usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area ([[Glasscock County]] had voted 93 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition.\n\nConaway has been reelected six times with no substantive opposition. He has faced a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2018. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced no major-party opposition in 2008 and 2014.\n\nConaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 53,107 votes (74 percent); his challenger, Wade Brown, received 18,979 votes (26 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176 |title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014 |publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 6, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140305180619/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176 |archivedate=March 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nConaway won re-election in the general election held on November 4, 2014.

Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican [[Randy Neugebauer]]. A few months later, the [[Texas Legislature]] [[2003 Texas redistricting|redrew the state's districts]] in an effort engineered by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in part because [[Texas House]] Speaker [[Tom Craddick]] was from that area. This district is heavily Republican&nbsp;\u2013 by some accounts, the most Republican district in Texas.  Republican candidates usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area ([[Glasscock County]] had voted 93 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition.\n\nConaway has been reelected six times with no substantive opposition. He has faced a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2018. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced no major-party opposition in 2008 and 2014.\n\nConaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 53,107 votes (74 percent); his challenger, Wade Brown, received 18,979 votes (26 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176 |title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014 |publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 6, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140305180619/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176 |archivedate=March 5, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nConaway won re-election in the general election held on November 4, 2014.

In a series of small studies in [[Europe]] it had been shown that [[Rifampicin]], a drug used to treat [[tuberculosis]], could limit the effectiveness of [[Efavirenz]], a drug used to treat [[HIV]]. The drugs interact through a liver enzyme ([[cytochrome P450]]), which is produced at elevated levels in patients who take [[Rifampicin]], but breaks down the [[Efavirenz|Efavirenz.]] To overcome this, the 2012 [[Food and Drug Administration]] recommendations proposed larger doses of [[Efavirenz]]. Luetkemeyer argued that the recommendations were not appropriate for all populations in the [[United States]]; and in particular, may result in more drug toxicity.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/07/12389/ucsf-sfgh-researchers-call-change-new-fda-recommendation-hiv-and-tb-drug-doses|title=UCSF/SFGH Researchers Call for Change in New FDA Recommendation on HIV and TB Drug Doses|website=UCSF/SFGH Researchers Call for Change in New FDA Recommendation on HIV and TB Drug Doses {{!}} UC San Francisco|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> She showed that increasing the dosage of [[Efavirenz]] may result in most side effects \u2013 as well as coming at a greater cost.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Luetkemeyer led investigations into potential therapies for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|coronavirus disease]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-hospitalist.org/hospitalist/article/219602/coronavirus-updates/treatment-options-covid-19-dr-annie-luetkemeyer|title=Treatment options for COVID-19: Dr. Annie Luetkemeyer|website=www.the-hospitalist.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/trials-drugs-prevent-coronavirus-infection-begin-health-care-workers|title=Trials of drugs to prevent coronavirus infection begin in health care workers|last=KupferschmidtApr. 7|first=Kai|last2=2020|date=2020-04-07|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15|last3=Pm|first3=3:50}}</ref> In particular, Luetkemeyer has called for more [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled trials]] to assess the impact of [[hydroxychloroquine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/science-and-technology/2020/03/what-scientists-do-and-dont-know-about-treating-coronavirus|title=What scientists do and don't know about treating coronavirus|last=@NatGeoUK|date=2020-03-25|website=National Geographic|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> She called for older people with pre-existing conditions to be more careful during the outbreak, as the virus \"taxes all organ systems\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hafner|first=Katie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-elderly-protection.html|title=How to Protect Older People From the Coronavirus|date=2020-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n=== Selected publications ===\nHer publications include:\n\n* Comparison of an interferon-\u03b3 release assay with tuberculin skin testing in HIV-infected individuals ([[doi:10.1164/rccm.200608-1088OC|DOI: 10.1164/rccm.200608-1088OC]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luetkemeyer|first=Annie F.|last2=Charlebois|first2=Edwin D.|last3=Flores|first3=Laura L.|last4=Bangsberg|first4=David R.|last5=Deeks|first5=Steven G.|last6=Martin|first6=Jeffrey N.|last7=Havlir|first7=Diane V.|date=2007-04-01|title=Comparison of an Interferon-\u03b3 Release Assay with Tuberculin Skin Testing in HIV-infected Individuals|url=https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200608-1088OC|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|volume=175|issue=7|pages=737\u2013742|doi=10.1164/rccm.200608-1088OC|issn=1073-449X|pmc=PMC1899289|pmid=17218620}}</ref>\n* Clinical presentation and course of acute hepatitis C infection in HIV-infected patients ([http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.qai.0000191281.77954.27 DOI: 10.1097/01.qai.0000191281.77954.27])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luetkemeyer|first=Annie|last2=Hare|first2=C.
