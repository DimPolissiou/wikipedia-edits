{"title_page": "Food rescue", "text_new": "[[File:Food Waste.jpg|thumb|Food rescued from being thrown away]]\n'''Food rescue''', also called '''food recovery''' or '''food salvage''', is the practice of [[gleaning]] edible food that would otherwise go to waste from places such as restaurants, grocery stores, produce markets, or dining facilities and distributing it to local emergency food programs.\n\nThe recovered food is edible, but often not sellable. Products that are at or past their \"[[sell by]]\" dates or are imperfect in any way such as a bruised apple or day-old bread are donated by grocery stores, food vendors, restaurants, and [[farmers market]]s. Other times, the food is unblemished, but restaurants may have made or ordered too much or may have good pieces of food (such as scraps of fish or meat) that are byproducts of the process of preparing foods to cook and serve. Also, food manufacturers may donate products that marginally fail quality control, or that have become short-dated.\n\nOrganizations that encourage food recovery, food rescue, sharing, [[gleaning]] and similar waste-avoidance schemes come under the umbrella of [[food bank]]s, food pantries or [[soup kitchens]].\n\n== Details ==\nIn most cases, the rescued food is being saved from being thrown into a [[dumpster]] and, ultimately, [[landfill]]s or other garbage disposals. Food recovered on farms is kept from being plowed under. On farms, the donations often must be harvested, or gleaned, by volunteers.  Also, to help rescue food that would otherwise be wasted, the USDA has expanded their [[Farm Storage Facility Loan Program]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/price-support/facility-loans/farm-storage/|title=Farm Storage Facility Loan Program|website=USDA|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref> The [[Farm Storage Facility Loan Program]] helps farmers obtain low-cost loans for more farm storage so they can protect more food from becoming waste.\n\nIn the [[United States]], businesses that source food rescue programs have received tax benefits for their donations and have been protected from liability lawsuits by the federal [[Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act]] since 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ210/pdf/PLAW-104publ210.pdf|title=Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe benefit of many food rescue programs is they offer healthy food to those in need but who may not meet the application requirements of state food-assistance programs. Many programs also provide immediate emergency assistance, without having to wait through an application process. Food rescue organizations are less restricted by cost and availability of food, as so much edible food is thrown out and free for the taking, so eligibility requirements are generally unnecessary. This organizational model often allows food rescues to provide nutritional assistance more quickly, with more flexibility and accessibility than other types of hunger relief programs.\n\nAt the individual level, food recovery is practiced by both [[freegan]]s and by [[dumpster diving|dumpster divers]].\n\n== Food reuse strategies==\nThere are various ways how people and organizations can rescue food that would otherwise go to a landfill. For example, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] recommends the following actions <ref>https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/food-recovery-hierarchy</ref>\n\n=== Source reduction ===\nReduce the amount of food that is generated and potentially wasted. Individuals can for example make shopping lists so they don't buy more food than they really need. [https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/how-prevent-wasted-food-through-source-reduction]\n\n=== Human consumption ===\nOrganizations can [[donate]] both [[non-perishable food|non-perishable]] and unspoiled [[perishable food]] at the end of its shelf life, e. g. to [[food bank]]s, [[food pantries]], food rescue programs, [[homeless shelters]], and other organizations. [https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reduce-wasted-food-feeding-hungry-people]  [https://www.epa.gov/recycle/donating-food]\n\n[[File:Food rescued from going to the garbage.jpg|thumb|Food with no expiration dates but just past the 'best by' date by a couple months rescued from going to landfill and distributed to people who needed and wanted it]]\n\n=== Feeding animals ===\nMany animals can eat food scraps. Some farmers, [[solid waste]] collectors and [[recycling center]]s collect discarded food. [https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reduce-wasted-food-feeding-animals]\n\n[[File:Chickens eating food that would otherwise end up in the garbage.jpg|thumb|Chickens eating food that would otherwise end up in the garbage]]\n\n=== Industrial uses ===\n\n[[Anaerobic Digestion]] is a conversion process that converts food waste into [[renewable energy]].  Food is separated from any packaging and broken down into a more digestible state and then it is mixed with [[bacteria]] in special oxygen free holding tanks. The [[bacteria]] work to break down the [[food waste]] converting it into [[methane]] [[biogas]] which can be used to generate [[electricity]].\n\n[[Hydrothermal Liquefaction]] is the process of heating food waste under [[high pressure]], converting the food waste into an oil that can then be refined into fuel. Once the initial liquefaction is complete, the watery waste left over then goes through [[anaerobic digestion]] where the [[microbes]] break down the waste into [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] [[biogas]]. This biogas can be used for heat and electricity.\n\nIt is also possible to use fats, oils, grease, and meat products for [[Rendering (animal products)|rendering]] and [[biodiesel]] production.  [https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/industrial-uses-wasted-food]\n\n=== Composting ===\nAdd remaining food waste to an existing compost. [[Composting]] has many benefits over general waste landfills, including reduced [[methane gas]] production and improving the quality of the [[soil]]. [https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reducing-impact-wasted-food-feeding-soil-and-composting]\n\n== Countries ==\n\n===Australia===\nIn Australia, [[OzHarvest]] was launched in November 2004.\n\n===Canada===\nCanada's [[Second Harvest]] Toronto, in operation since 1985.

The largest donors are supermarkets (59%), followed by bakeries and other food producers.  The distributors are mainly charitable organizations, mostly with a religious connection, like the Salvation Army and the Church City Mission.  Most of the work is done by volunteers, without any salary.  The receivers are mainly narcotic and alcohol addicts, but also include homeless, immigrants and victims of domestic violence.  Most of the food is given away as prepared meals.  More than one million meals are provided per year in the cities covered by the study. Other food is given away as bags of groceries.\n\nDistribution of free food is often used as a method for charitable organizations to enter into contact with people who need help with drug abuse, psychological problems or similar.  Volunteers often emphasize the importance of having spaces where users can pick up food with dignity and discretion, plus sometimes have a cup of coffee or a shower.  Often, volunteers provide emotional support or help people with things unrelated to food acquisition, such as sharing work tips or helping immigrants with administrative tasks requiring knowledge of the Norwegian language.\n\nThe charities sometimes cooperate with each other by having a common food bank.  This makes it easier to maintain steady supplies of diversified food to users.\n\nSome users report that receiving free food may lead to stigmatization and thereby feelings of inferiority or social exclusion.  To counter this, charities sometimes charge a low, symbolic price for the food, or offer food in exchange for participating in the work of preparing it.\n\n===Singapore===\nIn [[Singapore]] the [[Foodbank Singapore]] is running their own Food rescue project, by collecting food excess in various places around the Islandstate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food rescue project details|url=http://www.foodbank.sg/index.php/programmes-events/programmes/food-rescue-project|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nSome organizations, such as [[Fareshare]] in [[England]], work directly with food manufacturers to minimize food wastage.

The banquet served by Ovid's Achelous offered a prototype for Italian midday feasts in the fountain-cooled shade of garden grottoes.\n\nAt the mouth of the Achelous River lie the [[Echinades]] Islands. According to Ovid's pretty myth-making in the same ''Metamorphoses'' episode, the Echinades Islands were once five nymphs. Unfortunately for them, they forgot to honor Achelous in their festivities, and the god was so angry about this slight that he turned them into the islands.\n\nIn Hellenistic and Roman contexts, the river god was often reduced to a mask and used decoratively as an emblem of water, \"his uncut hair wreathed with reeds\".<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' ix.</ref> The feature survived in Romanesque carved details and flowered during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the Classical prototypes of the [[Green Man]].\n\n==Achelous and the River Achelous==\nHomer claims that the Achelous River was located in Lydia, near Mount Sipylos.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iliad|last=Homer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=24.616|quote=|via=}}</ref> There were at least six different rivers with the name Achelous in ancient times,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Potamikon: Sinews of Acheloios|author=Molinari and Sisci|publisher=|year=2016|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}</ref> all of which indicate that Achelous was originally not a single river, but a god of all water.\n\nThe origin of the river Achelous is described by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]:\n<blockquote>When Achelous on one occasion had lost his daughters, the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, and in his grief invoked his mother Gaea, she received him to her bosom, and on the spot where she received him, she caused the river bearing his name to gush forth.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], ''ad Virg.

It resembled a bull's voice in the noise of the water; its windings and its reaches gave rise to the story about his forming himself into a serpent and about his horns; the formation of islands at the mouth of the river requires no explanation.  His conquest by Heracles lastly refers to the embankments by which Heracles confined the river to its bed and thus gained large tracts of land for cultivation, which are expressed by the horn of plenty.<ref>[[Strabo]], x. p. 458.</ref><ref>Compare Voss, ''Mythologische Briefe'', lxxii.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Andrews, Tamra.

The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells.\"<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VIII, 547ff.</ref>  In sixteenth-century Italy, an aspect of the revival of Antiquity was the desire to recreate Classical spaces as extensions of the revived [[villa]].  Ovid's description of the cave of Achelous provided some specific inspiration to patrons in France as well as Italy for the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] garden [[grotto]], with its cool dampness, [[tuff]] vaulting and shellwork walls. The banquet served by Ovid's Achelous offered a prototype for Italian midday feasts in the fountain-cooled shade of garden grottoes.\n\nAt the mouth of the Achelous River lie the [[Echinades]] Islands. According to Ovid's pretty myth-making in the same ''Metamorphoses'' episode, the Echinades Islands were once five nymphs. Unfortunately for them, they forgot to honor Achelous in their festivities, and the god was so angry about this slight that he turned them into the islands.\n\nIn Hellenistic and Roman contexts, the river god was often reduced to a mask and used decoratively as an emblem of water, \"his uncut hair wreathed with reeds\".<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' ix.</ref> The feature survived in Romanesque carved details and flowered during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the Classical prototypes of the [[Green Man]].\n\n==Achelous and the River Achelous==\nHomer claims that the Achelous River was located in Lydia, near Mount Sipylos.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iliad|last=Homer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=24.616|quote=|via=}}</ref> There were at least six different rivers with the name Achelous in ancient times,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Potamikon: Sinews of Acheloios|author=Molinari and Sisci|publisher=|year=2016|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}</ref> all of which indicate that Achelous was originally not a single river, but a god of all water.\n\nThe origin of the river Achelous is described by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]:\n<blockquote>When Achelous on one occasion had lost his daughters, the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, and in his grief invoked his mother Gaea, she received him to her bosom, and on the spot where she received him, she caused the river bearing his name to gush forth.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], ''ad Virg. Georg.'' i. 9; ''Aen.'' viii. 300.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOther accounts about the origin of the river and its name are given by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], [[Strabo]],<ref>[[Strabo]], x. p. 450.</ref> and [[Plutarch]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''De Flum.'' 22.</ref> [[Strabo]] proposes a very ingenious interpretation of the legends about Achelous, all of which according to him arose from the nature of the river itself.  It resembled a bull's voice in the noise of the water; its windings and its reaches gave rise to the story about his forming himself into a serpent and about his horns; the formation of islands at the mouth of the river requires no explanation.  His conquest by Heracles lastly refers to the embankments by which Heracles confined the river to its bed and thus gained large tracts of land for cultivation, which are expressed by the horn of plenty.<ref>[[Strabo]], x. p. 458.</ref><ref>Compare Voss, ''Mythologische Briefe'', lxxii.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Andrews, Tamra.

Ripert moved to New York in 1991, working briefly as David Bouley's sous-chef before [[Maguy_Le_Coze|Maguy]] and [[Gilbert Le Coze]] recruited him as chef for Le Bernardin. In 1994, Ripert became Le Bernardin's executive chef after Gilbert Le Coze died unexpectedly of a heart attack. The following year, at the age of 29, Ripert earned a four-star rating from the ''[[New York Times]]'', and in 1996 he became a part-owner. In the ''[[Michelin Guide]]'' NYC 2006, Ripert's Le Bernardin was one of four New York City restaurants to be awarded the maximum three Michelin stars for excellence in cuisine. Le Bernardin received four stars from the ''New York Times'' four consecutive times, making it the only restaurant to maintain that exquisite status for that length of time and never dropping a star in ten years. Le Bernardin is often referred to as the Temple of Seafood.\n\nRipert is the Vice Chairman of the board of [[City Harvest (United States)|City Harvest]], working to bring together New York's top chefs and restaurateurs to raise funds and increase the quality and quantity of food donations to New York's neediest. In addition, Ripert partnered with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company to open Blue in Grand Cayman.\n\n==Media career==\nRipert has made several guest appearances on cooking-based television shows, including guest judge and assistant chef roles on the second, third, fourth and fifth seasons of [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] TV's \"Top Chef\". Chef Ripert had been considered to join season 8 of Top Chef as a permanent judge, but bowed out when his employee Jen Caroll was selected as a contestant again. Ripert was good friends with [[Anthony Bourdain]] and appeared in many episodes of ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]]'' and ''[[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown]]''. In September 2009, AVEC ERIC, Ripert's first TV show, debuted on PBS stations and ran for two successful seasons, earning two [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s: [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Culinary Program|Outstanding Culinary Program]] (2011) and Outstanding Achievement in Main Title and Graphic Design (2010). AVEC ERIC returned for a third season on the Cooking Channel in February 2015, and is now available through iTunes and Netflix. Ripert has launched a series of brief online cooking videos called \"Get Toasted\" on his website AVECERIC.com which focuses on easy and quick meals that can be prepared and cooked in minutes with a toaster oven. In the series he uses a somewhat high end brick-oven based toaster oven produced by Cuisinart.\n\nRipert was a featured chef on [[Great Chefs]] television.<ref>[http://www.greatchefs.com/ripert-eric/www.greatchefs.com Great Chefs Television] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, he played himself in the television show ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'' on [[HBO]] (season 1 episode 5), alongside [[David Chang]], [[Wylie Dufresne]] and [[Tom Colicchio]]. He returned in his cameo role in Season 2, in multiple episodes.\n\n== Books ==\nIn fall 2008, Ripert published ''On the Line'', his second cookbook with Artisan, which in 2002 published ''A Return to Cooking'', a collaboration between Ripert, photographers Shimon and Tammar Rothstein, artist Valentino Cortazar, and writer Michael Ruhlman that was selected by ''Newsweek'' as one of its best books of the season.  Ripert's first cookbook, ''Le Bernardin \u2013 Four Star Simplicity'' (Clarkson Potter) was published in 1998, and in 2014, Ripert released his newest cookbook, ''My Best: Eric Ripert'' (Alain Ducasse Publishing). In 2016, he published his memoir: ''32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table to Working the Line'' (Random House), which appeared on ''The New York Times'' bestseller list.\n\n==Philanthropic activity==\nRipert is the chair of City Harvest's Food Council.

When he was young, his family moved to [[Andorra]], where he was raised. He later returned to France and attended a culinary school in [[Perpignan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.le-bernardin.com/about/eric-ripert|title=Le Bernardin by Eric Ripert {{!}} Eric Ripert|last=Studios|first=Ideawork|website=www.le-bernardin.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Culinary career==\nAt the age of 17 in 1982 he moved to Paris, where he worked for two years at [[La Tour d'Argent]], a famous restaurant that claims to be more than 400 years old. Ripert next worked at Jamin under [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]] and was soon promoted to [[Chef de Partie|Assistant Chef de Partie]]. In 1985 Ripert left to fulfill his military service, after which he returned to Jamin as [[Chef de Partie|Chef Poissonier]].\n\nIn 1989, Ripert moved to the United States and was hired as a sous chef in the [[Watergate Hotel|Watergate Hotel's]] [[Jean Louis Palladin]] restaurant. Ripert moved to New York in 1991, working briefly as David Bouley's sous-chef before [[Maguy_Le_Coze|Maguy]] and [[Gilbert Le Coze]] recruited him as chef for Le Bernardin. In 1994, Ripert became Le Bernardin's executive chef after Gilbert Le Coze died unexpectedly of a heart attack. The following year, at the age of 29, Ripert earned a four-star rating from the ''[[New York Times]]'', and in 1996 he became a part-owner. In the ''[[Michelin Guide]]'' NYC 2006, Ripert's Le Bernardin was one of four New York City restaurants to be awarded the maximum three Michelin stars for excellence in cuisine. Le Bernardin received four stars from the ''New York Times'' four consecutive times, making it the only restaurant to maintain that exquisite status for that length of time and never dropping a star in ten years. Le Bernardin is often referred to as the Temple of Seafood.\n\nRipert is the Vice Chairman of the board of [[City Harvest (organization)|City Harvest]], working to bring together New York's top chefs and restaurateurs to raise funds and increase the quality and quantity of food donations to New York's neediest. In addition, Ripert partnered with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company to open Blue in Grand Cayman.\n\n==Media career==\nRipert has made several guest appearances on cooking-based television shows, including guest judge and assistant chef roles on the second, third, fourth and fifth seasons of [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] TV's \"Top Chef\". Chef Ripert had been considered to join season 8 of Top Chef as a permanent judge, but bowed out when his employee Jen Caroll was selected as a contestant again. Ripert was good friends with [[Anthony Bourdain]] and appeared in many episodes of ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]]'' and ''[[Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown]]''. In September 2009, AVEC ERIC, Ripert's first TV show, debuted on PBS stations and ran for two successful seasons, earning two [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s: [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Culinary Program|Outstanding Culinary Program]] (2011) and Outstanding Achievement in Main Title and Graphic Design (2010). AVEC ERIC returned for a third season on the Cooking Channel in February 2015, and is now available through iTunes and Netflix. Ripert has launched a series of brief online cooking videos called \"Get Toasted\" on his website AVECERIC.com which focuses on easy and quick meals that can be prepared and cooked in minutes with a toaster oven. In the series he uses a somewhat high end brick-oven based toaster oven produced by Cuisinart.\n\nRipert was a featured chef on [[Great Chefs]] television.<ref>[http://www.greatchefs.com/ripert-eric/www.greatchefs.com Great Chefs Television] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, he played himself in the television show ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'' on [[HBO]] (season 1 episode 5), alongside [[David Chang]], [[Wylie Dufresne]] and [[Tom Colicchio]]. He returned in his cameo role in Season 2, in multiple episodes.\n\n== Books ==\nIn fall 2008, Ripert published ''On the Line'', his second cookbook with Artisan, which in 2002 published ''A Return to Cooking'', a collaboration between Ripert, photographers Shimon and Tammar Rothstein, artist Valentino Cortazar, and writer Michael Ruhlman that was selected by ''Newsweek'' as one of its best books of the season.  Ripert's first cookbook, ''Le Bernardin \u2013 Four Star Simplicity'' (Clarkson Potter) was published in 1998, and in 2014, Ripert released his newest cookbook, ''My Best: Eric Ripert'' (Alain Ducasse Publishing). In 2016, he published his memoir: ''32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table to Working the Line'' (Random House), which appeared on ''The New York Times'' bestseller list.\n\n==Philanthropic activity==\nRipert is the chair of City Harvest's Food Council. In this capacity he works to bring together New York's top chefs, restaurateurs and others in the food community to assist City Harvest in its mission to raise funds and to increase the quantity and quality of food donations. \"[[City Harvest (organization)|City Harvest]], a non-profit organization founded in 1982, is the world's first and New York City's only food rescue program.

However, when the Princess of Power toyline was released, Mattel decided to make the male Evil Horde characters part of the ''Masters of the Universe'' toyline, and therefore Catra became She-Ra's [[Archenemy|nemesis]] in the ''Princess of Power'' toyline instead. When a race called the Magicats were taken prisoner, their Queen set out to find them. The Queen, however, was also captured and imprisoned by Hordak. Without the magical mask which bestowed on her the title of Queen, she was powerless to escape. Hordak had taken the mask from her and had given it to Catra, from which she gained additional feline qualities to those of her native Purrsia, and the ability to transform into a large panther. To transform into her feline state, Catra slides the mask from her forehead over her eyes. In her cat form, she retains the ability to speak and possesses greater strength than her human form. When Adora is reconciled with her twin brother Adam, she leaves the Horde and is replaced by Catra as the Force-Captain. Several times, while serving Hordak, Catra strikes out on her own, showing that she does not need Hordak. This is quite evident when Catra betrays Hordak to Skeletor, in an attempt to overthrow him. Even though there are a few other female villains in The Horde, Catra does not get on that well with any of them, only working with them as a last resort. She appears to have a particularly intense rivalry with fellow female villain Scorpia. Catra, along with the other Horde members, holds an intense hatred for Imp.\n\nWith the magical mask, Catra is able to transform into a panther with light purple fur. One of the most overlooked details about Catra is that she also possesses the power of [[teleportation]]. She only demonstrates this ability on one occasion and it is uncertain where this power originates, although it is assumed that it is another power bestowed by her magical mask. However, the Magicat elder, Tao states that the Queen kept virtually all of the mask's powers secret, so this is unlikely. However, Tao does reveal one of the powers to Catra called Freezefire, which generates an energy beam that can encase its target in ice. Catra has subsequently lost any knowledge of this power. Additionally, the Magicat Percival, states that once the mask has been used for evil, it can no longer be used for good.\n \n====Clawdeen====\nCatra is also the owner of a pink lion named Clawdeen. Clawdeen only appears once during the series' run. In that episode, she scares the rebels into the Cage-Mines so The Horde can capture them. Bow traps her in one of the Cage-Mines and she is never seen again.\n\nIn the Ladybird books, Clawdeen is female (despite looking like a male lion in the animated series) and only referred to as a ''giant cat''. Nonetheless, she can talk and is Catra's mode of transportation. She also appears in the mini-comic \"A Born Champion,\" but has a minor role.\n\n==In ''She-Ra and the Princesses of Power'' (2018\u2013present)==\n{{Main|She-Ra and the Princesses of Power}}\n\nIn the 2018 series, a teenage Catra was a childhood friend of Adora, raised alongside her by their trainer/mother-figure, Shadow Weaver. Though Adora defended Catra from Shadow Weaver's emotional abuse throughout their childhood, Catra resented Adora for the favoritism shown her by Shadow Weaver. Furthermore, unlike Adora, Catra is well aware of the Horde's manipulations and accepted it for the sake of her own ambitions.<ref name=\"cbr.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/she-ra-catra-friendship-reboot-noelle-stevenson/|title=She-Ra: Noelle Stevenson on Catra and She-Ra's New Relationship|date=6 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref> After Adora defects from the Horde, Catra rejects her former friend's attempt to talk her into leaving as well. Stevenson explains: \u201cCatra\u2019s feelings of betrayal towards Adora are personal. Adora\u2019s more idealistic, and she loves everyone in the world and wants to save everybody. Catra can\u2019t understand or accept that. That\u2019s the core tragedy, not just of the characters, but of the show.\u201d\n\nCatra seizes the opportunity to prove herself to the Horde and is quickly promoted to Force Captain by Lord Hordak. Although her plan to capture Adora fails, Catra is able win the allegiance of the eccentric genius Princess Entrapta, providing the Horde with new technology for an attempted conquest of Etheria. Although that plan fails as well, Catra impresses Hordak enough to replace Shadow Weaver as his second in command.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/42718-she-ra-princesses-of-power-noelle-stevenson-netflix.html|title=SHE-RA & PRINCESSES OF POWER's Noelle Stevenson Dishes On Season 1 Relationships - SPOILERS|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the second and third seasons, Hordak begins losing faith in Catra due to her arrogance and putting her personal grudges before the Horde's agenda. When Shadow Weaver is due to be exiled, she tricks Catra into providing the means for her to escape. As punishment for her mistake, she is sent on a dangerous mission in the hazardous desert of the Crimson Waste. There she becomes the leader of a local band of bandits, and is tempted to abandon the Horde for her new life in the desert, but when she learns that Shadow Weaver has defected to the rebels, her resentment and jealousy of Adora drives her to return to the Horde. Obsessed with vengeance, she activates Hordak's experimental portal even though she knows it might destroy the planet, and then blames Entrapta for its failure.\n\nIn the fourth season, Catra coerces Hordak into letting her command the Horde's war effort, and hires shapeshifting mercenary Double Trouble to sow dissent in the Rebellion. But the Horde's victories leave Catra unsatisfied, as her obsession with proving herself drives off her few remaining friends. When Hordak learns the truth of Entrapta's exile from Double Trouble, he attacks her, but she immobilizes him.

Power}}\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nIn Filmation's ''She-Ra: Princess of Power'' cartoon series, Hordak is the leader of the Evil Horde, with Catra as of one of his minions. However, when the Princess of Power toyline was released, Mattel decided to make the male Evil Horde characters part of the ''Masters of the Universe'' toyline, and therefore Catra became She-Ra's [[Archenemy|nemesis]] in the ''Princess of Power'' toyline instead. When a race called the Magicats were taken prisoner, their Queen set out to find them. The Queen, however, was also captured and imprisoned by Hordak. Without the magical mask which bestowed on her the title of Queen, she was powerless to escape. Hordak had taken the mask from her and had given it to Catra, from which she gained additional feline qualities to those of her native Purrsia, and the ability to transform into a large panther. To transform into her feline state, Catra slides the mask from her forehead over her eyes. In her cat form, she retains the ability to speak and possesses greater strength than her human form. When Adora is reconciled with her twin brother Adam, she leaves the Horde and is replaced by Catra as the Force-Captain. Several times, while serving Hordak, Catra strikes out on her own, showing that she does not need Hordak. This is quite evident when Catra betrays Hordak to Skeletor, in an attempt to overthrow him. Even though there are a few other female villains in The Horde, Catra does not get on that well with any of them, only working with them as a last resort. She appears to have a particularly intense rivalry with fellow female villain Scorpia. Catra, along with the other Horde members, holds an intense hatred for Imp.\n\nWith the magical mask, Catra is able to transform into a panther with light purple fur. One of the most overlooked details about Catra is that she also possesses the power of [[teleportation]]. She only demonstrates this ability on one occasion and it is uncertain where this power originates, although it is assumed that it is another power bestowed by her magical mask. However, the Magicat elder, Tao states that the Queen kept virtually all of the mask's powers secret, so this is unlikely. However, Tao does reveal one of the powers to Catra called Freezefire, which generates an energy beam that can encase its target in ice. Catra has subsequently lost any knowledge of this power. Additionally, the Magicat Percival, states that once the mask has been used for evil, it can no longer be used for good.\n \n====Clawdeen====\nCatra is also the owner of a pink lion named Clawdeen. Clawdeen only appears once during the series' run. In that episode, she scares the rebels into the Cage-Mines so The Horde can capture them. Bow traps her in one of the Cage-Mines and she is never seen again.\n\nIn the Ladybird books, Clawdeen is female (despite looking like a male lion in the animated series) and only referred to as a ''giant cat''. Nonetheless, she can talk and is Catra's mode of transportation. She also appears in the mini-comic \"A Born Champion,\" but has a minor role.\n\n==In ''She-Ra and the Princesses of Power'' (2018\u2013present)==\n{{Main|She-Ra and the Princesses of Power}}\n\nIn the 2018 series, a teenage Catra was a childhood friend of Adora, raised alongside her by their trainer/mother-figure, Shadow Weaver. Though Adora defended Catra from Shadow Weaver's emotional abuse throughout their childhood, Catra resented Adora for the favoritism shown her by Shadow Weaver. Furthermore, unlike Adora, Catra is well aware of the Horde's manipulations and accepted it for the sake of her own ambitions.<ref name=\"cbr.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/she-ra-catra-friendship-reboot-noelle-stevenson/|title=She-Ra: Noelle Stevenson on Catra and She-Ra's New Relationship|date=6 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref> After Adora defects from the Horde, Catra rejects her former friend's attempt to talk her into leaving as well. Stevenson explains: \u201cCatra\u2019s feelings of betrayal towards Adora are personal. Adora\u2019s more idealistic, and she loves everyone in the world and wants to save everybody. Catra can\u2019t understand or accept that. That\u2019s the core tragedy, not just of the characters, but of the show.\u201d\n\nCatra seizes the opportunity to prove herself to the Horde and is quickly promoted to Force Captain by Lord Hordak. Although her plan to capture Adora fails, Catra is able win the allegiance of the eccentric genius Princess Entrapta, providing the Horde with new technology for an attempted conquest of Etheria. Although that plan fails as well, Catra impresses Hordak enough to replace Shadow Weaver as his second in command.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/42718-she-ra-princesses-of-power-noelle-stevenson-netflix.html|title=SHE-RA & PRINCESSES OF POWER's Noelle Stevenson Dishes On Season 1 Relationships - SPOILERS|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the second and third seasons, Hordak begins losing faith in Catra due to her arrogance and putting her personal grudges before the Horde's agenda. When Shadow Weaver is due to be exiled, she tricks Catra into providing the means for her to escape. As punishment for her mistake, she is sent on a dangerous mission in the hazardous desert of the Crimson Waste. There she becomes the leader of a local band of bandits, and is tempted to abandon the Horde for her new life in the desert, but when she learns that Shadow Weaver has defected to the rebels, her resentment and jealousy of Adora drives her to return to the Horde. Obsessed with vengeance, she activates Hordak's experimental portal even though she knows it might destroy the planet, and then blames Entrapta for its failure.\n\nIn the fourth season, Catra coerces Hordak into letting her command the Horde's war effort, and hires shapeshifting mercenary Double Trouble to sow dissent in the Rebellion. But the Horde's victories leave Catra unsatisfied, as her obsession with proving herself drives off her few remaining friends. When Hordak learns the truth of Entrapta's exile from Double Trouble, he attacks her, but she immobilizes him. Double Trouble switches sides, enabling the Rebellion to reverse the Horde's gains; their analysis of Catra's character flaws causes her to emotionally break down and accept her defeat. At the end of the season, Catra manages to convince Hordak's creator Horde Prime to refrain from destroying Etheria in order to use it as a weapon.\n\n==In popular culture==\nCatra appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Slaughterhouse on the Prairie\", voiced by [[Eden Espinosa]].

{"title_page": "Walter Horstmann Thomas", "text_new": "[[File:1928ss.png|thumb|Walter H. Thomas - 1928]]\n\n'''Walter Horstmann Thomas''' (1876\u20131948) was an American architect from Philadelphia whose career spanned 44 years. \u00a0He is best known for approximately eighty church designs.\n\n==Early life==\n\nWalter H. Thomas was the younger of two children of Richard Newton Thomas, an [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|Episcopal]] priest who served several Philadelphia parishes, and Clara Horstmann. Thomas was educated in private schools, including the Hamilton School and [[Episcopal Academy]].\n\n==Grand tour ==\n[[File:1889 Luxor copy 1.jpg|thumb|WHT in Luxor - 1889]]\nOn December 29, 1888, Thomas\u2019 twelfth birthday, his family sailed from New York for a six-month trip to Europe, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece and Turkey. \u00a0Thomas kept a diary of this adventure that documents observations of the people and places he saw. \u00a0In a photo of their party, taken at the Temple of Karnack in [[Luxor]] on February 13, 1889, Walter is the youngest in the group. \u00a0His sister Emma stands to his left and their father, Richard N. Thomas behind her.\n\n==Education==\n\nThomas graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1899 with a BS in architecture <sup>[15]</sup>, then interned in the office of [[Edgar Viguers Seeler|Edgar Seeler <sup>[6]</sup>]] until March 1901 when he and his UPenn classmate and Zeta Psi brother Clark Wharton Churchman sailed to Paris. \u00a0Thomas enrolled in atelier Lambert at the [[\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]]. \u00a0He passed the entrance exams in May 1902 <sup>[13]</sup>, and also studied planning in ateliers [[Fran\u00e7ois-Benjamin Chaussemiche|Chaussemiche]] and Faure-Dujarric. \u00a0He travelled around Europe visiting architectural sites, recording his impressions in sketches and photographs.\n\n==Early career==\n\nWhen Thomas returned to Philadelphia in 1904, he established a partnership with Clark Churchman as Churchman & Thomas. \u00a0Early clients were fraternity brothers and family members. Thomas\u2019 uncle, George C. Thomas, a partner at Drexel & Co. bankers, was an important client who directly commissioned several projects, mostly church-related. \u00a0\n\nThomas joined the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) in 1907 <sup>[15]</sup> and, by 1912, was attending executive committee meetings of the Philadelphia Chapter as recording secretary. \u00a0He was also a member of the T-Square Club during this period <sup>[1]</sup>. \n\nIn 1908, John Molitor joined the firm which then became Thomas, Churchman & Molitor <sup>[15]</sup>. TC&M designed a variety of buildings, including trolley stations and a new house for Zeta Psi fraternity on the UPenn Campus.\n\n==World War I==\n\nAs [[World War I]] started, the Thomas, Churchman & Molitor partnership dissolved. John Molitor left in 1914 to lead Philadelphia\u2019s new Division of Housing and Sanitation. \u00a0Thus, some projects designed in 1914 are attributed to Thomas & Churchman. \u00a0Clark Churchman left in 1915 to work with interior designer E.J. Holmes. Thomas worked on his own during the next three years, much of the time on one of his early landmark buildings, the Chapel of the Mediator P.E. Church, West Philadelphia. \n\nIn 1918 Thomas volunteered for the YMCA supporting the American Expeditionary Forces; in August he sailed to Europe and was assigned to manage decoration and maintenance of YMCA huts throughout France. \u00a0\n\n==Thomas, Martin & Kirkpatrick==\n\nThomas returned to Philadelphia in the summer of 1919 and briefly continued his solo practice. \u00a0In 1920 he formed a new partnership with Sydney E. Martin and Donald M. Kirkpatrick <sup>[15]</sup>, both of whom had worked for Thomas, Churchman & Molitor prior to the war. \n\nThomas became more active with the Philadelphia Chapter of AIA, becoming vice president 1926-1927 and president 1928-1930 <sup>[15]</sup>. During his presidency, the AIA formed a design committee and, in coordination with developer Joseph Greenberg, designed and built the Architects Building at 17<sup>th</sup> and Sansom Streets. \u00a0Upon its completion this location became the hub of Philadelphia architectural activity for the next two generations.\n\nThomas designed several large church projects during this period, one of which is a unique, non-sectarian, \u201cecclesiastical\u201d building, the [[Girard College]] Chapel in Philadelphia. \u00a0TMK won a competition in 1930 and the winning design and resulting building were widely published in the architectural press. <sup>[27, 28]</sup>\u00a0{{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Thomas & Martin continued their partnership after Donald Kirkpatrick left in 1930, although there were few new commissions. \u00a0Major projects during the 1930\u2019s included a science building, library addition, and a dormitory at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. \u00a0\n\n==Bureau of Architecture of the Methodist Episcopal Church==\n\nMethodist minister Elbert M. Conover established a Philadelphia office of the \u201cBureau of Architecture of the Methodist Episcopal Church\u201d (BAMEC) in 1919. Conover promoted his concepts of church design through popular, widely distributed books and pamphlets. \u00a0Conover employed young architecture graduates to provide design review services. In 1924 Conover engaged Walter Thomas as \u201cConsultant\u201d to BAMEC <sup>[15]</sup> to provide direction for the young staff and to lead the design of new church projects that were requested by Methodist congregations around the country.  As the young architects gained experience, several obtained professional registration. \u00a0Notable among these were Thoralf Sundt and Bruce Wenner (registered in 1927), <sup>[15]</sup> and Hensel Fink and [[Harold E. Wagoner|Harold Wagoner]] (registered in 1933). <sup>[15]</sup> \u00a0Thus, Thomas was the principal designer for BAMEC\u2019s new church projects during this period, while Sundt & Wenner were the architects of record. Conover\u2019s books include many drawings and photos of Thomas\u2019 designs, however many of Conover\u2019s attributions for buildings are technically inaccurate, listing design participants as if they were also architects of record <sup>[7], [8], [9]</sup>.\n\nThomas\u2019 consulting arrangement ended in 1933, when BAMEC\u2019s Philadelphia office closed. \u00a0Elbert Conover subsequently established the \u201cInterdenominational Bureau of Architecture\u201d (IBA), with an office in New York City. \u00a0The IBA used a business model in which Conover recommended established architects instead of using in-house design staff. \n\n==City architect and Philadelphia City Planning Commission==\n\nIn December 1929, Philadelphia Mayor Mackey appointed Walter Thomas to his cabinet as the city architect. This position had, as recently as 1926, been occupied by Thomas\u2019 former partner John Molitor. Although Thomas\u2019 term as City Architect lasted only for the 1930 calendar year, Thomas continued working for the city for the next six years as Secretary and Technical Director of the [[City Planning Commission (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia City Planning Commission]] (PCPC).\n\nThomas initiated and managed PCPC research into numerous planning issues, especially concerns relating to impacts of increasing automobile and truck traffic. \u00a0Other planning subjects included: location of the city\u2019s airport; updating building and zoning codes; preservation of historic structures; mitigation of slums; providing more efficient municipal services; providing more recreation facilities; more schools; further planning for public districts within the city, especially the Parkway area, the University of Pennsylvania and Civic Center, the new Pennsylvania Railroad station and Post Office at 30<sup>th</sup> Street and the banks of the Schuylkill River; and coordination of multi-modal transportation systems. <sup>[12]</sup>\n\nAs the depression intensified in the mid-1930\u2019s and, after the Roosevelt administration developed its various agencies and boards, the PCPC used some of the federal funding thus made available to further the planning projects cited above.\n\n==Public housing==\n\nBy the spring of 1937, as federal funding started to become available for public housing, Thomas accepted the position of Technical Director to the newly-formed [[Philadelphia Housing Authority]]. \u00a0His responsibilities included supervising all of the planning, architecture and engineering for programs involving four housing projects, totaling roughly 3,000 dwelling units. \u00a0This work continued until 1942 when war expenditures severely limited federal spending for domestic programs.\n\n==World War II==\n\nThe Thomas & Martin partnership ended in 1940. Sydney Martin maintained the current clients, including Bryn Mawr College, and formed his own firm. \u00a0Around 1940 Thomas was one of the founding members of the Church Architecture Guild of America. \u00a0He was elected president of this group in 1945. Thomas also taught two courses in City Planning at the University of Pennsylvania from 1941 to 1944.<sup>[16]</sup>\n\n==Thomas & Wagoner, Thomas & Antrim==\n\nIn the early 1940s, Thomas received requests to design churches, many referred by his long-time friend Elbert Conover. \u00a0Thomas reconnected with [[Harold E. Wagoner|Harold Wagoner]] in 1944, who had been one of the staff architects under his direction at BAMEC from 1926-1933 and who had worked for T&M from 1936-1939. \u00a0In 1944, Wagoner had just been discharged from the Army after designing building camouflage during the war. \u00a0The new firm, titled \u201cWalter H. Thomas, Architect and Harold E. Wagoner, Associated Architect,\u201d was established to pursue ecclesiastical work. \u00a0\n\nThomas formed a similar partnership around the same time with Walter Antrim to pursue municipal projects. \u00a0Antrim had worked for TMK from 1922-1929 and in various positions under Thomas at the PCPC and the Housing Authority in the 1930\u2019s. \u00a0 Thomas & Antrim\u2019s main project was a vocational school for the Philadelphia School Board.\n\nThe Thomas & Wagoner partnership's project list grew quickly. \u00a0In June 1947, Thomas & Wagoner's list of current church projects to show prospective clients included twenty-three projects in fifteen states then proceeding in various stages of design. \u00a0By the time of Thomas\u2019 death, a year later, Richmond, VA, First Presbyterian Church stated in its fundraising brochure that \u201cThomas & Wagoner had thirty church projects underway in sixteen states.\u201d <sup>[26]</sup> Thomas did not see most of these completed, however due to the economic impact of World War II which had seriously disrupted availability of materials, labor and capital for non-war-related work. Harold Wagoner eventually completed those projects, the construction of several of which lasted through the 1950\u2019s.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn October 1906 Walter married Natalie Taylor, daughter of Nathan A. Taylor and Florence N. Supplee. They had two daughters, Claire (Rava\u00e7on) (1907-1997) and Florence (Davis) (1909-1999). Natalie died in March 1913. Thomas married Ruth Boomer in December 1919. \u00a0They had one son, [[Brooks Thomas]] (1931-2010). Thomas was member of St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal church in Overbrook, Philadelphia and served on its vestry. He was the secretary for the P.E. Church City Mission for many years. He was a Mason and belonged to several Philadelphia area clubs.\n\n==Selected architectural works==\n\nDocumented examples of the work of Walter H. Thomas and his various partnerships are listed below. Dates indicate the approximate completion of design.

Thomas - 1928]]\n\n'''Walter Horstmann Thomas''' (1876\u20131948) was an American architect from Philadelphia whose career spanned 44 years. \u00a0He is best known for approximately eighty church designs.\n\n==Early life==\n\nWalter H. Thomas was the younger of two children of Richard Newton Thomas, an [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|Episcopal]] priest who served several Philadelphia parishes, and Clara Horstmann. Thomas was educated in private schools, including the Hamilton School and [[Episcopal Academy]].\n\n==Grand tour ==\n[[File:1889 Luxor copy 1.jpg|thumb|WHT in Luxor - 1889]]\nOn December 29, 1888, Thomas\u2019 twelfth birthday, his family sailed from New York for a six-month trip to Europe, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece and Turkey. \u00a0Thomas kept a diary of this adventure that documents observations of the people and places he saw. \u00a0In a photo of their party, taken at the Temple of Karnack in [[Luxor]] on February 13, 1889, Walter is the youngest in the group. \u00a0His sister Emma stands to his left and their father, Richard N. Thomas behind her.\n\n==Education==\n\nThomas graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1899 with a BS in architecture <sup>[15]</sup>, then interned in the office of [[Edgar Viguers Seeler|Edgar Seeler <sup>[6]</sup>]] until March 1901 when he and his UPenn classmate and Zeta Psi brother Clark Wharton Churchman sailed to Paris. \u00a0Thomas enrolled in atelier Lambert at the [[\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]]. \u00a0He passed the entrance exams in May 1902 <sup>[13]</sup>, and also studied planning in ateliers [[Fran\u00e7ois-Benjamin Chaussemiche|Chaussemiche]] and Faure-Dujarric. \u00a0He travelled around Europe visiting architectural sites, recording his impressions in sketches and photographs.\n\n==Early career==\n\nWhen Thomas returned to Philadelphia in 1904, he established a partnership with Clark Churchman as Churchman & Thomas. \u00a0Early clients were fraternity brothers and family members. Thomas\u2019 uncle, George C. Thomas, a partner at Drexel & Co. bankers, was an important client who directly commissioned several projects, mostly church-related. \u00a0\n\nThomas joined the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) in 1907 <sup>[15]</sup> and, by 1912, was attending executive committee meetings of the Philadelphia Chapter as recording secretary. \u00a0He was also a member of the T-Square Club during this period <sup>[1]</sup>. \n\nIn 1908, John Molitor joined the firm which then became Thomas, Churchman & Molitor <sup>[15]</sup>. TC&M designed a variety of buildings, including trolley stations and a new house for Zeta Psi fraternity on the UPenn Campus.\n\n==World War I==\n\nAs [[World War I]] started, the Thomas, Churchman & Molitor partnership dissolved. John Molitor left in 1914 to lead Philadelphia\u2019s new Division of Housing and Sanitation. \u00a0Thus, some projects designed in 1914 are attributed to Thomas & Churchman. \u00a0Clark Churchman left in 1915 to work with interior designer E.J. Holmes. Thomas worked on his own during the next three years, much of the time on one of his early landmark buildings, the Chapel of the Mediator P.E. Church, West Philadelphia. \n\nIn 1918 Thomas volunteered for the YMCA supporting the American Expeditionary Forces; in August he sailed to Europe and was assigned to manage decoration and maintenance of YMCA huts throughout France. \u00a0\n\n==Thomas, Martin & Kirkpatrick==\n\nThomas returned to Philadelphia in the summer of 1919 and briefly continued his solo practice. \u00a0In 1920 he formed a new partnership with Sydney E. Martin and Donald M. Kirkpatrick <sup>[15]</sup>, both of whom had worked for Thomas, Churchman & Molitor prior to the war. \n\nThomas became more active with the Philadelphia Chapter of AIA, becoming vice president 1926-1927 and president 1928-1930 <sup>[15]</sup>. During his presidency, the AIA formed a design committee and, in coordination with developer Joseph Greenberg, designed and built the Architects Building at 17<sup>th</sup> and Sansom Streets. \u00a0Upon its completion this location became the hub of Philadelphia architectural activity for the next two generations.\n\nThomas designed several large church projects during this period, one of which is a unique, non-sectarian, \u201cecclesiastical\u201d building, the [[Girard College]] Chapel in Philadelphia. \u00a0TMK won a competition in 1930 and the winning design and resulting building were widely published in the architectural press. <sup>[27, 28]</sup>\u00a0{{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Thomas & Martin continued their partnership after Donald Kirkpatrick left in 1930, although there were few new commissions. \u00a0Major projects during the 1930\u2019s included a science building, library addition, and a dormitory at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. \u00a0\n\n==Bureau of Architecture of the Methodist Episcopal Church==\n\nMethodist minister Elbert M. Conover established a Philadelphia office of the \u201cBureau of Architecture of the Methodist Episcopal Church\u201d (BAMEC) in 1919. Conover promoted his concepts of church design through popular, widely distributed books and pamphlets. \u00a0Conover employed young architecture graduates to provide design review services. In 1924 Conover engaged Walter Thomas as \u201cConsultant\u201d to BAMEC <sup>[15]</sup> to provide direction for the young staff and to lead the design of new church projects that were requested by Methodist congregations around the country.  As the young architects gained experience, several obtained professional registration. \u00a0Notable among these were Thoralf Sundt and Bruce Wenner (registered in 1927), <sup>[15]</sup> and Hensel Fink and [[Harold E. Wagoner|Harold Wagoner]] (registered in 1933). <sup>[15]</sup> \u00a0Thus, Thomas was the principal designer for BAMEC\u2019s new church projects during this period, while Sundt & Wenner were the architects of record. Conover\u2019s books include many drawings and photos of Thomas\u2019 designs, however many of Conover\u2019s attributions for buildings are technically inaccurate, listing design participants as if they were also architects of record <sup>[7], [8], [9]</sup>.\n\nThomas\u2019 consulting arrangement ended in 1933, when BAMEC\u2019s Philadelphia office closed. \u00a0Elbert Conover subsequently established the \u201cInterdenominational Bureau of Architecture\u201d (IBA), with an office in New York City. \u00a0The IBA used a business model in which Conover recommended established architects instead of using in-house design staff. \n\n==City architect and Philadelphia City Planning Commission==\n\nIn December 1929, Philadelphia Mayor Mackey appointed Walter Thomas to his cabinet as the city architect. This position had, as recently as 1926, been occupied by Thomas\u2019 former partner John Molitor. Although Thomas\u2019 term as City Architect lasted only for the 1930 calendar year, Thomas continued working for the city for the next six years as Secretary and Technical Director of the [[City Planning Commission (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia City Planning Commission]] (PCPC).\n\nThomas initiated and managed PCPC research into numerous planning issues, especially concerns relating to impacts of increasing automobile and truck traffic. \u00a0Other planning subjects included: location of the city\u2019s airport; updating building and zoning codes; preservation of historic structures; mitigation of slums; providing more efficient municipal services; providing more recreation facilities; more schools; further planning for public districts within the city, especially the Parkway area, the University of Pennsylvania and Civic Center, the new Pennsylvania Railroad station and Post Office at 30<sup>th</sup> Street and the banks of the Schuylkill River; and coordination of multi-modal transportation systems. <sup>[12]</sup>\n\nAs the depression intensified in the mid-1930\u2019s and, after the Roosevelt administration developed its various agencies and boards, the PCPC used some of the federal funding thus made available to further the planning projects cited above.\n\n==Public housing==\n\nBy the spring of 1937, as federal funding started to become available for public housing, Thomas accepted the position of Technical Director to the newly-formed [[Philadelphia Housing Authority]]. \u00a0His responsibilities included supervising all of the planning, architecture and engineering for programs involving four housing projects, totaling roughly 3,000 dwelling units. \u00a0This work continued until 1942 when war expenditures severely limited federal spending for domestic programs.\n\n==World War II==\n\nThe Thomas & Martin partnership ended in 1940. Sydney Martin maintained the current clients, including Bryn Mawr College, and formed his own firm. \u00a0Around 1940 Thomas was one of the founding members of the Church Architecture Guild of America. \u00a0He was elected president of this group in 1945. Thomas also taught two courses in City Planning at the University of Pennsylvania from 1941 to 1944.<sup>[16]</sup>\n\n==Thomas & Wagoner, Thomas & Antrim==\n\nIn the early 1940s, Thomas received requests to design churches, many referred by his long-time friend Elbert Conover. \u00a0Thomas reconnected with [[Harold E. Wagoner|Harold Wagoner]] in 1944, who had been one of the staff architects under his direction at BAMEC from 1926-1933 and who had worked for T&M from 1936-1939. \u00a0In 1944, Wagoner had just been discharged from the Army after designing building camouflage during the war. \u00a0The new firm, titled \u201cWalter H. Thomas, Architect and Harold E. Wagoner, Associated Architect,\u201d was established to pursue ecclesiastical work. \u00a0\n\nThomas formed a similar partnership around the same time with Walter Antrim to pursue municipal projects. \u00a0Antrim had worked for TMK from 1922-1929 and in various positions under Thomas at the PCPC and the Housing Authority in the 1930\u2019s. \u00a0 Thomas & Antrim\u2019s main project was a vocational school for the Philadelphia School Board.\n\nThe Thomas & Wagoner partnership's project list grew quickly. \u00a0In June 1947, Thomas & Wagoner's list of current church projects to show prospective clients included twenty-three projects in fifteen states then proceeding in various stages of design. \u00a0By the time of Thomas\u2019 death, a year later, Richmond, VA, First Presbyterian Church stated in its fundraising brochure that \u201cThomas & Wagoner had thirty church projects underway in sixteen states.\u201d <sup>[26]</sup> Thomas did not see most of these completed, however due to the economic impact of World War II which had seriously disrupted availability of materials, labor and capital for non-war-related work. Harold Wagoner eventually completed those projects, the construction of several of which lasted through the 1950\u2019s.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn October 1906 Walter married Natalie Taylor, daughter of Nathan A. Taylor and Florence N. Supplee. They had two daughters, Claire (Rava\u00e7on) (1907-1997) and Florence (Davis) (1909-1999). Natalie died in March 1913. Thomas married Ruth Boomer in December 1919. \u00a0They had one son, [[Brooks Thomas]] (1931-2010). Thomas was member of St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal church in Overbrook, Philadelphia and served on its vestry. He was the secretary for the P.E. Church City Mission for many years. He was a Mason and belonged to several Philadelphia area clubs.\n\n==Selected architectural works==\n\nDocumented examples of the work of Walter H.

He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.\" According to the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel; Genesis 35:10) had 12 sons and at least one daughter ([[Dinah]]) by two wives and two concubines. The twelve sons fathered the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]].\n* When the land of Israel was apportioned among the tribes in the days of [[Joshua]], the [[Levite|Tribe of Levi]], being chosen as priests, did not receive land ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:33|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|14:3|HE}}). However, the tribe of Levi were given cities. Six cities were to be refuge cities for all men of Israel, which were to be controlled by the Levites. Three of these cities were located on each side of the Jordan River. In addition, 42 other cities (and their respective open spaces), totaling 48 cities, were given to the Tribe of Levi. ({{bibleverse||Numbers|35|HE}})\n* Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] (the two sons of Joseph by his Egyptian wife [[Asenath]]) ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:50|HE}}) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the [[Tribe of Joseph]] (Genesis 48:5). Each tribe received its own land and had its own encampment during the 40 years of wandering in the desert.\n\nThus, the two divisions of the tribes are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Traditional division\n! Division according to<br /> apportionment of land in Israel\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n| \n# Reuben\n# Simeon\n# Levi\n# Judah\n# Issachar\n# Zebulun\n# Dan\n# Naphtali\n# Gad\n# Asher\n# Joseph\n# Benjamin {{ns|10}}<!-- column width trick plus judicious usage of <br /> -->\n|\n# Reuben\n# Simeon\n# Judah\n# Issachar\n# Zebulun\n# Dan\n# Naphtali\n# Gad\n# Asher\n# Benjamin\n# Ephraim (son of Joseph)\n# Manasseh (son of Joseph) {{ns|1}}\n* Levi (no territorial allotment,<br /> except a number of cities<br /> located within the territories of the other tribes)\n|}\n\nAccording to the Bible, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (or Northern Kingdom) was one of the successor states to the older [[United Monarchy]] (also called the Kingdom of Israel). The Northern Kingdom came into existence in about the 930s BCE after the northern [[Tribes of Israel|tribes of Israel]] rejected Solomon's son [[Rehoboam]] as their king. Nine landed tribes formed the Northern Kingdom: the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]]. In addition, some members of the Tribe of Levi, who had no land allocation, were found in the Northern Kingdom. The tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] remained loyal to Rehoboam, and formed the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (or the Southern Kingdom). Members of Levi and the remnant of [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] were also found in the Southern Kingdom.\n\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|HE}}, members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] \"fled\" to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]] (c. 911\u2013870 BCE). Whether these groups were absorbed into the population or remained distinct groups or returned to their tribal lands is not indicated.\n\nIn c. 732 BCE, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] sacked [[Damascus]] and Israel, annexing [[Aramea]]<ref name=Grabbe>Lester L. Grabbe, ''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'' (New York: T&T Clark, 2007): 134</ref> and [[Transjordan (Bible)|territory]] of the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in [[Gilead]] including the desert outposts of [[Jetur]], [[Naphish]], and [[Nodab]]. People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] system in Assyria/Mesopotamia. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janohah|Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of [[Naphtali]]. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|HE}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\n\nIsrael continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom subject to Assyria until around [[725 BCE|725]]\u2013[[720 BCE]], when it was again invaded by Assyria and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, leaving only the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]] who lived among them of the original Israelite tribes in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, [[Israel Finkelstein]] estimated that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser V]], and [[Sargon II]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Israel |last2=Silberman |first2=Neil Asher |title=The Bible unearthed: archaeology's new vision of ancient Israel and the origin of its sacred texts |date=2001 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9780684869124}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2018}} Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water ([[Siloam]]) to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etTUEorS1zMC&pg=PA174&dq=the+main+reasons+behind+this+expansion+was+the+immigration+of+Israelites+who+came+to+Judah+from+the+Northern+Kingdom+after+the+fall+of+Samaria+in+721+BCE&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=DCiQVbrTJsbv-AGv4oiICw&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=the%20main%20reasons%20behind%20this%20expansion%20was%20the%20immigration%20of%20Israelites%20who%20came%20to%20Judah%20from%20the%20Northern%20Kingdom%20after%20the%20fall%20of%20Samaria%20in%20721%20BCE&f=false |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1841272019}}</ref> Furthermore, {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-11|HE}} explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians\u2014in particular, members of Dan, Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, and Zebulun\u2014and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem at that time.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible does not use the phrase \"ten lost tribes\", leading some to question the number of tribes involved. {{bibleref2|1 Kings|11:31|HE}} states that the kingdom would be taken from [[Solomon]] and ten tribes given to [[Jeroboam]]:\n\n{{quote|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:31|HE}}}}\n\n{{quote|But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:35|HE}}}}\n\n===Biblical apocrypha===\nAccording to Zvi Ben-Dor Benite:\n\n<blockquote>Centuries after their disappearance, the ten lost tribes sent an indirect but vital sign ...

According to Parfitt:<blockquote>As Michael Pollack shows, Menasseh's argument was based on \"three separate and seemingly unrelated sources: a verse from the book of Isaiah, Matteo Ricci's discovery of an old Jewish community in the heart of China and Antonio Montezinos' reported encounter with members of the Lost Tribes in the wilds of South America\".<ref name=Parfitt2003/>{{rp|69}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1649 [[Menasseh ben Israel]] published his book, ''The Hope of Israel'', in Spanish and in Latin in Amsterdam; it included Montezinos' account of the Lost Tribes in the New World.<ref name=\"henry\"/><ref name=\"wilensky\">{{cite journal |last1=Wilensky |first1=M. |title=The Royalist Position concerning the Readmission of Jews to England |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=1951 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=397\u2013409 |doi=10.2307/1453207 |jstor=1453207}}</ref> An English translation was published in London in 1650.

(Since the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290, Jews had been prohibited by law from living in [[England]].) With the approach of 1666, considered a significant date, Cromwell was allegedly interested in the return of the Jews to England because of the many theories circulating related to millennial thinking about the [[End Time|end of the world]]. Many of these ideas were fixed upon the year 1666 and the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] who were looking for the return of [[Jesus]] as the [[Messiah]]; he was expected to establish a final kingdom to rule the physical world for a thousand years. Messianic believers supported Cromwell's Republic in the expectation that it was a preparation for the ''[[fifth monarchy]]''\u2014that is, the monarchy that should succeed the [[Babylonia]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world empires.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nApocryphal accounts concerning the Lost Tribes, based to varying degrees on biblical accounts, have been produced by both [[Jew]]s and [[Christianity|Christians]] since at least the 17th century.<ref name=Benite/>{{rp|59}} An [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish tradition speaks of these tribes as ''Die Roite Yiddelech'', \"the little [[red Jews]]\", cut off from the rest of Jewry by the legendary river [[Sambation]], \"whose foaming waters raise high up into the sky a wall of fire and smoke that is impossible to pass through\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosen |first1=Moses |editor1-last=Riff |editor1-first=Michael |title=The face of survival : Jewish life in Eastern Europe past and present |date=1992 |publisher=Valentine Mitchell |location=London |isbn=9780853032298 |url=https://archive.org/details/faceofsurvival00mich |url-access=registration |chapter=Epilogue: The Recipe|oclc=28236867|page=[https://archive.org/details/faceofsurvival00mich/page/215 215]}}</ref>\n\nHistorians generally concluded that the groups referred to as the Lost Tribes merged with the local population.

Many of these people do not know that they are descended from the ancient house of Israel,\" the church teaches in its basic ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' manual. \"The Lord promised that His covenant people would someday be gathered .... God gathers His children through missionary work. As people come to a knowledge of Jesus Christ, receiving the ordinances of salvation and keeping the associated covenants, they become 'the children of the covenant' ([[Third Nephi|3 Nephi]] 20:26).\"\n\nThe church also teaches that \"The power and authority to direct the work of gathering the house of Israel was given to [[Joseph Smith]] by the prophet Moses, who appeared in 1836 in the Kirtland Temple.&nbsp;... The Israelites are to be gathered spiritually first and then physically. They are gathered spiritually as they join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and make and keep sacred covenants.&nbsp;... The physical gathering of Israel means that the covenant people will be 'gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise' (2 Nephi 9:2). The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will be gathered in the Americas. The tribe of Judah will return to the city of Jerusalem and the area surrounding it. The ten lost tribes will receive from the tribe of Ephraim their promised blessings (see D&C 133:26\u201334).&nbsp;... The physical gathering of Israel will not be complete until the Second Coming of the Savior and on into the Millennium (see Joseph Smith\u2014Matthew 1:37).\"<ref>''[[Gospel Principles]]'', chapter 42, [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-42-the-gathering-of-the-house-of-israel?lang=eng \"The Gathering of the House of Israel\"].</ref>\n\nOne of their main [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]], written by Joseph Smith, is as follows: \"We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.\" (LDS Articles of Faith #10)\n\nRegarding the Ezekiel 37 prophecy, the church teaches that the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' is the stick of Ephraim (or Joseph) mentioned and that the [[Bible]] is the stick of Judah, thus comprising two witnesses for Jesus Christ. The church believes the ''Book of Mormon'' to be a collection of records by prophets of the ancient Americas, written on plates of gold and translated by Joseph Smith c. 1830.

He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.\" According to the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel; Genesis 35:10) had 12 sons and at least one daughter ([[Dinah]]) by two wives and two concubines. The twelve sons fathered the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]].\n* When the land of Israel was apportioned among the tribes in the days of [[Joshua]], the [[Levite|Tribe of Levi]], being chosen as priests, did not receive land ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:33|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|14:3|HE}}). However, the tribe of Levi were given cities. Six cities were to be refuge cities for all men of Israel, which were to be controlled by the Levites. Three of these cities were located on each side of the Jordan River. In addition, 42 other cities (and their respective open spaces), totaling 48 cities, were given to the Tribe of Levi. ({{bibleverse||Numbers|35|HE}})\n* Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] (the two sons of Joseph by his Egyptian wife [[Asenath]]) ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:50|HE}}) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the [[Tribe of Joseph]] (Genesis 48:5). Each tribe received its own land and had its own encampment during the 40 years of wandering in the desert.\n\nThus, the two divisions of the tribes are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Northern Kingdom came into existence in about the 930s BCE after the northern [[Tribes of Israel|tribes of Israel]] rejected Solomon's son [[Rehoboam]] as their king. Nine landed tribes formed the Northern Kingdom: the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]]. In addition, some members of the Tribe of Levi, who had no land allocation, were found in the Northern Kingdom. The tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] remained loyal to Rehoboam, and formed the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (or the Southern Kingdom). Members of Levi and the remnant of [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] were also found in the Southern Kingdom.\n\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|HE}}, members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] \"fled\" to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]] (c. 911\u2013870 BCE). Whether these groups were absorbed into the population or remained distinct groups or returned to their tribal lands is not indicated.\n\nIn c. 732 BCE, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] sacked [[Damascus]] and Israel, annexing [[Aramea]]<ref name=Grabbe>Lester L. Grabbe, ''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?''

People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] system in Assyria/Mesopotamia. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janohah|Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of [[Naphtali]]. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|HE}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\n\nIsrael continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom subject to Assyria until around [[725 BCE|725]]\u2013[[720 BCE]], when it was again invaded by Assyria and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, leaving only the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]] who lived among them of the original Israelite tribes in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, [[Israel Finkelstein]] estimated that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser V]], and [[Sargon II]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Israel |last2=Silberman |first2=Neil Asher |title=The Bible unearthed: archaeology's new vision of ancient Israel and the origin of its sacred texts |date=2001 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9780684869124}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2018}} Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water ([[Siloam]]) to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etTUEorS1zMC&pg=PA174&dq=the+main+reasons+behind+this+expansion+was+the+immigration+of+Israelites+who+came+to+Judah+from+the+Northern+Kingdom+after+the+fall+of+Samaria+in+721+BCE&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=DCiQVbrTJsbv-AGv4oiICw&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=the%20main%20reasons%20behind%20this%20expansion%20was%20the%20immigration%20of%20Israelites%20who%20came%20to%20Judah%20from%20the%20Northern%20Kingdom%20after%20the%20fall%20of%20Samaria%20in%20721%20BCE&f=false |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1841272019}}</ref> Furthermore, {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-11|HE}} explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians\u2014in particular, members of Dan, Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, and Zebulun\u2014and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem at that time.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible does not use the phrase \"ten lost tribes\", leading some to question the number of tribes involved. {{bibleref2|1 Kings|11:31|HE}} states that the kingdom would be taken from [[Solomon]] and ten tribes given to [[Jeroboam]]:\n{{quote|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.\n\n...\n\nBut I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:31,35|HE}}}}\n\n===Biblical apocrypha===\nAccording to Zvi Ben-Dor Benite:\n\n<blockquote>Centuries after their disappearance, the ten lost tribes sent an indirect but vital sign ...

With the approach of 1666, considered a significant date, Cromwell was allegedly interested in the return of the Jews to England because of the many theories circulating related to millennial thinking about the [[End Time|end of the world]]. Many of these ideas were fixed upon the year 1666 and the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] who were looking for the return of [[Jesus]] as the [[Messiah]]; he was expected to establish a final kingdom to rule the physical world for a thousand years.

Many of these people do not know that they are descended from the ancient house of Israel,\" the church teaches in its basic ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' manual. \"The Lord promised that His covenant people would someday be gathered .... God gathers His children through missionary work. As people come to a knowledge of Jesus Christ, receiving the ordinances of salvation and keeping the associated covenants, they become 'the children of the covenant' ([[Third Nephi|3 Nephi]] 20:26).\"\n\nThe church also teaches that \"The power and authority to direct the work of gathering the house of Israel was given to [[Joseph Smith]] by the prophet Moses, who appeared in 1836 in the Kirtland Temple.&nbsp;... The Israelites are to be gathered spiritually first and then physically. They are gathered spiritually as they join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and make and keep sacred covenants.&nbsp;... The physical gathering of Israel means that the covenant people will be 'gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise' (2 Nephi 9:2). The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will be gathered in the Americas. The tribe of Judah will return to the city of Jerusalem and the area surrounding it. The ten lost tribes will receive from the tribe of Ephraim their promised blessings (see D&C 133:26\u201334).&nbsp;... The physical gathering of Israel will not be complete until the Second Coming of the Savior and on into the Millennium (see Joseph Smith\u2014Matthew 1:37).\"<ref>''[[Gospel Principles]]'', chapter 42, [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-42-the-gathering-of-the-house-of-israel?lang=eng \"The Gathering of the House of Israel\"].</ref>\n\nOne of their main [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]], written by Joseph Smith, is as follows: \"We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.\" (LDS Articles of Faith #10)\n\nRegarding the Ezekiel 37 prophecy, the church teaches that the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' is the stick of Ephraim (or Joseph) mentioned and that the [[Bible]] is the stick of Judah, thus comprising two witnesses for Jesus Christ. The church believes the ''Book of Mormon'' to be a collection of records by prophets of the ancient Americas, written on plates of gold and translated by Joseph Smith c. 1830. The church considers the ''Book of Mormon'' one of the main tools for the spiritual gathering of Israel.\n\n==Ethnology and anthropology==\nHistorian [[Tudor Parfitt]] has declared that \"the Lost Tribes are indeed nothing but a myth\", and he writes that \"this myth is a vital feature of colonial discourse throughout the long period of European overseas empires, from the beginning of the fifteenth century, until the later half of the twentieth\".<ref name=Parfitt2003/>{{rp|1, 225}}\n\nExpanded exploration and study of groups throughout the world through archeology and the new field of anthropology in the late 19th century led to a revival or reworking of accounts of the Lost Tribes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Weil |first1=Shalva |editor1-last=Baskin |editor1-first=Judith R. |title=The Cambridge dictionary of Judaism and Jewish culture |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780511982491 |page=616 |chapter=Ten Lost Tribes}}</ref> For instance, because archeological finds of the Mississippian culture's complex earthwork mounds seemed beyond the skills of the Native American cultures known to European Americans at the time of their discovery, it was theorized that the ancient civilizations involved in the mounds' construction were linked to the Lost Tribes.
