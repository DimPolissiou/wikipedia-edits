About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day [[Moldova]], with the Ukrainian [[Budjak]] region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] covering a small area in the north.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]], and the ensuing [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], the eastern parts of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[vassal state|vassal]], along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to [[Imperial Russia]]. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Governorate of Bessarabia]], adopting a name previously used for the southern plains, between the Dniester and the [[Danube]] rivers. Following the [[Crimean War]], in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when [[United Principalities|Romania]], the result of Moldavia's union with [[Wallachia]], was pressured into exchanging those territories for the [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1917, in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the area constituted itself as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], an autonomous republic part of a proposed [[Russian Democratic Federative Republic|federative Russian state]]. [[Bolshevik]] agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the [[Romanian Army]], ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with the Kingdom of Romania]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Charles Upson |title=Bessarabia |url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/meta_pag.shtml |publisher=Dodd, Mead |location=New York City |year=1927}}</ref> The legality of these acts was however disputed, most prominently by the [[Soviet Union]], which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.\n\nIn 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war,<ref name=\"Rothschild77\">Joseph Rothschild, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&pg=PA314 East Central Europe between the two World Wars]'' University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1977; {{ISBN|0-295953-57-8}}, p.314</ref> into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the [[Red Army]] to [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annex the region]]. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to form the [[Moldavian SSR]], while territories inhabited by [[Slav]]ic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of [[Operation M\u00fcnchen]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war changed. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the process of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]], while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]] was proclaimed in the [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]], extending its authority also over the municipality of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]]-inhabited areas in the southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an [[Gagauzia|autonomous region]] within Moldova.\n\n== Etymology and usage of the name ==\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map of Bessarabia within Moldavia through time]]\n\nAccording to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (''Basarabia'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) derives from the [[Wallachia]]n [[Basarab dynasty]], who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. Some scholars question this, however, claiming that:\n* the name was initially an [[exonym]] applied by [[Western Europe|Western]] cartographers\n* it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;\n* the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the [[Black Sea]] was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler [[Miron Costin]], and;\n* the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting  contemporaneous Polish  references to Wallachia as ''Bessarabia'', as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coman| first=Marian|title=Basarabia \u2013 Inventarea cartografic\u0103 a unei regiuni|journal=Studii \u0219i Materiale de Istorie Medie| volume=XXIX| pages=183\u2013215|year=2011| publisher= [[Institutul de Istorie Nicolae Iorga]]| issn=1222-4766}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the [[Upper Trajan Wall|Upper Trajanic Wall]], i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day [[Budjak]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the [[Prut]] to the west, and the lower [[River Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the south.

After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of [[Decebalus]] in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province [[Moesia Inferior]], but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. [[Lower Trajan Wall]]) to defend the [[Scythia Minor]] province against invasions. Except for the [[Black Sea]] shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians [[Free Dacians]].<ref>Mihai B\u0103rbulescu, Dennis Diletant, Keith Hitchins, \u0218erban Papacostea, Pompiliu Teodor, \"Istoria Rom\u00e2niei\", Corint, Bucharest, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-135-031-8}}, pag. 77</ref> The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\nIn 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the [[Roman Dacia]], due to the invading [[Goths]] and Carpi. The [[Goths]], a Germanic tribe, poured into the [[Roman Empire]] from the lower [[Dniepr River]], through the southern part of Bessarabia ([[Budjak|Budjak steppe]]), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly [[steppe]]), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the [[Huns]].\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Main article|Moldavia in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}\n\n[[File:Tara Rumaneasca map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|According to one theory, the region's name originated from the Wallachian rule during the late 14th century (1390 map).]]\n\nFrom the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Mongols]]. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the ''\"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\"'' of Europe, or Age of migrations.\n\nIn 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler [[Mesamer]]. Following the Avars, Slavs started to arrive in the region and establish settlements. Then, in 582, [[Onogurs|Onogur]] Bulgars settled in southeastern Bessarabia and northern [[Dobruja]], from which they moved to Moesia Inferior (allegedly under pressure from the [[Khazars]]), and formed the nascent region of ''Bulgaria''. With the rise of the Khazars' state in the east, the invasions began to diminish and it was possible to create larger states. According to some opinions, the southern part of Bessarabia remained under the influence of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] until to the end of the 9th century.\n\nBetween the 8th and 10th centuries, the southern part of Bessarabia was inhabited by people from the [[Balkan-Danubian culture]]<ref>\u0427\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0413.\u0424. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u043a \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 VIII-\u0425 \u0432\u0432. \u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e-\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c\u044f//\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0438, \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0432, 1969, \u0441. 224\u2013230</ref> (the culture of the First Bulgarian Empire). Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bessarabia is mentioned in Slav chronicles as part of ''Bolohoveni'' (north) and ''[[Brodnici]]'' (south) voivodeships, believed{{by whom|date=February 2012}} to be [[Vlach]] principalities of the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe last large scale invasions were those of the [[Mongols]] of 1241, 1290, and 1343. Sehr al-Jedid (near [[Orhei]]), an important settlement of the [[Golden Horde]], dates from this period. They led to a retreat of a big part of the population to the mountainous areas in [[Eastern Carpathians]] and to [[Transylvania]]. The population east of Prut became especially low at the time of the Tatar invasions.\n\nIn the Late Middle Age, chronicles mention a [[Tigheci]] \"republic\", predating the establishment of the [[Principality of Moldavia]], situated near the modern town of [[Cahul]] in the southwest of Bessarabia, preserving its autonomy even during the later Principality even into the 18th century. [[Republic of Genoa|Genovese]] merchants rebuilt or established a number of forts along Dniester (notably [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Moncastro]]) and Danube (including [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kyliya/Chilia]]-[[Chilia Veche|Licostomo]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n=== Principality of Moldavia ===\n{{Main article|History of Moldavia}}\n[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|Most of Bessarabia was for centuries part of the principality of Moldavia (1800 map).]]\n\nAfter the 1360s the region was gradually included in the [[principality]] of [[Moldavia]], which by 1392 established control over the fortresses of [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]] and [[Kilia, Ukraine|Chilia]], its eastern border becoming the [[Dniester|River Dniester]]. Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of [[Wallachia]] (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called [[House of Basarab|Basarab]]). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles), while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity. Many of these battlefields and churches, as well as old fortresses, are situated in Bessarabia (mainly along Dniester).\n\n[[File:\u0410\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0446\u044f \u0432 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434-\u0414\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044311.jpg|thumb|Akkerman fortress in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]], [[Ukraine]]) was one of the many important castles in Bessarabia.]]\n\nIn 1484, the Turks invaded and captured Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103 (Akkerman in Turkish), and annexed the shoreline southern part of Bessarabia, which was then divided into two [[sanjak]]s (districts) of the Ottoman Empire. In 1538, the Ottomans annexed more Bessarabian land in the south as far as [[Tighina]], while the central and northern Bessarabia remained part of the Principality of Moldavia (which became a [[vassal]] of the Ottoman Empire).

[[Northern Dobruja]] was awarded to Romania for its role in the 1877\u201378 Russo-Turkish War, and as compensation for the transfer of the Southern Bessarabia.\n\n====Early 20th century====\n[[File:Unification of Romania & Bessarabia.jpg|thumb|upright|Declaration of unification of [[Romania]] and Bessarabia]]\n\nThe [[Kishinev pogrom]] took place in the capital of Bessarabia on April 6, 1903 after local newspapers published articles inciting the public to act against [[Jew]]s; 47 or 49 Jews were killed, 92 severely wounded and 700 houses destroyed. The [[anti-Semitic]] newspaper \u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446 (Bessarabetz, meaning \"Bessarabian\"), published by Pavel Krushevan, insinuated that a Russian boy was killed by local Jews. Another newspaper, \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442 (Lat. Svet, meaning \"World\"), used the age-old [[blood libel]] against the Jews (alleging that the boy had been killed to use his blood in preparation of [[matzo]]s).\n\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Russian Revolution]], a Romanian nationalist movement started to develop in Bessarabia. In the chaos brought by the [[October Revolution|Russian revolution of October 1917]], a National Council ([[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]]) was established in Bessarabia, with 120 members elected from Bessarabia by some political and professional organizations and 10 elected from [[Transnistria]] (the left bank of Dniester where [[Moldovans]] and [[Romanians]] accounted for less than a third and the majority of the population was [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]].

On 16 January, the Romanian Army began a full-scale invasion of Bessarabia; following several skirmishes with Moldavian and Bolshevik troops, the occupation of the whole region was completed in early March.\n\nWith Romanian troops holding Chi\u0219in\u0103u, on January 24, 1918, [[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]] declared Bessarabia's independence as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]].\n\n=== Unification with Romania ===\n{{Main article|Union of Bessarabia with Romania}}\n\nThe county councils of [[B\u0103l\u021bi]], [[Soroca]] and [[Orhei]] were the earliest to ask for unification with the Kingdom of Romania, and on April 9 [O.S.

After the victory of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] in the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Ukrainian SSR]] was created in 1922, and in 1924 the [[Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established on a strip of Ukrainian land on the west bank of Dniester where Moldovans and Romanians accounted for less than a third and the relative majority of population was [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]. (See [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic#Demographics|Demographics of Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]).\n\nAccording to Vladimir Solonar and Vladimir Bruter, Bessarabia under Romanian rule experienced low population growth due to high mortality (one of the highest in Europe) as well as emigration; Bessarabia was also characterized by economic stagnation and high unemployment.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Shlapentokh |editor1-first=Vladimir |editor2-last=Sendich |editor2-first=Munir |editor3-last=Payin |editor3-first=Emil |title=The New Russian diaspora : Russian Minorities in the former Soviet Republics |chapter=Russians in Moldova |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |orig-year=1st pub.

As a consequence, even Bessarabian entrepreneurs preferred to invest their capital in those areas instead of using it within the region. Local industry faced fierce competition from larger Romanian companies, which had access to preferential rail tariffs, limited credit to local entrepreneurs and flooded the local market with cheaper industrial goods produced in Romania or imported from abroad. Nevertheless, some new small-scale industrial enterprises were established in the 1920s, using primarily local raw materials and producing for the local market. The total engine power rose from 7.8 thousand [[Horsepower|hp]] in 1925 to 12.2 thousand in 1929. Nevertheless, many of the enterprises did not survive for long, and the [[Great Depression]] had particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929-1933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the ''[[Old Kingdom]]'' again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increase in transport tariffs and customs restrictions and special tax policies. Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials, and a market for the cheaper industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-depression levels. Even so, most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly bellow their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]] railway workshops, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u textile and knitwear factories, and the [[Flore\u0219ti, Moldova|Flore\u0219ti]] workshops were dismantled and relocated to the ''Old Kingdom'' during 1935-1938. Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27%. Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs, while most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7%, during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in [[Gala\u021bi]], 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Ia\u0219i. In a 1938 review, the Bessarabian Federation of Chambers of Commerce noted that \"the decline in industrial production in Bessarabia hinders the rational processing of local raw materials, thereby turning our province into a colony for industry in the rest of the country\". Throughout the period, industrial workers in the region faced long working hours (up to fourteen per day), lack proper safety precaution, unsanitary conditions, the perspective of unemployment and general decrease in the standard of living: the real wage of a Chi\u0219in\u0103u worker dropped 60% between 1913 and 1937.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsaranov |first1=V.

Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now [[Budjak]] and parts of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]]) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present [[Transnistria]]), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nBetween September and November 1940, the [[Bessarabia Germans|ethnic Germans of Bessarabia]] were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.\n\nOn June 22, 1941 the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops with the help of [[Wehrmacht]] recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Soviets employed [[scorched earth]] tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control.\n\nAs the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops \"taking revenge\" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of [[pogrom]]s on civilians and murder of Jewish [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], operating in the area of the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 11th Army]], committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Communism|Communists]], or under no pretext whatsoever.\n\nThe political solution of the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" was apparently seen by the Romanian [[dictator]] Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into [[ghettos]] or [[Nazi concentration camps]], and then deported during 1941\u20131942 in [[death march]]es into [[Transnistria (World War II)|Romanian-occupied Transnistria]], where the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was applied.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/499496/Constructing_Interethnic_Conflict_and_Cooperation_Why_Some_People_Harmed_Jews_and_Others_Helped_Them_during_the_Holocaust_in_Romania|title=Constructing Interethnic Conflict and Cooperation: Why Some People Harmed Jews and Others Helped Them during the Holocaust in Romania Diana Dumitru|journal=World Politics |date=January 2011 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201342 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |doi=10.1017/s0043887110000274}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the [[Dniester]].

The Soviet armies overran Bessarabia in a two-pronged offensive within five days. In pocket battles at [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] and [[Sarata, Odessa|S\u0103rata]] the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] of c. 650,000 men, newly reformed after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], was obliterated.

About two thirds of Bessarabia lies within modern-day [[Moldova]], with the Ukrainian [[Budjak]] region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] covering a small area in the north.\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]], and the ensuing [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], the eastern parts of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[vassal state|vassal]], along with some areas formerly under direct Ottoman rule, were ceded to [[Imperial Russia]]. The acquisition was among the Empire's last territorial acquisitions in Europe. The newly acquired territories were organised as the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Governorate of Bessarabia]], adopting a name previously used for the southern plains, between the Dniester and the [[Danube]] rivers. Following the [[Crimean War]], in 1856, the southern areas of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavian rule; Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878, when [[United Principalities|Romania]], the result of Moldavia's union with [[Wallachia]], was pressured into exchanging those territories for the [[Dobruja]].\n\nIn 1917, in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the area constituted itself as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], an autonomous republic part of a proposed [[Russian Democratic Federative Republic|federative Russian state]]. [[Bolshevik]] agitation in late 1917 and early 1918 resulted in the intervention of the [[Romanian Army]], ostensibly to pacify the region. Soon after, the parliamentary assembly declared independence, and then [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with the Kingdom of Romania]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Charles Upson |title=Bessarabia |url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/meta_pag.shtml |publisher=Dodd, Mead |location=New York City |year=1927}}</ref> The legality of these acts was however disputed, most prominently by the [[Soviet Union]], which regarded the area as a territory occupied by Romania.\n\nIn 1940, after securing the assent of Nazi Germany through the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union pressured Romania, under threat of war,<ref name=\"Rothschild77\">Joseph Rothschild, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytc-muwFT_IC&pg=PA314 East Central Europe between the two World Wars]'' University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1977; {{ISBN|0-295953-57-8}}, p.314</ref> into withdrawing from Bessarabia, allowing the [[Red Army]] to [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annex the region]]. The area was formally integrated into the Soviet Union: the core joined parts of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to form the [[Moldavian SSR]], while territories inhabited by [[Slav]]ic majorities in the north and the south of Bessarabia were transferred to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-aligned Romania recaptured the region in 1941 with the success of [[Operation M\u00fcnchen]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], but lost it in 1944 as the tide of war changed. In 1947, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut was internationally recognised by the Paris Treaty that ended [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the process of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Moldavian and Ukrainian SSRs proclaimed their independence in 1991, becoming the modern states of [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]], while preserving the existing partition of Bessarabia. Following a short war in the early 1990s, the [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]] was proclaimed in the [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]], extending its authority also over the municipality of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] on the right bank of Dniester river. Part of the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]]-inhabited areas in the southern Bessarabia was organised in 1994 as an [[Gagauzia|autonomous region]] within Moldova.\n\n== Etymology and usage of the name ==\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map of Bessarabia within Moldavia through time]]\n\nAccording to the traditional explanation, the name Bessarabia (''Basarabia'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) derives from the [[Wallachia]]n [[Basarab dynasty]], who allegedly ruled over the southern part of the area in the 14th century. Some scholars question this, however, claiming that:\n* the name was initially an [[exonym]] applied by [[Western Europe|Western]] cartographers\n* it was first used in local sources only in the late 17th century;\n* the idea that it referred to Moldavian regions near the [[Black Sea]] was explicitly rejected as a cartographic confusion by the early Moldavian chronicler [[Miron Costin]], and;\n* the confusion may have been caused by medieval Western cartographers, misinterpreting  contemporaneous Polish  references to Wallachia as ''Bessarabia'', as referring to a separate land between Wallachia and Moldavia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coman| first=Marian|title=Basarabia \u2013 Inventarea cartografic\u0103 a unei regiuni|journal=Studii \u0219i Materiale de Istorie Medie| volume=XXIX| pages=183\u2013215|year=2011| publisher= [[Institutul de Istorie Nicolae Iorga]]| issn=1222-4766}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the name Bessarabia originally applied only to the part of the territory south of the [[Upper Trajan Wall|Upper Trajanic Wall]], i.e. an area only slightly bigger than present-day [[Budjak]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bounded by the Dniester to the north and east, the [[Prut]] to the west, and the lower [[River Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the south.

It is very fertile and has [[lignite]] deposits and stone quarries. People living in the area grow [[sugar beet]], [[sunflower]], [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[tobacco]], [[wine grapes]], and [[fruit]]. They raise [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]. The main industry in the region is agricultural processing.\n\nThe main cities are [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] (former capital of Bessarabia Governorate, now capital of Moldova), and [[Izmail]] and [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovs'kyi]] (historically called Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Akkerman; both now within Ukraine).

Afterwards, this territory was directly or indirectly, partly or wholly controlled by: the [[Ottoman Empire]] (as suzerain of Moldavia, with direct rule only in Budjak and [[Khotin]]), [[Russian Empire]], [[Romania]], the [[USSR]]. Since 1991, most of the territory forms the core of [[Moldova]], with smaller parts in [[Ukraine]].\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main article|Prehistory of Moldavia|Bronze Age in Romania}}\n\nThe territory of Bessarabia has been inhabited by people for thousands of years.

[[Celts]] also settled in the southern parts of Bessarabia, their main city being Aliobrix.\n\nThe first polity that is believed to have included the whole of Bessarabia was the [[Dacia]]n polity of [[Burebista]] in the 1st century BC. After his death, the polity was divided into smaller pieces, and the central parts were unified in the Dacian kingdom of [[Decebalus]] in the 1st century AD. This kingdom was defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106. Southern Bessarabia was included in the empire even before that, in 57 AD, as part of the Roman province [[Moesia Inferior]], but it was secured only when the Dacian Kingdom was defeated in 106. The Romans built defensive earthen walls in Southern Bessarabia (e.g. [[Lower Trajan Wall]]) to defend the [[Scythia Minor]] province against invasions. Except for the [[Black Sea]] shore in the south, Bessarabia remained outside direct Roman control; the myriad of tribes there are called by modern historians [[Free Dacians]].<ref>Mihai B\u0103rbulescu, Dennis Diletant, Keith Hitchins, \u0218erban Papacostea, Pompiliu Teodor, \"Istoria Rom\u00e2niei\", Corint, Bucharest, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-135-031-8}}, pag. 77</ref> The 2nd to the 5th centuries also saw the development of the [[Chernyakhov culture]].\n\nIn 270, the Roman authorities began to withdraw their forces south of the Danube, especially from the [[Roman Dacia]], due to the invading [[Goths]] and Carpi. The [[Goths]], a Germanic tribe, poured into the [[Roman Empire]] from the lower [[Dniepr River]], through the southern part of Bessarabia ([[Budjak|Budjak steppe]]), which due to its geographic position and characteristics (mainly [[steppe]]), was swept by various nomadic tribes for many centuries. In 378, the area was overrun by the [[Huns]].\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Main article|Moldavia in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}\n\n[[File:Tara Rumaneasca map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|According to one theory, the region's name originated from the Wallachian rule during the late 14th century (1390 map).]]\n\nFrom the 3rd century until the 11th century, the region was invaded numerous times in turn by different tribes: [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Mongols]]. The territory of Bessarabia was encompassed in dozens of ephemeral kingdoms which were disbanded when another wave of migrants arrived. Those centuries were characterized by a terrible state of insecurity and mass movement of these tribes. The period was later known as the ''\"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\"'' of Europe, or Age of migrations.\n\nIn 561, the Avars captured Bessarabia and executed the local ruler [[Mesamer]]. Following the Avars, Slavs started to arrive in the region and establish settlements. Then, in 582, [[Onogurs|Onogur]] Bulgars settled in southeastern Bessarabia and northern [[Dobruja]], from which they moved to Moesia Inferior (allegedly under pressure from the [[Khazars]]), and formed the nascent region of ''Bulgaria''. With the rise of the Khazars' state in the east, the invasions began to diminish and it was possible to create larger states. According to some opinions, the southern part of Bessarabia remained under the influence of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] until to the end of the 9th century.\n\nBetween the 8th and 10th centuries, the southern part of Bessarabia was inhabited by people from the [[Balkan-Danubian culture]]<ref>\u0427\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0413.\u0424. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u043a \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 VIII-\u0425 \u0432\u0432. \u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e-\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c\u044f//\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0438, \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0432, 1969, \u0441. 224\u2013230</ref> (the culture of the First Bulgarian Empire). Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bessarabia is mentioned in Slav chronicles as part of ''Bolohoveni'' (north) and ''[[Brodnici]]'' (south) voivodeships, believed{{by whom|date=February 2012}} to be [[Vlach]] principalities of the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe last large scale invasions were those of the [[Mongols]] of 1241, 1290, and 1343. Sehr al-Jedid (near [[Orhei]]), an important settlement of the [[Golden Horde]], dates from this period. They led to a retreat of a big part of the population to the mountainous areas in [[Eastern Carpathians]] and to [[Transylvania]]. The population east of Prut became especially low at the time of the Tatar invasions.\n\nIn the Late Middle Age, chronicles mention a [[Tigheci]] \"republic\", predating the establishment of the [[Principality of Moldavia]], situated near the modern town of [[Cahul]] in the southwest of Bessarabia, preserving its autonomy even during the later Principality even into the 18th century. [[Republic of Genoa|Genovese]] merchants rebuilt or established a number of forts along Dniester (notably [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Moncastro]]) and Danube (including [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kyliya/Chilia]]-[[Chilia Veche|Licostomo]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n=== Principality of Moldavia ===\n{{Main article|History of Moldavia}}\n[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|Most of Bessarabia was for centuries part of the principality of Moldavia (1800 map).]]\n\nAfter the 1360s the region was gradually included in the [[principality]] of [[Moldavia]], which by 1392 established control over the fortresses of [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]] and [[Kilia, Ukraine|Chilia]], its eastern border becoming the [[Dniester|River Dniester]]. Based on the name of the region, some authors consider that in the latter part of the 14th century the southern part of the region was under the rule of [[Wallachia]] (the ruling dynasty of Wallachia during that period was called [[House of Basarab|Basarab]]). In the 15th century, the entire region was a part of the principality of Moldavia. [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ruled between 1457 and 1504, a period of nearly 50 years during which he won 32 battles defending his country against virtually all his neighbours (mainly the Ottomans and the Tatars, but also the Hungarians and the Poles), while losing only two. During this period, after each victory, he raised a monastery or a church close to the battlefield honoring Christianity. Many of these battlefields and churches, as well as old fortresses, are situated in Bessarabia (mainly along Dniester).\n\n[[File:\u0410\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0446\u044f \u0432 \u0411\u0456\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434-\u0414\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044311.jpg|thumb|Akkerman fortress in [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]], [[Ukraine]]) was one of the many important castles in Bessarabia.]]\n\nIn 1484, the Turks invaded and captured Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103 (Akkerman in Turkish), and annexed the shoreline southern part of Bessarabia, which was then divided into two [[sanjak]]s (districts) of the Ottoman Empire.

As a consequence, even Bessarabian entrepreneurs preferred to invest their capital in those areas instead of using within the region. Local industry faced fierce competition from larger Romanian companies, which had access to preferential rail tariffs, limited credit to local entrepreneurs and flooded the local market with cheaper industrial goods produced in Romania or imported from abroad. Nevertheless, some new small-scale industrial enterprises were established in the 1920s, using primarily local raw materials and producing for the local market. The total engine power rose from 7.8 thousand [[Horsepower|hp]] in 1925 to 12.2 thousand in 1929. Nevertheless, many of the enterprises did not survive for long, and the [[Great Depression]] had particularly strong impact on the region, many of the companies going bankrupt or closing in 1929-1933. Governmental policy, influenced by the banking system and the industrial cartels, prevented a rebound, the industry of the ''[[Old Kingdom]]'' again receiving preferential treatment. The main factors that affected the development of Bessarabia in the 1930s were severe credit restrictions, increase in transport tariffs and customs restrictions and special tax policies. Bessarabia was reduced mostly to a supplier of raw materials, and a market for the cheaper industrial goods of Romanian or foreign origin. By the end of the 1930s, the only industrial sectors that managed to rebound were the food and woodworking industries, the rest witnessing either stagnation or a decrease compared to pre-depression levels. Even so, most industrial facilities in the food industry worked significantly bellow their installed capacity even in prosperous years such as 1937. Several large factories, such as the [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]] railway workshops, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u textile and knitwear factories, and the [[Flore\u0219ti, Moldova|Flore\u0219ti]] workshops were dismantled and relocated to the ''Old Kingdom'' during 1935-1938. Between 1929 and 1937, fixed capital in the industry dropped by 10%, and the number of industrial workers in Bessarabia dropped from 5,400 in 1925 to 3,500 in 1937, while their overall number in Romania had increased by almost 27%. Between 1926 and 1937 the share of the food industry in the total production of large manufacturing industries increased from 77.1% to 92.4%, with sharp decreases observed in sectors with higher added value, such as the metalworking, textile and leather processing industries. Even so, the food industry failed to fulfill local needs, while most industries heavily relied on manual labor and primitive technologies. Electricity production in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia's center and Romania's second largest city, recorded in 1925 at 4.47 million kWh, only increased by 6.7%, during the following decade, lagging far behind other Romanian cities: 572.3% in [[Gala\u021bi]], 238.2% in Bucharest, and over 101% in Ia\u0219i. In a 1938 review, the Bessarabian Federation of Chambers of Commerce noted that \"the decline in industrial production in Bessarabia hinders the rational processing of local raw materials, thereby turning our province into a colony for industry in the rest of the country\". Throughout the period, industrial workers in the region faced long working hours (up to fourteen per day), lack proper safety precaution, unsanitary conditions, the perspective of unemployment and general decrease in the standard of living: the real wage of a Chi\u0219in\u0103u worker dropped 60% between 1913 and 1937.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsaranov |first1=V.

Bessarabia was divided between the Moldavian SSR (65% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (now [[Budjak]] and parts of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]]) were allotted to Ukraine, while some territories (4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on the left (eastern) bank of Dniester (present [[Transnistria]]), previously part of Ukraine, were allotted to Moldavia. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians, who were accused of supporting the deposed Romanian administration, were executed or deported to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].\n\nBetween September and November 1940, the [[Bessarabia Germans|ethnic Germans of Bessarabia]] were offered resettlement to Germany, following a German-Soviet agreement. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories.\n\nOn June 22, 1941 the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Between June 22 and July 26, 1941, Romanian troops with the help of [[Wehrmacht]] recovered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. The Soviets employed [[scorched earth]] tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was once again under Romanian control.\n\nAs the military operation was still in progress, there were cases of Romanian troops \"taking revenge\" on Jews in Bessarabia, in the form of [[pogrom]]s on civilians and murder of Jewish [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], resulting in several thousand dead. The supposed cause for murdering Jews was that in 1940 some Jews welcomed the Soviet takeover as liberation. At the same time the notorious [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], operating in the area of the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 11th Army]], committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Communism|Communists]], or under no pretext whatsoever.\n\nThe political solution of the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" was apparently seen by the Romanian [[dictator]] Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] more in expulsion rather than extermination. That portion of the Jewish population of Bessarabia and Bukovina which did not flee before the retreat of the Soviet troops (147,000) was initially gathered into [[ghettos]] or [[Nazi concentration camps]], and then deported during 1941\u20131942 in [[death march]]es into [[Transnistria (World War II)|Romanian-occupied Transnistria]], where the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was applied.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/499496/Constructing_Interethnic_Conflict_and_Cooperation_Why_Some_People_Harmed_Jews_and_Others_Helped_Them_during_the_Holocaust_in_Romania|title=Constructing Interethnic Conflict and Cooperation: Why Some People Harmed Jews and Others Helped Them during the Holocaust in Romania Diana Dumitru|journal=World Politics |date=January 2011 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201342 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |doi=10.1017/s0043887110000274}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of relative peace, the German-Soviet front returned in 1944 to the land border on the [[Dniester]].

On August 23, 1944, Marshal Ion Antonescu was arrested by King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]], and later handed over to the Soviets.\n\n=== Part of the Soviet Union ===\n{{Main article|Moldovan SSR}}\n\n[[File:Soviet Union - Moldavian SSR.svg|250px|thumb|Moldavian SSR (in red) as part of the [[Soviet Union]] (yellow)]]\nThe Soviet Union regained the region in 1944, and the Red Army occupied Romania. By 1947, the Soviets had imposed a [[Communist Romania|communist government]] in Bucharest, which was friendly and obedient towards Moscow. The [[Soviet occupation of Romania]] lasted until 1958.  The Romanian communist regime did not openly raise the matter of Bessarabia or Northern Bukovina in its diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. At least 100,000 people died in a post-war famine in Moldavia.\n\nBetween 1969  and 1971, a clandestine National Patriotic Front was established by several young intellectuals in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, totaling over 100 members, vowing to fight for the establishment of a Moldavian Democratic Republic, its secession from the Soviet Union and union with Romania.\n\nIn December 1971, following an informative note from [[Ion Stanescu|Ion St\u0103nescu]], the President of the Council of State Security of the Romanian Socialist Republic, to [[Yuri Andropov]], the chief of KGB, three of the leaders of the [[National Patriotic Front (Moldova)|National Patriotic Front]], [[Alexandru Usatiuc-Bulgar]], [[Gheorghe Ghimpu]] and [[Valeriu Graur]], as well as a fourth person, [[Alexandru Soltoianu]], the leader of a similar clandestine movement in northern [[Bukovina]] (Bucovina), were arrested and later sentenced to long prison terms.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4921186/Political_Repressions_in_the_Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_after_1956_Towards_a_Typology_Based_on_KGB_files |title=Political Repressions in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic after 1956: Towards a Typology Based on KGB files Igor Casu |journal=Dystopia |volume=I |issue=1\u20132 |year=2014 |pages= 89\u2013127 |accessdate=2014-10-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise of independent Moldova ===\n{{Main article|Moldovan SSR|Moldova|History of Moldova}}\n\nWith the weakening of the Soviet Union, in February 1988, the first non-sanctioned demonstrations were held in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]. At first pro-[[Perestroika]], they soon turned anti-government and demanded official status for the Romanian (Moldavian) language instead of the Russian language.  On August 31, 1989, following a 600,000-strong demonstration in Chi\u0219in\u0103u four days earlier, Romanian (Moldavian) became the official language of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, this was not implemented for many years.  In 1990, the first free elections were held for Parliament, with the opposition [[Popular Front of Moldova|Popular Front]] winning them. A government led by [[Mircea Druc]], one of the leaders of the Popular Front, was formed. The Moldavian SSR became SSR Moldova, and later the Republic of Moldova.  The [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] became independent on August 31, 1991; it took over unchanged the boundaries of the Moldavian SSR.\n\n== Population ==\nAccording to Bessarabian historian [[\u0218tefan Ciobanu]] and Moldovan philologist Viorica R\u0103ileanu, in '''1810''' the percentage of the Romanian (Moldavian) population was approximately 95%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ciobanu|first=\u0218tefan|title=Cultura rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 \u00een Basarabia sub st\u0103p\u00e2nirea rus\u0103|year=1923|publisher=Editura Asocia\u021biei Uniunea Cultural\u0103 Bisericeasc\u0103|location=Chi\u0219in\u0103u|page=20}}</ref><ref>[http://www.upm.ro/cci12/volCCI_II/Pages%20from%20Volum_texteCCI2-134.pdf The Memory of (Im)Proper Names from Basarabia]</ref> During the 19th century, as a result of the Russian policy of colonization and [[Russification]],<ref name=\"Mitrasca2007\">{{cite book|author=Marcel Mitrasca|title=Moldova: A Romanian Province Under Russian Rule : Diplomatic History from the Archives of the Great Powers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nYrAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA20|year=2007|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-0-87586-184-5|pages=20\u2013}}</ref> the Romanian population decreased to (depending on data sources) 47.6% (in 1897), 52% or 75% for 1900 (Krusevan), 53.9% (1907), 70% (1912, Laskov), or 65\u201367% (1918, J.

The old [[Parish Priest]] of [[Lagonoy]], Fr. Salvador Mendoza, decided to build a church in a place called \"Cabayawasnan\" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. Unfortunately, the place was owned by Laurenciano Barcillano who refused to donate the land to the Church. However, through circumstances beyond his control, ownership was passed to the Church.\n\nThe construction of the church began in 1818 and there were only around thirty houses around the area. So, the priest sought the help of the people of Lagonoy. It was a cooperative effort of the people of [[Lagonoy]] who worked on the northern part and the people of Danlog on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism.\n\nIn 1813, the town of San Jose was officially established under the name \"Patrocinio\" derived from the word \"Patron\", meaning model. Then it was changed to Patrocinio de San Jose in honor of its Patron Saint, San Jose de Patriarca. Later in 1883, it was shortened to \"San Jose\" which is now the official name. Its founders were Fr. Salvador Mendoza, then the Parish Priest of El Pueblo de Lagonoy and Don Macario Agustin, the first Capitan Municipal of the town.\n\nAfter the founding of the town, progress and development became eminent and this could be attributed to the cooperative efforts of the church and the state. In 1887, the foundations of the municipal building were laid when Venancio Obias was the Captain Municipal. His successors continued the work but the structure was completely destroyed by a very strong typhoon called \"Bagyong Ogis\", so named because the back of the trees were shredded of and trunks turned white in 1898. A big house owned by Capitan Gregorio Patrocinio was made the temporary \"tribunal.\"\n\nWhen the people of [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] decided to take up arms against the [[Spaniards]], Elias Angeles, then the leading \"Guard Civil\" of Naga convinced the people of San Jose to join the revolutionary movement. Ariston Prila, a \"cabeza de barangay\" from barangay [[Kinalansan]] heeded the call.\n\nIn the early part of 1903, when the Americans reached the town, there were a handful of revolutionaries led by Jose Valencia and Nicomedes Mata but they fled when they realized that their resistance was futile. The American Government was easily established and continued its pacification campaign while pursuing its goal of effecting changes in various aspects of the lives of the people.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Japanese soldiers reached the town in the latest of 1942. Most of the people had evacuated to the far-flung barangays and up to the mountains of Goa and Lagonoy while some joined the [[guerilla]] movement. Filipino-Japanese government continued with an appointed Mayor. [[Filipinos|Filipino]] volunteers manned the defense of the town hall which served as garrison while the Japanese Imperial Forces had Goa for its headquarters. Schools were ordered opened by the authorities to allay fears and to give confidence of the people.\n\nWith the end of the [[Pacific War]] and the celebration of Independence in 1946, the people slowly rehabilitated their lives from the ravages of the war and returned to their usual milieu with renewed vigor.\n\nMay 19 marks the annual celebration of the feast day of San Jose, the town's patron saint.\n\n==Geography==\nSan Jose has a total land area of 4,702.8146 hectares and is bounded in north by [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]], south by [[Tigaon, Camarines Sur|Tigaon]], east by [[Lagonoy Gulf]], and west by [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]]. The whole town is roughly 0.27% of the region's 1.76 million hectares; 0.89% of the total land area of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 526.680 square kilometers; and 2.26% of the total land area of the 4th Congressional District of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 207,596.71 hectares.<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box|location = San Jose, Camarines Sur\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Mar high C = 30\n| Apr high C = 31\n| May high C = 32\n| Jun high C = 32\n| Jul high C = 31\n| Aug high C = 32\n| Sep high C = 31\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Dec high C = 29\n| Jan low C = 23\n| Feb low C = 23\n| Mar low C = 23\n| Apr low C = 24\n| May low C = 25\n| Jun low C = 25\n| Jul low C = 25\n| Aug low C = 25\n| Sep low C = 24\n| Oct low C = 24\n| Nov low C = 24\n| Dec low C = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 189.5\n| Jan rain days = 18\n| Feb precipitation mm = 169.4 \n| Feb rain days = 14\n| Mar precipitation mm = 133.1 \n| Mar rain days = 14\n| Apr precipitation mm = 119.4 \n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May precipitation mm = 134.2\n| May rain days = 13\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.2 \n| Jun rain days = 15\n| Jul precipitation mm = 200.5\n| Jul rain days = 17\n| Aug precipitation mm = 155 \n| Aug rain days = 14\n| Sep precipitation mm = 189 \n| Sep rain days = 16\n| Oct precipitation mm = 314.6 \n| Oct rain days = 22\n| Nov precipitation mm = 369.2 \n| Nov rain days = 23\n| Dec precipitation mm = 444 \n| Dec rain days = 24\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/san-jose-weather-averages/camarines-sur/PH.aspx\n| title = San Jose, Camarines Sur: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 6 December 2015}}</ref>\n| date=December 2015}}\n\nThe municipality belongs to Type II Climate<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> characterized by the absence of a dry season and very pronounced maximum rainfall from November to December. It is during these months that the Northeast monsoon season occurs and the [[cyclones|tropical cyclones]] contribute to the increased rainfall in the area. In January and February, the effect of these air masses on rainfall is considerably radical. In addition to the north-east monsoon during the months of February and March, the trail winds traveling from East to West do not give significant increase of rainfall. Likely, the month of May is the transition period between the monsoon that is prevalent from June to September. During the south-west monsoon season, the linear system called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITZ), brings the largest amount of rainfall to the area. In October, which is the transitive period between the south-west and north-east monsoons, the tropical cyclone brings considerable amount of rain.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe rainfall distribution in the municipality is greatly influenced by the air streams, tropical cyclones, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], shorelines, easterly waves and other rainfall-causing weather patterns.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The rainfall season occurs from June to December with high rainfall intensity of 285.06mm to 474.22m and less rainfall intensity of 245.30mm to 224.06m from January to the month May which at the same time is the onset of effective rainfall with 75% probability and it would terminate in February of the following year which consequently during this period the mountainous areas receive higher intensity of rainfall. But the trend of monthly rainfall is unimodal (having one peak) and the maximum rain period is from October to December. On the other hand, the monthly average rainfall varies from 125.86mm to 594.56mm with a mean annual rainfall of 298.54mm.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe winds are influenced by the monsoon and the Pacific Trade System with Northeast direction that occurs in November to February; Easterly winds during the months of March, April, May and October; Southwest winds in June to August; and Westerly winds in September.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe maximum [[temperature]] during the month of January reaches about 27.9[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] while 31.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in November. The minimum [[temperature]] from December to June reaches about 20.6&nbsp;\u00b0C to 24.5&nbsp;\u00b0C; and the average monthly [[temperature]] is recorded at 25.0&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 27.9&nbsp;\u00b0C in June.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n[[Relative humidity]] is indicative of the amount of [[water vapor]] present in the [[atmosphere]]. [[Humidity]] in the [[Philippines]] as in the municipality of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is high because of the warm moist air streams flowing over the [[archipelago]], the surrounding seas, rich vegetation and abundant rainfall. The lowest average [[humidity|relative humidity]] occurs in May with 85.9%; highest in February with 93.4%; and the annual average [[humidity]] is 90% which is higher than the regional and national average of 82%.\n\n====Typhoon and storm surges====\n\nThe [[cyclone|tropical cyclone]] is a climatic control that contributes largely to the rainfall from June to December.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> It was shown to usually cause maximum values of rainfall and winds as exemplified by the highest wind speed of 77 miles per second as recorded in [[Virac, Catanduanes]] areas during the height of [[Typhoon Joan (1970)|Typhoon Sening]] in 1970.\n\nThe tropical cyclones are internationally classified with these depending on their maximum wind speed or peak wind velocities (V) as follows:\n* Tropical Depression, V<33 knots (63&nbsp;km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 33 knots < V < 47 k (87&nbsp;km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 47 knots < u < 63 knots (116&nbsp;km/h)\n* Typhoon, u > 63 knots (116&nbsp;km/h)\n\nThe cyclones affecting the Philippine islands<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> originate from the [[Pacific Ocean]] East of the Islands between latitude 8 degrees North, 10 degrees South, traveling on a Westerly or Northwesterly course over the country. It has the highest sustained wind [[velocity]] of 6 knots in November to April and lowest sustained wind velocity of 4 knots in September. Note that the average cyclone that passes over mainland [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] which include San Jose town is 3 cyclones for every 2 years.<ref>Research Study by PAGASA (1948-1982)</ref>\n\n===Topography===\nThe terrain of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is characterized as level to gently rolling and sloping. About 91.96% is characterized as having a generally flat terrain with a slope 0-3% which is described to be level to nearly level. It practically covers the entire land area of the town except barangay [[Adiangao]] which is located along the mountain range of [[Caramoan Peninsula]] which has an undulating to rolling terrain with 8.04% portions of steep slopes.\n\nThe elevation of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is roughly 92.55% low to very low with a mean elevation from 0\u2013100 meters above sea level. Hence, low elevation is about 5.72% ranging from 100\u2013300 meters above sea level as well as 1.73% with moderately high elevation ranging from 300\u2013500 meters above sea level.\n\n===Geology===\nThe major part of the municipal area is composed of Alluvium River Terraces<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\">{{cite journal|last1=LGU San Jose|first1=MPDC|title=Brief  Profile of the Municipality of San Jose,  Camarines Sur|date=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is particularly described as ''fluvicatile lacustrine alluvium'' composed of unsorted loosely consolidated pebbles, gravel, silt, coral debris and clay that can be found in flooded plains, riverbanks, sand bars, beaches, and tidal flats. It is notable that river terraces along the [[Lagonoy]] River and its tributaries which include also the Rangas River that practically originating from the foot of the [[Mount Isarog]] account for about 90.69% or 4,264.9826 hectares of the total land area of the municipality while the rest is of igneous and metamorphic rock origin of which volcanoclast alluvial fans cover about 0.19% or 8.94 hectares. These are specifically found in barangays [[Catalotoan]] and [[Salogon]]. Note that volcanoclast is a thick and extensive pyroclastic material consists of ashes, cinder lapili, tuff agromerate and volcanic debris while alluvial fans consists only of worked pyroclastics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Geological Table\n|-\n!

It is characterized as highly fractured and folded complex consisting of quartzite, quartzatedspathit and mica schists that cover roughly 5.26% or 247.37 hectares. Meanwhile, the lower part of the place is composed of sedimentary rocks known as crystalline limestone which covers about 3.86% or 181.53 hectares. Crystalline limestone is an extensive transgressive rectal carbonated facies including wall preserved bushes of corals, megafossils and algae structure, detritae to fuffacious limestone showing well developed karst landforms or formation that can be found prevalent in the [[Caramoan Peninsula]].<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/>\n\n===Landforms===\nThe many landforms<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> found in the municipality have been the natural production of the different geographical pressures of the different structural land forms such as alluvial lowland, alluvial fans, sedimentary plateau or masses of residual slopes and thick sedimentary landscapes. Most of its territorial areas are best characterized by broad alluvial plans described as level to nearly level, and moderately well-drained terraces. The level to undulating plains are the product of paludal environment or deltaic plains which are usually being flooded during slight and heavy downpours.\n\nOn the other hand, Barangay [[Adiangao]] is characterized by Shale/Sandstone Hills (SSH)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is described to be undulating to rolling, slightly to moderately dissected, and moistly top-rounded hills, both are low and high relief. Likewise, steep slopes are dissected closely with each other particularly those with greater than 18<sup>o</sup> inclinations. Meanwhile, V-shaped valleys are noted to have been composed and dominated by sandstone. Likewise, landforms in barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], part of [[Minoro]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]] and [[Tagas]] are noted to be flat with very poorly drained terrains and oftentimes affected by floods caused by high tides. The coastal plains are most commonly swarmed with mangroves, nipa plants, break rides, swales and tidal flats.\n\n====Major Types of Land Management Units====\nThe municipality is composed of 5 major types of Land Management Units (LMUs)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which are classified into 2 forms, namely: Warm Lowland and Warm Cool Hillyland. They are enumerated and explained below.\n\nWarm Lowland:\n* Tidal Flats (LMU 02) is very deep, fine loamy dark grayish brown but sometimes coarse loamy grayish soil, medium acid to mildly alkaline reaction, low available P and CaMg but adequate with O.M., constant extractable KBSP and CEC; generally moderate fertility level, very low infiltration and moderate to slow permeability rate, submerged and very poorly drained.\n* Beach Ridges and Swales (LMU 03) is shallow to moderately deep, very dark brown, coarse, and loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; slightly acid to mutual moderate CaMg and CEC; available highly extractable K acid; BSP generally moderate fertility level; rapid to very rapid infiltration and rapid to moderate rapid permeability rate, and excessively drained.\n* Estuarin Plain (LMU 04) is deep to very deep clay, predominantly very dark brown, yellowish brown, coarse, loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; medium acid to neutral soil reaction; moderate exchangeable K, high O.M. content, available P, BSP and CEC; generally high fertility level; slow to very slow infiltration and rapid to moderately rapid permeability rate, and moderately well to poorly drained.\n* Broad Plain (LMU 09) is moderately deep and sometimes shallow predominantly brown fine, loamy and sometimes coarse, loamy sub-soil underlain by coarse loamy skeletal stratum; strong acid to slightly acid, moderately available P, extractable K and Ca/Mg; adequate O.M. content CEC and BSP, moderate general fertility level; very slow to very rapid permeability rate, poorly to well drained, none to moderate flooding.\n\nWarm Cool Hillyland:\n* Shale/Sandstones Hills (LMU 70) is moderately shallow to very deep, predominantly dark, yellowish brown, and strong fine loamy and sometimes clayey subsoil underlain by skeletal substratum; medium soil to mildly alkaline reaction, low O.M. content and available P, high extractable K, Ca/Mg, BS and CEC generally moderate fertility level, slow to moderate permeability, moderate to well drained.\n\n===Soil classifications===\nThe soil map reveals that the municipality is composed of 9 soil types, namely:\n* [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] Sandy clay loan and sandy loam\n* [[Minoro]] Loam\n* Venagre Clay loam and sandy loam\n* Huyon-huyon Sandy loam\n* [[Kinalansan]] Silty clay loam and Clay\n* Magsaysay Sandy Loam\n* San Miguel Silty Loam\n* Porous rocks & clay load\n* Sandy soil\n\nIt is also noted that the soil composition of the low-lying areas is rich loamy characterized as broad alluvial plains. However, the inherent soil fertility is generally moderate because of the moderate levels of calcium and magnesium contents that would be adequate for normal growth of crops. Meanwhile, the solids of the coastal plains are generally deep to poorly drained while beach ridges are shallow, coarse and loamy. These areas are noted to be moderately fertile due to low organic matter content; while some areas are poorly drained and prone to tidal floods usually occurring in barangays [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Kinalansan]].\n\nOn the other hand, soils that came from shales and sandstones can be found in barangay [[Adiangao]]. These are noted to be moderately shallow to moderately deep, fine loamy to clayey. Generally, it is high in fertility brought about by adequate levels of soil reaction, organic matter content, and permeability. However, soil limitations may include heavy texture, erosion hazard, surface stoniness as well as the presence of rock outcrops and shallow soils.\n\n===Soil Erosion and Landslide Susceptibility===\nThe lands that are prone to erosion account for about 8.04% of the total land area and they have slopes ranging from 30%-50%. However, the erosion map of the municipality revealed that only 8.49% of the total land area are observed to be slightly eroded while no apparent erosion occurred in the rest of the territory.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Erosion Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

However, there is a slight seasonal flooding or about 1.67% that usually occur in barangay [[Minoro]] and in the northern part of [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] which covers about 78.54 hectares. The flood reaches a depth of less than 0.5 to 1.0 meter after heavy downpour. It would usually recedes within 12 hours to a maximum of one day. Likewise, seasonal flooding is moderately experienced in some portions of barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Telegrafo]] and [[Calalahan]] with a depth of about 0.75 to 1.50 meters which would usually recedes within a few days only.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Flooding Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

These rivers and creeks are most frequently being utilized not only for irrigation purposes of existing paddies but also for the day to day human activities such as bathing and washing.\n\n===Marine ecosystem===\nThe municipality has a total length of shoreline along the [[Lagonoy Gulf]] of 11.30&nbsp;km. which is about 3.15% of the 358.70&nbsp;km. of shoreline found within the 4th District of [[Camarines Sur]].<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The fine beach sand in the area makes it suitable for natural harbors as well as refuge for ships and motorbancas during the peak of weather disturbances. Moreover, a variety of marine life and species are notably abounding in the municipal waters that provided a rich source of livelihood among coastal families. At present, there are two separate municipal ports, one located in barangay [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]] and the San Jose Fishing Port in Sitio Talisay, of barangay [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]]. They most frequently served as docking points for both inter-island passenger motorbancas and fishing vessels operating in [[Lagonoy Gulf]].\n\n===Land classification===\nThe entire land area of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> with 4,702.8146 hectares is classified as alienable and disposable.

On the other hand, high quality sand, gravels and boulders are abundantly found along the Rangas River traversing barangays [[Bagacay]], [[Mampirao]], [[Pugay]], [[Calalahan]], [[Tambangan]] and [[Calawit]].\n\n===Volcanoes, Faults, and Earthquake Belt===\nThe  parallel location of the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]], or [[Philippine Fault System|Philippine Fault Zone]], to the [[Philippine Trench|Deep Philippine Trench]]<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> practically contributed to the triangulated distribution of events with faults or volcanic abnormalities within the earthquake belts in the Bicol Region. It has been observed that the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]] or Chain had a span of 240&nbsp;km. from [[Camarines Norte]] in the North down to [[Sorsogon]] in the South with a total of 16 volcanoes separately spread over by about 24&nbsp;km. apart and rested parallel along the 200&nbsp;km. chain west of the [[Philippine Trench]], which is the major source of earthquake in the region. The trench can be described as a long, narrow, and generally steep-sided very deep depression in the ocean floor. The axis of a trench marks, the position of a subduction zone where old oceanic lithospheric plates begin their descent into the earth's interior.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a study was conducted which reveals that the [[Bicol Region]] particularly the location of San Jose is a part prone to earthquakes of intensify 5 from the above-cited source zones. Based on the frequency of volcanic eruptions that occurred in the region, there are three prominent volcanoes which are considered to be active, namely: [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]], [[Mount Bulusan|Mt. Bulusan]], and [[Mount Iriga|Mt. Iriga (Asog)]]. The latter is the nearest to the Municipality of San Jose.\n\n[[Mount Iriga]] (Asog) has a peak of 1,143 meters above sea level and classified to be \"stratovolcanoe\" or it has a composite cone like that of [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]] and last record of eruption was in 1628 A.D. which eventually damned the Barit River but consequently created the [[Lake Buhi]], the home of the smallest fish in the world with scientific name ''[[Pandaka pygmaea]]'' locally known as \"tabios.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\"\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of San Jose\n| 1903 = 8314\n| 1918 = 8710\n| 1939 = 10722\n| 1948 = 12788\n| 1960 = 16704\n| 1970 = 20343\n| 1975 = 21859\n| 1980 = 23898\n| 1990 = 27517\n| 1995 = 31362\n| 2000 = 32512\n| 2007 = 35768\n| 2010 = 38523\n| 2015 = 40623\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of San Jose, Camarines Sur, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe population projection was computed based on Geometric formula resulting to an average annual increase of 2.62%.

This includes the numerous beaches with crystalline clear water along the coastline of [[Lagonoy Gulf]] and the Adiangao Cave at barangay [[Adiangao]].\n\n==Heritage sites and buildings==\n\n===The municipal building===\n[[File:Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building.png|thumb|Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building]]\nCapitano Municipal Venancio Pe\u00f1as initiated the building of the municipal hall<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\">{{cite book|last1=Nieva|first1=Lourdes Lobis|title=San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride|date=February 2010|publisher=Local  Government of San Jose|location=San Jose, Camarines Sur|edition=1st}}</ref> during his term of office in 1877. His successors contributed to its completion, however, Typhoon \"Uguis\" hit the town in 1898 that caused the eventual destruction of the building. Several years after this calamity, the residence of Gregorio Patrocinio who was the Capital Municipal at that time was utilized as the municipal hall.\n\nIn the early days, the parochial house in the town was also utilized as the municipal tribunal. So that, before the construction of the municipal hall, the old convent could have been the government tribunal. In 1912, the already destroyed municipal hall was rehabilitated when Job Obias took office as the president of the town. The work never ceased until the zealous leader able to see the roof installed with galvanized iron sheets. Meantime, the balcony at the front, right above the main entrance of the municipal building was added during the presidency of Isaias Obias (1920-1922).\n\nDuring the presidency of Jovito Dizon (1923-1925), the wooden stairs and floor was constructed, which until this time the same wooden stairs and floor exist where they were built. An engraved proof of this construction is seen on the Spanish stone wall of the municipal building. This engraved marker always greets everyone who takes the first step in climbing up the historic wooden stairs. It was told that San Jose\u00f1os took the pride of owning the biggest municipal hall in the Bicol Region in 1953.\n\nAt present, the people of San Jose can take the pride and honor of having the only functional centuries-old municipal building still in its admirable strength and durability.\n\n===The Catholic Church===\nThe site<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the Catholic Church where it majestically stands until now, including all other church properties, was owned by Laurenciano Barcellano. It was chosen by Fr. Salvador Mendoza who considered the place as the most appropriate part to build the Church. The place was formerly called sitio \"Cabayawasnan\" which means guavas or guava orchard. In the 1880s, the place was known to have been grown with many guava trees particularly in the quadrangle which served as the spacious backyard of the old convent. The front part also served as the usual venue for religious and cultural activities such as the \"cenaculo.\" It was told that once the wooden gates of the quadrangle were opened to the public, the folks or their children would usually take the chance of exploring the whole place even to the most secluded part of this area, of course without the watching eyes of the people in the convent.\n[[File:San Jose Church Partido.jpg|thumb|San Jose Church Partido]]\nThe construction of the church started in 1818 under the strictest rule of the Cura Parocco, Fr. Mendoza. It has a Romansque architectural dimension with lime-plastered walls designed by a certain Felix Paete. The sand and lime used in its construction were taken from barangay [[Dolo]], about 6 kilometers away.\n\nThe parishioners rendered the hard labor and experienced the extent of Polo Method in the construction of the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> At dusk time, the workers were already gathered around the designated place before the start of the work. According to old folks account, the workers were parading in the darkness of the night while carrying torches to light their way to reach the starting point of the work before dusk. They endured the rugged, thickly forested and muddy trail to make the very slow and difficult manual transport of the building materials and to make while of their hard labor, they would usually entertain themselves with songs and music as they carried the lime and sand from barangay Dolo to the site.\n\nWhen the church was completed, there were donations received by the parish for its accessories. The belfry<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> at the center of the church<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> facade that holds the big bronze bell donated by Dalmacia Obias. The bell is considered to be the queen of the bells at the center of the belfry. People can find also two other smaller bells hanging at each side of the belfry beside the gigantic bronze bell. Accordingly, these three bells when rang send the intended message to all its parishioners, purportedly summoning them to come to church to attend mass. It would take a master ringer to harmoniously blend the sound of the bells with the queen bronze bell on the central command.\n\nOne can take notice of the church altar<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> which is exactly the same altar that it had when the workers of the church had it constructed. The design of the retablo and the materials used are made from solid hard wood to give it an appropriate care of preservation. The present walnut color of paint applied to the retablo was made really intentional to conform with its original paint upon its construction, and the gold ornaments added are carefully designed to adapt to the centuries-old design that it was.\n\nMeantime, the presidential chair where the parish priest sits is still the original chair used by the very first Cura.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> It was said to have undergone some minor repairs, but its main parts and appearance generally remained almost exactly the same as it was first used by Fr. Salvador Mendoza. Also the altar fence marks the separation of the priest's place from the parishioners. It then upholds the sacredness of the altar. It likewise undergone minors repairs but the original design and materials are preserved.\n\n===Christ the King monument===\nThe gigantic monument of Christ the King (Cristo Rey) can be found at the church patio. It was donated by Primitiva Ortiz Obias and inaugurated on October 27, 1952.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> The monument was mounted on an elevated portal to give it a lordly treatment. It is facing east at the town center. Likewise, the base of the monument portal is also elevated like a low-raised floor. People love to stay by sitting on its floor, playing around, or simply enjoy the peace it offers.\n\n===The convent===\nThe convent was built later than the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> Accordingly, before its construction, the first Cura could have stayed in an improvised parochial house made of ca\u00f1a and nipa. It also functioned as the municipal tribunal. During the Spanish time, the residence of the Cura was also the residence of the capitan municipal.\n\nThe old convent as still seen today is made of thick stone walls with wooden floors. It is very spacious and too big for one Cura. It also had many spacious rooms to accommodate visiting priests.\n\nDuring World War II, this old convent was known to have served as the headquarters<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the [[United States Volunteers|American Volunteer Soldiers]] while the pavement was used as the jail. In 1988, this old convent was converted into a preparatory seminary. In fact, its size made [[Leonardo Legaspi|Archbishop Leonardo Z. Legaspi]] decide to covert it into a Pre-College Seminary purposely to accommodate the growing need of the Holy Rosary Minor Seminary for a formation house. In the same year, the old convent was made a preparatory seminary in consultation with then Parish Priest, Fr. Eutiquio Infante<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> and it initially accepted seminarians on July 1, 1988 with Fr. Raul S. Pan as the first rector. In 1991, the name was changed to Holy Rosary Preparatory Seminary based on the provisions of the formation manual for the diocesan priestly life and ministry, \"That Christ May Be Formed in Us.\"\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\nThe municipality has a total of 98.046 kilometers road<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> length consisting of the National, Provincial, Municipal and Barangay roads. Approximately 6.730 kilometers or 6.864% of the total road length are classified as National roads, 24.830 kilometers or 25.3248% are provincial roads, 4.920 kilometers or 5.018% are Municipal roads and 61.566 kilometers or 62.793% are barangay roads with varying road conditions.\n\nBased on the standard of 1.000 kilometers of road for every square kilometer of land area, the municipality requires 47 kilometers of road length. The existing road length in the area of 98.046 kilometers actually include all types of roads. Thus, this would only indicate that the existing roads are sufficient to facilitate the efficient transportation of agricultural and fishing products of the municipality.\n\nThere are 18 bridges existing in the area, the longest of which is located in barangay [[Pugay]], a reinforced concrete deck girder (RCDA), one in [[Mampirao]], [[Salogon]], and the rest are Spanish-type bridges that are made of bricks and reinforced concrete, spillways and footbridges.\n\n===Water supply===\nThe ''Partido'' water supply system<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> of the [[Partido Development Administration]] (PWSS-PDA) Level III supplies the potable water. It has its water source from [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]]. There are 6 pipe connections from the poblacion area to the barangays of [[Camagong]], [[Danlog]], part of [[Boclod]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Telegrafo]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]].

The old [[Parish Priest]] of [[Lagonoy]], Fr. Salvador Mendoza, decided to build a church in a place called \"Cabayawasnan\" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. Unfortunately, the place was owned by Laurenciano Barcillano who refused to donate the land to the Church. However, through circumstances beyond his control, ownership was passed to the Church.\n\nThe construction of the church began in 1818 and there were only around thirty houses around the area. So, the priest sought the help of the people of Lagonoy. It was a cooperative effort of the people of [[Lagonoy]] who worked on the northern part and the people of Danlog on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism.\n\nIn 1813, the town of San Jose was officially established under the name \"Patrocinio\" derived from the word \"Patron\", meaning model. Then it was changed to Patrocinio de San Jose in honor of its Patron Saint, San Jose de Patriarca. Later in 1883, it was shortened to \"San Jose\" which is now the official name. Its founders were Fr. Salvador Mendoza, then the Parish Priest of El Pueblo de Lagonoy and Don Macario Agustin, the first Capitan Municipal of the town.\n\nAfter the founding of the town, progress and development became eminent and this could be attributed to the cooperative efforts of the church and the state. In 1887, the foundations of the municipal building were laid when Venancio Obias was the Captain Municipal. His successors continued the work but the structure was completely destroyed by a very strong typhoon called \"Bagyong Ogis\", so named because the back of the trees were shredded of and trunks turned white in 1898. A big house owned by Capitan Gregorio Patrocinio was made the temporary \"tribunal.\"\n\nWhen the people of [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] decided to take up arms against the [[Spaniards]], Elias Angeles, then the leading \"Guard Civil\" of Naga convinced the people of San Jose to join the revolutionary movement. Ariston Prila, a \"cabeza de barangay\" from barangay [[Kinalansan]] heeded the call.\n\nIn the early part of 1903, when the Americans reached the town, there were a handful of revolutionaries led by Jose Valencia and Nicomedes Mata but they fled when they realized that their resistance was futile. The American Government was easily established and continued its pacification campaign while pursuing its goal of effecting changes in various aspects of the lives of the people.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Japanese soldiers reached the town in the latest of 1942. Most of the people had evacuated to the far-flung barangays and up to the mountains of Goa and Lagonoy while some joined the [[guerilla]] movement. Filipino-Japanese government continued with an appointed Mayor. [[Filipinos|Filipino]] volunteers manned the defense of the town hall which served as garrison while the Japanese Imperial Forces had Goa for its headquarters. Schools were ordered opened by the authorities to allay fears and to give confidence of the people.\n\nWith the end of the [[Pacific War]] and the celebration of Independence in 1946, the people slowly rehabilitated their lives from the ravages of the war and returned to their usual milieu with renewed vigor.\n\nMay 19 marks the annual celebration of the feast day of San Jose, the town's patron saint.\n\n==Geography==\nSan Jose has a total land area of 4,702.8146 hectares and is bounded in north by [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]], south by [[Tigaon, Camarines Sur|Tigaon]], east by [[Lagonoy Gulf]], and west by [[Goa, Camarines Sur|Goa]]. The whole town is roughly 0.27% of the region's 1.76 million hectares; 0.89% of the total land area of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 526.680 square kilometers; and 2.26% of the total land area of the 4th Congressional District of [[Camarines Sur]] with an area of 207,596.71 hectares.<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box|location = San Jose, Camarines Sur\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Mar high C = 30\n| Apr high C = 31\n| May high C = 32\n| Jun high C = 32\n| Jul high C = 31\n| Aug high C = 32\n| Sep high C = 31\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Dec high C = 29\n| Jan low C = 23\n| Feb low C = 23\n| Mar low C = 23\n| Apr low C = 24\n| May low C = 25\n| Jun low C = 25\n| Jul low C = 25\n| Aug low C = 25\n| Sep low C = 24\n| Oct low C = 24\n| Nov low C = 24\n| Dec low C = 23\n| Jan precipitation mm = 189.5\n| Jan rain days = 18\n| Feb precipitation mm = 169.4 \n| Feb rain days = 14\n| Mar precipitation mm = 133.1 \n| Mar rain days = 14\n| Apr precipitation mm = 119.4 \n| Apr rain days = 13\n| May precipitation mm = 134.2\n| May rain days = 13\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.2 \n| Jun rain days = 15\n| Jul precipitation mm = 200.5\n| Jul rain days = 17\n| Aug precipitation mm = 155 \n| Aug rain days = 14\n| Sep precipitation mm = 189 \n| Sep rain days = 16\n| Oct precipitation mm = 314.6 \n| Oct rain days = 22\n| Nov precipitation mm = 369.2 \n| Nov rain days = 23\n| Dec precipitation mm = 444 \n| Dec rain days = 24\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/san-jose-weather-averages/camarines-sur/PH.aspx\n| title = San Jose, Camarines Sur: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 6 December 2015}}</ref>\n| date=December 2015}}\n\nThe municipality belongs to Type II Climate<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> characterized by the absence of a dry season and very pronounced maximum rainfall from November to December. It is during these months that the Northeast monsoon season occurs and the [[cyclones|tropical cyclones]] contribute to the increased rainfall in the area. In January and February, the effect of these air masses on rainfall is considerably radical. In addition to the north-east monsoon during the months of February and March, the trail winds traveling from East to West do not give significant increase of rainfall. Likely, the month of May is the transition period between the monsoon that is prevalent from June to September. During the south-west monsoon season, the linear system called the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITZ), brings the largest amount of rainfall to the area. In October, which is the transitive period between the south-west and north-east monsoons, the tropical cyclone brings considerable amount of rain.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe rainfall distribution in the municipality is greatly influenced by the air streams, tropical cyclones, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], shorelines, easterly waves and other rainfall-causing weather patterns.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The rainfall season occurs from June to December with high rainfall intensity of 285.06mm to 474.22m and less rainfall intensity of 245.30mm to 224.06m from January to the month May which at the same time is the onset of effective rainfall with 75% probability and it would terminate in February of the following year which consequently during this period the mountainous areas receive higher intensity of rainfall. But the trend of monthly rainfall is unimodal (having one peak) and the maximum rain period is from October to December. On the other hand, the monthly average rainfall varies from 125.86mm to 594.56mm with a mean annual rainfall of 298.54mm.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe winds are influenced by the monsoon and the Pacific Trade System with Northeast direction that occurs in November to February; Easterly winds during the months of March, April, May and October; Southwest winds in June to August; and Westerly winds in September.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThe maximum [[temperature]] during the month of January reaches about 27.9[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] while 31.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in November. The minimum [[temperature]] from December to June reaches about 20.6&nbsp;\u00b0C to 24.5&nbsp;\u00b0C; and the average monthly [[temperature]] is recorded at 25.0&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 27.9&nbsp;\u00b0C in June.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\n[[Relative humidity]] is indicative of the amount of [[water vapor]] present in the [[atmosphere]]. [[Humidity]] in the [[Philippines]] as in the municipality of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is high because of the warm moist air streams flowing over the [[archipelago]], the surrounding seas, rich vegetation and abundant rainfall. The lowest average [[humidity|relative humidity]] occurs in May with 85.9%; highest in February with 93.4%; and the annual average [[humidity]] is 90% which is higher than the regional and national average of 82%.\n\n====Typhoon and storm surges====\n\nThe [[cyclone|tropical cyclone]] is a climatic control that contributes largely to the rainfall from June to December.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> It was shown to usually cause maximum values of rainfall and winds as exemplified by the highest wind speed of 77 miles per second as recorded in [[Virac, Catanduanes]] areas during the height of [[Typhoon Joan (1970)|Typhoon Sening]] in 1970.\n\nThe tropical cyclones are internationally classified with these depending on their maximum wind speed or peak wind velocities (V) as follows:\n* Tropical Depression, V<33 knots (63 km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 33 knots < V < 47 k (87 km/h)\n* Tropical Storm, 47 knots < u < 63 knots (116 km/h)\n* Typhoon, u > 63 knots (116 km/h)\n\nThe cyclones affecting the Philippine islands<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> originate from the [[Pacific Ocean]] East of the Islands between latitude 8 degrees North, 10 degrees South, traveling on a Westerly or Northwesterly course over the country. It has the highest sustained wind [[velocity]] of 6 knots in November to April and lowest sustained wind velocity of 4 knots in September. Note that the average cyclone that passes over mainland [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] which include San Jose town is 3 cyclones for every 2 years.<ref>Research Study by PAGASA (1948-1982)</ref>\n\n===Topography===\nThe terrain of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is characterized as level to gently rolling and sloping. About 91.96% is characterized as having a generally flat terrain with a slope 0-3% which is described to be level to nearly level. It practically covers the entire land area of the town except barangay [[Adiangao]] which is located along the mountain range of [[Caramoan Peninsula]] which has an undulating to rolling terrain with 8.04% portions of steep slopes.\n\nThe elevation of the municipality<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> is roughly 92.55% low to very low with a mean elevation from 0\u2013100 meters above sea level. Hence, low elevation is about 5.72% ranging from 100\u2013300 meters above sea level as well as 1.73% with moderately high elevation ranging from 300\u2013500 meters above sea level.\n\n===Geology===\nThe major part of the municipal area is composed of Alluvium River Terraces<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\">{{cite journal|last1=LGU San Jose|first1=MPDC|title=Brief  Profile of the Municipality of San Jose,  Camarines Sur|date=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is particularly described as ''fluvicatile lacustrine alluvium'' composed of unsorted loosely consolidated pebbles, gravel, silt, coral debris and clay that can be found in flooded plains, riverbanks, sand bars, beaches, and tidal flats. It is notable that river terraces along the [[Lagonoy]] River and its tributaries which include also the Rangas River that practically originating from the foot of the [[Mount Isarog]] account for about 90.69% or 4,264.9826 hectares of the total land area of the municipality while the rest is of igneous and metamorphic rock origin of which volcanoclast alluvial fans cover about 0.19% or 8.94 hectares. These are specifically found in barangays [[Catalotoan]] and [[Salogon]]. Note that volcanoclast is a thick and extensive pyroclastic material consists of ashes, cinder lapili, tuff agromerate and volcanic debris while alluvial fans consists only of worked pyroclastics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Geological Table\n|-\n!

It is characterized as highly fractured and folded complex consisting of quartzite, quartzatedspathit and mica schists that cover roughly 5.26% or 247.37 hectares. Meanwhile, the lower part of the place is composed of sedimentary rocks known as crystalline limestone which covers about 3.86% or 181.53 hectares. Crystalline limestone is an extensive transgressive rectal carbonated facies including wall preserved bushes of corals, megafossils and algae structure, detritae to fuffacious limestone showing well developed karst landforms or formation that can be found prevalent in the [[Caramoan Peninsula]].<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/>\n\n===Landforms===\nThe many landforms<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> found in the municipality have been the natural production of the different geographical pressures of the different structural land forms such as alluvial lowland, alluvial fans, sedimentary plateau or masses of residual slopes and thick sedimentary landscapes. Most of its territorial areas are best characterized by broad alluvial plans described as level to nearly level, and moderately well-drained terraces. The level to undulating plains are the product of paludal environment or deltaic plains which are usually being flooded during slight and heavy downpours.\n\nOn the other hand, Barangay [[Adiangao]] is characterized by Shale/Sandstone Hills (SSH)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which is described to be undulating to rolling, slightly to moderately dissected, and moistly top-rounded hills, both are low and high relief. Likewise, steep slopes are dissected closely with each other particularly those with greater than 18<sup>o</sup> inclinations. Meanwhile, V-shaped valleys are noted to have been composed and dominated by sandstone. Likewise, landforms in barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], part of [[Minoro]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]] and [[Tagas]] are noted to be flat with very poorly drained terrains and oftentimes affected by floods caused by high tides. The coastal plains are most commonly swarmed with mangroves, nipa plants, break rides, swales and tidal flats.\n\n====Major Types of Land Management Units====\nThe municipality is composed of 5 major types of Land Management Units (LMUs)<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> which are classified into 2 forms, namely: Warm Lowland and Warm Cool Hillyland. They are enumerated and explained below.\n\nWarm Lowland:\n* Tidal Flats (LMU 02) is very deep, fine loamy dark grayish brown but sometimes coarse loamy grayish soil, medium acid to mildly alkaline reaction, low available P an CaMg but adequate with O.M., constant extractable KBSP and CEC; generally moderate fertility level, very low infiltration and moderate to slow permeability rate, submerged and very poorly drained.\n* Beach Ridges and Swales (LMU 03) is shallow to moderately deep, very dark brown, coarse, and loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; slightly acid to mutual moderate CaMg and CEC; available highly extractable K acid; BSP generally moderate fertility level; rapid to very rapid infiltration and rapid to moderate rapid permeability rate, and excessively drained.\n* Estuarin Plain (LMU 04) is deep to very deep clay, predominantly very dark brown, yellowish brown, coarse, loamy underlain by sandy skeletal substratum; medium acid to neutral soil reaction; moderate exchangeable K, high O.M. content, available P, BSP and CEC; generally high fertility level; slow to very slow infiltration and rapid to moderately rapid permeability rate, and moderately well to poorly drained.\n* Broad Plain (LMU 09) is moderately deep and sometimes shallow predominantly brown fine, loamy and sometimes coarse, loamy sub-soil underlain by coarse loamy skeletal stratum; strong acid to slightly acid, moderately available P, extractable K and Ca/Mg; adequate O.M. content CEC and BSP, moderate general fertility level; very slow to very rapid permeability rate, poorly to well drained, none to moderate flooding.\n\nWarm Cool Hillyland:\n* Shale/Sandstones Hills (LMU 70) is moderately shallow to very deep, predominantly dark, yellowish brown, and strong fine loamy and sometimes clayey subsoil underlain by skeletal substratum; medium soil to mildly alkaline reaction, low O.M. content and available P, high extractable K, Ca/Mg, BS and CEC generally moderate fertility level, slow to moderate permeability, moderate to well drained.\n\n===Soil classifications===\nThe soil map reveals that the municipality is composed of 9 soil types, namely:\n* [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] Sandy clay loan and sandy loam\n* [[Minoro]] Loam\n* Venagre Clay loam and sandy loam\n* Huyon-huyon Sandy loam\n* [[Kinalansan]] Silty clay loam and Clay\n* Magsaysay Sandy Loam\n* San Miguel Silty Loam\n* Porous rocks & clay load\n* Sandy soil\n\nIt is also noted that the soil composition of the low-lying areas is rich loamy characterized as broad alluvial plains. However, the inherent soil fertility is generally moderate because of the moderate levels of calcium and magnesium contents that would be adequate for normal growth of crops. Meanwhile, the solids of the coastal plains are generally deep to poorly drained while beach ridges are shallow, coarse and loamy. These areas are noted to be moderately fertile due to low organic matter content; while some areas are poorly drained and prone to tidal floods usually occurring in barangays [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Kinalansan]].\n\nOn the other hand, soils that came from shales and sandstones can be found in barangay [[Adiangao]]. These are noted to be moderately shallow to moderately deep, fine loamy to clayey. Generally, it is high in fertility brought about by adequate levels of soil reaction, organic matter content, and permeability. However, soil limitations may include heavy texture, erosion hazard, surface stoniness as well as the presence of rock outcrops and shallow soils.\n\n===Soil Erosion and Landslide Susceptibility===\nThe lands that are prone to erosion account for about 8.04% of the total land area and they have slopes ranging from 30%-50%. However, the erosion map of the municipality revealed that only 8.49% of the total land area are observed to be slightly eroded while no apparent erosion occurred in the rest of the territory.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Erosion Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

However, there is a slight seasonal flooding or about 1.67% that usually occur in barangay [[Minoro]] and in the northern part of [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]] which covers about 78.54 hectares. The flood reaches a depth of less than 0.5 to 1.0 meter after heavy downpour. It would usually recedes within 12 hours to a maximum of one day. Likewise, seasonal flooding is moderately experienced in some portions of barangays [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Telegrafo]] and [[Calalahan]] with a depth of about 0.75 to 1.50 meters which would usually recedes within a few days only.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Area Distribution by Flooding Hazard<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n|-\n!

Isarog]]. These rivers and creeks are most frequently being utilized not only for irrigation purposes of existing paddies but also for the day to day human activities such as bathing and washing.\n\n===Marine ecosystem===\nThe municipality has a total length of shoreline along the [[Lagonoy Gulf]] of 11.30&nbsp;km. which is about 3.15% of the 358.70&nbsp;km. of shoreline found within the 4th District of [[Camarines Sur]].<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> The fine beach sand in the area makes it suitable for natural harbors as well as refuge for ships and motorbancas during the peak of weather disturbances. Moreover, a variety of marine life and species are notably abounding in the municipal waters that provided a rich source of livelihood among coastal families. At present, there are two separate municipal ports, one located in barangay [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]] and the San Jose Fishing Port in Sitio Talisay, of barangay [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]]. They most frequently served as docking points for both inter-island passenger motorbancas and fishing vessels operating in [[Lagonoy Gulf]].\n\n===Land classification===\nThe entire land area of San Jose<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> with 4,702.8146 hectares is classified as alienable and disposable.

It has been known that the [[marble]] deposit in barangay [[Adiangao]] has an estimated volume of 71,772,912 metric tons; and it has been contained along the Maangas-Adiangao area and believed to be suitable for [[dimension]] stones.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nThere is noted also a considerable amount of deposit of \"guano\" inside the [[Adiangao]] Caves. On the other hand, high quality sand, gravels and boulders are abundantly found along the Rangas River traversing barangays [[Bagacay]], [[Mampirao]], [[Pugay]], [[Calalahan]], [[Tambangan]] and [[Calawit]].\n\n===Volcanoes, Faults, and Earthquake Belt===\nThe  parallel location of the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]], or [[Philippine Fault System|Philippine Fault Zone]], to the [[Philippine Trench|Deep Philippine Trench]]<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/> practically contributed to the triangulated distribution of events with faults or volcanic abnormalities within the earthquake belts in the Bicol Region. It has been observed that the [[Bicol Region|Bicol Volcanic Belt]] or Chain had a span of 240&nbsp;km. from [[Camarines Norte]] in the North down to [[Sorsogon]] in the South with a total of 16 volcanoes separately spread over by about 24&nbsp;km. apart and rested parallel along the 200&nbsp;km. chain west of the [[Philippine Trench]], which is the major source of earthquake in the region. The trench can be described as a long, narrow, and generally steep-sided very deep depression in the ocean floor. The axis of a trench marks, the position of a subduction zone where old oceanic lithospheric plates begin their descent into the earth's interior.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a study was conducted which reveals that the [[Bicol Region]] particularly the location of San Jose is a part prone to earthquakes of intensify 5 from the above-cited source zones. Based on the frequency of volcanic eruptions that occurred in the region, there are three prominent volcanoes which are considered to be active, namely: [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]], [[Mount Bulusan|Mt. Bulusan]], and [[Mount Iriga|Mt. Iriga (Asog)]]. The latter is the nearest to the Municipality of San Jose.\n\n[[Mount Iriga]] (Asog) has a peak of 1,143 meters above sea level and classified to be \"stratovolcanoe\" or it has a composite cone like that of [[Mayon Volcano|Mt. Mayon]] and last record of eruption was in 1628 A.D. which eventually damned the Barit River but consequently created the [[Lake Buhi]], the home of the smallest fish in the world with scientific name ''[[Pandaka pygmaea]]'' locally known as \"tabios.<ref name=\"Municipal Comprehensive Landuse Plan & Zoning Ordinance (2000-2010)\"/>\"\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of San Jose\n| 1903 = 8314\n| 1918 = 8710\n| 1939 = 10722\n| 1948 = 12788\n| 1960 = 16704\n| 1970 = 20343\n| 1975 = 21859\n| 1980 = 23898\n| 1990 = 27517\n| 1995 = 31362\n| 2000 = 32512\n| 2007 = 35768\n| 2010 = 38523\n| 2015 = 40623\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of San Jose, Camarines Sur, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\nThe population projection was computed based on Geometric formula resulting to an average annual increase of 2.62%.

This includes the numerous beaches with crystalline clear water along the coastline of [[Lagonoy Gulf]] and the Adiangao Cave at barangay [[Adiangao]].\n\n==Heritage sites and buildings==\n\n===The municipal building===\n[[File:Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building.png|thumb|Main Entrance to the San Jose Municipal Building]]\nCapitano Municipal Venancio Pe\u00f1as initiated the building of the municipal hall<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\">{{cite book|last1=Nieva|first1=Lourdes Lobis|title=San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride|date=February 2010|publisher=Local  Government of San Jose|location=San Jose, Camarines Sur|edition=1st}}</ref> during his term of office in 1877. His successors contributed to its completion, however, Typhoon \"Uguis\" hit the town in 1898 that caused the eventual destruction of the building. Several years after this calamity, the residence of Gregorio Patrocinio who was the Capital Municipal at that time was utilized as the municipal hall.\n\nIn the early days, the parochial house in the town was also utilized as the municipal tribunal. So that, before the construction of the municipal hall, the old convent could have been the government tribunal. In 1912, the already destroyed municipal hall was rehabilitated when Job Obias took office as the president of the town. The work never ceased until the zealous leader able to see the roof installed with galvanized iron sheets. Meantime, the balcony at the front, right above the main entrance of the municipal building was added during the presidency of Isaias Obias (1920-1922).\n\nDuring the presidency of Jovito Dizon (1923-1925), the wooden stairs and floor was constructed, which until this time the same wooden stairs and floor exist where they were built. An engraved proof of this construction is seen on the Spanish stone wall of the municipal building. This engraved marker always greets everyone who takes the first step in climbing up the historic wooden stairs. It was told that San Jose\u00f1os took the pride of owning the biggest municipal hall in the Bicol Region in 1953.\n\nAt present, the people of San Jose can take the pride and honor of having the only functional centuries-old municipal building still in its admirable strength and durability.\n\n===The Catholic Church===\nThe site<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the Catholic Church where it majestically stands until now, including all other church properties, was owned by Laurenciano Barcellano. It was chosen by Fr. Salvador Mendoza who considered the place as the most appropriate part to build the Church. The place was formerly called sitio \"Cabayawasnan\" which means guavas or guava orchard. In 1880s, the place was known to have been grown with many guava trees particularly in the quadrangle which served as the spacious backyard of the old convent. The front part also served as the usual venue for religious and cultural activities such as the \"cenaculo.\" It was told that once the wooden gates of the quadrangle were opened to the public, the folks or their children would usually take the chance of exploring the whole place even to the most secluded part of this area, of course without the watching eyes of the people in the convent.\n[[File:San Jose Church Partido.jpg|thumb|San Jose Church Partido]]\nThe construction of the church started in 1818 under the strictest rule of the Cura Parocco, Fr. Mendoza. It has a Romansque architectural dimension with lime-plastered walls designed by a certain Felix Paete. The sand and lime used in its construction were taken from barangay [[Dolo]], about 6 kilometers away.\n\nThe parishioners rendered the hard labor and experienced the extent of Polo Method in the construction of the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> At dusk time, the workers were already gathered around the designated place before the start of the work. According to old folks account, the workers were parading in the darkness of the night while carrying torches to light their way to reach the starting point of the work before dusk. They endured the rugged, thickly forested and muddy trail to make the very slow and difficult manual transport of the building materials and to make while of their hard labor, they would usually entertain themselves with songs and music as they carried the lime and sand from barangay Dolo to the site.\n\nWhen the church was completed, there were donations received by the parish for its accessories. The belfry<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> at the center of the church<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> facade that holds the big bronze bell donated by Dalmacia Obias. The bell is considered to be the queen of the bells at the center of the belfry. People can find also two other smaller bells hanging at each side of the belfry beside the gigantic bronze bell. Accordingly, these three bells when rang send the intended message to all its parishioners, purportedly summoning them to come to church to attend mass. It would take a master ringer to harmoniously blend the sound of the bells with the queen bronze bell on the central command.\n\nOne can take notice of the church altar<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> which is exactly the same altar that it had when the workers of the church had it constructed. The design of the retablo and the materials used are made from solid hard wood to give it an appropriate care of preservation. The present walnut color of paint applied to the retablo was made really intentional to conform with its original paint upon its construction, and the gold ornaments added are carefully designed to adapt to the centuries-old design that it was.\n\nMeantime, the presidential chair where the parish priest sits is still the original chair used by the very first Cura.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> It was said to have undergone some minor repairs, but its main parts and appearance generally remained almost exactly the same as it was first used by Fr. Salvador Mendoza. Also the altar fence marks the separation of the priest's place from the parishioners. It then upholds the sacredness of the altar. It likewise undergone minors repairs but the original design and materials are preserved.\n\n===Christ the King monument===\nThe gigantic monument of Christ the King (Cristo Rey) can be found at the church patio. It was donated by Primitiva Ortiz Obias and inaugurated on October 27, 1952.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> The monument was mounted on an elevated portal to give it a lordly treatment. It is facing east at the town center. Likewise, the base of the monument portal is also elevated like a low-raised floor. People love to stay by sitting on its floor, playing around, or simply enjoy the peace it offers.\n\n===The convent===\nThe convent was built later than the church.<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> Accordingly, before its construction, the first Cura could have stayed in an improvised parochial house made of ca\u00f1a and nipa. It also functioned as the municipal tribunal. During the Spanish time, the residence of the Cura was also the residence of the capitan municipal.\n\nThe old convent as still seen today is made of thick stone walls with wooden floors. It is very spacious and too big for one Cura. It also had many spacious rooms to accommodate visiting priests.\n\nDuring World War II, this old convent was known to have served as the headquarters<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> of the [[United States Volunteers|American Volunteer Soldiers]] while the pavement was used as the jail. In 1988, this old convent was converted into a preparatory seminary. In fact, its size made [[Leonardo Legaspi|Archbishop Leonardo Z. Legaspi]] decide to covert it into a Pre-College Seminary purposely to accommodate the growing need of the Holy Rosary Minor Seminary for a formation house. In the same year, the old convent was made a preparatory seminary in consultation with then Parish Priest, Fr. Eutiquio Infante<ref name=\"San Jose at its Great Serenity and Pride\"/> and it initially accepted seminarians on July 1, 1988 with Fr. Raul S. Pan as the first rector. In 1991, the name was changed to Holy Rosary Preparatory Seminary based on the provisions of the formation manual for the diocesan priestly life and ministry, \"That Christ May Be Formed in Us.\"\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transportation===\nThe municipality has a total of 98.046 kilometers road<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> length consisting of the National, Provincial, Municipal and Barangay roads. Approximately 6.730 kilometers or 6.864% of the total road length are classified as National roads, 24.830 kilometers or 25.3248% are provincial roads, 4.920 kilometers or 5.018% are Municipal roads and 61.566 kilometers or 62.793% are barangay roads with varying road conditions.\n\nBased on the standard of 1.000 kilometers of road for every square kilometer of land area, the municipality requires 47 kilometers of road length. The existing road length in the area of 98.046 kilometers actually include all types of roads. Thus, this would only indicate that the existing roads are sufficient to facilitate the efficient transportation of agricultural and fishing products of the municipality.\n\nThere are 18 bridges existing in the area, the longest of which is located in barangay [[Pugay]], a reinforced concrete deck girder (RCDA), one in [[Mampirao]], [[Salogon]], and the rest are Spanish-type bridges that are made of bricks and reinforced concrete, spillways and footbridges.\n\n===Water supply===\nThe ''Partido'' water supply system<ref name=\"MPDC Brief Profile of the Municipality of San Jose, Camarines Sur\"/> of the [[Partido Development Administration]] (PWSS-PDA) Level III supplies the potable water. It has its water source from [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur|Lagonoy]]. There are 6 pipe connections from the poblacion area to the barangays of [[Camagong]], [[Danlog]], part of [[Boclod]], [[Kinalansan]], [[Manzana, San Jose|Manzana]], [[Telegrafo]], [[Dolo, San Jose|Dolo]], and [[Sabang, San Jose|Sabang]]. The rest of the people are dependent from the artesian wells particularly in barangays along the [[Lagonoy Gulf]]; as well as deepwells, shallow wells, and improved springs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ San Jose Water Supply (PWSS)<ref name=\"Municipal Health Profile of San Jose, Camarines Sur\">{{cite journal|last1=LGU San Jose|first1=Rural Health Unit|title=Municipal Health Profile of San Jose, Camarines Sur|date=2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!
