These include [[humid subtropical climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[oceanic climate|oceanic]], and [[continental climate]].\n\n=== Subtropics ===\nThese are the climates that are typically found at southernmost portion of the temperate zone between 23.5\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 north or south, and thus are far more influenced by the tropics than any other tepid climate type, usually having warmer temperatures over the year, longer summers and mild, short winters. Freezing precipitation is uncommon in this portion of the temperate zone. \n\n==== Humid Subtropical (Cfa) and Monsoon Subtropical (Cwa)====\n[[File:Koppen World Map Cwa Cfa.png|thumb|255x255px|Regions where the Humid (Cfa) and Dry-Winter Subtropical (Cwa) climates are found.]]\n[[Humid subtropical climate|Humid Subtropical]] climates generally have long, hot and humid summers with convective showers in summer and a peak seasonal rainfall in the hottest months. Winters are normally mild in the humid subtropics, and warm ocean currents normally are found in coastal areas with humid subtropical climates. This type of climate is normally located along leeward lower east coast continents such as in southeast and central [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and south of [[Brazil]], the southeast portions of [[east Asia]], the [[southern United States]], [[South Africa]], and eastern [[Australia]]. In some areas with Cfa climate (most notably southeast [[China]] and Florida in the [[United States]]), there is an even sharper wet - dry season, called subtropical monsoon or Cwa. In these regions winters are quite dry and summers have very heavy rainfall. Some Cwa areas in southern China report more than 80% of annually precipitation in the 5 warmest months (southwest Monsoon).\n\n==== Mediterranean (Csa, Csb) ====\n[[File:Koppen World Map C.png|thumb|260x260px|Regions where the Dry Summer Subtropical or Mediterranean Climates are found.]]\n[[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean Climate]]s, opposite to the humid subtropical and monsoonal climates, have a dry summer, with rainfall in the winter and cooler months. They occur mostly at the western edges and coasts of the continents and are bounded by arid deserts on their equatorward sides that cause the dry season of summer, and oceanic climates to the poleward sides that are influenced by cool ocean currents and air masses that bring the rainfall of winter. The five main mediterranean regions of the world are the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Sea basin]] in northwestern [[Afro-Eurasia]], coastal [[California]] in the [[United States]], the southwest of [[Argentina]], the [[Western Cape]] of [[South Africa]] and the south and southwestern coast of [[Australia]].\n\n==== Subtropical/Tropical Highland (Cfb, Cwb) ====\nThese are variants of the subtropical climates found in high altitude plateaus or montane systems either in the tropics or subtropics, they have characteristically mild temperatures year round, featuring the four seasons in the subtropics and no marked seasons in the tropics, the latter usually remaining mild to cool through most of the year.\n\n=== Middle-Latitudes ===\nThese occur in the middle latitudes, between 23\u00b026'22\" and 66\u00b033'39\" north, and 23\u00b026'22\" and 66\u00b033'39\" south and are the ones with the most of practically equal influence from the equator and the poles, and the most characteristic temperate climates with the typical distinct four season pattern. In these the temperatures remain relatively cool through most of the year as opposed to mild and warm in the subtropics and cold in the subpoles.\n\n==== Oceanic (Cfb) ====\nThe [[Oceanic climate|oceanic climates]] are created by the onshore flow from the cool high latitude oceans to their west. This causes the climate to have cool summers and cool (but not cold) winters, and relative humidity and precipitation evenly distributed along the year. These climates are frequently cloudy, and are fairly milder both in winter and summer in comparison to other temperate climates. Annual rainfall is spread throughout the entire year. Regions with this climate include [[Northwestern Europe]], [[Pacific Northwest|Northwestern North America]], southeastern and southwestern [[South America]], southeastern [[Australia]] and most of [[New Zealand]].\n\n==== Continental (Dfa, Dwa, Dsa, Dfb, Dwb, Dsb) ====\nThe [[Continental climate|continental climates]], as opposed to the oceanic climates have strikingly extreme seasonal differences. With less moderating effect from ocean currents and more influence from tropical and polar large-size continental land air-masses they feature more extreme temperatures in each respective season, with summers getting as hot as those of subtropical or tropical climates and winters as cold as in subpolar climates. They are mostly found on the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]], because this is where there is a large enough landmass to generate extremes in seasonal temperatures, however some areas of Patagonia experience continental climate as well. This climate type is found in northeast Asia, the north-central and north- eastern United States and southern Canada, and [[Eurasia]], in eastern, central and northern [[Europe]], in Patagonia and in mountains of Cuyo.\n\n=== Subpolars ===\nThese are temperate climates that opposite to the subtropicals are on the poleward edge of the temperate zone, therefore still have four marked seasons including a warmer one, but are far more influenced by the poles than any other but the very polar climates ([[Tundra]] and [[Ice cap climate|Icecap]]).\n\n==== Subpolar-Oceanic (Cfc, Cwc, Csc) ====\nAreas with subpolar oceanic climates feature an oceanic climate but are usually located closer to polar regions. As a result of their location, these regions tend to be on the cool end of oceanic climates. Snowfall tends to be more common here than in other oceanic climates. Subpolar oceanic climates are less prone to temperature extremes than [[Subarctic climate|subarctic climates]] or [[Continental climate|continental climates]], featuring milder winters than these climates. This variant of an oceanic climate is found in parts of coastal [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], parts of [[Scotland]], northwestern coastal areas of [[Norway]] such as [[Lofoten]] and reaching to 70\u00b0N on some islands, uplands near the coast of southwestern Norway, the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]] and northern parts of the [[Alaskan Panhandle]], some parts of Southern [[Argentina]] (though most regions still fall as continental subantarctic), and a few highland areas of [[Tasmania]], and the [[Australian Alps|Australian]] and [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]]. This type of climate is even found in the very remote parts of the Papuan Highlands in Indonesia. The classification used for this regime is Cfc. In the most marine of those areas affected by this regime, temperatures above 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) are extreme weather events, even in the midst of summer. Temperatures above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) have been recorded on rare occasions in some areas of this climate, and in winter temperatures down to \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) have seldom been recorded in some areas.\n\n==== Boreal(Austral)/Subpolar (Dfc, Dwc, Dsc, Dfd, Dwd, Dsd) ====\nMostly polewards of Humid Continental zones this climate features extremely cold and long winters, with short mild summers. In very small areas at high altitudes around the Mediterranean Basin, [[Iran]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Alaska]] and other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|northwestern United States]] ([[Eastern Washington]], [[Eastern Oregon]] and [[Southern Idaho]]) and [[Russian Far East|Russian South-Eastern]] regions the climate is classified as ''Dsc'' with a dry summer climate, such as in [[Seneca, Oregon]] or [[Atlin, British Columbia]]. In [[Southern Hemisphere]] it is found in southern [[Patagonia]] (cities like [[Rio Grande (Argentina)|Rio Grande]] and [[Tolhuin]]). This is the closest to the polar climates of all four-season temperate climates as practically all of the year is set up by extremely low temperatures, except for summer.\n\n== Human aspects ==\n\n=== Demography, fauna and flora ===\nThe vast majority of the world's human population resides in temperate zones, especially in the [[northern hemisphere]], due to its greater mass of land.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Hypsographic demography: The distribution of human population by altitude |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |first1=Joel E. |last1=Cohen |first2=Christopher |last2=Small |volume=95 |issue=24 |pages=14009-14014 |date=24 November 1998 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.24.14009 |pmid=9826643 |pmc=24316}}</ref> The biggest described number in temperate region in the world is found in [[southern Africa]], where some 24,000 taxa (species and infraspecific taxa) have been described, but the native fauna and flora of this region does not have much cultural importance for the majority of the human population of the world that lives in Temperate Zones and that live in the Northern Hemisphere, only environmental importance.<ref name=ger>{{cite book |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/NISL/Biodiversity/Attachments/Plants%20of%20SA.pdf |title=Plants of Southern Africa: An Annotated Checklist |publisher=National Botanical Institute |location=Pretoria |series=Strelitzia |editor1-first=Gerrit |editor1-last=Germishuizen |editor2-first=N.

There are a couple factors why the climate of large city landscapes differs from the climate of rural areas. One factor is the strength of the absorption rate of builds and asphalt, which is higher than natural land. The other large factor is the burning of fossil fuels from buildings and vehicles. These factors have led to the average climate of cities to be warmer than surrounding areas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Misconceptions ==\n\"Temperate Climate\" refers to climates between Polar and Tropical. However, there is a gradual change from polar to tropical climates across the middle latitude temperate zones. Normally, in the northern hemisphere, the northern portions of the temperate zone feature [[Boreal climate|Boreal]], [[Continental climate|Continental]], and [[Oceanic climate]]s, while the southern portions of the temperate zone are often [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] and [[humid subtropical climate]]s. These different climates all fall within the temperate zone which has a basic definition as being any climate with a mean temperature above {{convert|-3|C|F|1}} but below {{convert|18|C|F|1}} in the coldest month. Obviously winter temperatures will be more mild in southerly portions and colder in the more northerly portions of the northern temperate zone and vice-versa in the southern temperate zone.\n\nFrom a floristic standpoint, each of these climate zones have generally temperate vegetation. There is however, an obvious change in flora from the far northern portions of the temperate zone (Boreal) to the far southern portion (humid subtropical). Pines and conifers are endemic and more abundant in the northern portion of the temperate, while palms may be endemic to far southern portions of the temperate zone. Along with this, the humid subtropical climate may be wrongly separated from the Temperate group of climates, and further associated with the Tropical climates, much because of its name, temperatures and the vegetation found in Subtropical zones which can be somewhat similar to that of Tropical regions (For instance the [[Atlantic Forest]] of [[Brazil]] is spread across both Temperate and Tropical zones of the country). Additionally, both temperate and tropical species can be found side by side in the far southern portions of the temperate zone (for example in central Florida), while subarctic species might be found growing in northern portions of the continental zone (for example in Northwest Europe).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Geographical zone]]\n* [[Habitat]]\n* [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]\n* [[Middle latitudes]]\n* [[Polar circle]]\n* [[Subtropics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Seasons}}\n{{K\u00f6ppen}}\n\n[[Category:Climate]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect2|Temperate|Temperateness|the usage of the term in virology|Temperateness (virology)}}\n{{For|the history of the term|geographical zone}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Latitude zones.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The different geographical zones of the world.

They typically feature four distinct seasons, [[Summer]] the warmest, [[Autumn]] the transitioning season to [[Winter]], the colder season, and [[Spring (season)|Spring]] the transitioning season from winter back into summer. In the northern hemisphere, the year starts with winter, transitions in the first half year through spring into summer, which is in mid-year, then at the second half year through autumn into winter at year-end. In the southern hemisphere, the seasons are swapped, with summer  between years and winter in mid-year. \n\nThe '''temperate zones''' (latitudes from 23.5\u00b0 to the [[polar circle]]s at about 66.5\u00b0, [[Arctic Circle|north]] and [[Antarctic Circle|south]]) are where the widest seasonal changes occur, with most climates found in it having some influence from both the tropics and the [[geographical pole|poles]]. The [[subtropics]] (latitudes from about 23.5\u00b0 to 35\u00b0, [[Tropic of Cancer|north]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|south]]) have temperate climates that have the least seasonal change and the warmest in winter, while at the other end, [[Boreal climate]]s located from 55 to 65 north latitude have the most seasonal changes and long and severe winters.  \n\nIn temperate climates, not only do latitudinal positions influence temperature changes, but sea currents, prevailing wind direction, continentality (how large a landmass is), and altitude also shape temperate climates. \n\nThe [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] defines a climate as \"temperate\" when the mean temperature is above {{convert|-3|C|F|1}} but below {{convert|18|C|F|1}} in the coldest month. However, in more recent climate classifications climatologists use the {{convert|0|C|F|1}} line .<ref>{{cite web |url=https://enviroliteracy.org/air-climate-weather/climate/latitude-climate-zones/ |title=Latitude & Climate Zones |website=The Environmental Literacy Council |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather-climate.org.uk/13.php |title=Patterns of Climate |website=Weather-climate.org.uk |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Zones and climates ==\nThe '''north temperate zone''' extends from (approximately 23.5\u00b0 north) to the [[Arctic Circle]] (approximately 66.5\u00b0 north latitude).

These include [[humid subtropical climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[oceanic climate|oceanic]], and [[continental climate]].\n\n=== Subtropics ===\nThese are the climates that are typically found at southernmost portion of the temperate zone between 23.5\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 north or south, and thus are far more influenced by the tropics than any other tepid climate type, usually having warmer temperatures over the year, longer summers and mild, short winters. Freezing precipitation is uncommon in this portion of the temperate zone. \n\n==== Humid Subtropical (Cfa) and Monsoon Subtropical (Cwa)====\n[[File:Koppen World Map Cwa Cfa.png|thumb|255x255px|Regions where the Humid (Cfa) and Dry-Winter Subtropical (Cwa) climates are found.]]\n[[Humid subtropical climate|Humid Subtropical]] climates generally have long, hot and humid summers with convective showers in summer and a peak seasonal rainfall in the hottest months. Winters are normally mild in the humid subtropics, and warm ocean currents normally are found in coastal areas with humid subtropical climates. This type of climate is normally located along leeward lower east coast continents such as in southeast and central [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and south of [[Brazil]], the southeast portions of [[east Asia]], the [[southern United States]], [[South Africa]], and eastern [[Australia]]. In some areas with Cfa climate (most notably southeast [[China]] and Florida in the [[United States]]), there is an even sharper wet - dry season, called subtropical monsoon or Cwa. In these regions winters are quite dry and summers have very heavy rainfall. Some Cwa areas in southern China report more than 80% of annually precipitation in the 5 warmest months (southwest Monsoon).\n\n==== Mediterranean (Csa, Csb) ====\n[[File:Koppen World Map C.png|thumb|260x260px|Regions where the Dry Summer Subtropical or Mediterranean Climates are found.]]\n[[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean Climate]]s, opposite to the humid subtropical and monsoonal climates, have a dry summer, with rainfall in the winter and cooler months. They occur mostly at the western edges and coasts of the continents and are bounded by arid deserts on their equatorward sides that cause the dry season of summer, and oceanic climates to the poleward sides that are influenced by cool ocean currents and air masses that bring the rainfall of winter. The five main mediterranean regions of the world are the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Sea basin]] in northwestern [[Afro-Eurasia]], coastal [[California]] in the [[United States]], the southwest of [[Argentina]], the [[Western Cape]] of [[South Africa]] and the south and southwestern coast of [[Australia]].\n\n==== Subtropical/Tropical Highland (Cfb, Cwb) ====\nThese are variants of the subtropical climates found in high altitude plateaus or montane systems either in the tropics or subtropics, they have characteristically mild temperatures year round, featuring the four seasons in the subtropics and no marked seasons in the tropics, the latter usually remaining mild to cool through most of the year.\n\n=== Middle-Latitudes ===\nThese occur in the middle latitudes, between 23\u00b026'22\" and 66\u00b033'39\" north, and 23\u00b026'22\" and 66\u00b033'39\" south and are the ones with the most of practically equal influence from the equator and the poles, and the most characteristic temperate climates with the typical distinct four season pattern. In these the temperatures remain relatively cool through most of the year as opposed to mild and warm in the subtropics and cold in the subpoles.\n\n==== Oceanic (Cfb) ====\nThe [[Oceanic climate|oceanic climates]] are created by the onshore flow from the cool high latitude oceans to their west. This causes the climate to have cool summers and cool (but not cold) winters, and relative humidity and precipitation evenly distributed along the year. These climates are frequently cloudy, and are fairly milder both in winter and summer in comparison to other temperate climates. Annual rainfall is spread throughout the entire year. Regions with this climate include [[Northwestern Europe]], [[Pacific Northwest|Northwestern North America]], southeastern and southwestern [[South America]], southeastern [[Australia]] and most of [[New Zealand]].\n\n==== Continental (Dfa, Dwa, Dsa, Dfb, Dwb, Dsb) ====\nThe [[Continental climate|continental climates]], as opposed to the oceanic climates have strikingly extreme seasonal differences. With less moderating effect from ocean currents and more influence from tropical and polar large-size continental land air-masses they feature more extreme temperatures in each respective season, with summers getting as hot as those of subtropical or tropical climates and winters as cold as in subpolar climates. They are mostly found on the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]], because this is where there is a large enough landmass to generate extremes in seasonal temperatures, however some areas of Patagonia experience continental climate as well. This climate type is found in northeast Asia, the north-central and north- eastern United States and southern Canada, and [[Eurasia]], in eastern, central and northern [[Europe]], in Patagonia and in mountains of Cuyo.\n\n=== Subpolars ===\nThese are temperate climates that opposite to the subtropicals are on the poleward edge of the temperate zone, therefore still have four marked seasons including a warmer one, but are far more influenced by the poles than any other but the very polar climates ([[Tundra]] and [[Ice cap climate|Icecap]]).\n\n==== Subpolar-Oceanic (Cfc, Cwc, Csc) ====\nAreas with subpolar oceanic climates feature an oceanic climate but are usually located closer to polar regions. As a result of their location, these regions tend to be on the cool end of oceanic climates. Snowfall tends to be more common here than in other oceanic climates. Subpolar oceanic climates are less prone to temperature extremes than [[Subarctic climate|subarctic climates]] or [[Continental climate|continental climates]], featuring milder winters than these climates. This variant of an oceanic climate is found in parts of coastal [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], parts of [[Scotland]], northwestern coastal areas of [[Norway]] such as [[Lofoten]] and reaching to 70\u00b0N on some islands, uplands near the coast of southwestern Norway, the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]] and northern parts of the [[Alaskan Panhandle]], some parts of Southern [[Argentina]] (though most regions still fall as continental subantarctic), and a few highland areas of [[Tasmania]], and the [[Australian Alps|Australian]] and [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]]. This type of climate is even found in the very remote parts of the Papuan Highlands in Indonesia. The classification used for this regime is Cfc. In the most marine of those areas affected by this regime, temperatures above 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) are extreme weather events, even in the midst of summer. Temperatures above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) have been recorded on rare occasions in some areas of this climate, and in winter temperatures down to \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) have seldom been recorded in some areas.\n\n==== Boreal(Austral)/Subpolar (Dfc, Dwc, Dsc, Dfd, Dwd, Dsd) ====\nMostly polewards of Humid Continental zones this climate features extremely cold and long winters, with short mild summers. In very small areas at high altitudes around the Mediterranean Basin, [[Iran]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Alaska]] and other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|northwestern United States]] ([[Eastern Washington]], [[Eastern Oregon]] and [[Southern Idaho]]) and [[Russian Far East|Russian South-Eastern]] regions the climate is classified as ''Dsc'' with a dry summer climate, such as in [[Seneca, Oregon]] or [[Atlin, British Columbia]]. In [[Southern Hemisphere]] it is found in southern [[Patagonia]] (cities like [[Rio Grande (Argentina)|Rio Grande]] and [[Tolhuin]]). This is the closest to the polar climates of all four-season temperate climates as practically all of the year is set up by extremely low temperatures, except for summer.\n\n== Human aspects ==\n\n=== Demography, fauna and flora ===\nThe vast majority of the world's human population resides in temperate zones, especially in the [[northern hemisphere]], due to its greater mass of land.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Hypsographic demography: The distribution of human population by altitude |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |first1=Joel E. |last1=Cohen |first2=Christopher |last2=Small |volume=95 |issue=24 |pages=14009-14014 |date=24 November 1998 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.24.14009 |pmid=9826643 |pmc=24316}}</ref> The biggest described number in temperate region in the world is found in [[southern Africa]], where some 24,000 taxa (species and infraspecific taxa) have been described, but the native fauna and flora of this region does not have much cultural importance for the majority of the human population of the world that lives in Temperate Zones and that live in the Northern Hemisphere, only environmental importance.<ref name=ger>{{cite book |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/NISL/Biodiversity/Attachments/Plants%20of%20SA.pdf |title=Plants of Southern Africa: An Annotated Checklist |publisher=National Botanical Institute |location=Pretoria |series=Strelitzia |editor1-first=Gerrit |editor1-last=Germishuizen |editor2-first=N.

This resulted in a change of its name: the NHH became the NEH, or '''Netherlands School of Economics''' ({{lang|nl|Nederlandse Economische Hogeschool}}). The growing complexity of society led in the 1960s to the arrival of the faculties of Law and Social Sciences, followed in later decades by Philosophy, History and Arts, and Business Administration.\n\nFrom 1950, the Foundation for Higher Clinical Education used its best efforts to get a full academic medical study programme established in Rotterdam, and with success: In 1966, the government established the Medical Faculty Rotterdam, housed next to Dijkzigt Hospital. Together with the Sophia Children's Hospital and the Daniel den Hoed Clinic, it forms the University Hospital Rotterdam, which as of 1 January 2003 bears the name Erasmus MC.\nIn 1973, the Medical Faculty Rotterdam and the Netherlands School of Economics merged, after which the institution was renamed under its current name '''Erasmus University Rotterdam''' \u2013 the first university in the Netherlands named after a person, a man to whom Rotterdam owes the reputation it has held for centuries in the academic world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eur.nl/english/eur/background|title=History|date=14 June 2017|website=www.eur.nl}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nThis domain includes the [[Erasmus MC]], the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) and the Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA).\n\n[[Erasmus MC]] is the new name for the university medical centre in Rotterdam, which is a merger of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the University Hospital Rotterdam (Dijkzigt, Sophia, Daniel den Hoed clinic). The biomedical cluster plays a leading role in the field of analysis of role of individual genes playing role in diseases. The Forensic Molecular Biology department works together with the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). Major long-term [[genetic epidemiology|genetic epidemiological]] studies among the elderly and children are Erasmus Rotterdam Health for the Elderly (ERGO) and Generation R respectively.\nThe Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) forms a bridge between medicine and the health sciences on the one hand and social sciences on the other. The institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA) conducts health economic research in collaboration with both the Erasmus MC and the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management.\n\n===Wealth===\n[[File:ErasmusUniv3.JPG|thumb|Erasmus University main faculty building containing Erasmus School of Economics.]]\nThis area includes the Erasmus School of Economics and the Rotterdam School of Management. Its economics programmes and management programmes attract students and postgraduates from all over the world.\nThe research schools Erasmus Institute for Management (ERIM) and the Tinbergen Institute attract PhD students, research fellows, PostDocs and visiting professors of repute from all corners of the world.\nOther joint ventures are the English-language programme International Business Administration, the Erasmus Executive Development programme (EED) and the Erasmus University Centre for Contract Research and Business Support (ERBS).\n\n[[File:Lustrum sculpture by Ger van Iersel 2.jpg|thumb|180px|Alma Mater statue created by sculptor Ger van Iersel.|left]]\n===Governance===\nThe research focuses on the organisation of business and society. This area has ground in common not only with economics and management, but also with medicine and health sciences.\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Rotterdam universiteit bibliotheek.jpg|thumb|University Library.]]\nAs one of four concentrations of Erasmus University, culture is defined broadly with focus on the areas of media, cultural economics, and the high arts. Primary research is on society and the arts, including cultural policy, media, and social identity in modern society. Faculty has particular strengths in research, and the students tend to graduate with strong research skills for both academic and field placement.\n\n==Research Institutes/Schools==\n\n===Wealth===\n* '''Erasmus Research Institute of Management'''\nThe [[Erasmus Research Institute of Management]] (ERIM) is the joint research institute of the Rotterdam School of Management and the Erasmus School of Economics, both at Erasmus University Rotterdam. It aims to bring together top researchers in business and management.\n\n* '''Econometric Institute'''\nErasmus University today is seen as the leading university in [[Econometrics]] and [[Operational Research]].

This resulted in a change of its name: the NHH became the NEH, or '''Netherlands School of Economics''' ({{lang|nl|Nederlandse Economische Hogeschool}}). The growing complexity of society led in the 1960s to the arrival of the faculties of Law and Social Sciences, followed in later decades by Philosophy, History and Arts, and Business Administration.\n\nFrom 1950, the Foundation for Higher Clinical Education used its best efforts to get a full academic medical study programme established in Rotterdam, and with success: In 1966, the government established the Medical Faculty Rotterdam, housed next to Dijkzigt Hospital. Together with the Sophia Children's Hospital and the Daniel den Hoed Clinic, it forms the University Hospital Rotterdam, which as of 1 January 2003 bears the name Erasmus MC.\nIn 1973, the Medical Faculty Rotterdam and the Netherlands School of Economics merged, after which the institution was renamed under its current name '''Erasmus University Rotterdam''' \u2013 the first university in the Netherlands named after a person, a man to whom Rotterdam owes the reputation it has held for centuries in the academic world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eur.nl/english/eur/background|title=History|date=14 June 2017|website=www.eur.nl}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nThis domain includes the [[Erasmus MC]], the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) and the Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA).\n\n[[Erasmus MC]] is the new name for the university medical centre in Rotterdam, which is a merger of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the University Hospital Rotterdam (Dijkzigt, Sophia, Daniel den Hoed clinic). The biomedical cluster plays a leading role in the field of analysis of role of individual genes playing role in diseases. The Forensic Molecular Biology department works together with the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). Major long-term [[genetic epidemiology|genetic epidemiological]] studies among the elderly and children are Erasmus Rotterdam Health for the Elderly (ERGO) and Generation R respectively.\nThe Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) forms a bridge between medicine and the health sciences on the one hand and social sciences on the other. The institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA) conducts health economic research in collaboration with both the Erasmus MC and the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management.\n\n===Wealth===\n[[File:ErasmusUniv3.JPG|thumb|Erasmus University main faculty building containing Erasmus School of Economics.]]\nThis area includes the Erasmus School of Economics and the Rotterdam School of Management. Its economics programmes and management programmes attract students and postgraduates from all over the world.\nThe research schools Erasmus Institute for Management (ERIM) and the Tinbergen Institute attract PhD students, research fellows, PostDocs and visiting professors of repute from all corners of the world.\nOther joint ventures are the English-language programme International Business Administration, the Erasmus Executive Development programme (EED) and the Erasmus University Centre for Contract Research and Business Support (ERBS).\n\n[[File:Lustrum sculpture by Ger van Iersel 2.jpg|thumb|180px|Alma Mater statue created by sculptor Ger van Iersel.|left]]\n===Governance===\nThe research focuses on the organisation of business and society. This area has ground in common not only with economics and management, but also with medicine and health sciences.\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Rotterdam universiteit bibliotheek.jpg|thumb|University Library.]]\nAs one of four concentrations of Erasmus University, culture is defined broadly with focus on the areas of media, cultural economics, and the high arts. Primary research is on society and the arts, including cultural policy, media, and social identity in modern society. Faculty has particular strengths in research, and the students tend to graduate with strong research skills for both academic and field placement.\n\n==Research Institutes/Schools==\n\n===Wealth===\n* '''Erasmus Research Institute of Management'''\nThe [[Erasmus Research Institute of Management]] (ERIM) is the joint research institute of the Rotterdam School of Management and the Erasmus School of Economics, both at Erasmus University Rotterdam. It aims to bring together top researchers in business and management.\n\n* '''Econometric Institute'''\nErasmus University today is seen as the leading university in [[Econometrics]] and [[Operational Research]].
