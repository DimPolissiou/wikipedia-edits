It was one of the last Saturday morning cartoon series to be fitted with a [[laugh track]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nWhen an evil alien named Mondraggor (voiced by William Woodson) attempted to steal an ancient object called the Pyramid of Power, the pyramid shattered into many pieces, which scattered around the world. Each week, Mondraggor would race against two human siblings, Peter and Peggy Darrow, who were accompanied by three talking [[giant panda|pandas]] named Chesty, Timothy, and Algernon, who were irradiated by the Pyramid's magic. The three of them could unite to form Poppapanda, a being with supernatural power.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/332/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=333}}</ref>\n\nIn the air, Mondraggor possessed control over wind, fire, thunder and lightning. On Earth, however, all of his powers disappeared except for his ability to control people's minds, leading him to brainwash several people in his attempt to claim the pyramid pieces.\n\nThe series was canceled after one season before all of the pieces of the Pyramid of Power were successfully found by the human and panda team. However, they did manage to collect enough pieces by the end of the series to be able to take advantage of their power to a degree in times of need.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! style=\"background:#500050; width:20px\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#500050\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#500050; width:135px\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1 \n| Title = The Beginning \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|9|18}}\n| ShortSummary = Mondraggor tries to steal the Pyramid of Power, but it breaks into hundreds of small pieces, and lands in various locations all over Earth.
