an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 and 8 Pro are the first water-resistant OnePlus phones, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

Austria is a key country in movement of freight between northern and southern Europe and between eastern and western Europe. The Brenner region is very politically sensitive with respect to both local and cross-border transport issues. Between 1970 and 1999, highway freight increased seven-fold. (3 million to 22 million tonnes)\nIn 1990, 70% of the freight from eastern Europe was transported by rail and the remainder by trucks. These proportions were expected to reverse by 2010.<ref name=\"EU Policy 2004\">{{Google books|kspRHY8UfX0C|Contemporary Issues and Debates in EU Policy: The European Union and ...|page=PA182 ff}} {{ISBN|071906418X}}</ref>{{rp|182ff}}\nAbout three-quarters of traffic through the Brenner Pass is currently carried by road transport. Local residents have long fought for relief from the associated pollution.\nThe construction of a rail tunnel is considered by its proponents to be necessary for a shift of freight traffic from road to rail.\n\nThe railway line from Innsbruck to Bozen was built between 1860 and 1867. Tight curve radii and gradients of up to 2.6% complicate rail operations. However, improvements on the Italian side in recent years to the existing line, which were completed in late 2008, allow the line theoretically to accommodate 240 trains per day. The grades were not significantly improved.\n\nThe new Brenner line would have a maximum gradient of 0.4%-0.7%. Thus, a locomotive would be capable of hauling more than double the weight. The new line (the [[base tunnel]] together with the southern approach from [[Waidbruck|Waidbruck/Ponte Gardena]] to [[Franzensfeste|Franzensfeste/Fortezza]]) would cut travel time between Innsbruck and Bolzano from about two hours today to less than half that.\n\n==Project==\n\n===Main tunnel===\n[[File:Galleria TAv.JPG|thumb|left|Start of the [[Tunnel boring machine]] at Aicha/Aica construction site in April 2008]]\n[[File:Cantiere BBT a Mules.jpg|thumb|left|View of Mauls/Mules construction site in summer of 2008]]\nThe {{convert|55|km||abbr=|adj=on}} long, twin-tube tunnel begins in the Innsbruck suburb of Wilten and penetrates the [[Alps]] reaching a height of about {{convert|840|m}} above sea level (ASL). The tunnel will be up to {{convert|1720|m|abbr=on}} below the surface at its deepest point in the [[gneiss]] section stretching south from the Italian border<!--Staatsgrenze-->.<ref name=\"urlwww.tunneltalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|title=Brenner project takes a major leap forward|last=Reynolds|first=Patrick|date=February 2011|website=Tunnel Talk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820150827/http://tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|archive-date=2013-08-20|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> Since under the most recent plan the tunnel starts as a twin-tube tunnel, the junction already prepared in the [[Inntal Tunnel|Inntal tunnel]] on the [[Innsbruck bypass]] will not be used. Instead, a costly diversion with several branches is planned.\n\nThe volume of rock to be excavated during the construction of the tunnel is estimated at {{Convert|21|e6m3||abbr=off}}, of which approximately 60% will be incurred in Austria, as about 60% of the tunnel will be in Austria. A part of the spoil will be used as [[Fill dirt|fill]] for the approach lines and another part of the spoil material is used to produce the concrete segment for the final lining of the tunnel. The main tunnels will have a circular cross section  with a diameter of approx. {{Convert|8.1|m||abbr=on}}\n\nAccording to current planning the apex of the tunnel will be at the border at an altitude of about {{convert|810|m|abbr=on}} ASL, although an apex farther south would have been lower. The placing of the apex at the border is set out in the treaty between Austria and Italy. As justification for this choice it is stated that this will allow Austrian water to run in the tunnel to Austria and Italian water to Italy.\n\n===Northern approach===\n[[File:BBT 18 4 2011.JPG|thumb|left|BBT construction site in [[Sill (river)|Sill river]] seen from Bergisel in April 2011]]\nOn its north end, the base tunnel (BBT) has two entrances, which must go underground a few kilometres before the junction with the main tunnels, and will also be built as part of the BBT. One route leads from the main Innsbruck station under [[Bergisel]] and the other connects with the Innsbruck bypass. This route adds about {{convert|8|km}} more to the length of the tunnel than the Innsbruck station route; with it included, the BBT, at {{convert|62.7|km}}, would become the longest continuous railroad tunnel in the world. However, if the [[Axentunnel]] extension is added to the Gotthard base tunnel, its length would become {{convert|75|km}}, allowing it to reclaim the 'longest tunnel' title.\n\nThe northern approach from Munich within Germany is the {{convert|165|km}} [[Munich\u2013Rosenheim railway|Grafing]]\u2013[[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein]] route.  The \"Brenner Nordzulauf\" (Brenner northern link) project aims to construct a high-speed line for speeds of up to 230&nbsp;km/h (143&nbsp;mph) between [[Grafing]] and [[Brannenburg]] in addition to the existing line, adapting the route's capacity to the projected increase as a result of the BBT.

Austria is a key country in movement of freight between northern and southern Europe and between eastern and western Europe. The Brenner region is very politically sensitive with respect to both local and cross-border transport issues. Between 1970 and 1999, highway freight increased seven-fold. (3 million to 22 million tonnes)\nIn 1990, 70% of the freight from eastern Europe was transported by rail and the remainder by trucks. These proportions were expected to reverse by 2010.<ref name=\"EU Policy 2004\">{{Google books|kspRHY8UfX0C|Contemporary Issues and Debates in EU Policy: The European Union and ...|page=PA182 ff}} {{ISBN|071906418X}}</ref>{{rp|182ff}}\nAbout three-quarters of traffic through the Brenner Pass is currently carried by road transport. Local residents have long fought for relief from the associated pollution.\nThe construction of a rail tunnel is considered by its proponents to be necessary for a shift of freight traffic from road to rail.\n\nThe railway line from Innsbruck to Bozen was built between 1860 and 1867. Tight curve radii and gradients of up to 2.6% complicate rail operations. However, improvements on the Italian side in recent years to the existing line, which were completed in late 2008, allow the line theoretically to accommodate 240 trains per day. The grades were not significantly improved.\n\nThe new Brenner line would have a maximum gradient of 0.4%-0.7%. Thus, a locomotive would be capable of hauling more than double the weight. The new line (the [[base tunnel]] together with the southern approach from [[Waidbruck|Waidbruck/Ponte Gardena]] to [[Franzensfeste|Franzensfeste/Fortezza]]) would cut travel time between Innsbruck and Bolzano from about two hours today to less than half that.\n\n==Project==\n\n===Main tunnel===\n[[File:Galleria TAv.JPG|thumb|left|Start of the [[Tunnel boring machine]] at Aicha/Aica construction site in April 2008]]\n[[File:Cantiere BBT a Mules.jpg|thumb|left|View of Mauls/Mules construction site in summer of 2008]]\nThe {{convert|55|km||abbr=|adj=on}} long, twin-tube tunnel begins in the Innsbruck suburb of Wilten and penetrates the [[Alps]] reaching a height of about {{convert|840|m}} above sea level (ASL). The tunnel will be up to {{convert|1720|m|abbr=on}} below the surface at its deepest point in the [[gneiss]] section stretching south from the Italian border<!--Staatsgrenze-->.<ref name=\"urlwww.tunneltalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|title=Brenner project takes a major leap forward|last=Reynolds|first=Patrick|date=February 2011|website=Tunnel Talk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820150827/http://tunneltalk.com/Brenner-Base-Tunnel-Feb11-A-leap-forward.php|archive-date=2013-08-20|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> Since under the most recent plan the tunnel starts as a twin-tube tunnel, the junction already prepared in the [[Inntal Tunnel|Inntal tunnel]] on the [[Innsbruck bypass]] will not be used. Instead, a costly diversion with several branches is planned.\n\nThe volume of rock to be excavated during the construction of the tunnel is estimated at {{Convert|21|e6m3||abbr=off}}, of which approximately 60% will be incurred in Austria, as about 60% of the tunnel will be in Austria. A part of the spoil will be used as [[Fill dirt|fill]] for the approach lines and another part of the spoil material is used to produce the concrete segment for the final lining of the tunnel. The main tunnels will have a circular cross section  with a diameter of approx. {{Convert|8.1|m||abbr=on}}\n\nAccording to current planning the apex of the tunnel will be at the border at an altitude of about {{convert|810|m|abbr=on}} ASL, although an apex farther south would have been lower. The placing of the apex at the border is set out in the treaty between Austria and Italy. As justification for this choice it is stated that this will allow Austrian water to run in the tunnel to Austria and Italian water to Italy.\n\n===Northern approach===\n[[File:BBT 18 4 2011.JPG|thumb|left|BBT construction site in [[Sill (river)|Sill river]] seen from Bergisel in April 2011]]\nOn its north end, the base tunnel (BBT) has two entrances, which must go underground a few kilometres before the junction with the main tunnels, and will also be built as part of the BBT. One route leads from the main Innsbruck station under [[Bergisel]] and the other connects with the Innsbruck bypass. This route adds about {{convert|8|km}} more to the length of the tunnel than the Innsbruck station route; with it included, the BBT, at {{convert|62.7|km}}, would become the longest continuous railroad tunnel in the world. However, if the [[Axentunnel]] extension is added to the Gotthard base tunnel, its length would become {{convert|75|km}}, allowing it to reclaim the 'longest tunnel' title.\n\nThe northern approach from Munich within Germany is the {{convert|165|km}} [[Munich\u2013Rosenheim railway|Grafing]]\u2013[[Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein railway|Rosenheim\u2013Kufstein]] route.  The \"Brenner Nordzulauf\" (Brenner northern link) project aims to construct a high-speed line for speeds of up to 230&nbsp;km/h (143&nbsp;mph) between [[Grafing]] and [[Brannenburg]] in addition to the existing line, adapting the route's capacity to the projected increase as a result of the BBT.

An apartment building or student [[hall of residence]] may have a shared laundry facility such as a ''[[tv\u00e4ttstuga]]''. A stand-alone business is referred to as a [[self-service laundry]] (launderette in [[British English]] or laundromat in [[North American]] and [[Australasia]]). The material that is being washed, or has been laundered, is also generally referred to as ''laundry''.\n\nLaundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship. Laundry work has traditionally been [[Occupational segregation|highly gendered]], with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (known as laundresses or [[washerwoman|washerwomen]]). The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanised solutions to laundry work, notably the [[washing machine]] and later the [[tumble dryer]]. Laundry, like cooking and child care, is done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.<ref>https://thescrubba.com/blogs/news/how-people-used-to-wash-the-fascinating-history-of-laundry</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Watercourses ===\n[[File:Laundry 1806.PNG|thumb|\"Man and woman washing linen in a brook\", from [[William Henry Pyne]]'s ''Microcosm'' (1806). Unusually, this is depicted as a mixed-sex activity.]]\n\nLaundry was first done in watercourses, letting the water carry away the materials which could cause stains and smells. Laundry is still done this way in the rural regions of poor countries. [[Agitation (action)|Agitation]] helps remove the dirt, so the laundry was rubbed, twisted, or slapped against flat rocks. One name for this surface is a beetling-stone, related to [[beetling]], a technique in the production of linen; one name for a wooden substitute is a battling-block.<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|last1=Katz-Hyman|first1=Martha B.|last2=editors|first2=Kym S.

Wooden or stone scrubbing surfaces set up near a water supply were gradually replaced by portable rub boards, including factory-made corrugated glass or metal [[washboard (laundry)|washboards]].\n\nOnce clean, the clothes were rinsed and then wrung out \u2014 twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or [[clothes line]]s to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass, bushes, or trees. Finally, they were ironed.\n\n=== Washhouses ===\n{{Main|Lavoir}}\n[[File:Brogi, Carlo (1850-1925) - n. 12182 - Sanremo - Popolane al lavatojo.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Sanremo]], Italy, at about the turn of the 20th century]]\n[[File:Tanque das Lavandeiras - comunitario II.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Cabe\u00e7\u00e3o]], Portugal, today. Note the two basins and inclined stone lip.]]\nBefore the advent of the [[washing machine]], laundry was often done in a communal setting.\n\nVillages across Europe that could afford it built a wash-house, sometimes known by the French name of ''[[lavoir]]''. Water was channelled from a stream or spring and fed into a building, possibly just a roof with no walls. This wash-house usually contained two basins \u2013 one for washing and the other for rinsing \u2013 through which the water was constantly flowing, as well as a stone lip inclined towards the water against which the wet laundry could be beaten. Such facilities were more comfortable and convenient than washing in a watercourse. Some lavoirs had the wash-basins at waist height, although others remained on the ground. The launderers were protected to some extent from rain, and their travel was reduced, as the facilities were usually at hand in the village or at the edge of a town. These facilities were public and available to all families, and usually used by the entire village. Many of these village wash-houses are still standing, historic structures with no obvious modern purpose.\n\nThe job of doing the laundry was [[occupational segregation|reserved for women]], who washed all their family's laundry. [[Washerwoman|Washerwomen]] (laundresses) took in the laundry of others, charging by the piece. As such, wash-houses were an obligatory stop in many women's weekly lives and became a sort of institution or meeting place. It was a [[women-only space]] where they could discuss issues or simply chat (cf the concept of the [[village pump]]). Indeed, this tradition is reflected in the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] idiom \"''fer safareig''\" (literally, \"to do the laundry\"), which means to gossip.\n\nEuropean cities also had public wash-houses. The city authorities wanted to give the poorer population, who would otherwise not have access to laundry facilities, the opportunity to wash their clothes. Sometimes these facilities were combined with [[public baths]], see for example [[Baths and wash houses in Britain]]. The aim was to foster hygiene and thus reduce outbreaks of epidemics.\n\nSometimes large metal cauldrons (a \"[[wash copper]]\", even when not made of that metal),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Clarendon Press|edition= Second|volume=III|isbn=0-19-861215-X|page=908: copper 3.a}}</ref> were filled with fresh water and heated over a fire, as hot or boiling water is more effective than cold in removing dirt. A [[posser]] could be used to agitate clothes in a tub.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldandinteresting.com/laundry-ponches-punches.aspx |title=Ponch, punch or ? |publisher=OldandInteresting.com |accessdate=2014-03-06}}</ref> A related implement called a washing dolly is \"a wooden stick or mallet with an attached cluster of legs or pegs\" that moves the cloth through the water.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maxwell|first1=Lee|title=Save womens lives : history of washing machines|date=2003|publisher=Oldewash|location=Eaton, CO|isbn=9780972971003|page=8|edition= 1st}}</ref>\n\n=== Washing machines and other devices ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Woman's Friend - Indiana State Museum - DSC00433.JPG|thumb|The \"Woman's Friend\" washing machine, circa 1890 U.S.]]\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] completely transformed laundry technology. [[Christina Hardyment]], in her history from the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, argues that it was the development of domestic machinery that led to [[women's liberation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hardyment|first1=Christina|title=From mangle to microwave : the mechanization of household work|date=1988|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0745602061|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/frommangletomicr0000hard}}</ref>\n\nThe [[mangle (machine)|mangle]] (or \"wringer\" in [[American English]]) was developed in the 19th century \u2014 two long rollers in a frame and a crank to revolve them. A laundry-worker took sopping wet clothing and cranked it through the mangle, compressing the cloth and expelling the excess water. The mangle was much quicker than hand twisting. It was a variation on the [[box mangle]] used primarily for pressing and smoothing cloth.\n\nMeanwhile, 19th-century inventors further mechanized the laundry process with various hand-operated [[washing machine]]s to replace tedious hand rubbing against a washboard. Most involved turning a handle to move paddles inside a tub. Then some early-20th-century machines used an electrically powered [[agitator (device)|agitator]]. Many of these washing machines were simply a tub on legs, with a hand-operated mangle on top. Later the mangle too was electrically powered, then replaced by a perforated double tub, which spun out the excess water in a spin cycle.\n\nLaundry drying was also mechanized, with [[clothes dryer]]s. Dryers were also spinning perforated tubs, but they blew heated air rather than water.\n\n=== Chinese laundries in North America ===\n{{See also|Yick Wo v. Hopkins}}\n\nIn the United States and Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century, the occupation of laundry worker was heavily identified with the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. Discrimination, lack of English-language skills, and lack of [[capital (economics)|capital]] kept Chinese immigrants out of most desirable careers. Around 1900, one in four ethnic Chinese men in the U.S. worked in a laundry, typically working 10 to 16 hours a day.<ref name=CHLA>{{citation|chapter=Declaration of the Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance.|pages=183\u2013185 (including notes)|editor1-first=Judy|editor1-last=Yung|editor2-first=Gordon H.|editor2-last=Chang|editor3-first=Him Mark|editor3-last=Lai|title=Chinese American Voices|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-520-24310-2}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Ban Seng Hoe <!-- not using First and Last as this is pure Chinese name, not sure if appropriate -->|title=Enduring Hardship: The Chinese Laundry in Canada|publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization|year=2004|isbn=0-660-19078-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese in New York City|New York City]] had an estimated 3,550 Chinese laundries at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. In 1933, with even this looking to many people like a relatively desirable business, the city's Board of Aldermen passed a law clearly intended to drive the Chinese out of the business. Among other things, it limited ownership of laundries to U.S. citizens. The [[Chinese Six Companies#New York|Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]] tried fruitlessly to fend this off, resulting in the formation of the openly [[left-wing politics|leftist]] [[Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance]] (CHLA), which successfully challenged this provision of the law, allowing Chinese laundry workers to preserve their livelihoods.<ref name=CHLA />\n\nThe CHLA went on to function as a more general [[civil rights]] group; its numbers declined strongly after it was targeted by the [[FBI]] during the [[Red Scare#'Second Red Scare' (1947\u20131957)|Second Red Scare]] (1947\u20131957).<ref name=CHLA />\n\nNote that the phrase \"Chinese laundry\" as in \"We set up a Chinese laundry in our ski lodge\" is not a reference to the social history described above, but indicates an impromtu [[clothes horse]] arrangement, a usually temporary system of indoor or veranda clothes-lines, whether well-organized or crudely-improvised, that have been rigged up to get clothes dry. The phrase is presumably kept alive less by historical memories of Chinese laundries in Western countries than by the colorful displays of washing that visitors to China often remark upon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2239084|title=Now that's a Chinese laundry! Washing hung out on students' balconies creates a bright rainbow patchwork of colours|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn India, laundry was traditionally done by men. A washerman was called a ''dhobiwallah'', and ''[[dhobi]]'' became the name of their [[caste]] group. The places where they work or worked include [[Dhobi Ghat]] in Mumbai. There are approx 7,65,000 laundries present in India, So on the idea of Dhobi Ghat A startup is opened in chennai named [https://www.dhobig.com Dhobi G]  which is short form of Dhobi Ghat. Also it gives respect to caste Dhobi. Related to this is [[Dhoby Ghaut]] in Singapore and [[Dhoby Ghaut, Penang]] in Malaysia.\n\n===Ancient Rome===\nThe workers in ancient [[Rome]] who cleaned the cloth were called ''fullones'', singular ''[[fullo]]'' (cf [[fulling]], a process in wool-making, and [[Fuller's earth]], used to clean). Clothes were treated in small tubs standing in niches surrounded by low walls, known as treading or fulling stalls. The tub was filled with water and a mixture of alkaline chemicals (sometimes including urine). The fuller stood in the tub and trampled the cloth, a technique known elsewhere as [[Posting (laundering process)|posting]]. The aim of this treatment was to apply the chemical agents to the cloth so that they could do their work, the resolving of greases and fats. These stalls are so typical of these workshops that they are used to identify ''fullonicae'' in the archaeological remains.\n\n==Laundry processes==\nLaundry processes include washing (usually with water containing detergents or other chemicals), agitation, rinsing, drying, pressing (ironing), and [[Self-service laundry#Fluff and Fold services|folding]]. The washing will often be done at a temperature above room temperature to increase the activities of any chemicals used and the solubility of stains, and high temperatures kill micro-organisms that may be present on the fabric. Many professional laundry services are present in the market which offers at different price range.\n\nAgitation helps remove dirt which is usually mobilised by surfactants from between fibres, however, due to the small size of the pores in fibres, the 'stagnant core' of the fibres themselves see virtually no flow. The fibres are nevertheless rapidly cleaned by [[diffusiophoresis]] carrying dirt out into the clean water during the rinsing process.<ref>https://physicsworld.com/a/clothes-washing-mystery-solved-by-physicists/</ref>\n\n===Chemicals===\nVarious chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in [[Chlorogalum|soaproot]] or yucca-root used by Native American tribes, or the ash [[lye]] (usually [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]]) once widely used for soaking laundry in Europe. [[Soap]], a compound made from lye and fat, is an ancient and common laundry aid. Modern [[washing machine]]s typically use synthetic powdered or liquid [[laundry detergent]] in place of more traditional soap.\n\n===Cleaning or dry cleaning===\n{{main|Dry cleaning}}\n[[Image:Dry clean rack.jpg|thumb|Many dry cleaners place cleaned clothes inside thin clear plastic garment bags.]]\nDry cleaning refers to any process which uses a chemical [[solvent]] other than water.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Does The Dry Cleaning Process Work?|url=http://www.laundroxpress.com/dry-cleaning-process-work/|publisher=LX|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=Dry cleaning is the process of deep cleaning clothing without using water.

Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a [[Currency detector|coin slot]].\n\nIn other parts of the world, including Europe, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial [[self-service laundry]] (laundromat, laundrette) or a laundry shop, such as [[5\u00e0sec]].\n\n== Right to dry movement==\n{{See also|Project Laundry List}}\nSome American communities forbid their residents from drying clothes outside, and citizens protesting this have created a \"right to dry\" movement. Many [[homeowners' associations]] and other communities in the United States prohibit residents from using a clothesline outdoors, or limit such use to locations that are not visible from the street or to certain times of day. Other communities, however, expressly prohibit rules that prevent the use of clotheslines. Some organizations have been campaigning against legislation which has outlawed line-drying of clothing in public places, especially given the increased [[greenhouse gas]] emissions produced by some types of electrical power generation needed to power electric clothes dryers, since driers can constitute a considerable fraction of a home's total energy usage.\n\nFlorida (\"the Sunshine State\") is the only state to expressly guarantee a right to dry, although Utah and Hawaii have passed solar rights legislation.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} A Florida law explicitly states: \"No deed restrictions, covenants, or similar binding agreements running with the land shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting solar collectors, clotheslines, or other energy devices based on renewable resources from being installed on buildings erected on the lots or parcels covered by the deed restrictions, covenants, or binding agreements.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=Ch0163/SEC04.HTM&Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0163-%3ESection%2004#0163.04|title=The 2008 Florida Statutes (chapter: Energy devices based on renewable resources)|volume=163|issue=4|year=2008|publisher=[[Florida Senate]]|journal=|access-date=2020-02-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503144033/http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute#0163.04|archive-date=2007-05-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> No other state has such clearcut legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Vermont considered a \"Right to Dry\" bill in 1999, but it was defeated in the Senate Natural Resources & Energy Committee.

An apartment building or student [[hall of residence]] may have a shared laundry facility such as a ''[[tv\u00e4ttstuga]]''. A stand-alone business is referred to as a [[self-service laundry]] (launderette in [[British English]] or laundromat in [[North American]] and [[Australasia]]). The material that is being washed, or has been laundered, is also generally referred to as ''laundry''.\n\nLaundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship. Laundry work has traditionally been [[Occupational segregation|highly gendered]], with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (known as laundresses or [[washerwoman|washerwomen]]). The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanised solutions to laundry work, notably the [[washing machine]] and later the [[tumble dryer]]. Laundry, like cooking and child care, is done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.<ref>https://thescrubba.com/blogs/news/how-people-used-to-wash-the-fascinating-history-of-laundry</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Watercourses ===\n[[File:Laundry 1806.PNG|thumb|\"Man and woman washing linen in a brook\", from [[William Henry Pyne]]'s ''Microcosm'' (1806). Unusually, this is depicted as a mixed-sex activity.]]\n\nLaundry was first done in watercourses, letting the water carry away the materials which could cause stains and smells. Laundry is still done this way in the rural regions of poor countries. [[Agitation (action)|Agitation]] helps remove the dirt, so the laundry was rubbed, twisted, or slapped against flat rocks. One name for this surface is a beetling-stone, related to [[beetling]], a technique in the production of linen; one name for a wooden substitute is a battling-block.<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|last1=Katz-Hyman|first1=Martha B.|last2=editors|first2=Kym S.

Wooden or stone scrubbing surfaces set up near a water supply were gradually replaced by portable rub boards, including factory-made corrugated glass or metal [[washboard (laundry)|washboards]].\n\nOnce clean, the clothes were rinsed and then wrung out \u2014 twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or [[clothes line]]s to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass, bushes, or trees. Finally, they were ironed.\n\n=== Washhouses ===\n{{Main|Lavoir}}\n[[File:Brogi, Carlo (1850-1925) - n. 12182 - Sanremo - Popolane al lavatojo.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Sanremo]], Italy, at about the turn of the 20th century]]\n[[File:Tanque das Lavandeiras - comunitario II.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Cabe\u00e7\u00e3o]], Portugal, today. Note the two basins and inclined stone lip.]]\nBefore the advent of the [[washing machine]], laundry was often done in a communal setting.\n\nVillages across Europe that could afford it built a wash-house, sometimes known by the French name of ''[[lavoir]]''. Water was channelled from a stream or spring and fed into a building, possibly just a roof with no walls. This wash-house usually contained two basins \u2013 one for washing and the other for rinsing \u2013 through which the water was constantly flowing, as well as a stone lip inclined towards the water against which the wet laundry could be beaten. Such facilities were more comfortable and convenient than washing in a watercourse. Some lavoirs had the wash-basins at waist height, although others remained on the ground. The launderers were protected to some extent from rain, and their travel was reduced, as the facilities were usually at hand in the village or at the edge of a town. These facilities were public and available to all families, and usually used by the entire village. Many of these village wash-houses are still standing, historic structures with no obvious modern purpose.\n\nThe job of doing the laundry was [[occupational segregation|reserved for women]], who washed all their family's laundry. [[Washerwoman|Washerwomen]] (laundresses) took in the laundry of others, charging by the piece. As such, wash-houses were an obligatory stop in many women's weekly lives and became a sort of institution or meeting place. It was a [[women-only space]] where they could discuss issues or simply chat (cf the concept of the [[village pump]]). Indeed, this tradition is reflected in the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] idiom \"''fer safareig''\" (literally, \"to do the laundry\"), which means to gossip.\n\nEuropean cities also had public wash-houses. The city authorities wanted to give the poorer population, who would otherwise not have access to laundry facilities, the opportunity to wash their clothes. Sometimes these facilities were combined with [[public baths]], see for example [[Baths and wash houses in Britain]]. The aim was to foster hygiene and thus reduce outbreaks of epidemics.\n\nSometimes large metal cauldrons (a \"[[wash copper]]\", even when not made of that metal),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Clarendon Press|edition= Second|volume=III|isbn=0-19-861215-X|page=908: copper 3.a}}</ref> were filled with fresh water and heated over a fire, as hot or boiling water is more effective than cold in removing dirt. A [[posser]] could be used to agitate clothes in a tub.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldandinteresting.com/laundry-ponches-punches.aspx |title=Ponch, punch or ? |publisher=OldandInteresting.com |accessdate=2014-03-06}}</ref> A related implement called a washing dolly is \"a wooden stick or mallet with an attached cluster of legs or pegs\" that moves the cloth through the water.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maxwell|first1=Lee|title=Save womens lives : history of washing machines|date=2003|publisher=Oldewash|location=Eaton, CO|isbn=9780972971003|page=8|edition= 1st}}</ref>\n\n=== Washing machines and other devices ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Woman's Friend - Indiana State Museum - DSC00433.JPG|thumb|The \"Woman's Friend\" washing machine, circa 1890 U.S.]]\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] completely transformed laundry technology. [[Christina Hardyment]], in her history from the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, argues that it was the development of domestic machinery that led to [[women's liberation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hardyment|first1=Christina|title=From mangle to microwave : the mechanization of household work|date=1988|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0745602061|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/frommangletomicr0000hard}}</ref>\n\nThe [[mangle (machine)|mangle]] (or \"wringer\" in [[American English]]) was developed in the 19th century \u2014 two long rollers in a frame and a crank to revolve them. A laundry-worker took sopping wet clothing and cranked it through the mangle, compressing the cloth and expelling the excess water. The mangle was much quicker than hand twisting. It was a variation on the [[box mangle]] used primarily for pressing and smoothing cloth.\n\nMeanwhile, 19th-century inventors further mechanized the laundry process with various hand-operated [[washing machine]]s to replace tedious hand rubbing against a washboard. Most involved turning a handle to move paddles inside a tub. Then some early-20th-century machines used an electrically powered [[agitator (device)|agitator]]. Many of these washing machines were simply a tub on legs, with a hand-operated mangle on top. Later the mangle too was electrically powered, then replaced by a perforated double tub, which spun out the excess water in a spin cycle.\n\nLaundry drying was also mechanized, with [[clothes dryer]]s. Dryers were also spinning perforated tubs, but they blew heated air rather than water.\n\n=== Chinese laundries in North America ===\n{{See also|Yick Wo v. Hopkins}}\n\nIn the United States and Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century, the occupation of laundry worker was heavily identified with the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. Discrimination, lack of English-language skills, and lack of [[capital (economics)|capital]] kept Chinese immigrants out of most desirable careers. Around 1900, one in four ethnic Chinese men in the U.S. worked in a laundry, typically working 10 to 16 hours a day.<ref name=CHLA>{{citation|chapter=Declaration of the Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance.|pages=183\u2013185 (including notes)|editor1-first=Judy|editor1-last=Yung|editor2-first=Gordon H.|editor2-last=Chang|editor3-first=Him Mark|editor3-last=Lai|title=Chinese American Voices|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-520-24310-2}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Ban Seng Hoe <!-- not using First and Last as this is pure Chinese name, not sure if appropriate -->|title=Enduring Hardship: The Chinese Laundry in Canada|publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization|year=2004|isbn=0-660-19078-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese in New York City|New York City]] had an estimated 3,550 Chinese laundries at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. In 1933, with even this looking to many people like a relatively desirable business, the city's Board of Aldermen passed a law clearly intended to drive the Chinese out of the business. Among other things, it limited ownership of laundries to U.S. citizens. The [[Chinese Six Companies#New York|Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]] tried fruitlessly to fend this off, resulting in the formation of the openly [[left-wing politics|leftist]] [[Chinese Hand Laundry Alliance]] (CHLA), which successfully challenged this provision of the law, allowing Chinese laundry workers to preserve their livelihoods.<ref name=CHLA />\n\nThe CHLA went on to function as a more general [[civil rights]] group; its numbers declined strongly after it was targeted by the [[FBI]] during the [[Red Scare#'Second Red Scare' (1947\u20131957)|Second Red Scare]] (1947\u20131957).<ref name=CHLA />\n\nNote that the phrase \"Chinese laundry\" as in \"We set up a Chinese laundry in our ski lodge\" is not a reference to the social history described above, but indicates an impromtu [[clothes horse]] arrangement, a usually temporary system of indoor or veranda clothes-lines, whether well-organized or crudely-improvised, that have been rigged up to get clothes dry. The phrase is presumably kept alive less by historical memories of Chinese laundries in Western countries than by the colorful displays of washing that visitors to China often remark upon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2239084|title=Now that's a Chinese laundry! Washing hung out on students' balconies creates a bright rainbow patchwork of colours|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn India, laundry was traditionally done by men. A washerman was called a ''dhobiwallah'', and ''[[dhobi]]'' became the name of their [[caste]] group. The places where they work or worked include [[Dhobi Ghat]] in Mumbai. Related to this is [[Dhoby Ghaut]] in Singapore and [[Dhoby Ghaut, Penang]] in Malaysia.\n\n===Ancient Rome===\nThe workers in ancient [[Rome]] who cleaned the cloth were called ''fullones'', singular ''[[fullo]]'' (cf [[fulling]], a process in wool-making, and [[Fuller's earth]], used to clean). Clothes were treated in small tubs standing in niches surrounded by low walls, known as treading or fulling stalls. The tub was filled with water and a mixture of alkaline chemicals (sometimes including urine). The fuller stood in the tub and trampled the cloth, a technique known elsewhere as [[Posting (laundering process)|posting]]. The aim of this treatment was to apply the chemical agents to the cloth so that they could do their work, the resolving of greases and fats. These stalls are so typical of these workshops that they are used to identify ''fullonicae'' in the archaeological remains.\n\n==Laundry processes==\nLaundry processes include washing (usually with water containing detergents or other chemicals), agitation, rinsing, drying, pressing (ironing), and [[Self-service laundry#Fluff and Fold services|folding]]. The washing will often be done at a temperature above room temperature to increase the activities of any chemicals used and the solubility of stains, and high temperatures kill micro-organisms that may be present on the fabric. Many professional laundry services are present in the market which offers at different price range.\n\nAgitation helps remove dirt which is usually mobilised by surfactants from between fibres, however, due to the small size of the pores in fibres, the 'stagnant core' of the fibres themselves see virtually no flow. The fibres are nevertheless rapidly cleaned by [[diffusiophoresis]] carrying dirt out into the clean water during the rinsing process.<ref>https://physicsworld.com/a/clothes-washing-mystery-solved-by-physicists/</ref>\n\n===Chemicals===\nVarious chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in [[Chlorogalum|soaproot]] or yucca-root used by Native American tribes, or the ash [[lye]] (usually [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]]) once widely used for soaking laundry in Europe. [[Soap]], a compound made from lye and fat, is an ancient and common laundry aid. Modern [[washing machine]]s typically use synthetic powdered or liquid [[laundry detergent]] in place of more traditional soap.\n\n===Cleaning or dry cleaning===\n{{main|Dry cleaning}}\n[[Image:Dry clean rack.jpg|thumb|Many dry cleaners place cleaned clothes inside thin clear plastic garment bags.]]\nDry cleaning refers to any process which uses a chemical [[solvent]] other than water.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Does The Dry Cleaning Process Work?|url=http://www.laundroxpress.com/dry-cleaning-process-work/|publisher=LX|accessdate=21 November 2014|quote=Dry cleaning is the process of deep cleaning clothing without using water.

Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a [[Currency detector|coin slot]].\n\nIn other parts of the world, including Europe, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial [[self-service laundry]] (laundromat, laundrette) or a laundry shop, such as [[5\u00e0sec]].\n\n== Right to dry movement==\n{{See also|Project Laundry List}}\nSome American communities forbid their residents from drying clothes outside, and citizens protesting this have created a \"right to dry\" movement. Many [[homeowners' associations]] and other communities in the United States prohibit residents from using a clothesline outdoors, or limit such use to locations that are not visible from the street or to certain times of day. Other communities, however, expressly prohibit rules that prevent the use of clotheslines. Some organizations have been campaigning against legislation which has outlawed line-drying of clothing in public places, especially given the increased [[greenhouse gas]] emissions produced by some types of electrical power generation needed to power electric clothes dryers, since driers can constitute a considerable fraction of a home's total energy usage.\n\nFlorida (\"the Sunshine State\") is the only state to expressly guarantee a right to dry, although Utah and Hawaii have passed solar rights legislation.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} A Florida law explicitly states: \"No deed restrictions, covenants, or similar binding agreements running with the land shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting solar collectors, clotheslines, or other energy devices based on renewable resources from being installed on buildings erected on the lots or parcels covered by the deed restrictions, covenants, or binding agreements.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=Ch0163/SEC04.HTM&Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0163-%3ESection%2004#0163.04|title=The 2008 Florida Statutes (chapter: Energy devices based on renewable resources)|volume=163|issue=4|year=2008|publisher=[[Florida Senate]]|journal=|access-date=2020-02-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503144033/http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute#0163.04|archive-date=2007-05-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> No other state has such clearcut legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Vermont considered a \"Right to Dry\" bill in 1999, but it was defeated in the Senate Natural Resources & Energy Committee.

This handbook noted opportunities for looting, and named potentially dangerous anti-Nazi institutions including [[Freemasonry|Masonic lodges]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Boy Scouts]]. On 17 September 1940, SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Dr [[Franz Six]] was designated to a position in London where he would implement the post-invasion arrests and actions against institutions, but on the same day, Hitler postponed the invasion indefinitely.{{sfn|Shirer|2011|pp=937, 939}} In September 1945, at the end of the war, the list was discovered in Berlin. Reporting included the reactions of some of the people listed.{{sfn | Guardian, Berlin | 1945}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|right|upright| SS functionary [[Walter Schellenberg]] said he had compiled the Black Book]]\n\nThe list was similar to earlier lists prepared by the SS,{{sfn | Forces War Records | 2017}} such as the [[Special Prosecution Book-Poland]] ({{lang-de|Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen}}) prepared before the [[World War II|Second World War]] by members of the German [[fifth column]] in cooperation with German Intelligence, and used to target the 61,000 Polish people on this list during [[Operation Tannenberg]] and [[Intelligenzaktion]] in occupied Poland between 1939 and 1941.\n\nRapid German victories led quickly to the [[Fall of France]] and British forces had to be withdrawn during the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], with the Nazi spearhead reaching the coast on 21 May 1940. It was only then that the prospect of invading Britain was raised with Hitler, and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German high command]] did not issue any orders for preparations until 2 July.  Eventually, on 16 July, Hitler issued his Directive no. 16 ordering preparation for invasion, codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]].{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=35\u201341}}\n\nGerman intelligence set out to provide their invading forces with encyclopaedic handbooks giving useful information.  Seven maps, each covering the whole of the [[British Isles]], covered different topographical aspects. A book provided 174 photographs, mostly [[aerial photography]], supplemented with views cut out from newspapers and magazines. A mass of information was included in a book on ''Military-Geographical Data about England''. Only one book was marked secret, the ''Informationsheft GB''.{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=191\u2013192}} [[Walter Schellenberg]] wrote in his memoirs that \"at the end of June 1940 I was ordered to prepare a small handbook for the invading troops and the political and administrative units that would accompany them, describing briefly the most important political, administrative and economic institutions of Great Britain and the leading public figures.\"<ref name=\"Doerries2013\" />\n\n==Description==\nThe ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' was an appendix or supplement to the secret handbook ''[[Informationsheft Grossbritannien]]'' (''Informationsheft GB'') which provided information for German security services about institutions thought likely to resist the Nazis, including the private [[public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Boy Scouts]]. A general survey of British museums and art galleries suggested opportunities for looting. The handbook described the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|organisation of the British police]], and had a section analysing the [[British intelligence agencies]]. Following this, four pages had around 30 passport-sized photographs of individuals who also appeared in the appendix.{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=192\u2013195}}\n\nThe appendix, of 104 pages, was a list in alphabetical order<ref>Walter Schellenberg, ''The Schellenberg Memoirs'', London 1956 (Deutsch: Aufzeichungen, M\u00fcnchen 1979)</ref><ref>Invasion 1940.

Churchill was to be placed into the custody of Amt VI  ([[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|Ausland-SD]], Foreign Intelligence), but the vast majority of the people listed in the Black Book would be placed into the custody of Amt IV ([[Gestapo]]). The book had some significant errors, such as people who had died ([[Lytton Strachey]], died in 1932) or were no longer based in the UK ([[Paul Robeson]], moved back to the United States in 1939), and omissions (such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], one of the few English language writers whose works were published and performed in Nazi Germany).<ref name = Schellenberg>Schellenberg, ''Invasion, 1940'', p. 150</ref>\n\nThe dimension of the booklet is given as {{convert|19|cm|in}}, and \"[[wikt:geheim|Geheim!]]\" (\"Secret!\") is printed on the cover.

This handbook noted opportunities for looting, and named potentially dangerous anti-Nazi institutions including [[Freemasonry|Masonic lodges]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Boy Scouts]]. On 17 September 1940, SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Dr [[Franz Six]] was designated to a position in London where he would implement the post-invasion arrests and actions against institutions, but on the same day, Hitler postponed the invasion indefinitely.{{sfn|Shirer|2011|pp=937, 939}} In September 1945, at the end of the war, the list was discovered in Berlin. Reporting included the reactions of some of the people listed.{{sfn | Guardian, Berlin | 1945}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|right|upright| SS functionary [[Walter Schellenberg]] said he had compiled the Black Book]]\n\nThe list was similar to earlier lists prepared by the SS,{{sfn | Forces War Records | 2017}} such as the [[Special Prosecution Book-Poland]] ({{lang-de|Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen}}) prepared before the [[World War II|Second World War]] by members of the German [[fifth column]] in cooperation with German Intelligence, and used to target the 61,000 Polish people on this list during [[Operation Tannenberg]] and [[Intelligenzaktion]] in occupied Poland between 1939 and 1941.\n\nRapid German victories led quickly to the [[Fall of France]] and British forces had to be withdrawn during the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], with the Nazi spearhead reaching the coast on 21 May 1940. It was only then that the prospect of invading Britain was raised with Hitler, and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German high command]] did not issue any orders for preparations until 2 July.  Eventually, on 16 July, Hitler issued his Directive no. 16 ordering preparation for invasion, codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]].{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=35\u201341}}\n\nGerman intelligence set out to provide their invading forces with encyclopaedic handbooks giving useful information.  Seven maps, each covering the whole of the [[British Isles]], covered different topographical aspects. A book provided 174 photographs, mostly [[aerial photography]], supplemented with views cut out from newspapers and magazines. A mass of information was included in a book on ''Military-Geographical Data about England''. Only one book was marked secret, the ''Informationsheft GB''.{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=191\u2013192}} [[Walter Schellenberg]] wrote in his memoirs that \"at the end of June 1940 I was ordered to prepare a small handbook for the invading troops and the political and administrative units that would accompany them, describing briefly the most important political, administrative and economic institutions of Great Britain and the leading public figures.\"<ref name=\"Doerries2013\" />\n\n==Description==\nThe ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' was an appendix or supplement to the secret handbook ''[[Informationsheft Grossbritannien]]'' (''Informationsheft GB'') which provided information for German security services about institutions thought likely to resist the Nazis, including the private [[public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Boy Scouts]]. A general survey of British museums and art galleries suggested opportunities for looting. The handbook described the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|organisation of the British police]], and had a section analysing the [[British intelligence agencies]]. Following this, four pages had around 30 passport-sized photographs of individuals who also appeared in the appendix.{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=192\u2013195}}\n\nThe appendix, of 104 pages, was a list in alphabetical order<ref>Walter Schellenberg, ''The Schellenberg Memoirs'', London 1956 (Deutsch: Aufzeichungen, M\u00fcnchen 1979)</ref><ref>Invasion 1940.

Churchill was to be placed into the custody of Amt VI  ([[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|Ausland-SD]], Foreign Intelligence), but the vast majority of the people listed in the Black Book would be placed into the custody of Amt IV ([[Gestapo]]). The book had some significant errors, such as people who had died ([[Lytton Strachey]], died in 1932) or were no longer based in the UK ([[Paul Robeson]], moved back to the United States in 1939), and omissions (such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], one of the few English language writers whose works were published and performed in Nazi Germany).<ref name = Schellenberg>Schellenberg, ''Invasion, 1940'', p. 150</ref>\n\nThe dimension of the booklet is given as {{convert|19|cm|in}}, and \"[[wikt:geheim|Geheim!]]\" (\"Secret!\") is printed on the cover.

The regulation of this [[gene]] is more [[Complexity|complex]] than most other genes in the ''[[E. coli]]'' [[genome]], as Fis is an important [[protein]] which regulates [[Gene expression|expression]] of other genes. It is supposed that ''fis'' is regulated by [[H-NS]], [[IHF (protein)|IHF]] and [[cAMP receptor protein|CRP]]. It also regulates its own expression ([[autoregulation]]). Fis is one of the most abundant DNA binding proteins in Escherichia coli under nutrient-rich growth conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n''Fis'' was first discovered for its role in stimulating Gin catalyzed inversion of the G segment of phage Mu genome.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Koch C., Kahmann R. | year = 1986 | title = Purification and properties of the Escherichia coli host factor required for inversion of the G segment in bacteriophage Mu | url = | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 261 | issue = | pages = 15673\u201315678 }}</ref>  Fis was originally identified as the factor for inversion stimulation of the homologous Hin and Gin site-specific DNA recombinases of Salmonella and phage Mu, respectively. This small, basic, DNA-bending protein has recently been shown to function in many other reactions including phage lambda site-specific recombination, transcriptional activation of rRNA and tRNA operons, repression of its own synthesis, and oriC-directed DNA replication. Cellular concentrations of Fis vary tremendously under different growth conditions which may have important regulatory implications for the physiological role of Fis in these different reactions.<ref>Finkel, S. E., and R. C. Johnson. \"The Fis protein: it's not just for DNA inversion anymore.\" Molecular microbiology 6.22 (2006): 3257-3265.</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nStructurally, Fis folds into four [[\u03b1-helices]] (A\u2013D) and a [[\u03b2-hairpin]]. Helices A and B provide the contacts between Fis monomers, facilitating dimer formation, whereas the C and D helices form a [[helix-turn-helix motif]] that is essential for DNA binding.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Steen JA, Steen JA, Harrison P, Seemann T, Wilkie I | display-authors = etal | year = 2010 | title = Fis Is Essential for Capsule Production in Pasteurella multocida and Regulates Expression of Other Important Virulence Factors | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 6 | issue = 2| page = e1000750 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000750 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fisproteinstructure.gif|thumb|Fis protein structure]]\n\n[[File:FisK36Ehomodimerstructure.jpg|thumb|Fis K36E homodimer structure]]\n\n== Properties and functions ==\nFis is a very important small nucleotide-associated protein which plays a role in affecting the bacterial chromosome structure and the initiation of DNA replication.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wold S, Crooke E, Skarstad K | year = 1996 | title = The Escherichia coli Fis protein prevents initiation of DNA replication from oriC in vitro | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 3527\u20133532 }}</ref> It is a nucleoid-associated protein in Escherichia coli that is abundant during early exponential growth in rich medium but is in short supply during stationary phase.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bradley Meranda D | display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = Effects of Fis on Escherichia coli gene expression during different growth stages | url = | journal = Microbiology | volume = 153 | issue = 9| pages = 2922\u20132940 }}</ref>  When stationary-phase cells are subcultured into a rich medium, Fis levels increase from less than 100 to over 50,000 copies per cell prior to the first cell division. As cells enter exponential growth, nascent synthesis is largely shut off, and intracellular Fis levels decrease as a function of cell division. Fis synthesis also transiently increases when exponentially growing cells are shifted to a richer medium. The magnitude of the peak of Fis synthesis appears to reflect the extent of the nutritional upshift. fis mRNA levels closely resemble the protein expression pattern, suggesting that regulation occurs largely at the transcriptional level. Two RNA polymerase-binding sites and at least six high-affinity Fis-binding sites are present in the fis promoter region. Expression of this fis operon is negatively regulated by Fis in vivo and purified Fis can prevent stable complex formation by RNA polymerase at the fis promoter in vitro. However, autoregulation only partially accounts for the expression pattern of Fis. Fluctuations in Fis levels have been shown to serve as an early signal of a nutritional upshift and is important in the physiological roles Fis plays in the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ball Catherine A | display-authors = etal | year = 1992 | title = Dramatic changes in Fis levels upon nutrient upshift in Escherichia coli | url = | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 174 | issue = 24| pages = 8043\u20138056 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fisregulation.jpg|thumb|Fis regulation]]\n\n[[File:Dnanegativesupercoiling.jpg|thumb|DNA negative supercoiling]]\n\nIt is a global regulatory protein in [[Escherichia coli]] that activates ribosomal RNA ([[rRNA]]) transcription by binding to three upstream activation sites of the rRNA promoter and enhances transcription 5 to 10 fold [[in vivo]].

Within this region, an AU sequence element centered 35 nucleotides upstream of the ''fis'' AUG increases ''fis'' translation by as much as 15 fold. Formation of a supposed RNA secondary structure element beginning 50 nucleotids upstream of the AUG also positively affects fis translation by up to 10 fold. The ''fis'' gene is cotranscribed with the upstream ''[[dusB]]'' gene encoding a tRNA-modifying enzyme. ''DusB'' protein levels are very low even under conditions when there is high transcription of the operon and high levels of Fis protein.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nafissi Maryam | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = Robust translation of the nucleoid protein Fis requires a remote upstream AU element and is enhanced by RNA secondary structure | url = | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 194 | issue = 10| pages = 2458\u20132469 }}</ref>\n\nFis has been deemed a bacterial chromatin architectural protein.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(00)01217-7\n |author1=Travers, A. |author2=Schneider, R. |author3=Muskhelishvili, G. | title = DNA supercoiling and transcription in ''Escherichia coli'': The FIS connection \n | journal = Biochimie \n | volume = 83\n | issue = 2 \n | pages = 213\u20137 \n | year = 2001 \n | pmid = 11278071}}</ref>\nBesides modulating chromatin architecture, it is known to influence numerous promoters of E. coli and several other bacteria.

There is data that shows Fis mediates its repressive effect by denying access to [[RNA polymerase]] at the ''mom'' promoter. combined A repressive effect of Fis and previously characterized negative regulatory factors could be responsible to keep the gene silenced most of the time.

Observations in ''Pseudomonas putida'' demonstrate ''fis'' reduced the migration of ''P. putida'' onto the apices of barley roots and thereby the competitiveness of bacteria on the roots. It was also observed that the overexpression of ''fis'' drastically reducing swimming motility and facilitated the formation of P. putida biofilm.

The regulation of this [[gene]] is more [[Complexity|complex]] than most other genes in the ''[[E. coli]]'' [[genome]], as Fis is an important [[protein]] which regulates [[Gene expression|expression]] of other genes. It is supposed that ''fis'' is regulated by [[H-NS]], [[IHF (protein)|IHF]] and [[cAMP receptor protein|CRP]]. It also regulates its own expression ([[autoregulation]]). Fis is one of the most abundant DNA binding proteins in Escherichia coli under nutrient-rich growth conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n''Fis'' was first discovered for its role in stimulating Gin catalyzed inversion of the G segment of phage Mu genome.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Koch C., Kahmann R. | year = 1986 | title = Purification and properties of the Escherichia coli host factor required for inversion of the G segment in bacteriophage Mu | url = | journal = J.

This small, basic, DNA-bending protein has recently been shown to function in many other reactions including phage lambda site-specific recombination, transcriptional activation of rRNA and tRNA operons, repression of its own synthesis, and oriC-directed DNA replication. Cellular concentrations of Fis vary tremendously under different growth conditions which may have important regulatory implications for the physiological role of Fis in these different reactions.<ref>Finkel, S. E., and R. C. Johnson. \"The Fis protein: it's not just for DNA inversion anymore.\" Molecular microbiology 6.22 (2006): 3257-3265.</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nStructurally, Fis folds into four [[\u03b1-helices]] (A\u2013D) and a [[\u03b2-hairpin]]. Helices A and B provide the contacts between Fis monomers, facilitating dimer formation, whereas the C and D helices form a [[helix-turn-helix motif]] that is essential for DNA binding.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Steen JA, Steen JA, Harrison P, Seemann T, Wilkie I | display-authors = etal | year = 2010 | title = Fis Is Essential for Capsule Production in Pasteurella multocida and Regulates Expression of Other Important Virulence Factors | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 6 | issue = 2| page = e1000750 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000750 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fisproteinstructure.gif|thumb|Fis protein structure]]\n\n[[File:FisK36Ehomodimerstructure.jpg|thumb|Fis K36E homodimer structure]]\n\n== Properties and functions ==\nFis is a very important small nucleotide-associated protein which plays a role in affecting the bacterial chromosome structure and the initiation of DNA replication.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wold S, Crooke E, Skarstad K | year = 1996 | title = The Escherichia coli Fis protein prevents initiation of DNA replication from oriC in vitro | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 3527\u20133532 }}</ref> It is a nucleoid-associated protein in Escherichia coli that is abundant during early exponential growth in rich medium but is in short supply during stationary phase.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bradley Meranda D | display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = Effects of Fis on Escherichia coli gene expression during different growth stages | url = | journal = Microbiology | volume = 153 | issue = 9| pages = 2922\u20132940 }}</ref>  When stationary-phase cells are subcultured into a rich medium, Fis levels increase from less than 100 to over 50,000 copies per cell prior to the first cell division. As cells enter exponential growth, nascent synthesis is largely shut off, and intracellular Fis levels decrease as a function of cell division. Fis synthesis also transiently increases when exponentially growing cells are shifted to a richer medium. The magnitude of the peak of Fis synthesis appears to reflect the extent of the nutritional upshift. fis mRNA levels closely resemble the protein expression pattern, suggesting that regulation occurs largely at the transcriptional level. Two RNA polymerase-binding sites and at least six high-affinity Fis-binding sites are present in the fis promoter region. Expression of this fis operon is negatively regulated by Fis in vivo and purified Fis can prevent stable complex formation by RNA polymerase at the fis promoter in vitro. However, autoregulation only partially accounts for the expression pattern of Fis. Fluctuations in Fis levels have been shown to serve as an early signal of a nutritional upshift and is important in the physiological roles Fis plays in the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ball Catherine A | display-authors = etal | year = 1992 | title = Dramatic changes in Fis levels upon nutrient upshift in Escherichia coli | url = | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 174 | issue = 24| pages = 8043\u20138056 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fisregulation.jpg|thumb|Fis regulation]]\n\n[[File:Dnanegativesupercoiling.jpg|thumb|DNA negative supercoiling]]\n\nIt is a global regulatory protein in [[Escherichia coli]] that activates ribosomal RNA ([[rRNA]]) transcription by binding to three upstream activation sites of the rRNA promoter and enhances transcription 5 to 10 fold [[in vivo]].

Within this region, an AU sequence element centered 35 nucleotides upstream of the ''fis'' AUG increases ''fis'' translation by as much as 15 fold. Formation of a supposed RNA secondary structure element beginning 50 nucleotids upstream of the AUG also positively affects fis translation by up to 10 fold.
