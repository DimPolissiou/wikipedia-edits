For example, the equation\n:<math>(x+1)^2 = -9</math>\nhas no real solution, since the square of a real number cannot be negative. Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem. The idea is to [[field extension|extend]] the real numbers with an [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] {{math|''i''}} (sometimes called the [[imaginary unit]]) that is taken to satisfy the relation {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}, so that solutions to equations like the preceding one can be found. In this case the solutions are {{math|\u22121 + 3''i''}} and {{math|\u22121 \u2212 3''i''}}, as can be verified using the fact that {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}:\n\n:<math>((-1+3i)+1)^2 = (3i)^2 = \\left(3^2\\right)\\left(i^2\\right) = 9(-1) = -9,</math>\n:<math>((-1-3i)+1)^2 = (-3i)^2 = (-3)^2\\left(i^2\\right) = 9(-1) = -9.</math>\n\nAccording to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], all [[polynomial equation]]s with real or complex coefficients in a single variable have a solution in complex numbers. In contrast, some polynomial equations with real coefficients have no solution in real numbers. The 16th-century Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] is credited with introducing complex numbers in his attempts to find solutions to [[cubic equations]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Burton |first1=David M. |title=The History of Mathematics |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |edition= 3rd |page=294 |isbn=978-0-07-009465-9 |year=1995}}</ref>\n\nFormally, the complex number system can be defined as the [[field extension|algebraic extension]] of the ordinary real numbers by an imaginary number {{math|''i''}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  This means that complex numbers can be added, subtracted, and multiplied, as polynomials in the variable {{math|''i''}}, with the rule {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}} imposed.  Furthermore, complex numbers can also be divided by nonzero complex numbers. Overall, the complex number system is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nGeometrically, complex numbers extend the concept of the [[one-dimensional]] [[number line]] to the [[two-dimensional]] [[complex plane]] by using the [[horizontal axis]] for the real part and the [[vertical axis]] for the imaginary part. The complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can be identified with the point {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} in the complex plane. A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]]; the points for these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane.  A complex number whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number; its point lies on the horizontal axis of the complex plane.  Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form, which associates each complex number with its distance from the origin (its magnitude) and with a particular angle known as the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of this complex number.\n\nThe geometric identification of the complex numbers with the complex plane, which is a [[Euclidean plane]] (<math>\\mathbb R^2</math>), makes their structure as a real 2-dimensional [[vector space]] evident. Real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be taken as components of a vector with respect to the canonical [[standard basis]]. The addition of complex numbers is thus immediately depicted as the usual component-wise addition of vectors. However, the complex numbers allow for a richer algebraic structure, comprising additional operations, that are not necessarily available in a vector space; for example, the multiplication of two complex numbers always yields again a complex number, and should not be mistaken for the usual \"products\" involving vectors, like the ''[[scalar multiplication]]'', the ''[[scalar product]]'' or other (sesqui)linear [[bilinear form|forms]], available in many vector spaces; and the broadly exploited ''[[vector product]]'' exists only in an [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-dependent form in three dimensions.\n\n==Definition==\n\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[complex plane]]. The real part of a complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}} is {{mvar|x}}, and its imaginary part is {{mvar|y}}.]]\n\nBased on the concept of [[real number]]s, a complex number is a number of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers and {{math|''i''}} is an indeterminate satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. For example, {{math|2 + 3''i''}} is a complex number.<ref>{{cite book|title=College algebra |last=Axler |first=Sheldon |page=262|publisher=Wiley|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThis way, a complex number is defined as a [[polynomial]] with real coefficients in the single indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, for which the relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} is imposed. Based on this definition, complex numbers can be added and multiplied, using the addition and multiplication for polynomials. The relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} induces the equalities {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''</sup> {{=}} 1, ''i''<sup>4''k''+1</sup> {{=}} ''i'', ''i''<sup>4''k''+2</sup> {{=}} \u22121,}} and {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''+3</sup> {{=}} \u2212''i'',}} which hold for all integers {{mvar|k}}; these allow the reduction of any polynomial that results from the addition and multiplication of complex numbers to a linear polynomial in {{mvar|i}}, again of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}} with real coefficients {{mvar|a, b.}}\n\nThe real number {{mvar|a}} is called the ''real part'' of the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}; the real number {{mvar|b}} is called its ''imaginary part''. To emphasize, the imaginary part does not include a factor {{mvar|i}}; that is, the imaginary part is {{mvar|b}}, not {{math|''bi''}}.<ref>{{citation |last1=Spiegel |first1= M.R. |last2=Lipschutz |first2= S. |last3= Schiller |first3= J.J. |last4=Spellman |first4=D. |title= Complex Variables (2nd Edition) |series=Schaum's Outline Series |publisher= McGraw Hill |isbn= 978-0-07-161569-3|date= 14 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=College Algebra and Trigonometry |edition=6 |first1=Richard N. |last1=Aufmann |first2=Vernon C. |last2=Barker |first3=Richard D. |last3=Nation |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-618-82515-8 |page=66 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=g5j-cT-vg_wC&pg=PA66 |chapter=Chapter P}}</ref>\n\nFormally, the complex numbers are defined as the [[quotient ring]] of the [[polynomial ring]] in the indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the polynomial {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} (see [[#Construction as a quotient field|below]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\n==Notation==\n\nA real number {{mvar|a}} can be regarded as a complex number {{math|''a'' + 0''i''}} whose imaginary part is 0.

As with polynomials, it is common to write {{mvar|a}} for {{math|''a'' + 0''i''}} and {{math|''bi''}} for {{math|0 + ''bi''}}. Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, that is, {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'' < 0,}} it is common to write {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''{{!}}b{{!}}i''}} instead of {{math|''a'' + (\u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'')''i''}}; for example, for {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u22124,}} {{math|3 \u2212 4''i''}} can be written instead of {{math|3 + (\u22124)''i''.}}\n\nSince in polynomials with real coefficients the multiplication of the indeterminate {{math|''i''}} and a real is commutative, the polynomial {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} may be written as {{math|''a'' + ''ib''.}} This is often expedient for imaginary parts denoted by expressions, for example, when {{mvar|b}} is a radical.<ref>See {{harv|Ahlfors|1979}}.</ref>\n\nThe real part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Re(''z'')}} or {{math|\u211c(''z'')}}; the imaginary part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Im(''z'')}} or {{math|\u2111(''z'')}}.

The horizontal (''real'') axis is generally used to display the real part with increasing values to the right and the imaginary part marks the vertical (''imaginary'') axis, increasing values upwards.\n\nA charted number may be either viewed as the coordinatized point, or as a [[Vector (geometric)|position vector]] from the origin to this point. The coordinate values of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are said to give its ''Cartesian'', ''rectangular'', or ''algebraic'' form.\n\nNotably, the operations of addition and multiplication take on a very natural geometric character when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors: addition corresponds to [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector addition]], while multiplication (see [[#Multiplication and division in polar form|below]]) corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes and adding the angles they make with the real axis. Viewed in this way the multiplication of a complex number by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to rotating the position vector [[orientation (geometry)|counterclockwise]] by a quarter [[turn (geometry)|turn]] ([[right angle|90\u00b0]]) about the origin\n: <math>(a + bi)\\cdot i = ai + b(i)^2 = -b + ai .</math>\n\n=== Polar complex plane {{anchor|Polar form}}=== <!-- [[Nth root]] links to this section -->\n{{Main|Polar coordinate system}}\n{{Redirect|Polar form|the higher-dimensional analogue|Polar decomposition}}\n[[File:Complex number illustration modarg.svg|right|thumb|Argument {{mvar|\u03c6}} and modulus {{mvar|r}} locate a point in the complex plane.]]\n\n====Modulus and argument====\nAn alternative option for coordinates in the complex plane is the [[polar coordinate system]] that uses the distance of the point {{mvar|z}} from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (''O''), and the angle subtended between the [[positive real axis]] and the line segment ''Oz'' in a counterclockwise sense.

Because each complex number is represented in two dimensions, visually graphing a complex function would require the perception of a [[four dimensional space]], which is possible only in projections. Because of this, other ways of visualizing complex functions have been designed.\n\nIn [[Domain coloring]] the output dimensions are represented by color and brightness, respectively. Each point in the complex plane as domain is ''ornated'', typically with ''color'' representing the argument of the complex number, and ''brightness'' representing the magnitude. Dark spots mark moduli near zero, brighter spots are farther away from the origin, the gradation may be discontinuous, but is assumed as monotonous. The colors often vary in steps of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} for {{math|0}} to {{math|2{{pi}}}} from red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, to magenta. These plots are called [[Domain coloring|color wheel graphs]]. This provides a simple way to visualize the functions without losing information. The picture shows zeros for {{math|\u00b11, (2+i)}} and poles at {{math|\u00b1{{radic|\u22122\u22122i}}.}}\n\n[[Riemann surface]]s are another way to visualize complex functions.{{explain|date=December 2018}} Riemann surfaces can be thought of as [[Deformation theory|deformations]] of the complex plane; while the horizontal axes represent the real and imaginary inputs, the single vertical axis only represents either the real or imaginary output. However, Riemann surfaces are built in such a way that rotating them 180 degrees shows the imaginary output, and vice versa. Unlike domain coloring, Riemann surfaces can represent [[multivalued function]]s like <math>\\sqrt{z}</math>.\n\n==History==\nThe solution in [[nth root|radicals]] (without [[trigonometric functions]]) of a general [[cubic equation]] contains the square roots of [[negative numbers]] when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the [[rational root test]] if the cubic is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] (the so-called [[casus irreducibilis]]). This conundrum led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,<ref>{{cite book|first=Morris |last= Kline|title=A history of mathematical thought, volume 1|page=253}}</ref> though his understanding was rudimentary.\n\nWork on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every [[polynomial equation]] of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an [[algebraically closed field]], where any polynomial equation has a [[Root of a function|root]].\n\nMany mathematicians contributed to the development of complex numbers. The rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and root extraction of complex numbers were developed by the Italian mathematician [[Rafael Bombelli]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Katz |first1=Victor J. |title=A History of Mathematics, Brief Version |section= 9.1.4 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=978-0-321-16193-2 |year=2004}}</ref> A more abstract formalism for the complex numbers was further developed by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who extended this abstraction to the theory of [[quaternions]].\n\nThe earliest fleeting reference to [[square root]]s of [[negative number]]s can perhaps be said to occur in the work of the [[Hellenistic mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Hero of Alexandria]] in the 1st century [[AD]], where in his ''[[Hero of Alexandria#Bibliography|Stereometrica]]'' he considers, apparently in error, the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]] to arrive at the term <math>\\sqrt{81 - 144} = 3i\\sqrt{7}</math> in his calculations, although negative quantities were not conceived of in [[Hellenistic mathematics]] and Hero merely replaced it by its positive (<math>\\sqrt{144 - 81} = 3\\sqrt{7}</math>).<ref>{{Citation |title=An Imaginary Tale: The Story of {{sqrt|\u22121}} |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |year=2007 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-12798-9 |url=http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=149&threadID=383188&messageID=1181284 |accessdate=20 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012090553/http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=149&threadID=383188&messageID=1181284 |archive-date=12 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe impetus to study complex numbers as a topic in itself first arose in the 16th century when [[algebraic solution]]s for the roots of [[Cubic equation|cubic]] and [[Quartic equation|quartic]] [[polynomial]]s were discovered by Italian mathematicians (see [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]], [[Gerolamo Cardano]]). It was soon{{when|date=March 2020}} realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's formula for a cubic equation of the form <math>x^3 = px + q</math>{{refn|group=\"note\"|In modern notation, Tartaglia's solution is based on expanding the cube of the sum of two cube roots: <math>\\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right)^3 = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv} \\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right) + u + v</math> With <math>x = \\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}</math>, <math>p = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv}</math>, <math>q = u + v</math>, {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} can be expressed in terms of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} as <math>u = q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math> and <math>v = q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math>, respectively.

However formal calculations with complex numbers show that the equation {{math|1=''z''<sup>3</sup> = ''i''}} has solutions {{math|\u2212''i''}}, <math>{\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math> and <math>{\\tfrac{-\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math>. Substituting these in turn for <math>{\\sqrt{-1}^{1/3}}</math> in Tartaglia's cubic formula and simplifying, one gets 0, 1 and \u22121 as the solutions of {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' = 0}}. Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic equations with real roots then, as later{{when|date=March 2020}} mathematicians{{who|date=March 2020}} showed rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus irreducibilis|is unavoidable]]. [[Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.\n\nThe term \"imaginary\" for these quantities was coined by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature<ref>{{Citation |title=La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie &#124; The Geometry of Ren\u00e9 Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |year=1954 |origyear=1637 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=978-0-486-60068-0 |page= |url=https://archive.org/details/geometryofrenede00rend |accessdate=20 April 2011 }}</ref>\n{{quote|[...] sometimes only imaginary, that is one can imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity that matches that which we imagine.\n''([...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on peut toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque \u00e9quation, mais qu'il n'y a quelquefois aucune quantit\u00e9 qui corresponde \u00e0 celle qu'on imagine.)''}}\nA further source of confusion was that the equation <math>\\sqrt{-1}^2=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math> seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity <math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab}</math>, which is valid for non-negative real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and which was also used in complex number calculations with one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{a}}</math>) in the case when both {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol {{math|''i''}} in place of {{sqrt|\u22121}} to guard against this mistake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Even so, Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today. In his elementary algebra text book, [[Elements of Algebra]], he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.\n\nIn the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 [[Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which bears his name, [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta. </math>\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]]:\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta } </math>\n\nby formally manipulating complex [[power series]] and observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential identities.\n\nThe idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane ([[#Complex plane|above]]) was first described by [[Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John Wallis|Wallis's]] ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nWessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed. In 1806 [[Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#History|fundamental theorem of algebra]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] had earlier published an essentially [[topology|topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about \"the true metaphysics of the square root of \u22121\".

The expression ''direction coefficient'', often used for <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math>, is due to Hankel (1867), and ''absolute value,'' for ''modulus,'' is due to Weierstrass.\n\nLater classical writers on the general theory include [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto H\u00f6lder]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and many others.\n\n==Relations and operations==\n===Equality===\nTwo complex numbers are equal [[if and only if]] both their real and imaginary parts are equal.

This process is sometimes called \"[[rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalization]]\" of the denominator (although the denominator in the final expression might be an irrational real number), because it resembles the method to remove roots from simple expressions in a denominator.\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number {{mvar|z}} can be extracted using the conjugation:\n: <math>\\operatorname{Re}(z) = \\dfrac{z+\\overline{z}}{2},\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{Im}(z) = \\dfrac{z-\\overline{z}}{2i}.</math>\nMoreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.\n\nConjugation distributes over the basic complex arithmetic operations:\n: <math>\\overline{z\\pm w} = \\overline{z} \\pm \\overline{w},</math>\n: <math>\\overline{z\\cdot w} = \\overline{z} \\cdot\\overline{w},\\quad \\overline{z/w} = \\overline{z}/\\overline{w}.</math>\n\nConjugation is also employed in [[inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry studying reflections more general than ones about a line.

A visualization of the subtraction can be achieved by considering addition of the negative [[subtrahend]].\n\n===Multiplication===\nSince the real part, the imaginary part, and the indeterminate <math>i</math> in a complex number are all considered as numbers in themselves, two complex numbers, given as <math>z=x+yi</math> and <math>w= u+vi</math> are multiplied under the rules of the [[distributive property]], the [[commutative property|commutative properties]] and the defining property <math>i^2 = -1</math> in the following way\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz\\cdot w &= (x+yi)\\cdot (u+vi)  & \\\\\n&=x(u+vi) + yi(u+vi)  &&\\text{by the (right) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + xvi + yiu + yivi &&\\text{by the (left) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + yivi + xvi + yiu &&\\text{by the commutativity of addition} \\\\\n&=xu + yvi^2 + xvi + yui &&\\text{by the commutativity of multiplication} \\\\\n&=(xu + yvi^2) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the associativity of addition} \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the defining property of } i \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i &&\\text{by the distributive law}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Reciprocal and division===\nUsing the conjugation, the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a nonzero complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} can always be broken down to\n: <math>\\frac{1}{z}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{z \\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{x^2+y^2}=\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i,</math>\n\nsince ''non-zero'' implies that <math>x^2 + y^2</math> is greater than zero.\n\nThis can be used to express a division of an arbitrary complex number <math>w= u+vi</math> by a non-zero complex number <math>z</math> as\n:<math>\\frac {w}{z}= w\\cdot \\frac {1}{z}= (u+vi)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i\\right)= \\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}\\left((ux+vy)+(vx-uy)i\\right).</math>\n\n===Multiplication and division in polar form===\n[[File:Complex multi.svg|right|thumb|Multiplication of {{math|2 + ''i''}} (blue triangle) and {{math|3 + ''i''}} (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by [[square root of 5|{{sqrt|5}}]], the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]\nFormulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler in polar form than the corresponding formulas in Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers {{math|1=''z''<sub>1</sub> = ''r''<sub>1</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|1=''z''<sub>2</sub> = ''r''<sub>2</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub>)}}, because of the trigonometric identities\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = \\cos(a + b)</math>\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\sin(b) + \\sin(a)\\cos(b) = \\sin(a + b)</math>\n\nwe may derive\n\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\\cos(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2)).</math>\nIn other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to a quarter-[[turn (geometry)|turn]] counter-clockwise, which gives back {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of\n:<math>(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i. </math>\nSince the real and imaginary part of {{math|5 + 5''i''}} are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 (in [[radian]]). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangles are [[arctan]](1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) </math>\nholds. As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this \u2013 known as [[Machin-like formulas]] \u2013 are used for high-precision approximations of [[pi|\u03c0]].\n\nSimilarly, division is given by\n:<math>\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\left(\\cos(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2)\\right).</math>\n\n===Square root===\n{{see also|Square root#Square roots of negative and complex numbers|l1=Square roots of negative and complex numbers}}\nThe square roots of {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} (with {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}) are <math> \\pm (\\gamma + \\delta i)</math>, where\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\delta = \\sgn (b) \\sqrt{\\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}},</math>\n\nwhere sgn is the [[sign function|signum]] function.

For extending this to the complex domain, one can start from Euler's formula. It implies that, if a complex number {{mvar|z}} is written in [[polar form]]\n:<math> z = r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ),</math>\nthen its [[complex logarithm]] should be\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\ln(r) + \\varphi i.</math>\n\nHowever, because cosine and sine are periodic functions,  the addition to <math>\\varphi</math> of an integer multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}}}. does not change {{mvar|z}}. For example, <math>e^{i\\pi} = e^{3i\\pi} = -1</math>, so both <math>i \\pi</math> and <math>3i\\pi</math> are possible values for the natural logarithm of <math>-1</math>.\n\nTherefore the complex logarithm must be defined as a [[multivalued function]]:\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\left\\{ \\ln(r) + \\varphi i+ 2\\pi ki \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nAlternatively, a [[branch cut]] can be used to define a true function. If {{mvar|z}} is not a negative real number, the [[principal value]] of the complex logarithm is obtained with <math>-\\pi < \\varphi < \\pi.</math> This is an [[analytic function]] outside the negative real numbers, but it cannot be prolongated to a function that is continuous at any negative real number.\n\nIt follows that if {{mvar|z}} is as above, and if {{mvar|t}} is another complex number, then the ''exponentiation'' is the multivalued function\n:<math>z^t=\\left\\{e^{t\\ln r}\\,(\\cos(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt)+i\\sin(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt))\\}\\mid k\\in \\mathbb Z\\right\\}</math>\n\n====Integer and fractional exponents====\n{{visualisation_complex_number_roots.svg}}\nIf, in the preceding formula, {{mvar|t}} is an integer, then the sine and the cosine are independent of {{mvar|k}}. Thus, if the exponent {{mvar|n}} is an integer, then <math>z^n</math> is well defined, and the exponentiation formula simplifies to [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n:<math> z^{n}=(r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ))^n = r^n \\, (\\cos n\\varphi + i \\sin n \\varphi).</math>\n\nThe {{mvar|n}} [[Nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are given by\n:<math>z^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]r \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right) + i \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)</math>\nfor {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2212 1}}. (Here <math>\\sqrt[n]r</math> is the usual (positive) {{mvar|n}}th root of the positive real number {{mvar|r}}.) Because sine and cosine are periodic, other integer values of {{mvar|k}} do not give other values.\n\nWhile the {{mvar|n}}th root of a positive real number {{mvar|r}} is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number {{mvar|c}} satisfying {{math|1=''c''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''r''}}, there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex {{mvar|n}}th root of a complex number. Therefore, the {{mvar|n}}th root is a [[multivalued function|{{mvar|n}}-valued function]] of {{mvar|z}}. This implies that, contrary to the case of positive real numbers, one has  \n:<math>(z^n)^{1/n} \\ne z,</math>\nsince the left-hand side consists of {{mvar|n}} values, and the right-hand side is a single value.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Field structure===\nThe set '''C''' of complex numbers is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref> Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number {{mvar|z}}, its [[additive inverse]] {{math|\u2212''z''}} is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero complex number has a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}:\n:<math>z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1,</math>\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1.</math>\nThese two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a field.\n\nUnlike the reals, '''C''' is not an [[ordered field]], that is to say, it is not possible to define a relation {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub> < ''z''<sub>2</sub>}} that is compatible with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is necessarily positive, so {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}} precludes the existence of an [[total order|ordering]] on '''C'''.<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, page 25.</ref>\n\nWhen the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to reflect that fact. For example: [[complex analysis]], complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], complex [[polynomial]], and complex [[Lie algebra]].\n\n===Solutions of polynomial equations===\nGiven any complex numbers (called [[coefficient]]s) {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, the equation\n:<math>a_n z^n + \\dotsb + a_1 z + a_0 = 0</math>\nhas at least one complex solution ''z'', provided that at least one of the higher coefficients {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is nonzero.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  This is the statement of the ''[[fundamental theorem of algebra]]'', of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. Because of this fact, '''C''' is called an [[algebraically closed field]]. This property does not hold for the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]] '''Q''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} does not have a rational root, since [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] is not a rational number) nor the real numbers '''R''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''}} does not have a real root for {{math|''a'' > 0}}, since the square of {{mvar|x}} is positive for any real number {{mvar|x}}).\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], or [[topology|topological]] ones such as the [[winding number]], or a proof combining [[Galois theory]] and the fact that any real polynomial of ''odd'' degree has at least one real root.\n\nBecause of this fact, theorems that hold ''for any algebraically closed field'', apply to '''C'''. For example, any non-empty complex [[square matrix]] has at least one (complex) [[eigenvalue]].\n\n===Algebraic characterization===\nThe field '''C''' has the following three properties: first, it has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. This means that {{math|1=1 + 1 + \u22ef + 1 \u2260 0}} for any number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its [[transcendence degree]] over '''Q''', the [[prime field]] of '''C''', is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Third, it is [[algebraically closed]] (see above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a field) to '''C'''. For example, the [[algebraic closure]] of [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] also satisfies these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic (as fields, but not as topological fields).<ref>{{citation\n | last = Marker | first = David\n | editor1-last = Marker | editor1-first = D.\n | editor2-last = Messmer | editor2-first = M.\n | editor3-last = Pillay | editor3-first = A.\n | contribution = Introduction to the Model Theory of Fields\n | contribution-url = https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235423155\n | isbn = 978-3-540-60741-0\n | mr = 1477154\n | pages = 1\u201337\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin\n | series = Lecture Notes in Logic\n | title = Model theory of fields\n | volume = 5\n | year = 1996}}</ref> Also, '''C''' is isomorphic to the field of complex [[Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that '''C''' contains many proper subfields that are isomorphic to '''C'''.\n\n===Characterization as a topological field===\nThe preceding characterization of '''C''' describes only the algebraic aspects of '''C'''. That is to say, the properties of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]] and [[continuity (topology)|continuity]], which matter in areas such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt with. The following description of '''C''' as a [[topological ring|topological field]] (that is, a field that is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], which allows the notion of convergence) does take into account the topological properties. '''C''' contains a subset {{math|''P''}} (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:\n* {{math|''P''}} is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.\n* If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are distinct elements of {{math|''P''}}, then either {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}} or {{math|''y'' \u2212 ''x''}} is in {{math|''P''}}.\n* If {{mvar|S}} is any nonempty subset of {{math|''P''}}, then {{math|1=''S'' + ''P'' = ''x'' + ''P''}} for some {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\nMoreover, '''C''' has a nontrivial [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[automorphism]] {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''*}} (namely the complex conjugation), such that {{math|''x\u2009x''*}} is in {{math|''P''}} for any nonzero {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\n\nAny field {{mvar|F}} with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the sets {{math|1= ''B''(''x'',\u2009''p'') = {\u2009''y'' {{!}} ''p'' \u2212 (''y'' \u2212 ''x'')(''y'' \u2212 ''x'')* \u2208 ''P''\u2009}\u2009}} as a [[base (topology)|base]], where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the field and {{mvar|p}} ranges over {{math|''P''}}. With this topology {{mvar|F}} is isomorphic as a ''topological'' field to '''C'''.\n\nThe only [[connected space|connected]] [[locally compact]] [[topological ring|topological fields]] are '''R''' and '''C'''. This gives another characterization of '''C''' as a topological field, since '''C''' can be distinguished from '''R''' because the nonzero complex numbers are [[connected space|connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.4|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\n==Formal construction==\n===Construction as ordered pairs===\n[[William Rowan Hamilton]] introduced the approach to define the set {{math|'''C'''}} of complex numbers<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Numbers|first=Leo |last=Corry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|pages=215\u201316}}</ref> as the set {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} of {{nowrap|[[ordered pair]]s {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}}}} of real numbers, in which the following rules for addition and multiplication are imposed:<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref>\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n(a, b) + (c, d) &= (a + c, b + d)\\\\\n(a, b) \\cdot (c, d) &= (ac - bd, bc + ad).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is then just a matter of notation to express {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} as {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n===Construction as a quotient field===\nThough this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic nature of {{math|'''C'''}} more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations that behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the [[distributive law]]\n:<math>(x+y) z = xz + yz</math>\nmust hold for any three elements {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} of a field. The set {{math|'''R'''}} of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial {{math|''p''(''X'')}} with real [[coefficient]]s is an expression of the form\n:<math>a_nX^n+\\dotsb+a_1X+a_0,</math>\nwhere the {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}} of all such polynomials with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. This ring is called the [[polynomial ring]] over the real numbers.\n\nThe set of complex numbers is defined as the [[quotient ring]] {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>   This extension field contains two square roots of {{math|\u22121}}, namely (the [[coset]]s of) {{math|''X''}} and {{math|\u2212''X''}}, respectively. (The cosets of) {{math|1}} and {{math|''X''}} form a basis of {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}} as a real [[vector space]], which means that each element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a [[linear combination]] in these two elements. Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} of real numbers.  The quotient ring is a field, because {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} is [[Irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the ideal it generates is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]].\n\nThe formulas for addition and multiplication in the ring {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}}, modulo the relation {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}}, correspond to the formulas for addition and multiplication of complex numbers defined as ordered pairs.  So the two definitions of the field {{math|'''C'''}} are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (as fields).\n\nAccepting that {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, since it is an [[algebraic extension]] of {{math|'''R'''}} in this approach, {{math|'''C'''}} is therefore the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n===Matrix representation of complex numbers===<!-- .This section is linked from [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] -->\nComplex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can also be represented by {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that have the following form:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nHere the entries {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and [[matrix multiplication|product]] of such matrices, the product being:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  c &   -d  \\\\\n  d & \\;\\; c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n  ac-bd &   -ad-bc  \\\\\n  bc+ad & \\;\\; -bd+ac\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be expressed in terms of [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] by using this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:\n:<math> |z|^2 =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a & -b  \\\\\n  b &  a\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= a^2 + b^2.\n</math>\nThe conjugate <math>\\overline z</math> corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.\n\nThough this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most common, many other representations arise from matrices ''other than'' <math>\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\1 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)</math> that square to the negative of the [[identity matrix]].

Black parts inside refer to numbers having large absolute values.]]\n{{main|Complex analysis}}\n<!--\n[[File:Color complex plot.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Domain coloring]] plot of the function\n<br /><math>f(x) = \\tfrac{(x^2 - 1)(x - 2 - i)^2}{x^2 + 2 + 2 i}</math><br />\nThe hue represents the function argument, while the saturation and [[Lightness (color)|value]] represent the magnitude.]]\n\nThe absolute value has three important properties:\n\n:<math> | z | \\geq 0, \\,</math> where <math> | z | = 0 \\,</math> [[if and only if]] <math> z = 0</math>\n\n:<math> | z + w | \\leq | z | + | w | \\,</math> ([[triangle inequality]])\n\n:<math> | z \\cdot w | = | z | \\cdot | w | </math>\n\nfor all complex numbers {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}. These imply that {{math|1={{!}}1{{!}} = 1}} and {{math|1={{!}}''z''/''w''{{!}} = {{!}}''z''{{!}}/{{!}}''w''{{!}}}}. By defining the '''distance''' function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and we can therefore talk about [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]].\n\nIn general, distances between complex numbers are given by the distance function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, which turns the complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and introduces the ideas of [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]]. All of the standard properties of two dimensional space therefore hold for the complex numbers, including important properties of the modulus such as non-negativity, and the [[triangle inequality]] (<math>| z + w | \\leq | z | + | w |</math> for all {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}).\n\n-->\n\nThe study of functions of a complex variable is known as [[complex analysis]] and has enormous practical use in [[applied mathematics]] as well as in other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in [[real analysis]] or even [[number theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see [[prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, [[complex function]]s have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.\n\n===Complex exponential and related functions===\nThe notions of [[convergent series]] and [[continuous function]]s in (real) analysis have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence <!--(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' \u2265 0</sub>--> of complex numbers is said to [[convergent sequence|converge]] if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]]s, where the absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view, '''C''', endowed with the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2|</math>\nis a complete [[metric space]], which notably includes the [[triangle inequality]]\n:<math>|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|</math>\nfor any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nLike in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number of [[elementary function]]s: the ''[[exponential function]]'' {{math|exp(''z'')}}, also written {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}}, is defined as the [[infinite series]]\n:<math>\\exp(z):= 1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2\\cdot 1}+\\frac{z^3}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}+\\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}. </math>\n\nThe series defining the real trigonometric functions [[sine]] and [[cosine]], as well as the [[hyperbolic functions]] sinh and cosh, also carry over to complex arguments without change. For the other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, such as [[tangent (function)|tangent]], things are slightly more complicated, as the defining series do not converge for all complex values. Therefore, one must define them either in terms of sine, cosine and exponential, or, equivalently, by using the method of [[analytic continuation]].\n\n''[[Euler's formula]]'' states:\n:<math>\\exp(i\\varphi) = \\cos(\\varphi) + i\\sin(\\varphi) </math>\nfor any real number ''\u03c6'', in particular\n:<math>\\exp(i \\pi) = -1 </math>\nUnlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an [[infinite set|infinitude]] of complex solutions {{mvar|z}} of the equation\n:<math>\\exp(z) = w </math>\nfor any complex number {{math|''w'' \u2260 0}}. It can be shown that any such solution {{mvar|z}} \u2013 called [[complex logarithm]] of {{mvar|w}} \u2013 satisfies\n:<math>\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i\\arg(w), </math>\nwhere arg is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] defined [[#Polar form|above]], and ln the (real) [[natural logarithm]]. As arg is a [[multivalued function]], unique only up to a multiple of 2''\u03c0'', log is also multivalued. The [[principal value]] of log is often taken by restricting the imaginary part to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{open-closed|\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0}}.\n\nComplex [[exponentiation]] {{math|''z''<sup>''\u03c9''</sup>}} is defined as\n:<math>z^\\omega = \\exp(\\omega \\log z), </math>\nand is multi-valued, except when <math>\\omega</math> is an integer. For {{math|1=''\u03c9'' = 1 / ''n''}}, for some natural number {{mvar|n}}, this recovers the non-uniqueness of {{mvar|n}}th roots mentioned above.\n\nComplex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the unmodified power and logarithm identities, particularly when na\u00efvely treated as single-valued functions; see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]. For example, they do not satisfy\n:<math>a^{bc} = \\left(a^b\\right)^c.</math>\nBoth sides of the equation are multivalued by the definition of complex exponentiation given here, and the values on the left are a subset of those on the right.\n\n===Holomorphic functions===\nA function ''f''&thinsp;: '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' is called [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if it satisfies the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]]. For example, any [[Linear transformation#Definition and first consequences|'''R'''-linear]] map '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' can be written in the form\n:<math>f(z)=az+b\\overline{z}</math>\nwith complex coefficients {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. This map is holomorphic [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}. The second summand <math>b \\overline z</math> is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]].\n\nComplex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For example, any two holomorphic functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} that agree on an arbitrarily small [[open subset]] of '''C''' necessarily agree everywhere. [[Meromorphic function]]s, functions that can locally be written as {{math|''f''(''z'')/(''z'' \u2212 ''z''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>''n''</sup>}} with a holomorphic function {{mvar|f}}, still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], such as {{math|sin(1/''z'')}} at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}.\n\n==Applications==\nComplex numbers have applications in many scientific areas, including [[signal processing]], [[control theory]], [[electromagnetism]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[cartography]], and [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]]. Some of these applications are described below.\n\n===Geometry===\n====Shapes====\nThree [[collinearity|non-collinear]] points <math>u, v, w</math> in the plane determine the '''shape''' of the triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math>. Locating the points in the complex plane, this shape of a triangle may be expressed by complex arithmetic as\n:<math>S(u, v, w) = \\frac {u - w}{u - v}. </math>\nThe shape <math>S</math> of a triangle will remain the same, when the complex plane is transformed by translation or dilation (by an [[affine transformation]]), corresponding to the intuitive notion of shape, and describing [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Thus each triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math> is in a [[shape#Similarity classes|similarity class]] of triangles with the same shape.<ref>{{citation|last=Lester|first=J.A.|title=Triangles I: Shapes|journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]|volume=52|pages=30\u201354|year=1994|doi=10.1007/BF01818325}}</ref>\n\n====Fractal geometry====\n[[File:Mandelset hires.png|right|250px|thumb|The Mandelbrot set with the real and imaginary axes labeled.]]\nThe [[Mandelbrot set]] is a popular example of a fractal formed on the complex plane. It is defined by plotting every location <math>c</math> where iterating the sequence <math>f_c(z)=z^2+c</math> does not [[diverge (stability theory)|diverge]] when [[Iteration|iterated]] infinitely. Similarly, [[Julia set]]s have the same rules, except where <math>c</math> remains constant.\n\n====Triangles====\nEvery triangle has a unique [[Steiner inellipse]] \u2013 an [[ellipse]] inside the triangle and tangent to the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. The [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be found as follows, according to [[Marden's theorem]]:<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=An Elementary Proof of Marden's Theorem|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=115|issue=4|pages=330\u201338|year=2008a|doi=10.1080/00029890.2008.11920532|issn=0002-9890|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308104622/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|archive-date=8 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=The Most Marvelous Theorem in Mathematics|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|journal=[[Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications]]|year=2008b|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208014954/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|archive-date=8 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane as {{math|1=''a'' = ''x''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''A''</sub>''i''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''x''<sub>''B''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''B''</sub>''i''}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = ''x''<sub>''C''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''C''</sub>''i''}}. Write the [[cubic equation]] <math>\\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0</math>, take its derivative, and equate the (quadratic) derivative to zero. [[Marden's Theorem]] says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers denoting the locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n[[File:Pentagon construct.gif|right|thumb|Construction of a regular pentagon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using straightedge and compass]].]]\nAs mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in '''C'''. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic number]]s \u2013 they are a principal object of study in [[algebraic number theory]]. Compared to {{overline|'''Q'''}}, the algebraic closure of '''Q''', which also contains all algebraic numbers, '''C''' has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] to the [[number field]] containing [[root of unity|roots of unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular [[nonagon]] [[compass and straightedge constructions|using only compass and straightedge]] \u2013 a purely geometric problem.\n\nAnother example are [[Gaussian integer]]s, that is, numbers of the form {{math|''x'' + ''iy''}}, where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are integers, which can be used to classify [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|sums of squares]].\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\nAnalytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example, the [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|\u03b6(''s'')}} is related to the distribution of [[prime number]]s.\n\n===Improper integrals===\nIn applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-valued [[improper integral]]s, by means of complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see [[methods of contour integration]].\n\n===Dynamic equations===\nIn [[differential equation]]s, it is common to first find all complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the [[Linear differential equation#Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients|characteristic equation]] of a [[linear differential equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''e''<sup>''rt''</sup>}}. Likewise, in [[difference equations]], the complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''r''<sup>''t''</sup>}}.\n\n=== In applied mathematics ===\n\n====Control theory====\nIn [[control theory]], systems are often transformed from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Laplace transform]]. The system's [[zeros and poles]] are then analyzed in the ''complex plane''. The [[root locus]], [[Nyquist plot]], and [[Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the complex plane.\n\nIn the root locus method, it is important whether zeros and poles are in the left or right half planes, that is, have real part greater than or less than zero. If a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are\n\n* in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],\n* all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO stability|stable]],\n* on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal stability]].\n\nIf a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a [[nonminimum phase]] system.\n\n====Signal analysis====\nComplex numbers are used in [[signal analysis]] and other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the original quantities. For a [[sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the absolute value {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} of the corresponding {{mvar|z}} is the [[amplitude]] and the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] {{math|arg(''z'')}} is the [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\nIf [[Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form\n\n:<math>x(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{X( t ) \\} </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X( t ) = A e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{ i \\phi } e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi) } </math>\n\nwhere \u03c9 represents the [[angular frequency]] and the complex number ''A'' encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.\n\nThis use is also extended into [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and [[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data compression|compress]], restore, and otherwise process [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sound|audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.\n\nAnother example, relevant to the two side bands of [[amplitude modulation]] of AM radio, is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\cos((\\omega + \\alpha)t) + \\cos\\left((\\omega - \\alpha)t\\right)\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i(\\omega + \\alpha)t} + e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left(e^{i\\alpha t} + e^{-i\\alpha t}\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(2\\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===In physics===\n\n====Electromagnetism and electrical engineering====\n{{Main|Alternating current}}\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], the [[Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]. The treatment of [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. This approach is called [[phasor]] calculus.\n\nIn electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by {{math|''j''}}, to avoid confusion with {{mvar|I}}, which is generally in use to denote [[electric current]], or, more particularly, {{mvar|i}}, which is generally in use to denote instantaneous electric current.\n\nSince the [[voltage]] in an AC [[electric circuit|circuit]] is oscillating, it can be represented as\n\n:<math> V(t) = V_0 e^{j \\omega t} = V_0 \\left (\\cos\\omega t + j \\sin\\omega t \\right ),</math>\n\nTo obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:\n\n:<math> v(t) = \\mathrm{Re}(V) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left [ V_0 e^{j \\omega t} \\right ] = V_0 \\cos \\omega t.</math>\n\nThe complex-valued signal <math>V(t)</math> is called the [[analytic signal|analytic]] representation of the real-valued, measurable signal <math>v(t)</math>.\n<ref>{{citation|last1=Grant|first1=I.S.|title=Electromagnetism|year=2008|edition=2|publisher=Manchester Physics Series|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9|last2=Phillips|first2=W.R.}}</ref>\n\n====Fluid dynamics====\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to describe [[potential flow in two dimensions]].\n\n====Quantum mechanics====\nThe complex number field is intrinsic to the [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex [[Hilbert space]]s provide the context for one such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original foundation formulas of quantum mechanics \u2013 the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] and Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] \u2013 make use of complex numbers.\n\n====Relativity====\nIn [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is [[Wick rotation|used in an essential way]] in [[quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are essential to [[spinor]]s, which are a generalization of the [[tensor]]s used in relativity.\n\n==Generalizations and related notions==\nThe process of extending the field '''R''' of reals to '''C''' is known as the [[Cayley\u2013Dickson construction]]. It can be carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and [[octonion]]s '''O''' which (as a real vector space) are of dimension&nbsp;4 and 8, respectively.\nIn this context the complex numbers have been called the '''binarions'''.<ref>Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', pp 64, Universitext, Springer {{isbn|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n\nJust as by applying the construction to reals the property of [[ordered field|ordering]] is lost, properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish with each extension. The [[quaternion]]s lose commutativity, that is, {{math|''x''\u00b7''y'' \u2260 ''y''\u00b7''x''}} for some quaternions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',}} and the multiplication of [[octonion]]s, additionally to not being commutative, fails to be associative: {{math|(''x''\u00b7''y'')\u00b7''z'' \u2260 ''x''\u00b7(''y''\u00b7''z'')}} for some octonions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',\u2009''z''.}}\n\nReals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all [[normed division algebra]]s over '''R'''. By [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] they are the only ones; the [[sedenion]]s, the next step in the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction, fail to have this structure.\n\nThe Cayley\u2013Dickson construction is closely related to the [[regular representation]] of '''C''', thought of as an '''R'''-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] (an '''R'''-vector space with a multiplication), with respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}. This means the following: the '''R'''-linear map\n:<math>\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}, z \\mapsto wz</math>\nfor some fixed complex number {{mvar|w}} can be represented by a {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} matrix (once a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}, this matrix is\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\operatorname{Re}(w) & -\\operatorname{Im}(w) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Im}(w) & \\;\\; \\operatorname{Re}(w)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>,\nthat is, the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex numbers above. While this is a [[linear representation]] of '''C''' in the [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one. Any matrix\n:<math>J = \\begin{pmatrix}p & q \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0</math>\nhas the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: {{math|1=''J''<sup>2</sup> = \u2212''I''}}. Then\n:<math>\\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>\nis also isomorphic to the field '''C''', and gives an alternative complex structure on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. This is generalized by the notion of a [[linear complex structure]].\n\n[[Hypercomplex number]]s also generalize '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. For example, this notion contains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are elements of the ring {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1)}} (as opposed to {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}}). In this ring, the equation {{math|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> = 1}} has four solutions.\n\nThe field '''R''' is the completion of '''Q''', the field of [[rational number]]s, with respect to the usual [[absolute value]] [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. Other choices of [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]] on '''Q''' lead to the fields '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] (for any [[prime number]] ''p''), which are thereby analogous to '''R'''. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing '''Q''' than '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. The algebraic closures <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> still carry a norm, but (unlike '''C''') are not complete with respect to it.

Furthermore, complex numbers can also be divided by nonzero complex numbers. Overall, the complex number system is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nGeometrically, complex numbers extend the concept of the [[one-dimensional]] [[number line]] to the [[two-dimensional]] [[complex plane]] by using the [[horizontal axis]] for the real part and the [[vertical axis]] for the imaginary part. The complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can be identified with the point {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} in the complex plane. A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]]; the points for these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane.  A complex number whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number; its point lies on the horizontal axis of the complex plane.  Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form, which associates each complex number with its distance from the origin (its magnitude) and with a particular angle known as the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of this complex number.\n\nThe geometric identification of the complex numbers with the complex plane, which is a [[Euclidean plane]] (<math>\\mathbb R^2</math>), makes their structure as a real 2-dimensional [[vector space]] evident. Real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be taken as components of a vector with respect to the canonical [[standard basis]]. The addition of complex numbers is thus immediately depicted as the usual component-wise addition of vectors. However, the complex numbers allow for a richer algebraic structure, comprising additional operations, that are not necessarily available in a vector space; for example, the multiplication of two complex numbers always yields again a complex number, and should not be mistaken for the usual \"products\" involving vectors, like the ''[[scalar multiplication]]'', the ''[[scalar product]]'' or other (sesqui)linear [[bilinear form|forms]], available in many vector spaces; and the broadly exploited ''[[vector product]]'' exists only in an [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-dependent form in three dimensions.\n\n==Definition==\n\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[complex plane]]. The real part of a complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}} is {{mvar|x}}, and its imaginary part is {{mvar|y}}.]]\n\nBased on the concept of [[real number]]s, a complex number is a number of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers and {{math|''i''}} is an indeterminate satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. For example, {{math|2 + 3''i''}} is a complex number.<ref>{{cite book|title=College algebra |last=Axler |first=Sheldon |page=262|publisher=Wiley|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThis way, a complex number is defined as a [[polynomial]] with real coefficients in the single indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, for which the relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} is imposed. Based on this definition, complex numbers can be added and multiplied, using the addition and multiplication for polynomials. The relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} induces the equalities {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''</sup> {{=}} 1, ''i''<sup>4''k''+1</sup> {{=}} ''i'', ''i''<sup>4''k''+2</sup> {{=}} \u22121,}} and {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''+3</sup> {{=}} \u2212''i'',}} which hold for all integers {{mvar|k}}; these allow the reduction of any polynomial that results from the addition and multiplication of complex numbers to a linear polynomial in {{mvar|i}}, again of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}} with real coefficients {{mvar|a, b.}}\n\nThe real number {{mvar|a}} is called the ''real part'' of the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}; the real number {{mvar|b}} is called its ''imaginary part''.

As with polynomials, it is common to write {{mvar|a}} for {{math|''a'' + 0''i''}} and {{math|''bi''}} for {{math|0 + ''bi''}}. Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, that is, {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'' < 0,}} it is common to write {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''{{!}}b{{!}}i''}} instead of {{math|''a'' + (\u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'')''i''}}; for example, for {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u22124,}} {{math|3 \u2212 4''i''}} can be written instead of {{math|3 + (\u22124)''i''.}}\n\nSince in polynomials with real coefficients the multiplication of the indeterminate {{math|''i''}} and a real is commutative, the polynomial {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} may be written as {{math|''a'' + ''ib''.}} This is often expedient for imaginary parts denoted by expressions, for example, when {{mvar|b}} is a radical.<ref>See {{harv|Ahlfors|1979}}.</ref>\n\nThe real part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Re(''z'')}} or {{math|\u211c(''z'')}}; the imaginary part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Im(''z'')}} or {{math|\u2111(''z'')}}.

Another prominent space on which the coordinates may be projected is the two-dimensional surface of a sphere, which is then called [[Riemann sphere]].\n\n=== Cartesian complex plane ===\nThe definition of the complex numbers involving two arbitrary real values immediately suggest the use of Cartesian coordinates in the complex plane.

The coordinate values of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are said to give its ''Cartesian'', ''rectangular'', or ''algebraic'' form.\n\nNotably, the operations of addition and multiplication take on a very natural geometric character when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors: addition corresponds to [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector addition]], while multiplication (see [[#Multiplication and division in polar form|below]]) corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes and adding the angles they make with the real axis.

Because each complex number is represented in two dimensions, visually graphing a complex function would require the perception of a [[four dimensional space]], which is possible only in projections. Because of this, other ways of visualizing complex functions have been designed.\n\nIn [[Domain coloring]] the output dimensions are represented by color and brightness, respectively. Each point in the complex plane as domain is ''ornated'', typically with ''color'' representing the argument of the complex number, and ''brightness'' representing the magnitude. Dark spots mark moduli near zero, brighter spots are farther away from the origin, the gradation may be discontinuous, but is assumed as monotonous. The colors often vary in steps of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} for {{math|0}} to {{math|2{{pi}}}} from red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, to magenta. These plots are called [[Domain coloring|color wheel graphs]]. This provides a simple way to visualize the functions without losing information. The picture shows zeros for {{math|\u00b11, (2+i)}} and poles at {{math|\u00b1{{radic|\u22122\u22122i}}.}}\n\n[[Riemann surface]]s are another way to visualize complex functions.{{explain|date=December 2018}} Riemann surfaces can be thought of as [[Deformation theory|deformations]] of the complex plane; while the horizontal axes represent the real and imaginary inputs, the single vertical axis only represents either the real or imaginary output. However, Riemann surfaces are built in such a way that rotating them 180 degrees shows the imaginary output, and vice versa. Unlike domain coloring, Riemann surfaces can represent [[multivalued function]]s like <math>\\sqrt{z}</math>.\n\n==History==\nThe solution in [[nth root|radicals]] (without [[trigonometric functions]]) of a general [[cubic equation]] contains the square roots of [[negative numbers]] when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the [[rational root test]] if the cubic is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] (the so-called [[casus irreducibilis]]). This conundrum led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,<ref>{{cite book|first=Morris |last= Kline|title=A history of mathematical thought, volume 1|page=253}}</ref> though his understanding was rudimentary.\n\nWork on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every [[polynomial equation]] of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an [[algebraically closed field]], where any polynomial equation has a [[Root of a function|root]].\n\nMany mathematicians contributed to the development of complex numbers.

It was soon{{when|date=March 2020}} realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's formula for a cubic equation of the form <math>x^3 = px + q</math>{{refn|group=\"note\"|In modern notation, Tartaglia's solution is based on expanding the cube of the sum of two cube roots: <math>\\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right)^3 = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv} \\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right) + u + v</math> With <math>x = \\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}</math>, <math>p = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv}</math>, <math>q = u + v</math>, {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} can be expressed in terms of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} as <math>u = q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math> and <math>v = q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math>, respectively. Therefore, <math>x = \\sqrt[3]{q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}} + \\sqrt[3]{q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}}</math>. When <math>(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3</math> is negative (casus irreducibilis), the second cube root should be regarded as the complex conjugate of the first one.}} gives the solution to the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> = ''x''}} as\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\left(\\sqrt{-1}\\right)^{1/3}+\\left(\\sqrt{-1}\\right)^{-1/3}\\right).</math>\n\nAt first glance this looks like nonsense. However formal calculations with complex numbers show that the equation {{math|1=''z''<sup>3</sup> = ''i''}} has solutions {{math|\u2212''i''}}, <math>{\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math> and <math>{\\tfrac{-\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math>. Substituting these in turn for <math>{\\sqrt{-1}^{1/3}}</math> in Tartaglia's cubic formula and simplifying, one gets 0, 1 and \u22121 as the solutions of {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' = 0}}. Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic equations with real roots then, as later{{when|date=March 2020}} mathematicians{{who|date=March 2020}} showed rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus irreducibilis|is unavoidable]]. [[Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.\n\nThe term \"imaginary\" for these quantities was coined by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature<ref>{{Citation |title=La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie &#124; The Geometry of Ren\u00e9 Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |year=1954 |origyear=1637 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=978-0-486-60068-0 |page= |url=https://archive.org/details/geometryofrenede00rend |accessdate=20 April 2011 }}</ref>\n{{quote|[...] sometimes only imaginary, that is one can imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity that matches that which we imagine.\n''([...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on peut toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque \u00e9quation, mais qu'il n'y a quelquefois aucune quantit\u00e9 qui corresponde \u00e0 celle qu'on imagine.)''}}\nA further source of confusion was that the equation <math>\\sqrt{-1}^2=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math> seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity <math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab}</math>, which is valid for non-negative real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and which was also used in complex number calculations with one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{a}}</math>) in the case when both {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol {{math|''i''}} in place of {{sqrt|\u22121}} to guard against this mistake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Even so, Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today. In his elementary algebra text book, [[Elements of Algebra]], he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.\n\nIn the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 [[Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which bears his name, [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta. </math>\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]]:\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta } </math>\n\nby formally manipulating complex [[power series]] and observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential identities.\n\nThe idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane ([[#Complex plane|above]]) was first described by [[Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John Wallis|Wallis's]] ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nWessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed. In 1806 [[Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#History|fundamental theorem of algebra]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] had earlier published an essentially [[topology|topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about \"the true metaphysics of the square root of \u22121\".

Argand called <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''direction factor'', and <math>r = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</math> the ''modulus''; Cauchy (1828) called <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''reduced form'' (l'expression r\u00e9duite) and apparently introduced the term ''argument''; Gauss used {{math|''i''}} for <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math>, introduced the term ''complex number'' for {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}, and called {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup>}} the ''norm''. The expression ''direction coefficient'', often used for <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math>, is due to Hankel (1867), and ''absolute value,'' for ''modulus,'' is due to Weierstrass.\n\nLater classical writers on the general theory include [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto H\u00f6lder]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and many others.\n\n==Relations and operations==\n===Equality===\nTwo complex numbers are equal [[if and only if]] both their real and imaginary parts are equal. That is, complex numbers <math>z_1</math> and <math>z_2</math> are equal if and only if\n<math>\\operatorname{Re}(z_{1}) = \\operatorname{Re}(z_{2})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Im} (z_{1}) = \\operatorname{Im} (z_{2})</math>. Nonzero complex numbers written in [[polar form]] are equal if and only if they have the same magnitude and their arguments differ by an integer multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}}}.\n\n===Ordering===\nSince complex numbers are naturally thought of as existing on a two-dimensional plane, there is no natural [[linear ordering]] on the set of complex numbers. In fact, there is no [[linear ordering]] on the complex numbers that is compatible with addition and multiplication \u2013 the complex numbers cannot have the structure of an [[ordered field]]. This is because any square in an ordered field is at least {{math|0}}, but {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\n\n===Conjugate===\n{{See also|Complex conjugate}}\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|Geometric representation of {{mvar|z}} and its conjugate <math>\\overline{z}</math> in the complex plane]]\nThe ''[[complex conjugate]]'' of the complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} is given by {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''yi''}}. It is denoted by either <math>\\overline{z}</math> or {{math|''z''*}}.<ref>For the former notation, See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref> This [[unary operation]] on complex numbers cannot be expressed by applying only their basic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nGeometrically, <math>\\overline{z}</math> is the [[reflection symmetry|\"reflection\"]] of {{mvar|z}} about the real axis. Conjugating twice gives the original complex number\n:<math>\\overline{\\overline{z}}=z,</math>\n\nwhich makes this operation an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]. The reflection leaves both the real part and the magnitude of <math>z</math> unchanged, that is\n:<math>\\operatorname{Re}(\\overline{z}) = \\operatorname{Re}(z)\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad |\\overline{z}| = |z|.</math>\n\nThe imaginary part and the argument of a complex number <math>z</math> change their sign under conjugation\n:<math>\\operatorname{Im}(\\overline{z}) = -\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{arg}(\\overline{z}) \\equiv -\\operatorname{arg}(z) \\pmod {2\\pi}.</math>\n\nFor details on argument and magnitude, see the section on [[#Polar form|Polar form]].\n\nThe product of a complex number <math>z= x + yi</math> and its conjugate is always a positive real number and equals the square of the magnitude of each:\n:<math>z\\cdot \\overline{z} = x^2 + y^2 = |z|^2 = |\\overline{z}|^2.</math>\n\nThis property can be used to convert a fraction with a complex denominator to an equivalent fraction with a real denominator by expanding both numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the given denominator. This process is sometimes called \"[[rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalization]]\" of the denominator (although the denominator in the final expression might be an irrational real number), because it resembles the method to remove roots from simple expressions in a denominator.\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number {{mvar|z}} can be extracted using the conjugation:\n: <math>\\operatorname{Re}(z) = \\dfrac{z+\\overline{z}}{2},\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{Im}(z) = \\dfrac{z-\\overline{z}}{2i}.</math>\nMoreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.\n\nConjugation distributes over the basic complex arithmetic operations:\n: <math>\\overline{z\\pm w} = \\overline{z} \\pm \\overline{w},</math>\n: <math>\\overline{z\\cdot w} = \\overline{z} \\cdot\\overline{w},\\quad \\overline{z/w} = \\overline{z}/\\overline{w}.</math>\n\nConjugation is also employed in [[inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry studying reflections more general than ones about a line. In the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis of electrical circuits]], the complex conjugate is used in finding the equivalent impedance when the [[maximum power transfer theorem]] is looked for.\n\n===Addition and subtraction===\n[[File:Vector Addition.svg|200px|right|thumb|Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram.]]\n\nTwo complex numbers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are most easily [[addition|added]] by separately adding their real and imaginary parts of the summands. That is to say:\n:<math>a + b =(x+yi) + (u+vi) = (x+u) + (y+v)i.</math>\nSimilarly, [[subtraction]] can be performed as\n:<math>a - b =(x+yi) - (u+vi) = (x-u) + (y-v)i.</math>\n\nUsing the visualization of complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, interpreted as points in the complex plane, is the point obtained by building a [[parallelogram]] from the three vertices <math>O</math>, and the points of the arrows labeled <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> (provided that they are not on a line). Equivalently, calling these points <math>A,\\; B,</math> respectively and the fourth point of the parallelogram <math>X,</math> the [[triangle]]s <math>OAB</math> and <math>XBA</math> are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. A visualization of the subtraction can be achieved by considering addition of the negative [[subtrahend]].\n\n===Multiplication===\nSince the real part, the imaginary part, and the indeterminate <math>i</math> in a complex number are all considered as numbers in themselves, two complex numbers, given as <math>z=x+yi</math> and <math>w= u+vi</math> are multiplied under the rules of the [[distributive property]], the [[commutative property|commutative properties]] and the defining property <math>i^2 = -1</math> in the following way\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz\\cdot w &= (x+yi)\\cdot (u+vi)  & \\\\\n&=x(u+vi) + yi(u+vi)  &&\\text{by the (right) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + xvi + yiu + yivi &&\\text{by the (left) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + yivi + xvi + yiu &&\\text{by the commutativity of addition} \\\\\n&=xu + yvi^2 + xvi + yui &&\\text{by the commutativity of multiplication} \\\\\n&=(xu + yvi^2) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the associativity of addition} \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the defining property of } i \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i &&\\text{by the distributive law}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Reciprocal and division===\nUsing the conjugation, the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a nonzero complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} can always be broken down to\n: <math>\\frac{1}{z}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{z \\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{x^2+y^2}=\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i,</math>\n\nsince ''non-zero'' implies that <math>x^2 + y^2</math> is greater than zero.\n\nThis can be used to express a division of an arbitrary complex number <math>w= u+vi</math> by a non-zero complex number <math>z</math> as\n:<math>\\frac {w}{z}= w\\cdot \\frac {1}{z}= (u+vi)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i\\right)= \\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}\\left((ux+vy)+(vx-uy)i\\right).</math>\n\n===Multiplication and division in polar form===\n[[File:Complex multi.svg|right|thumb|Multiplication of {{math|2 + ''i''}} (blue triangle) and {{math|3 + ''i''}} (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by [[square root of 5|{{sqrt|5}}]], the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]\nFormulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler in polar form than the corresponding formulas in Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers {{math|1=''z''<sub>1</sub> = ''r''<sub>1</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|1=''z''<sub>2</sub> = ''r''<sub>2</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub>)}}, because of the trigonometric identities\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = \\cos(a + b)</math>\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\sin(b) + \\sin(a)\\cos(b) = \\sin(a + b)</math>\n\nwe may derive\n\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\\cos(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2)).</math>\nIn other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to a quarter-[[turn (geometry)|turn]] counter-clockwise, which gives back {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of\n:<math>(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i. </math>\nSince the real and imaginary part of {{math|5 + 5''i''}} are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 (in [[radian]]). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangles are [[arctan]](1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) </math>\nholds.

For extending this to the complex domain, one can start from Euler's formula. It implies that, if a complex number {{mvar|z}} is written in [[polar form]]\n:<math> z = r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ),</math>\nthen its [[complex logarithm]] should be\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\ln(r) + \\varphi i.</math>\n\nHowever, because cosine and sine are periodic functions,  the addition to <math>\\varphi</math> of an integer multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}}}. does not change {{mvar|z}}. For example, <math>e^{i\\pi} = e^{3i\\pi} = -1</math>, so both <math>i \\pi</math> and <math>3i\\pi</math> are possible values for the natural logarithm of <math>-1</math>.\n\nTherefore the complex logarithm must be defined as a [[multivalued function]]:\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\left\\{ \\ln(r) + \\varphi i+ 2\\pi ki \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nAlternatively, a [[branch cut]] can be used to define a true function. If {{mvar|z}} is not a negative real number, the [[principal value]] of the complex logarithm is obtained with <math>-\\pi < \\varphi < \\pi.</math> This is an [[analytic function]] outside the negative real numbers, but it cannot be prolongated to a function that is continuous at any negative real number.\n\nIt follows that if {{mvar|z}} is as above, and if {{mvar|t}} is another complex number, then the ''exponentiation'' is the multivalued function\n:<math>z^t=\\left\\{e^{t\\ln r}\\,(\\cos(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt)+i\\sin(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt))\\}\\mid k\\in \\mathbb Z\\right\\}</math>\n\n====Integer and fractional exponents====\n{{visualisation_complex_number_roots.svg}}\nIf, in the preceding formula, {{mvar|t}} is an integer, then the sine and the cosine are independent of {{mvar|k}}. Thus, if the exponent {{mvar|n}} is an integer, then <math>z^n</math> is well defined, and the exponentiation formula simplifies to [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n:<math> z^{n}=(r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ))^n = r^n \\, (\\cos n\\varphi + i \\sin n \\varphi).</math>\n\nThe {{mvar|n}} [[Nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are given by\n:<math>z^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]r \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right) + i \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)</math>\nfor {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2212 1}}. (Here <math>\\sqrt[n]r</math> is the usual (positive) {{mvar|n}}th root of the positive real number {{mvar|r}}.) Because sine and cosine are periodic, other integer values of {{mvar|k}} do not give other values.\n\nWhile the {{mvar|n}}th root of a positive real number {{mvar|r}} is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number {{mvar|c}} satisfying {{math|1=''c''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''r''}}, there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex {{mvar|n}}th root of a complex number. Therefore, the {{mvar|n}}th root is a [[multivalued function|{{mvar|n}}-valued function]] of {{mvar|z}}. This implies that, contrary to the case of positive real numbers, one has  \n:<math>(z^n)^{1/n} \\ne z,</math>\nsince the left-hand side consists of {{mvar|n}} values, and the right-hand side is a single value.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Field structure===\nThe set '''C''' of complex numbers is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref> Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number {{mvar|z}}, its [[additive inverse]] {{math|\u2212''z''}} is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero complex number has a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}:\n:<math>z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1,</math>\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1.</math>\nThese two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a field.\n\nUnlike the reals, '''C''' is not an [[ordered field]], that is to say, it is not possible to define a relation {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub> < ''z''<sub>2</sub>}} that is compatible with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is necessarily positive, so {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}} precludes the existence of an [[total order|ordering]] on '''C'''.<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, page 25.</ref>\n\nWhen the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to reflect that fact. For example: [[complex analysis]], complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], complex [[polynomial]], and complex [[Lie algebra]].\n\n===Solutions of polynomial equations===\nGiven any complex numbers (called [[coefficient]]s) {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, the equation\n:<math>a_n z^n + \\dotsb + a_1 z + a_0 = 0</math>\nhas at least one complex solution ''z'', provided that at least one of the higher coefficients {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is nonzero.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  This is the statement of the ''[[fundamental theorem of algebra]]'', of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. Because of this fact, '''C''' is called an [[algebraically closed field]]. This property does not hold for the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]] '''Q''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} does not have a rational root, since [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] is not a rational number) nor the real numbers '''R''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''}} does not have a real root for {{math|''a'' > 0}}, since the square of {{mvar|x}} is positive for any real number {{mvar|x}}).\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], or [[topology|topological]] ones such as the [[winding number]], or a proof combining [[Galois theory]] and the fact that any real polynomial of ''odd'' degree has at least one real root.\n\nBecause of this fact, theorems that hold ''for any algebraically closed field'', apply to '''C'''. For example, any non-empty complex [[square matrix]] has at least one (complex) [[eigenvalue]].\n\n===Algebraic characterization===\nThe field '''C''' has the following three properties: first, it has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. This means that {{math|1=1 + 1 + \u22ef + 1 \u2260 0}} for any number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its [[transcendence degree]] over '''Q''', the [[prime field]] of '''C''', is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Third, it is [[algebraically closed]] (see above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a field) to '''C'''. For example, the [[algebraic closure]] of [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] also satisfies these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic (as fields, but not as topological fields).<ref>{{citation\n | last = Marker | first = David\n | editor1-last = Marker | editor1-first = D.\n | editor2-last = Messmer | editor2-first = M.\n | editor3-last = Pillay | editor3-first = A.\n | contribution = Introduction to the Model Theory of Fields\n | contribution-url = https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235423155\n | isbn = 978-3-540-60741-0\n | mr = 1477154\n | pages = 1\u201337\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin\n | series = Lecture Notes in Logic\n | title = Model theory of fields\n | volume = 5\n | year = 1996}}</ref> Also, '''C''' is isomorphic to the field of complex [[Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that '''C''' contains many proper subfields that are isomorphic to '''C'''.\n\n===Characterization as a topological field===\nThe preceding characterization of '''C''' describes only the algebraic aspects of '''C'''. That is to say, the properties of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]] and [[continuity (topology)|continuity]], which matter in areas such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt with. The following description of '''C''' as a [[topological ring|topological field]] (that is, a field that is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], which allows the notion of convergence) does take into account the topological properties. '''C''' contains a subset {{math|''P''}} (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:\n* {{math|''P''}} is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.\n* If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are distinct elements of {{math|''P''}}, then either {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}} or {{math|''y'' \u2212 ''x''}} is in {{math|''P''}}.\n* If {{mvar|S}} is any nonempty subset of {{math|''P''}}, then {{math|1=''S'' + ''P'' = ''x'' + ''P''}} for some {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\nMoreover, '''C''' has a nontrivial [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[automorphism]] {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''*}} (namely the complex conjugation), such that {{math|''x\u2009x''*}} is in {{math|''P''}} for any nonzero {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\n\nAny field {{mvar|F}} with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the sets {{math|1= ''B''(''x'',\u2009''p'') = {\u2009''y'' {{!}} ''p'' \u2212 (''y'' \u2212 ''x'')(''y'' \u2212 ''x'')* \u2208 ''P''\u2009}\u2009}} as a [[base (topology)|base]], where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the field and {{mvar|p}} ranges over {{math|''P''}}. With this topology {{mvar|F}} is isomorphic as a ''topological'' field to '''C'''.\n\nThe only [[connected space|connected]] [[locally compact]] [[topological ring|topological fields]] are '''R''' and '''C'''. This gives another characterization of '''C''' as a topological field, since '''C''' can be distinguished from '''R''' because the nonzero complex numbers are [[connected space|connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.4|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\n==Formal construction==\n===Construction as ordered pairs===\n[[William Rowan Hamilton]] introduced the approach to define the set {{math|'''C'''}} of complex numbers<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Numbers|first=Leo |last=Corry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|pages=215\u201316}}</ref> as the set {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} of {{nowrap|[[ordered pair]]s {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}}}} of real numbers, in which the following rules for addition and multiplication are imposed:<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref>\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n(a, b) + (c, d) &= (a + c, b + d)\\\\\n(a, b) \\cdot (c, d) &= (ac - bd, bc + ad).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is then just a matter of notation to express {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} as {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n===Construction as a quotient field===\nThough this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic nature of {{math|'''C'''}} more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations that behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the [[distributive law]]\n:<math>(x+y) z = xz + yz</math>\nmust hold for any three elements {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} of a field. The set {{math|'''R'''}} of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial {{math|''p''(''X'')}} with real [[coefficient]]s is an expression of the form\n:<math>a_nX^n+\\dotsb+a_1X+a_0,</math>\nwhere the {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}} of all such polynomials with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. This ring is called the [[polynomial ring]] over the real numbers.\n\nThe set of complex numbers is defined as the [[quotient ring]] {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>   This extension field contains two square roots of {{math|\u22121}}, namely (the [[coset]]s of) {{math|''X''}} and {{math|\u2212''X''}}, respectively. (The cosets of) {{math|1}} and {{math|''X''}} form a basis of {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}} as a real [[vector space]], which means that each element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a [[linear combination]] in these two elements. Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} of real numbers.  The quotient ring is a field, because {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} is [[Irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the ideal it generates is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]].\n\nThe formulas for addition and multiplication in the ring {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}}, modulo the relation {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}}, correspond to the formulas for addition and multiplication of complex numbers defined as ordered pairs.  So the two definitions of the field {{math|'''C'''}} are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (as fields).\n\nAccepting that {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, since it is an [[algebraic extension]] of {{math|'''R'''}} in this approach, {{math|'''C'''}} is therefore the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n===Matrix representation of complex numbers===<!-- .This section is linked from [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] -->\nComplex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can also be represented by {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that have the following form:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nHere the entries {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and [[matrix multiplication|product]] of such matrices, the product being:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  c &   -d  \\\\\n  d & \\;\\; c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n  ac-bd &   -ad-bc  \\\\\n  bc+ad & \\;\\; -bd+ac\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be expressed in terms of [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] by using this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:\n:<math> |z|^2 =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a & -b  \\\\\n  b &  a\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= a^2 + b^2.\n</math>\nThe conjugate <math>\\overline z</math> corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.\n\nThough this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most common, many other representations arise from matrices ''other than'' <math>\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\1 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)</math> that square to the negative of the [[identity matrix]]. See the article on [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]] for other representations of complex numbers.\n\n==Complex analysis==\n[[File:Sin1perz.png|thumb|270px|[[Domain coloring|Color wheel graph]] of {{math|sin(1/''z'')}}.

These imply that {{math|1={{!}}1{{!}} = 1}} and {{math|1={{!}}''z''/''w''{{!}} = {{!}}''z''{{!}}/{{!}}''w''{{!}}}}. By defining the '''distance''' function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and we can therefore talk about [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]].\n\nIn general, distances between complex numbers are given by the distance function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, which turns the complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and introduces the ideas of [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]]. All of the standard properties of two dimensional space therefore hold for the complex numbers, including important properties of the modulus such as non-negativity, and the [[triangle inequality]] (<math>| z + w | \\leq | z | + | w |</math> for all {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}).\n\n-->\n\nThe study of functions of a complex variable is known as [[complex analysis]] and has enormous practical use in [[applied mathematics]] as well as in other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in [[real analysis]] or even [[number theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see [[prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, [[complex function]]s have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.\n\n===Complex exponential and related functions===\nThe notions of [[convergent series]] and [[continuous function]]s in (real) analysis have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence <!--(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' \u2265 0</sub>--> of complex numbers is said to [[convergent sequence|converge]] if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]]s, where the absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view, '''C''', endowed with the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2|</math>\nis a complete [[metric space]], which notably includes the [[triangle inequality]]\n:<math>|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|</math>\nfor any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nLike in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number of [[elementary function]]s: the ''[[exponential function]]'' {{math|exp(''z'')}}, also written {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}}, is defined as the [[infinite series]]\n:<math>\\exp(z):= 1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2\\cdot 1}+\\frac{z^3}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}+\\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}. </math>\n\nThe series defining the real trigonometric functions [[sine]] and [[cosine]], as well as the [[hyperbolic functions]] sinh and cosh, also carry over to complex arguments without change. For the other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, such as [[tangent (function)|tangent]], things are slightly more complicated, as the defining series do not converge for all complex values. Therefore, one must define them either in terms of sine, cosine and exponential, or, equivalently, by using the method of [[analytic continuation]].\n\n''[[Euler's formula]]'' states:\n:<math>\\exp(i\\varphi) = \\cos(\\varphi) + i\\sin(\\varphi) </math>\nfor any real number ''\u03c6'', in particular\n:<math>\\exp(i \\pi) = -1 </math>\nUnlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an [[infinite set|infinitude]] of complex solutions {{mvar|z}} of the equation\n:<math>\\exp(z) = w </math>\nfor any complex number {{math|''w'' \u2260 0}}. It can be shown that any such solution {{mvar|z}} \u2013 called [[complex logarithm]] of {{mvar|w}} \u2013 satisfies\n:<math>\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i\\arg(w), </math>\nwhere arg is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] defined [[#Polar form|above]], and ln the (real) [[natural logarithm]]. As arg is a [[multivalued function]], unique only up to a multiple of 2''\u03c0'', log is also multivalued. The [[principal value]] of log is often taken by restricting the imaginary part to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{open-closed|\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0}}.\n\nComplex [[exponentiation]] {{math|''z''<sup>''\u03c9''</sup>}} is defined as\n:<math>z^\\omega = \\exp(\\omega \\log z), </math>\nand is multi-valued, except when <math>\\omega</math> is an integer. For {{math|1=''\u03c9'' = 1 / ''n''}}, for some natural number {{mvar|n}}, this recovers the non-uniqueness of {{mvar|n}}th roots mentioned above.\n\nComplex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the unmodified power and logarithm identities, particularly when na\u00efvely treated as single-valued functions; see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]. For example, they do not satisfy\n:<math>a^{bc} = \\left(a^b\\right)^c.</math>\nBoth sides of the equation are multivalued by the definition of complex exponentiation given here, and the values on the left are a subset of those on the right.\n\n===Holomorphic functions===\nA function ''f''&thinsp;: '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' is called [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if it satisfies the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]]. For example, any [[Linear transformation#Definition and first consequences|'''R'''-linear]] map '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' can be written in the form\n:<math>f(z)=az+b\\overline{z}</math>\nwith complex coefficients {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. This map is holomorphic [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}. The second summand <math>b \\overline z</math> is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]].\n\nComplex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For example, any two holomorphic functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} that agree on an arbitrarily small [[open subset]] of '''C''' necessarily agree everywhere. [[Meromorphic function]]s, functions that can locally be written as {{math|''f''(''z'')/(''z'' \u2212 ''z''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>''n''</sup>}} with a holomorphic function {{mvar|f}}, still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], such as {{math|sin(1/''z'')}} at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}.\n\n==Applications==\nComplex numbers have applications in many scientific areas, including [[signal processing]], [[control theory]], [[electromagnetism]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[cartography]], and [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]]. Some of these applications are described below.\n\n===Geometry===\n====Shapes====\nThree [[collinearity|non-collinear]] points <math>u, v, w</math> in the plane determine the '''shape''' of the triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math>. Locating the points in the complex plane, this shape of a triangle may be expressed by complex arithmetic as\n:<math>S(u, v, w) = \\frac {u - w}{u - v}. </math>\nThe shape <math>S</math> of a triangle will remain the same, when the complex plane is transformed by translation or dilation (by an [[affine transformation]]), corresponding to the intuitive notion of shape, and describing [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Thus each triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math> is in a [[shape#Similarity classes|similarity class]] of triangles with the same shape.<ref>{{citation|last=Lester|first=J.A.|title=Triangles I: Shapes|journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]|volume=52|pages=30\u201354|year=1994|doi=10.1007/BF01818325}}</ref>\n\n====Fractal geometry====\n[[File:Mandelset hires.png|right|250px|thumb|The Mandelbrot set with the real and imaginary axes labeled.]]\nThe [[Mandelbrot set]] is a popular example of a fractal formed on the complex plane. It is defined by plotting every location <math>c</math> where iterating the sequence <math>f_c(z)=z^2+c</math> does not [[diverge (stability theory)|diverge]] when [[Iteration|iterated]] infinitely. Similarly, [[Julia set]]s have the same rules, except where <math>c</math> remains constant.\n\n====Triangles====\nEvery triangle has a unique [[Steiner inellipse]] \u2013 an [[ellipse]] inside the triangle and tangent to the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. The [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be found as follows, according to [[Marden's theorem]]:<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=An Elementary Proof of Marden's Theorem|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=115|issue=4|pages=330\u201338|year=2008a|doi=10.1080/00029890.2008.11920532|issn=0002-9890|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308104622/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|archive-date=8 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=The Most Marvelous Theorem in Mathematics|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|journal=[[Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications]]|year=2008b|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208014954/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|archive-date=8 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane as {{math|1=''a'' = ''x''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''A''</sub>''i''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''x''<sub>''B''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''B''</sub>''i''}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = ''x''<sub>''C''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''C''</sub>''i''}}. Write the [[cubic equation]] <math>\\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0</math>, take its derivative, and equate the (quadratic) derivative to zero. [[Marden's Theorem]] says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers denoting the locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n[[File:Pentagon construct.gif|right|thumb|Construction of a regular pentagon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using straightedge and compass]].]]\nAs mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in '''C'''. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic number]]s \u2013 they are a principal object of study in [[algebraic number theory]]. Compared to {{overline|'''Q'''}}, the algebraic closure of '''Q''', which also contains all algebraic numbers, '''C''' has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] to the [[number field]] containing [[root of unity|roots of unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular [[nonagon]] [[compass and straightedge constructions|using only compass and straightedge]] \u2013 a purely geometric problem.\n\nAnother example are [[Gaussian integer]]s, that is, numbers of the form {{math|''x'' + ''iy''}}, where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are integers, which can be used to classify [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|sums of squares]].\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\nAnalytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example, the [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|\u03b6(''s'')}} is related to the distribution of [[prime number]]s.\n\n===Improper integrals===\nIn applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-valued [[improper integral]]s, by means of complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see [[methods of contour integration]].\n\n===Dynamic equations===\nIn [[differential equation]]s, it is common to first find all complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the [[Linear differential equation#Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients|characteristic equation]] of a [[linear differential equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''e''<sup>''rt''</sup>}}. Likewise, in [[difference equations]], the complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''r''<sup>''t''</sup>}}.\n\n=== In applied mathematics ===\n\n====Control theory====\nIn [[control theory]], systems are often transformed from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Laplace transform]]. The system's [[zeros and poles]] are then analyzed in the ''complex plane''. The [[root locus]], [[Nyquist plot]], and [[Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the complex plane.\n\nIn the root locus method, it is important whether zeros and poles are in the left or right half planes, that is, have real part greater than or less than zero. If a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are\n\n* in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],\n* all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO stability|stable]],\n* on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal stability]].\n\nIf a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a [[nonminimum phase]] system.\n\n====Signal analysis====\nComplex numbers are used in [[signal analysis]] and other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the original quantities. For a [[sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the absolute value {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} of the corresponding {{mvar|z}} is the [[amplitude]] and the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] {{math|arg(''z'')}} is the [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\nIf [[Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form\n\n:<math>x(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{X( t ) \\} </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X( t ) = A e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{ i \\phi } e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi) } </math>\n\nwhere \u03c9 represents the [[angular frequency]] and the complex number ''A'' encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.\n\nThis use is also extended into [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and [[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data compression|compress]], restore, and otherwise process [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sound|audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.\n\nAnother example, relevant to the two side bands of [[amplitude modulation]] of AM radio, is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\cos((\\omega + \\alpha)t) + \\cos\\left((\\omega - \\alpha)t\\right)\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i(\\omega + \\alpha)t} + e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left(e^{i\\alpha t} + e^{-i\\alpha t}\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(2\\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===In physics===\n\n====Electromagnetism and electrical engineering====\n{{Main|Alternating current}}\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], the [[Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]. The treatment of [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. This approach is called [[phasor]] calculus.\n\nIn electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by {{math|''j''}}, to avoid confusion with {{mvar|I}}, which is generally in use to denote [[electric current]], or, more particularly, {{mvar|i}}, which is generally in use to denote instantaneous electric current.\n\nSince the [[voltage]] in an AC [[electric circuit|circuit]] is oscillating, it can be represented as\n\n:<math> V(t) = V_0 e^{j \\omega t} = V_0 \\left (\\cos\\omega t + j \\sin\\omega t \\right ),</math>\n\nTo obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:\n\n:<math> v(t) = \\mathrm{Re}(V) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left [ V_0 e^{j \\omega t} \\right ] = V_0 \\cos \\omega t.</math>\n\nThe complex-valued signal <math>V(t)</math> is called the [[analytic signal|analytic]] representation of the real-valued, measurable signal <math>v(t)</math>.\n<ref>{{citation|last1=Grant|first1=I.S.|title=Electromagnetism|year=2008|edition=2|publisher=Manchester Physics Series|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9|last2=Phillips|first2=W.R.}}</ref>\n\n====Fluid dynamics====\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to describe [[potential flow in two dimensions]].\n\n====Quantum mechanics====\nThe complex number field is intrinsic to the [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex [[Hilbert space]]s provide the context for one such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original foundation formulas of quantum mechanics \u2013 the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] and Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] \u2013 make use of complex numbers.\n\n====Relativity====\nIn [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is [[Wick rotation|used in an essential way]] in [[quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are essential to [[spinor]]s, which are a generalization of the [[tensor]]s used in relativity.\n\n==Generalizations and related notions==\nThe process of extending the field '''R''' of reals to '''C''' is known as the [[Cayley\u2013Dickson construction]]. It can be carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and [[octonion]]s '''O''' which (as a real vector space) are of dimension&nbsp;4 and 8, respectively.\nIn this context the complex numbers have been called the '''binarions'''.<ref>Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', pp 64, Universitext, Springer {{isbn|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n\nJust as by applying the construction to reals the property of [[ordered field|ordering]] is lost, properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish with each extension. The [[quaternion]]s lose commutativity, that is, {{math|''x''\u00b7''y'' \u2260 ''y''\u00b7''x''}} for some quaternions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',}} and the multiplication of [[octonion]]s, additionally to not being commutative, fails to be associative: {{math|(''x''\u00b7''y'')\u00b7''z'' \u2260 ''x''\u00b7(''y''\u00b7''z'')}} for some octonions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',\u2009''z''.}}\n\nReals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all [[normed division algebra]]s over '''R'''. By [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] they are the only ones; the [[sedenion]]s, the next step in the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction, fail to have this structure.\n\nThe Cayley\u2013Dickson construction is closely related to the [[regular representation]] of '''C''', thought of as an '''R'''-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] (an '''R'''-vector space with a multiplication), with respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}. This means the following: the '''R'''-linear map\n:<math>\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}, z \\mapsto wz</math>\nfor some fixed complex number {{mvar|w}} can be represented by a {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} matrix (once a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}, this matrix is\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\operatorname{Re}(w) & -\\operatorname{Im}(w) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Im}(w) & \\;\\; \\operatorname{Re}(w)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>,\nthat is, the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex numbers above. While this is a [[linear representation]] of '''C''' in the [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one. Any matrix\n:<math>J = \\begin{pmatrix}p & q \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0</math>\nhas the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: {{math|1=''J''<sup>2</sup> = \u2212''I''}}. Then\n:<math>\\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>\nis also isomorphic to the field '''C''', and gives an alternative complex structure on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. This is generalized by the notion of a [[linear complex structure]].\n\n[[Hypercomplex number]]s also generalize '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. For example, this notion contains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are elements of the ring {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1)}} (as opposed to {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}}). In this ring, the equation {{math|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> = 1}} has four solutions.\n\nThe field '''R''' is the completion of '''Q''', the field of [[rational number]]s, with respect to the usual [[absolute value]] [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. Other choices of [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]] on '''Q''' lead to the fields '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] (for any [[prime number]] ''p''), which are thereby analogous to '''R'''. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing '''Q''' than '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. The algebraic closures <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> still carry a norm, but (unlike '''C''') are not complete with respect to it. The completion <math>\\mathbf{C}_p</math> of <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> turns out to be algebraically closed. This field is called ''p''-adic complex numbers by analogy.\n\nThe fields '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> and their finite field extensions, including '''C''', are [[local field]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Complex numbers}}\n* [[Algebraic surface]]\n* [[Circular motion#Using complex numbers|Circular motion using complex numbers]]\n* [[Complex-base system]]\n* [[Complex geometry]]\n* [[Eisenstein integer]]\n* [[Euler's identity]]\n* [[Geometric algebra#Unit pseudoscalars|Geometric algebra]] (which includes the complex plane as the 2-dimensional [[Spinor#Two dimensions|spinor]] subspace <math>\\mathcal{G}_2^+</math>)\n* [[Root of unity]]\n* [[Unit complex number]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n====Works cited====\n* {{Citation |last=Ahlfors |first=Lars |authorlink=Lars Ahlfors |title=Complex analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1979 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-07-000657-7}}\n* {{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|last=Apostol |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Apostol|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley |ref={{harvid|Apostol|1981}} }}\n* {{springer|id=c/c024140|title=Complex number|year=2001|first=E.D.|last=Solomentsev}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikiversity|Complex Numbers}}\n{{wikibooks|Calculus/Complex numbers}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Number/Complex Numbers}}\n* {{citation |last= Penrose |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Penrose |title= The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe |publisher= Alfred A.

Morgan sold his stake in the club to Turner, prompting Scannell to announce that he was preparing to sell his stake as well.

For the 1986-87 season, he immediately changed the team's name from the Steamers to the Merchants after the Junior C team of old, and brought in former coach Gerry Inglis, who had also coached the Georgetown Raiders and had won five intermediate championships at the time.<ref name=\"halinet.on.ca\"/>\n\nGrant led the team to tremendous success in the late 1990s. During his 15-year ownership run, the team captured four division crowns, three league championships and a provincial title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/MPL/MPL002504511pf_0676.pdf |title=Photo |website=images.ourontario.ca |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the Milton Merchants were Central Junior B Hockey League champions with a 4-2 victory in Game 7 over the Aurora Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2690358/page/2|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 3 Apr 1992, p. 1|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>  They made the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] [[Sutherland Cup]] Junior B championship but lost in five games to the [[Mid-Western Junior B Hockey League]]'s [[Kitchener Dutchmen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2690370/page/16|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 1 May 1992, p. 15|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1992-93 season, the Merchants made the jump to Junior A in the OPJHL.\n\nThe 1994-95 season marked the beginning of a historical run for the franchise as the club won five straight division titles. The surge of success increased when the Merchants were crowned league champions in 1997, winning the [[Frank L. Buckland Trophy|Buckland Trophy]] after defeating the [[Newmarket 87's]]. In the 1997 Dudley Cup playoffs, the [[Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats]] (NOJHL) beat Milton four games to one.\n\nIn 1998, the Milton Merchants repeated their Buckland Trophy title, dispatching the [[Newmarket Hurricanes]] this time, and then went on to become Central Canadian Junior A Champions by winning the [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]], defeating the [[Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats]] (NOJHL) four games to two, and exacting revenge for the previous year's loss to Rayside-Balfour.\n\nAt the [[1998 Royal Bank Cup]], the Milton Merchants went 1-3 in round robin play. In the semifinal game, Milton lost 6-2 to the [[South Surrey Eagles]] and were eliminated from the tournament.\n\nIn 2018, the Milton Sports Hall of Fame announced that it is inducting the 1996\u201397 and 1997-98 Merchants teams, and Brad Grant as a builder, during a ceremony in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehalton.com/community-story/8698542-2018-class-named-for-milton-sports-hall-of-fame-induction/|title=2018 class named for Milton Sports Hall of Fame induction|date=27 June 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Forgione era===\nIn 2001, Grant sold the team to an Oakville trio that consisted of ex-NHLer [[Dave Gagner]], Mario Forgione who owned the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] at the time and was an automotive parts manufacturing president, and wine distillery consultant Ken Chase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2507710/page/17|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 15 Mar 2005, p. 17|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2506764/page/22|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 22 Jun 2001, p. 22|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2003-04 season, Forgione changed the team's name from the Merchants to the IceHawks to reflect the team's connection with the local minor hockey programs called the Winterhawks, and Forgione's ownership of the Mississauga IceDogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2507362/page/21|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 17 Jun 2003, p. 21|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref> In 2005, the Ontario Hockey Association fined the Icehawks $12,000 and suspended then-General Manager George Dupont for signing two players outside of OHA guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamdailynews.ca/2010/12/10/junior-hockeys-dirty-little-ecret |title=Chatham News, Sports, Entertainment, Business, Life & Opinion &#124; Chatham Daily News |publisher=Chathamdailynews.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-09-05}}</ref> In 2006, Forgione officially affiliated the Icehawks with the IceDogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2508127/page/15?n=|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 14 Mar 2006, p. 15|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\n===Heinz era===\nIn the spring of 2006, ex-NHL goaltender [[Rick Heinz|Rick Heinz']] attempt to purchase the nearby [[Georgetown Raiders]] fell through, but by July 2006 the local Campbellville resident Heinz had talked Forgione into selling the Icehawks, and the affiliation with the IceDogs ended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2508247/page/18?n=|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 7 Jul 2006, p. 18|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref> Heinz sold the team just nine months later after starting the season with essentially no committed players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2508366/page/19|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 30 Mar 2007, p. 19|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\n===DeVincentis and Piett era===\nDean Piett, a commercial real estate businessman from Burlington, and Rob DeVincentis, the Ancaster owner of a construction business, purchased the team from Heinz and owned the team from 2007 to 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/MPL/MPL002508887pf_0884.pdf |title=Photo |website=images.ourontario.ca |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Move to Brantford===\nDeVincentis sold the team in 2017 to Darren DeDobbelaer of Brantford, whose son Eric played on the Junior B Brantford 99ers, which DeDobbelaer also owned. The Ontario Hockey Association originally blocked the $500,000 sale of the IceHawks to prevent DeDobbelaer from moving the team to Brantford, or promoting the 99ers to Jr. A and demoting the IceHawks in Milton to Jr. B. Complicating matters was the fact that Brad Grant who previously owned the team was OHA chairman at the time of the proposed sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hamiltonnews.com/news-story/7410289-oha-decision-ices-bid-to-bring-junior-hockey-back-to-the-mountain/|title=OHA decision ices bid to bring junior hockey back to the Mountain|first=Mark|last=Newman|date=6 July 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The sale was ultimately approved on the condition that the IceHawks remain in Milton for the 2017\u201318 season.

They are a part of the [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]]. The 99ers have previously been known as the Milton Icehawks, Milton Merchants, Milton Flyers, and Milton Steamers as Milton hosted junior hockey from 1966 to 2018. After purchasing the team, Darren DeDobbelaer of Brantford moved the club to that city for the start of the 2018-19 season, re-branding the team as the 99ers.\n\n==History==\nThe Icehawks were one of the most historical teams in the Ontario Junior Hockey League, having been formed in 1964 until the team was purchased and moved to Brantford for the 2018-19 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quintenews.com/2018/06/ojhl-teams-move-cities-divisions-conferences/178975/|title=OJHL teams move cities, divisions & conferences - Quinte News|date=10 June 2018|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://miltonicehawks.pointstreaksites.com/view/miltonicehawks |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821171120/http://miltonicehawks.pointstreaksites.com/view/miltonicehawks |archive-date=2017-08-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Icehawks (2003\u20132018) have previously been known as the Milton Flyers (1971-1983), Milton Steamers (1983-1986), and Milton Merchants (1966-1971, 1986-2003).\n\n===Early years===\nAfter serving in the Second World War as a RCAF wireless air gunner, David Brush returned to Milton and managed the Fred Armstrong Arena on Brown Street for two years, before Milton had artificial ice. His dedication to hockey included coaching at the minor league level and founding the town\u2019s first Junior C club, the Milton Merchants, in 1964 as co-owner and president, which later became Jr. B and eventually Jr. A. For his efforts Brush was inducted into the Milton Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.<ref>https://www.milton.ca/en/play/sportshalloffame_Ceremony.asp</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Vern Gooding owned the local team when they were known as the Milton Flyers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2499204/page/5?n=3&q=flyers|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 4 Dec 1974, p. 5|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, three players including the team captain and top scorer left the team mid season over an imposed curfew dispute.

Morgan sold his stake in the club to Turner, prompting Scannell to announce that he was preparing to sell his stake as well.

For the 1986-87 season, he immediately changed the team's name from the Steamers to the Merchants after the Junior C team of old, and brought in former coach Gerry Inglis, who had also coached the Georgetown Raiders and had won five intermediate championships at the time.<ref name=\"halinet.on.ca\"/>\n\nGrant led the team to tremendous success in the late 1990s. During his 15-year ownership run, the team captured four division crowns, three league championships and a provincial title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/MPL/MPL002504511pf_0676.pdf |title=Photo |website=images.ourontario.ca |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the Milton Merchants were Central Junior B Hockey League champions with a 4-2 victory in Game 7 over the Aurora Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2690358/page/2|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 3 Apr 1992, p. 1|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>  They made the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] [[Sutherland Cup]] Junior B championship but lost in five games to the [[Mid-Western Junior B Hockey League]]'s [[Kitchener Dutchmen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2690370/page/16|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 1 May 1992, p. 15|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1992-93 season, the Merchants made the jump to Junior A in the OPJHL.\n\nThe 1994-95 season marked the beginning of a historical run for the franchise as the club won five straight division titles. The surge of success increased when the Merchants were crowned league champions in 1997, winning the [[Frank L. Buckland Trophy|Buckland Trophy]] after defeating the [[Newmarket 87's]]. In the 1997 Dudley Cup playoffs, the [[Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats]] (NOJHL) beat Milton four games to one.\n\nIn 1998, the Milton Merchants repeated their Buckland Trophy title, dispatching the [[Newmarket Hurricanes]] this time, and then went on to become Central Canadian Junior A Champions by winning the [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]], defeating the [[Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats]] (NOJHL) four games to two, and exacting revenge for the previous year's loss to Rayside-Balfour.\n\nAt the [[1998 Royal Bank Cup]], the Milton Merchants went 1-3 in round robin play. In the semifinal game, Milton lost 6-2 to the [[South Surrey Eagles]] and were eliminated from the tournament.\n\nIn 2018, the Milton Sports Hall of Fame announced that it is inducting the 1996\u201397 and 1997-98 Merchants teams, and Brad Grant as a builder, during a ceremony in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehalton.com/community-story/8698542-2018-class-named-for-milton-sports-hall-of-fame-induction/|title=2018 class named for Milton Sports Hall of Fame induction|date=27 June 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Forgione era===\nIn 2001, Grant sold the team to an Oakville trio that consisted of ex-NHLer [[Dave Gagner]], Mario Forgione who owned the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] at the time and was an automotive parts manufacturing president, and wine distillery consultant Ken Chase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2507710/page/17|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 15 Mar 2005, p. 17|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2506764/page/22|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 22 Jun 2001, p. 22|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2003-04 season, Forgione changed the team's name from the Merhcants to the IceHawks to reflect the team's connection with the local minor hockey programs called the Winterhawks, and Forgione's ownership of the Mississauga IceDogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2507362/page/21|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 17 Jun 2003, p. 21|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref> In 2005, the Ontario Hockey Association fined the Icehawks $12,000 and suspended then-General Manager George Dupont for signing two players outside of OHA guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamdailynews.ca/2010/12/10/junior-hockeys-dirty-little-ecret |title=Chatham News, Sports, Entertainment, Business, Life & Opinion &#124; Chatham Daily News |publisher=Chathamdailynews.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-09-05}}</ref> In 2006, Forgione officially affiliated the Icehawks with the IceDogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2508127/page/15?n=|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 14 Mar 2006, p. 15|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\n===Heinz era===\nIn the spring of 2006, ex-NHL goaltender [[Rick Heinz|Rick Heinz']] attempt to purchase the nearby [[Georgetown Raiders]] fell through, but by July 2006 the local Campbellville resident Heinz had talked Forgione into selling the Icehawks, and the affiliation with the IceDogs ended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2508247/page/18?n=|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 7 Jul 2006, p. 18|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref> Heinz sold the team just nine months later after starting the season with essentially no committed players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2508366/page/19|title=Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 30 Mar 2007, p. 19|website=news.milton.halinet.on.ca}}</ref>\n\n===DeVincentis and Piett era===\nDean Piett, a commercial real estate businessman from Burlington, and Rob DeVincentis, the Ancaster owner of a construction business, purchased the team from Heinz and owned the team from 2007 to 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/MPL/MPL002508887pf_0884.pdf |title=Photo |website=images.ourontario.ca |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Move to Brantford===\nDeVincentis sold the team in 2017 to Darren DeDobbelaer of Brantford, whose son Eric played on the Junior B Brantford 99ers, which DeDobbelaer also owned. The Ontario Hockey Association originally blocked the $500,000 sale of the IceHawks to prevent DeDobbelaer from moving the team to Brantford, or promoting the 99ers to Jr. A and demoting the IceHawks in Milton to Jr. B. Complicating matters was the fact that Brad Grant who previously owned the team was OHA chairman at the time of the proposed sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hamiltonnews.com/news-story/7410289-oha-decision-ices-bid-to-bring-junior-hockey-back-to-the-mountain/|title=OHA decision ices bid to bring junior hockey back to the Mountain|first=Mark|last=Newman|date=6 July 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The sale was ultimately approved on the condition that the IceHawks remain in Milton for the 2017\u201318 season.

In the UK, it is produced for the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9-to-12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine heats leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the programme in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the programme underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after one series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although neither addresses the viewer directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final.  Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cookery demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

A second series of the revived format ran in 2012, with a third following in 2014.\n\n== 2018 ''Rendang'' controversy ==\n''MasterChef'' was involved in a controversy (during Series 14, Episode 13) when Zaleha Kadir Olpin, a Malaysian-born contestant who had cooked ''[[nasi lemak]]'' and [[rendang]], native Southeast Asian dishes, was criticised by judges Gregg Wallace and John Torode because the dish was of poor quality. She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.  Many commentators (who did not realise what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"undercooked\".

competitive cooking show produced by [[Endemol Shine Group]] and is broadcast in 60 countries around the world. In the UK, it is produced for the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9-to-12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine heats leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, wandered around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the programme in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the programme underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after one series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although neither addresses the viewer directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final.  Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cookery demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

introduced in 2008.\n\n==''Junior MasterChef''==\n{{main article|Junior MasterChef}}\n''Junior MasterChef'' originally ran from 1994 to 1999 for under-16s. It was revived in 2010 with an age range of nine to twelve. A second series of the revived format ran in 2012, with a third following in 2014.\n\n== 2018 ''Rendang'' controversy ==\n''MasterChef'' was involved in a controversy (during Series 14, Episode 13) when Zaleha Kadir Olpin, a Malaysian-born contestant who had cooked ''[[nasi lemak]]'' and [[rendang]], native Southeast Asian dishes, was criticised by judges Gregg Wallace and John Torode because the dish was of poor quality. She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.  Many commentators (who did not realise what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"undercooked\".

The residents are known as ''Gordiens.'' The nearest big city is [[Avignon]]; smaller cities nearby include [[Cavaillon]], [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]] and [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe territory of Gordes occupies some of \"[[Vaucluse Mountains|Les Monts de Vaucluse]]\", a group of mountains and hills, part in the valley of the Calavon (a local river) also called the \"Luberon Valley\".\n\n=== Access ===\nThe main access to the village of Gordes is the departmental road D2 then the departmental road  D15, coming from [[Cavaillon]]. It is from the latter road, below the Bel-Air rock, that you can observe the most famous and photographed point of view of the village.\n\nGordes is located 38 kilometres east from [[Avignon]] and its TGV station, 75 kilometres from the Marseille Provence international airport and 87 kilometres from Marseille. The closest \"gares SNCF\" (normal train station) are located in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and Cavaillon.\n\n===Neighboring communes===\nNeighboring villages are [[Venasque]] and [[Murs, Vaucluse|Murs]] to the north, [[Joucas]] and [[Roussillon (Vaucluse)|Roussillon]] to the east, [[Goult]], [[Saint-Pantal\u00e9on (Vaucluse)|Saint-Pantal\u00e9on]], [[Beaumettes]] and [[Opp\u00e8de]] to the south and [[Cabri\u00e8res-d'Avignon]] and [[Saumane-de-Vaucluse]] to the west.\n\n=== Topography ===\nLocated between two geographic area, Gordes is one of the biggest [[Communes of France|communes]] of the area with 4,804 hectares. The north is defined by the southern edge of the [[Vaucluse Mountains]]. The highest point of the commune (635 meters) is in this area, next to ''la Pouraque''  and ''les Trois Termes''. The south of the commune is made by the Calavon valley, also called the Luberon Valley, and a few hills in the area. The lowest height of the commune, at 111 meters, is in the south in the area called ''plan de l'Alba''.\n\nThe village itself is located in the center of the commune, on a giant calcareous rock from the Vaucluse Mountains, dominating the valley.\n\n=== Geology ===\nWith a wide variation of the land, geology of the commune is divided into several distinct zones.\n\nIn the north, on the [[Vaucluse Mountains]], are soils dating mainly from Upper Jurassic with urgonian limestone and calcareous clay. There are also, in very low amounts and primarily localized over the Senanque Abbey, soils dating from the Eocene / Oligocene, composed of limestone, sand, and clay.\n\nGeology in the south of the village is more complex. The plain in Gordes (southeast) is composed of soil dating from the Quaternary (fluvial deposits, colluvium and scree) and soils of the Late Jurassic period (calcareous clay and blue marl). The hills area of \"les garrigues\" (in the south) is composed of soil dating from the Cretaceous \u2013 Paleocene period (calcareous sandstone, calcareous lacustrine clay, colorful, white and ocher sands and some ferruginous) and from the Miocene period (molasses limestone, sand and marl). Finally, the soil of the territory down to the plain of Calavon with some slightly higher ground dating from the Miocene and one lower from the Quaternary.\n\n===Climate===\nGordes has a Mediterranean climate characterised by relatively dry summers and cool, damp winters. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the [[mistral (wind)|mistral]].\n\nIn summer, high temperatures associated with a reduced amount of rain creates a drought of almost one or two months a year according to the \"Gaussen index\" (temperatures in Celsius degrees twice higher than rains in millimeters).<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.atlas-parcduluberon.com/atlas/images/EnSavoirPlus_survol.gif Atlas du parc du Luberon]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Gordes\" derives from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic word]] \"Vordense\". Vordense was pronounced ''Gordenses'',  then ''Gordae/Gordone'', and finally ''G\u00f2rda'' then translated into French \"Gordes\".<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 9.</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\nOccupation by the Roman empire.<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 17 to 24 / \"L'\u00e9poque romaine\".</ref> The area is full of evidence of their occupation especially the Roman road passing through Apt and Carpentras and crossing the valley.  Gallo-Roman remains were found in \"Bouisses\" district (skeletons, amphorae, columns) or Gallo-Roman substructures in the hamlet of \"les Gros\".\n\n[[Image:Castle of Gordes by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|The view from north of the castle shows the ancient and the Renaissance parts.]]\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nIn the 8th century, a [[Benedictine]] abbey known as [[Saint-Chaffret]] was founded by monks of the Abbey of Saint-Chaffre in [[Monastier-en-Velay]] on the site of an ancient ''cella'' (Roman temple) destroyed during the [[Arab]] invasions.<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 39 to 53, \"''Histoire de Saint Chaffret''\"</ref>\n\nIn 1031, a castle was built and the Latin word [[castra|\"castrum\"]] was added to what thus became \"Castrum Gordone\". The castle was re-enforced in 1123 to become a \"''nobile castrum''\", the only one known among the many castles nearby.<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 249 to 253 \"Le ch\u00e2teau de Gordes\" then page 205 to 216 / \"G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie des familles\".</ref>\n\nIn 1148 the [[S\u00e9nanque Abbey]] was established under the patronage of Alfant, [[Bishop of Cavaillon]], and [[Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona]], [[Count of Provence]], by Cistercian monks who came from [[Mazan Abbey]] in the [[Ard\u00e8che]].\n\nAfter the death of King Ren\u00e9 of Provence, the territory of Provence was incorporated in 1481 into the kingdom of France as a \"province royale fran\u00e7aise\" (French royal province). An insurrection broke out in the former states of Agoult-Simiane and County of Forcalquier. Gordes is distinguished by a strong opposition to French centralism but will pay heavily for its claims of independence. A year later, with the wedding of his son, Jacques Raybaud de Simiane takes the title of \"Baron de Gordes\".\n\n=== Second World War ===\nDuring World War II, Gordes was an active resistance village and was later awarded a medal, the [[Croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France)|Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945]].\n\nOn 21 August 1944, almost a week after the beginning of the [[Operation Dragoon]] on the Proven\u00e7al coast, a German patrol was attacked by the resistance. The day after, 22 August, the village was subject to violent reprisals. The Germans forced the inhabitants to enter their homes, shooting those who were late or that were not cooperating, and started to shoot from the rock on the other side with a canon and destroyed a dozen houses. On the other side of the village, the rest of the troops set fire to a chariot, pieces of wood and houses, blocking potential followers. More than twenty houses were destroyed. After the Liberation the resistance destroyed another part of the village, including the notarial house with all the archives. All this destruction brought the municipality the sad privilege to appear amongst three \"stricken cities\" of the Vaucluse department. By war's end, thirteen persons had been killed or executed in Gordes, twenty inhabitants had been shot by the enemy and five inhabitants were deported.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nAfter a period of reconstruction, the village started to attract artists like [[Marc Chagall]] or [[Jean Deyrolle]] who discovered the village in 1947 and will in turn attract artist friends such as [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Victor Vasarely|Vasarely]], [[Jean Dewasne|Dewasne]], etc.\n\n===Armory===\nThe primary ones are reported in 1696 in the [[Armorial G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France]] and coming from the Gordes-Simiane family.\n\n{{Blazon-arms\n| img1=Blason famille Gordes.svg\n| legend1=Arms of the Gordes family\n| text=The arms of the Gordes family are [[blazon]]ed :<br /> \"de gueules \u00e0 une gourde d'or\". \n}}\n\n{{Blazon-arms\n| img1=Blason famille Simiane.svg\n| legend1=Arms of the Simiane family\n| text=The arms of the Simiane family are [[blazon]]ed :<br />\"d'or sem\u00e9 altern\u00e9 de tours et de fleurs de lys d'azur\".\n}}\n\n{{Blazon-arms\n| img1=Blason Gordes 84.svg\n| legend1=1984's armory\n| text=In 1984, new arms are created : \"Mantel\u00e9 d'or \u00e0 deux gourdes de gueules, et de gueules \u00e0 une gourde d'or\".\n\n<br />\nThe design is clearly based on the Gordes family armory in terms of colors and form.\n}}\n\n=== Other historical language names ===\n{{Lang-oc|G\u00f2rda}} in classical norm of provencal, {{Lang|oc|Gordo}} in Mistralian norm\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Hotel simiane in Gordes by JM Rosier.jpg|thumb|The \"Hotel Simiane\", historical building with the new town office.]]\n\nThe commune of Gordes has numerous infrastructures of public utility like the \"gendarmerie\", the fire brigade, the post office, a tax office, a library, etc.\n\n===Sister cities===\n* {{Flagicon|France}} [[Annet-sur-Marne]], France, since 1985.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [[:fr:Fichier:Jumelage Gordes Annet-sur-Marnes bulletin municipal 1986.jpg|Article from the \"bulletin municipal\" of Gordes, 1986.]]</ref>\n\n=== Fiscality ===\n{| align=\"center\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border: 1px solid #999; border-right: 2px solid #999; border-bottom:2px solid #999; background: #FFFFFF\"\n|+ style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em\"|Taxation of households and businesses in Gordes in 2009<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.taxe.com/index-impots-departement-commune~84050.html local taxes, Gordes]</ref> \n|-style=\"background: #adcdf1\"\n!

No fences are allowed, only stone walls. All electrical and telephone cables have been put underground, except for some locations on the border of the commune not made already. Some streets inside the village are paved with stones and called \"calade\".\n\n=== The hamlets ===\nAround the village there are many ancient hamlets. Their names are mostly coming from the family names  occupying the places (Gros, Imbert, Martin, Cortasse, etc.) or from the activity performed there (les bouillons, les bouilladoires).\n\nLocated in the valley at southwest, the \"''les Imberts''\" hamlet is the biggest and even owns its own church built between 1785 and 1792. Besides this church, there are some elements and fa\u00e7ades of the 18th century. It is in this hamlet that are the two football stadiums of Gordes. One is for the official matches and the other for training. It has a nursery and a school and having once had several small businesses (bakery, grocery, etc..), in 2011 it now has only a garage / petrol station.\n\n\"''Les Gros''\" and \"''les Martins''\" are both former hamlets close enough to each other, between ''les Imberts'' and the commune of [[les Beaumettes]].\n\nIn the plain south-east of the village, you find the hamlets of \"''les Sauvestres''\", \"''les Pourquiers''\", \"''les Marres''\" and \"''les Cortasses''\", with buildings whose origins date back sometimes to hundreds years.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Gordes, vignes et oliviers, par JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|Vinyard and olive trees with the roofs of Gordes in the back]]\nAs in many villages in the Vaucluse department, agriculture is important. Historically, almond trees were the most planted in the area, and though they are still present, olive trees have largely replaced them. Thus olive oil is important to local commerce. You can also find vineyards, with the production of table grapes or wine in [[C\u00f4tes du Ventoux AOC|AOC Ventoux]].<ref>INAO, April 2007</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\nTourism is a major part of the local economy of Gordes.  Accommodating the tourist trade, there are a number hotels,<ref>{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/hebergement2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113716/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/hebergement2.html |date=11 July 2011 }}</ref> bed and breakfasts, seasonal rentals, and restaurants.<ref>{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/gastronomie2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113445/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/gastronomie2.html |date=11 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe main sights on the commune are the village itself, the castle, the Saint-Firmain Palace cellars, the [[S\u00e9nanque Abbey]] and the [[Village des Bories]].<ref>{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/patrimoine2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814133847/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/patrimoine2.html |date=14 August 2012 }}</ref> In the surrounding towns, you can find many other tourist locations like the [[Fontaine de Vaucluse (spring)|Fontaine de Vaucluse]], [[Roussillon (Vaucluse)|Roussillon]] or [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]], the [[Luberon]] area, [[Avignon]] or the [[Mont Ventoux]].\n\nGordes also has two centers of relaxation, numerous pools and ponds and miles of hiking trails.\n\n=== Commercial activity and handcraft ===\nCommercial activity is also important in the Gordes economy with various shops including several shops dedicated to tourists, selling souvenir and regional products (figurines, textiles, olive oil, honey, etc.). Moreover, a Proven\u00e7al market is held every Tuesday morning around the castle.\n\nGordes also attracts artisans and traders in the real estate business like agents, architects, builders, landscapers, decorators, masons. By the way, the oldest real estate agency of the north Luberon area still in activity is located in Gordes, between the castle and the church, and the total number of real estate agents on the Gordes area is over ten.\n\n==Everyday life==\n[[Image:Gordes 2 By JM Rosier.jpg|thumb|Gordes]]\nMarket day occurs in Gordes once a week. On Tuesday mornings, merchants from the area set up booths and sell their wares. These typically include food, clothing, instruments, Proven\u00e7ale dishes, decorations, and handicrafts. Additionally, the village has two bakeries and a variety of shops.\n\n=== Education ===\nYou can find on the commune Primary School, Nursery School and Day Care.<ref name=\"contact\">{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/contact2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113359/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/contact2.html |date=11 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the closest university is in Avignon, locals also attend slightly more distant universities in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.\n\n=== Health ===\nThe village is home to several doctors, a pharmacy, a dentist and even an hospital but exclusively used for older people.<ref name=\"contact\" />\n\n=== Sport ===\nThe commune is equipped with various sporting facilities including two football/soccer fields, walking and cycling trails, p\u00e9tanque and other recreational spaces.\n\n==Personalities==\nGordes is also known for artists who have lived or worked there: ([[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Pierre Chapo]], [[Philippe Ragueneau]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Victor Spahn]], [[Walter Salles]], [[Willy Ronis]], etc.) and politicians (including [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]).\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Confr\u00e9rie des vignerons C\u00f4tes de Ventoux by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb]]\n\n=== Fine arts and festival ===\nThe village of Gordes has a few art galleries and festivals. The biggest festival of Gordes is a music festival, but there is also a wine festival.<ref>{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/evenements2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113648/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/evenements2.html |date=11 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:WillyRonis.jpg|thumb|''Proven\u00e7al Nude'' by Willy Ronis.]] -->\nThe castle, stone houses, stone paved streets, views, etc. of Gordes have been an important source of inspiration for paintings or photography. for example, the ''Proven\u00e7al Nude'' by Willy Ronis was made in the \"fontaine basse\" area of Gordes in 1949.\n\n=== Literature ===\nYou find Gordes in books like :\n* ''La v\u00e9nus de Gordes'', [[Ernest Daudet]] (1875)\n* ''Sa Majest\u00e9 l'argent III, La Comtesse De Gordes'', [[Xavier de Mont\u00e9pin]], (1878)\n* All the books about the adventure of the ''Chat Moune'', [[Philippe Ragueneau]] (from 1981 to 1990)\n* ''Les trois Joyaux de Gordes'', [[Marc de Smedt]] (1988)\n* ''a year in Provence'', [[Peter Mayle]] (1993)\nA photograph of Gordes was used on the cover of the 2017 Gollancz edition of ''Orsinia'', an edition combining ''[[Malafrena]]'' and ''[[Orsinian Tales]]'' by [[Ursula K.

The residents are known as ''Gordiens.'' The nearest big city is [[Avignon]]; smaller cities nearby include [[Cavaillon]], [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]] and [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe territory of Gordes occupies some of \"[[Vaucluse Mountains|Les Monts de Vaucluse]]\", a group of mountains and hills, part in the valley of the Calavon (a local river) also called the \"Luberon Valley\".\n\n=== Access ===\nThe main access to the village of Gordes is the departmental road D2 then the departmental road  D15, coming from [[Cavaillon]]. It is from the latter road, below the Bel-Air rock, that you can observe the most famous and photographed point of view of the village.\n\nGordes is located 38 kilometres east from [[Avignon]] and its TGV station, 75 kilometres from the Marseille Provence international airport and 87 kilometres from Marseille. The closest \"gares SNCF\" (normal train station) are located in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and Cavaillon.\n\n===Neighboring communes===\nNeighboring villages are [[Venasque]] and [[Murs, Vaucluse|Murs]] to the north, [[Joucas]] and [[Roussillon (Vaucluse)|Roussillon]] to the east, [[Goult]], [[Saint-Pantal\u00e9on (Vaucluse)|Saint-Pantal\u00e9on]], [[Beaumettes]] and [[Opp\u00e8de]] to the south and [[Cabri\u00e8res-d'Avignon]] and [[Saumane-de-Vaucluse]] to the west.\n\n=== Topography ===\nLocated between two geographic area, Gordes is one of the biggest [[Communes of France|communes]] of the area with 4,804 hectares. The north is defined by the southern edge of the [[Vaucluse Mountains]]. The highest point of the commune (635 meters) is in this area, next to ''la Pouraque''  and ''les Trois Termes''. The south of the commune is made by the Calavon valley, also called the Luberon Valley, and a few hills in the area. The lowest height of the commune, at 111 meters, is in the south in the area called ''plan de l'Alba''.\n\nThe village itself is located in the center of the commune, on a giant calcareous rock from the Vaucluse Mountains, dominating the valley.\n\n=== Geology ===\nWith a wide variation of the land, geology of the commune is divided into several distinct zones.\n\nIn the north, on the [[Vaucluse Mountains]], are soils dating mainly from Upper Jurassic with urgonian limestone and calcareous clay. There are also, in very low amounts and primarily localized over the Senanque Abbey, soils dating from the Eocene / Oligocene, composed of limestone, sand, and clay.\n\nGeology in the south of the village is more complex. The plain in Gordes (southeast) is composed of soil dating from the Quaternary (fluvial deposits, colluvium and scree) and soils of the Late Jurassic period (calcareous clay and blue marl). The hills area of \"les garrigues\" (in the south) is composed of soil dating from the Cretaceous \u2013 Paleocene period (calcareous sandstone, calcareous lacustrine clay, colorful, white and ocher sands and some ferruginous) and from the Miocene period (molasses limestone, sand and marl). Finally, the soil of the territory down to the plain of Calavon with some slightly higher ground dating from the Miocene and one lower from the Quaternary.\n\n===Climate===\nGordes has a Mediterranean climate characterised by relatively dry summers and cool, damp winters. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the [[mistral (wind)|mistral]].\n\nIn summer, high temperatures associated with a reduced amount of rain creates a drought of almost one or two months a year according to the \"Gaussen index\" (temperatures in Celsius degrees twice higher than rains in millimeters).<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.atlas-parcduluberon.com/atlas/images/EnSavoirPlus_survol.gif Atlas du parc du Luberon]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Gordes\" derives from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic word]] \"Vordense\". Vordense was pronounced ''Gordenses'',  then ''Gordae/Gordone'', and finally ''G\u00f2rda'' then translated into French \"Gordes\".<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 9.</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\nOccupation by the Roman empire.<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 17 to 24 / \"L'\u00e9poque romaine\".</ref> The area is full of evidence of their occupation especially the Roman road passing through Apt and Carpentras and crossing the valley.  Gallo-Roman remains were found in \"Bouisses\" district (skeletons, amphorae, columns) or Gallo-Roman substructures in the hamlet of \"les Gros\".\n\n[[Image:Castle of Gordes by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|The view from north of the castle shows the ancient and the Renaissance parts.]]\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nIn the 8th century, a [[Benedictine]] abbey known as [[Saint-Chaffret]] was founded by monks of the Abbey of Saint-Chaffre in [[Monastier-en-Velay]] on the site of an ancient ''cella'' (Roman temple) destroyed during the [[Arab]] invasions.<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 39 to 53, \"''Histoire de Saint Chaffret''\"</ref>\n\nIn 1031, a castle was built and the Latin word [[castra|\"castrum\"]] was added to what thus became \"Castrum Gordone\". The castle was re-enforced in 1123 to become a \"''nobile castrum''\", the only one known among the many castles nearby.<ref>''GORDES notes d'histoire'' by Jean-Louis Morand page 249 to 253 \"Le ch\u00e2teau de Gordes\" then page 205 to 216 / \"G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie des familles\".</ref>\n\nIn 1148 the [[S\u00e9nanque Abbey]] was established under the patronage of Alfant, [[Bishop of Cavaillon]], and [[Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona]], [[Count of Provence]], by Cistercian monks who came from [[Mazan Abbey]] in the [[Ard\u00e8che]].\n\nAfter the death of King Ren\u00e9 of Provence, the territory of Provence was incorporated in 1481 into the kingdom of France as a \"province royale fran\u00e7aise\" (French royal province). An insurrection broke out in the former states of Agoult-Simiane and County of Forcalquier. Gordes is distinguished by a strong opposition to French centralism but will pay heavily for its claims of independence. A year later, with the wedding of his son, Jacques Raybaud de Simiane takes the title of \"Baron de Gordes\".\n\n=== Second World War ===\nDuring World War II, Gordes was an active resistance village and was later awarded a medal, the [[Croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France)|Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945]].\n\nOn 21 August 1944, almost a week after the beginning of the [[Operation Dragoon]] on the Proven\u00e7al coast, a German patrol was attacked by the resistance. The day after, 22 August, the village was subject to violent reprisals. The Germans forced the inhabitants to enter their homes, shooting those who were late or that were not cooperating, and started to shoot from the rock on the other side with a canon and destroyed a dozen houses. On the other side of the village, the rest of the troops set fire to a chariot, pieces of wood and houses, blocking potential followers. More than twenty houses were destroyed. After the Liberation the resistance destroyed another part of the village, including the notarial house with all the archives. All this destruction brought the municipality the sad privilege to appear amongst three \"stricken cities\" of the Vaucluse department. By war's end, thirteen persons had been killed or executed in Gordes, twenty inhabitants had been shot by the enemy and five inhabitants were deported.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nAfter a period of reconstruction, the village started to attract artists like [[Marc Chagall]] or [[Jean Deyrolle]] who discovered the village in 1947 and will in turn attract artist friends such as [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Victor Vasarely|Vasarely]], [[Jean Dewasne|Dewasne]], etc.\n\n===Armory===\nThe primary ones are reported in 1696 in the [[Armorial G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France]] and coming from the Gordes-Simiane family.\n\n{{Blazon-arms\n| img1=Blason famille Gordes.svg\n| legend1=Arms of the Gordes family\n| text=The arms of the Gordes family are [[blazon]]ed :<br /> \"de gueules \u00e0 une gourde d'or\". \n}}\n\n{{Blazon-arms\n| img1=Blason famille Simiane.svg\n| legend1=Arms of the Simiane family\n| text=The arms of the Simiane family are [[blazon]]ed :<br />\"d'or sem\u00e9 altern\u00e9 de tours et de fleurs de lys d'azur\".\n}}\n\n{{Blazon-arms\n| img1=Blason Gordes 84.svg\n| legend1=1984's armory\n| text=In 1984, new arms are created : \"Mantel\u00e9 d'or \u00e0 deux gourdes de gueules, et de gueules \u00e0 une gourde d'or\".\n\n<br />\nThe design is clearly based on the Gordes family armory in terms of colors and form.\n}}\n\n=== Other historical language names ===\n{{Lang-oc|G\u00f2rda}} in classical norm of provencal, {{Lang|oc|Gordo}} in Mistralian norm\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Hotel simiane in Gordes by JM Rosier.jpg|thumb|The \"Hotel Simiane\", historical building with the new town office.]]\n\nThe commune of Gordes has numerous infrastructures of public utility like the \"gendarmerie\", the fire brigade, the post office, a tax office, a library, etc.\n\n===Sister cities===\n* {{Flagicon|France}} [[Annet-sur-Marne]], France, since 1985.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [[:fr:Fichier:Jumelage Gordes Annet-sur-Marnes bulletin municipal 1986.jpg|Article from the \"bulletin municipal\" of Gordes, 1986.]]</ref>\n\n=== Fiscality ===\n{| align=\"center\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border: 1px solid #999; border-right: 2px solid #999; border-bottom:2px solid #999; background: #FFFFFF\"\n|+ style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em\"|Taxation of households and businesses in Gordes in 2009<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.taxe.com/index-impots-departement-commune~84050.html local taxes, Gordes]</ref> \n|-style=\"background: #adcdf1\"\n!

No fences are allowed, only stone walls. All electrical and telephone cables have been put underground, except for some locations on the border of the commune not made already. Some streets inside the village are paved with stones and called \"calade\".\n\n=== The hamlets ===\nAround the village there are many ancient hamlets. Their names are mostly coming from the family names  occupying the places (Gros, Imbert, Martin, Cortasse, etc.) or from the activity performed there (les bouillons, les bouilladoires).\n\nLocated in the valley at southwest, the \"''les Imberts''\" hamlet is the biggest and even owns its own church built between 1785 and 1792. Besides this church, there are some elements and fa\u00e7ades of the 18th century. It is in this hamlet that are the two football stadiums of Gordes. One is for the official matches and the other for training. It has a nursery and a school and having once had several small businesses (bakery, grocery, etc..), in 2011 it now has only a garage / petrol station.\n\n\"''Les Gros''\" and \"''les Martins''\" are both former hamlets close enough to each other, between ''les Imberts'' and the commune of [[les Beaumettes]].\n\nIn the plain south-east of the village, you find the hamlets of \"''les Sauvestres''\", \"''les Pourquiers''\", \"''les Marres''\" and \"''les Cortasses''\", with buildings whose origins date back sometimes to hundreds years.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Gordes, vignes et oliviers, par JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|Vinyard and olive trees with the roofs of Gordes in the back]]\nAs in many villages in the Vaucluse department, agriculture is important. Historically, almond trees were the most planted in the area, and though they are still present, olive trees have largely replaced them. Thus olive oil is important to local commerce. You can also find vineyards, with the production of table grapes or wine in [[C\u00f4tes du Ventoux AOC|AOC Ventoux]].<ref>INAO, April 2007</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\nTourism is a major part of the local economy of Gordes.  Accommodating the tourist trade, there are a number hotels,<ref>{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/hebergement2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113716/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/hebergement2.html |date=11 July 2011 }}</ref> bed and breakfasts, seasonal rentals, and restaurants.<ref>{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/gastronomie2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113445/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/gastronomie2.html |date=11 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe main sights on the commune are the village itself, the castle, the Saint-Firmain Palace cellars, the [[S\u00e9nanque Abbey]] and the [[Village des Bories]].<ref>{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/patrimoine2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814133847/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/patrimoine2.html |date=14 August 2012 }}</ref> In the surrounding towns, you can find many other tourist locations like the [[Fontaine de Vaucluse (spring)|Fontaine de Vaucluse]], [[Roussillon (Vaucluse)|Roussillon]] or [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]], the [[Luberon]] area, [[Avignon]] or the [[Mont Ventoux]].\n\nGordes also has two centers of relaxation, numerous pools and ponds and miles of hiking trails.\n\n=== Commercial activity and handcraft ===\nCommercial activity is also important in the Gordes economy with various shops including several shops dedicated to tourists, selling souvenir and regional products (figurines, textiles, olive oil, honey, etc.). Moreover, a Proven\u00e7al market is held every Tuesday morning around the castle.\n\nGordes also attracts artisans and traders in the real estate business like agents, architects, builders, landscapers, decorators, masons. By the way, the oldest real estate agency of the north Luberon area still in activity is located in Gordes, between the castle and the church, and the total number of real estate agents on the Gordes area is over ten.\n\n==Everyday life==\n[[Image:Gordes 2 By JM Rosier.jpg|thumb|Gordes]]\nMarket day occurs in Gordes once a week. On Tuesday mornings, merchants from the area set up booths and sell their wares. These typically include food, clothing, instruments, Proven\u00e7ale dishes, decorations, and handicrafts. Additionally, the village has two bakeries and a variety of shops.\n\n=== Education ===\nYou can find on the commune Primary School, Nursery School and Day Care.<ref name=\"contact\">{{in lang|en}} http://www.gordes-village.com/html/contact2.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711113359/http://www.gordes-village.com/html/contact2.html |date=11 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the closest university is in Avignon, locals also attend slightly more distant universities in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.\n\n=== Health ===\nThe village is home to several doctors, a pharmacy, a dentist and even an hospital but exclusively used for older people.<ref name=\"contact\" />\n\n=== Sport ===\nThe commune is equipped with various sporting facilities including two football/soccer fields, walking and cycling trails, p\u00e9tanque and other recreational spaces.\n\n==Personalities==\nGordes is also known for artists who have lived or worked there: ([[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Pierre Chapo]], [[Philippe Ragueneau]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Victor Spahn]], [[Walter Salles]], [[Willy Ronis]], etc.) and politicians (including [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]).\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Confr\u00e9rie des vignerons C\u00f4tes de Ventoux by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb]]\n\n=== Fine arts and festival ===\nThe village of Gordes has a few art galleries and festivals.

A pedal point sometimes functions as a \"[[non-chord tone]]\", placing it in the categories alongside [[Suspension (music)|suspension]]s, [[Suspension (music)|retardation]]s, and [[passing tone]]s. However, the pedal point is unique among non-chord tones, \"in that it begins on a consonance, sustains (or [[repetition (music)|repeats]]) through another chord as a dissonance until the [[harmony]]\", not the non-chord tone, \"resolves back to a consonance\".<ref name=\"smu\">Frank, Robert J. (2000). [http://www.smu.edu/totw/nct.htm \"Non-Chord Tones\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703095155/http://www.smu.edu/TOTW/nct.htm |date=2007-07-03 }}, ''Theory on the Web'', Southern Methodist University.</ref>\n\n[[File:pedalpoint.gif|thumb|center|400px|Pedal point example. {{audio|Pedalpoint.mid|Play}}]]\n\nPedal points \"have a strong tonal effect, 'pulling' the harmony back to its [[root (chord)|root]]\".<ref name=\"smu\" /> When a pedal point occurs in a [[voice (music)|voice]] other than the bass, it is usually referred to as an '''inverted pedal point'''<ref name=\"B&S\">Benward & Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.\u00a099. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref> (see [[inversion (music)|inversion]]). Pedal points are usually on either the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] (fifth note of the [[scale (music)|scale]]) tones. The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a [[nonchord tone]] during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an [[added tone]] than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal [[pitch center]]s.\n\nThe term comes from the [[organ (music)|organ]] for its ability to sustain a note indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ's [[pedal keyboard]]. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual keyboards.\n\n==Types==\nA '''double pedal''' is two pedal tones played simultaneously.\nAn '''inverted pedal''' is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest part.)  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] included numerous inverted pedals in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his [[concerto]]s. An '''internal pedal''' is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.\n\nA [[drone (music)|drone]] differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a [[nonchord tone]] and thus required to [[Resolution (music)|resolve]], unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.\n\n==Use in classical music==\n\nThere are numerous examples of pedal points in European classical music. Pedal points often appear in early baroque music \"alla battaglia\", notably prolonged in [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]'s ''Es steh Gott auf'' (SWV 356) and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''Altri canti di Marte''.<ref>Gerald Drebes: \"Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \u201eVollkommenheit der Musik\u201c \u2013 \u201eEs steh Gott auf\u201c aus den \u201eSymphoniae sacrae\u201c II (1647)\".

Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals.  A pedal tone can also be realized with a [[trill (music)|trill]]; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen [[harpsichord#Other|pedal harpsichord]], a harpsichord with a [[pedal keyboard]], makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.\n\nWith the development of the piano, composers began exploring the potential of a pedal-point in creating mood and atmosphere.  An example is the inverted pedal that pervades the right hand part of the piano accompaniment in [[Schubert]]\u2019s song [[Erlk\u00f6nig (Goethe)|''The Erl King'']]:\n[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 01.wav|thumb|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n\nAccording to Eugene Narmour (1987, p.&nbsp;101) \"There is no instrument on which a pedal point sounds better than the piano (with its ready-made damper mechanism), and, safe to say, no composer more fond of harmonic pedals than [[Chopin]].\"<ref>Narmour, E. (1987)  \"Melodic structuring of harmonic dissonance\" in Samson, J. (ed.) ''Chopin Studies''.

A pedal point sometimes functions as a \"[[non-chord tone]]\", placing it in the categories alongside [[Suspension (music)|suspension]]s, [[Suspension (music)|retardation]]s, and [[passing tone]]s. However, the pedal point is unique among non-chord tones, \"in that it begins on a consonance, sustains (or [[repetition (music)|repeats]]) through another chord as a dissonance until the [[harmony]]\", not the non-chord tone, \"resolves back to a consonance\".<ref name=\"smu\">Frank, Robert J.

''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.\u00a099. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref> (see [[inversion (music)|inversion]]). Pedal points are usually on either the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] (fifth note of the [[scale (music)|scale]]) tones. The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a [[nonchord tone]] during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an [[added tone]] than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal [[pitch center]]s.\n\nThe term comes from the [[organ (music)|organ]] for its ability to sustain a note indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ's [[pedal keyboard]]. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual keyboards.\n\n==Types==\nA '''double pedal''' is two pedal tones played simultaneously.\nAn '''inverted pedal''' is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest part.)  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] included numerous inverted pedals in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his [[concerto]]s. An '''internal pedal''' is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.\n\nA [[drone (music)|drone]] differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a [[nonchord tone]] and thus required to [[Resolution (music)|resolve]], unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.\n\n==Use in classical music==\n\nThere are numerous examples of pedal points in European classical music. Pedal points often appear in early baroque music \"alla battaglia\", notably prolonged in [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]'s ''Es steh Gott auf'' (SWV 356) and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''Altri canti di Marte''.<ref>Gerald Drebes: \"Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \u201eVollkommenheit der Musik\u201c \u2013 \u201eEs steh Gott auf\u201c aus den \u201eSymphoniae sacrae\u201c II (1647)\".

Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals.  A pedal tone can also be realized with a [[trill (music)|trill]]; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen [[harpsichord#Other|pedal harpsichord]], a harpsichord with a [[pedal keyboard]], makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.\n\nWith the development of the piano, composers began exploring the potential of a pedal-point in creating mood and atmosphere.  An example is the inverted pedal that pervades the right hand part of the piano accompaniment in [[Schubert]]\u2019s song [[Erlk\u00f6nig (Goethe)|''The Erl King'']]:[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 01.wav|thumb|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]][[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n\nAccording to Eugene Narmour (1987, p.&nbsp;101) \"There is no instrument on which a pedal point sounds better than the piano (with its ready-made damper mechanism), and, safe to say, no composer more fond of harmonic pedals than [[Chopin]].\"<ref>Narmour, E.

The writer's predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], where Lang and his wife Ruth ([[Olivia Williams]]) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly ([[Kim Cattrall]]), and staff. Amelia forbids the writer from taking McAra's [[Manuscript format|manuscript]] outside, emphasising that it is a security risk.\n\nShortly after the writer's arrival, former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] Richard Rycart ([[Robert Pugh]]) accuses Lang of authorising the [[extraordinary rendition|illegal seizure]] of suspected terrorists and handing them over to be [[torture]]d by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], a possible [[war crime]]. Lang faces prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]] unless he stays in the United States (or one of the few other countries that do not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in [[Washington, D.C.]], the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's.\n\nDuring a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man ([[Eli Wallach]]) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but she later fell down the stairs and lapsed into a coma. \n\nLater, Ruth admits to the writer that Lang had never been very political and until recently always took her advice. When the writer tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to \"clear her head\". Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before the latter's death. The writer and Ruth have a [[one night stand]] while Adam is away.\n\nThe next morning, the writer takes the [[BMW X5 (E70)|BMW X5]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2009 BMW X5 xDrive30d [E70] in ''The Ghost Writer'', Movie (2010)|url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_325926-BMW-X5-E70-2009.html|website=IMDb}}</ref> McAra used on his last journey. Unable to cancel the pre-programmed directions on the car's [[Satellite navigation|sat-nav]], he decides to follow them. He arrives in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]] at the home of Professor Paul Emmett ([[Tom Wilkinson]]). \n\nEmmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer's showing him two pictures of the pair among photographs found in McAra's possessions, as well as pointing out a more recent one on the wall of Emmett's study. When the writer tells Emmett the sat-nav proves McAra visited him the night he died, Emmett denies meeting McAra and becomes evasive. \n\nThe writer leaves and successfully eludes a car that is pursuing him. He boards the ferry back to Martha's Vineyard, but when he sees the pursuit car drive aboard, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock.\n\nWith no one else to turn to, the writer redials Rycart's number and asks for help. While waiting, the writer researches Emmett, and  finds links between Emmett's [[think tank]] and a [[Arms industry|military contractor]]. He also finds leads connecting Emmett to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. When Rycart arrives, Rycart reveals McAra [[News leak|gave him documents]] linking Lang to so-called \"torture flights\", in which terrorist suspects were placed on private jets owned by Emmett's company to be tortured while airborne.\n\nRycart further claims that McAra found new evidence, which he wrote about in the \"beginnings\" of the manuscript. The men cannot, however, find anything in the early pages. The writer discusses Emmett's relationship with Lang, while Rycart recounts how Lang's decisions as Prime Minister uniformly benefited US interests. \n\nWhen the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on his return flight by private jet, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett. Lang derides his suggestions.\n\nUpon leaving the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British anti-war protester, who is in turn shot by Lang's bodyguards. Nevertheless, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of Lang's death it will be a certain best-seller. \n\nAmelia invites the writer to the book's launch party in London, where she unwittingly tells him the Americans tightened access to the book, as the \"beginnings\" contained evidence threatening national security. She also tells him Emmett, who is in attendance, was Ruth's tutor when she was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].\n\nThe writer realizes the clues were hidden in the original manuscript, in the opening words of each chapter, and discovers the message: \"Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University.\" He concludes Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the United States under direction from the CIA.\n\nThe writer passes a note to Ruth revealing his discovery. She unfolds the note and is devastated. She sees the writer raising a glass to her but is kept from following him by Emmett and other assistants. \n\nThe writer leaves the party and attempts to hail a taxi, without success. As he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction, and a thud is heard. Witnesses react in horror, and the pages containing McAra's manuscript scatter in the wind. The film ends, leaving the writer's fate unconfirmed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as the unnamed [[ghostwriter]].\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Adam Peter Bennett Lang, a former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]].\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Ruth Lang, Lang's wife.\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Amelia Bly, Lang's personal assistant.\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Sidney Kroll, Lang's American lawyer.\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Paul Emmett, a professor at [[Harvard Law School]].\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as Rick Ricardelli, the ghostwriter's [[Literary agent|agent]].\n* [[Jim Belushi|James Belushi]] as John Maddox, Rhinehart's [[New York City|New York]] executive.\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Richard Rycart, UN Envoy and former British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]].\n* [[Tim Preece]] as Roy Quigley, managing director of Rhinehart's [[London]] business.\n* [[David Rintoul]] as The Stranger, a grieving father who lost his son during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as The Old Man at Martha's Vineyard.\n\n===Non-fictional allusions===\nPierce Brosnan plays the character of Adam Lang, who has echoes of former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].

The writer's predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], where Lang and his wife Ruth ([[Olivia Williams]]) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly ([[Kim Cattrall]]), and staff. Amelia forbids the writer from taking McAra's [[Manuscript format|manuscript]] outside, emphasising that it is a security risk.\n\nShortly after the writer's arrival, former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] Richard Rycart ([[Robert Pugh]]) accuses Lang of authorising the [[extraordinary rendition|illegal seizure]] of suspected terrorists and handing them over to be [[torture]]d by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], a possible [[war crime]]. Lang faces prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]] unless he stays in the United States (or one of the few other countries that do not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in [[Washington, D.C.]], the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's.\n\nDuring a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man ([[Eli Wallach]]) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but she later fell down the stairs and lapsed into a coma. \n\nLater, Ruth admits to the writer that Lang had never been very political and until recently always took her advice. When the writer tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to \"clear her head\". Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before the latter's death. The writer and Ruth have a [[one night stand]] while Adam is away.\n\nThe next morning, the writer takes the [[BMW X5 (E70)|BMW X5]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2009 BMW X5 xDrive30d [E70] in ''The Ghost Writer'', Movie (2010)|url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_325926-BMW-X5-E70-2009.html|website=IMDb}}</ref> McAra used on his last journey. Unable to cancel the pre-programmed directions on the car's [[Satellite navigation|sat-nav]], he decides to follow them. He arrives in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]] at the home of Professor Paul Emmett ([[Tom Wilkinson]]). \n\nEmmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer's showing him two pictures of the pair among photographs found in McAra's possessions, as well as pointing out a more recent one on the wall of Emmett's study. When the writer tells Emmett the sat-nav proves McAra visited him the night he died, Emmett denies meeting McAra and becomes evasive. \n\nThe writer leaves and successfully eludes a car that is pursuing him. He boards the ferry back to Martha's Vineyard, but when he sees the pursuit car drive aboard, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock.\n\nWith no one else to turn to, the writer redials Rycart's number and asks for help. While waiting, the writer researches Emmett, and  finds links between Emmett's [[think tank]] and a [[Arms industry|military contractor]]. He also finds leads connecting Emmett to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. When Rycart arrives, Rycart reveals McAra [[News leak|gave him documents]] linking Lang to so-called \"torture flights\", in which terrorist suspects were placed on private jets owned by Emmett's company to be tortured while airborne.\n\nRycart further claims that McAra found new evidence, which he wrote about in the \"beginnings\" of the manuscript. The men cannot, however, find anything in the early pages. The writer discusses Emmett's relationship with Lang, while Rycart recounts how Lang's decisions as Prime Minister uniformly benefited US interests. \n\nWhen the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on his return flight by private jet, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett. Lang derides his suggestions.\n\nUpon leaving the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British anti-war protester, who is in turn shot by Lang's bodyguards. Nevertheless, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of Lang's death it will be a certain best-seller. \n\nAmelia invites the writer to the book's launch party in London, where she unwittingly tells him the Americans tightened access to the book, as the \"beginnings\" contained evidence threatening national security. She also tells him Emmett, who is in attendance, was Ruth's tutor when she was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].\n\nThe writer realizes the clues were hidden in the original manuscript, in the opening words of each chapter, and discovers the message: \"Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University.\" He concludes Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the United States under direction from the CIA.\n\nThe writer passes a note to Ruth revealing his discovery. She unfolds the note and is devastated. She sees the writer raising a glass to her but is kept from following him by Emmett and other assistants. \n\nThe writer leaves the party and attempts to hail a taxi, without success. As he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction, and a thud is heard. Witnesses react in horror, and the pages containing McAra's manuscript scatter in the wind. The film ends, leaving the writer's fate unconfirmed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as the unnamed [[ghostwriter]].\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Adam Peter Bennett Lang, a former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]].\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Ruth Lang, Lang's wife.\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Amelia Bly, Lang's personal assistant.\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Sidney Kroll, Lang's American lawyer.\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Paul Emmett, a professor at [[Harvard Law School]].\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as Rick Ricardelli, the ghostwriter's [[Literary agent|agent]].\n* [[Jim Belushi|James Belushi]] as John Maddox, Rhinehart's [[New York City|New York]] executive.\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Richard Rycart, UN Envoy and former British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]].\n* [[Tim Preece]] as Roy Quigley, managing director of Rhinehart's [[London]] business.\n* [[David Rintoul]] as The Stranger, a grieving father who lost his son during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as The Old Man at Martha's Vineyard.\n\n===Non-fictional allusions===\nPierce Brosnan plays the character of Adam Lang, who has echoes of former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].

Twenty years later (1475), in the town of [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]], Lisa is burned at the stake after a bishop discovers scientific equipment in her home and accuses her of witchcraft. Dracula is devastated and furious upon learning of his wife's death and declares the people have one year to make their peace, after which every human in Wallachia will die by his hand. His son [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Adrian]] tells him to instead go after the man responsible instead of all of humanity, but Dracula refuses to listen and attacks him. One year later, the archbishop hosts a celebration in defiance of Dracula. As promised, Dracula kills the archbishop, destroys the church and orders his demon army to kill every person left in Wallachia.

He saves their Elder from a pair of corrupt priests, who brings him back to his home to meet his fellow Speakers. Trevor insists they leave the city for their own safety, but the Elder refuses, as his grandchild has gone missing after venturing into the catacombs below the city in search of the \"sleeping soldier\", a legendary hero who they believe can defeat Dracula.

He orders Trevor to leave Gresit before sundown, as they plan to lead a mob to kill the Speakers, offering to spare Trevor and restore his family name in exchange.

Adrian, now going by Alucard, engages Trevor in battle, but after seeing his and Sypha's resolve, Alucard relents and reveals that he was testing their abilities because the myth of the \"sleeping soldier\" was actually from the future and foretold Alucard's meeting with Belmont and Sypha.

While traveling to the Belmont estate, Trevor's party is attacked by Dracula's forces; the group slays all the attackers, save one injured demon who escapes. At the castle, Isaac reminisces on his past, having killed his previous abusive master in a moment that shaped his ideals.

Trevor, Sypha and Alucard reach the ruins of the Belmont estate and open a magically-sealed door leading to a massive underground library. Sypha begins researching and Trevor locates several monster-hunting weapons, including the Morning Star whip, while Alucard is left uneasy by the various vampire remains preserved there. At Dracula's castle, Godbrand expresses his dissatisfaction with the plan to exterminate the human race, believing they will be left hungry without human blood to consume, and Dracula rebukes him.

Isaac discusses Hector's request with Dracula, but asserts that there is no betrayal to be concerned about. Dracula reminisces about a time he once savored killing humans but admits he is tired and cares only for results instead of the details. Carmilla and Hector approach Dracula and he approves the attack on Br\u0103ila. Afterwards, Carmilla turns on Hector, explaining he is now implicated in her impending betrayal of Dracula and cannot turn back on her plan now.

At Carmilla's behest, Hector reanimates the Bishop and makes him bless the river. Carmilla's troops reveal themselves and bring down the bridge, dropping many of Dracula's soldiers to be destroyed by the now-holy water. Dracula's remaining forces retreat to the castle whilst Carmilla's soldiers cross the river on makeshift bridges. The two armies begin to battle in the castle's main hall, while Carmilla and Hector move elsewhere.

Alucard reaches the study and attacks Dracula, backed by Trevor and Sypha. The group manages to inflict some damage, but Dracula overpowers them, and engages in hand-to-hand combat with Alucard, moving through the castle as they battle. Eventually the two end up in Alucard's childhood room where Dracula has a break down upon realizing the reality of him trying to kill his own son. Dracula allows Alucard to stake him through the heart, while Trevor arrives to decapitate the decomposing vampire and Sypha burns the remains, leaving only his wedding ring intact.

Frederator brought writer [[Warren Ellis]] aboard as the screenwriter for the series. In an interview with ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', Warren Ellis said that when he was contacted about ''Castlevania'' he had no previous knowledge of the series and discovered it was a \"Japanese transposition of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror films]] I grew up with and loved\".<ref name=\"paste magazine\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/warren-ellis-on-castlevania-the-legacy-of-hammer-h.html |title=Warren Ellis on Castlevania, the Legacy of Hammer Horror, and the Creative Liberation of Writing for Netflix |first=Toussaint |last=Egan |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=July 8, 2017 |website=Paste Magazine}}</ref> Ellis explained how he worked with ''Castlevania'' producer [[Koji Igarashi]] to fit the film into the timeline of the series, including writing a new backstory, and how he was frustrated that Igarashi wanted eight full re-writes of pre-production material before giving approval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/7/7/15934226/netflix-castlevania|title=Netflix's new Castlevania series is the most bingeable show at just under 100 minutes|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2017-07-07|website=Polygon|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> Ellis noted that Frederator's Kevin Kolde, who was slated to produce the work, did not want the film to be aimed at children, allowing Ellis to use gruesome imagery and scenes as necessary to tell the story he wanted to write, something that Ellis had found restrictive in working with normal television animation.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nIn adapting the game for the film, Ellis did not want to make a point-for-point adaption, but instead provide some material to flesh out the game's world and elements behind it. At this stage, the film was anticipated to be only 80 minutes long, which Ellis knew would not be enough to tell the full story he wanted, so was able to break apart his script into a trilogy of works, each part having a self-contained [[three-act structure]]; the first part would be to introduce the characters of Dracula, Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard and with a meaningful narrative resolution. In this manner, Ellis noted that if the other two parts were never greenlit, the first work \"doesn't demand the presence of the other two parts for it to work as its own thing\".<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |title=The First Time Warren Ellis Wrote A Castlevania Animation, Ten Years Ago |first=Rich |last=Johnson |date=February 9, 2017 |accessdate=July 11, 2017 |website=[[Bleeding Cool News]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311002425/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |archivedate=March 11, 2017 }}</ref> Due to the limited time, Ellis opted to drop [[Grant DaNasty|Grant Danasty]], a pirate character in the game; Ellis noted that besides \"the stupid name\", he felt the pirate was misplaced in the setting and that the limited run time would not allow him to develop the character fully.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nSometime around 2008, work on the production stalled, and entered [[development hell]].<ref name=\"dtoid\">{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/10-years-of-purgatory-wasn-t-enough-to-keep-netflix-s-castlevania-down-447906.phtml | title = 10 years of purgatory wasn't enough to keep Netflix's Castlevania down | first = Peter | last = Glagowski | date = July 10, 2017 | accessdate = July 10, 2017 | website = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Ellis had completed his script in June 2008, and the show's production blog had said in August 2008 that they were shopping around the idea as a theatrical release, but no further updates followed before the blog was quietly deleted.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nAround 2012, [[Adi Shankar]] was approached to direct a live-action version of Ellis' script. Shankar, who at the time had just finished work as executive producer of ''[[Dredd]]'', said that the party was looking to make a film in the style of the ''[[Underworld (film series)|Underworld]]'' films with a similar budget, representative of a small studio with large independent backing.

Powerhouse reached out to Frederator to help with the show's production.<ref name=\"dtoid\"/> According to Ellis, Netflix was very positive about his original scripts that he wrote in 2007, and so he had to only make a few changes to fit the Netflix format while staying true to the version of the script Konami had accepted.<ref name=\"paste magazine\"/> Shankar was approached with the opportunity

There's one medium length flashback in which he massacres a council of merchants who offended him, but it's not like that moves the story along\".

The first two seasons adapt the 1989 entry ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'' and follow [[Trevor Belmont]], [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] and [[Sypha Belnades]] as they defend the nation of [[Wallachia]] from [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] and his minions. Seasons 2 and 3 borrow characters and elements from the 2005 entry ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]]''.\n\nThe series was originally planned as a film, developed by producer Kevin Kolde and his company Project 51. Kolde had a contract for a script with writer [[Warren Ellis]] in 2007; the project entered [[development hell]] until about 2015, when [[Adi Shankar]] boarded the project and it was picked up by streaming service [[Netflix]]. [[Powerhouse Animation Studios]] joined the team and production commenced. Its art style is heavily influenced by Japanese [[anime]] and [[Ayami Kojima]]'s artwork in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' with the production team including staff members who worked in the Japanese anime industry.\n\nThe series premiered on Netflix on July 7, 2017, and was renewed for an expanded second season of eight episodes on the same day; the second season premiered on October 26, 2018. A ten-episode third season was greenlit by Netflix and released on March 5, 2020. On March 27, 2020, Netflix announced they have renewed the series for a fourth season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/03/27/castlevania-season-4-netflix/|title=Netflix Announces Castlevania Season 4|website=Anime|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nWhen his wife is burned at the stake after being falsely accused of witchcraft, the vampire Count [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] declares all the people of [[Wallachia]] will pay with their lives.

Twenty years later (1475), in the town of [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]], Lisa is burned at the stake after a bishop discovers scientific equipment in her home and accuses her of witchcraft. Dracula is devastated and furious upon learning of his wife's death and declares the people have one year to make their peace, after which every human in Wallachia will die by his hand. His son [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Adrian]] tells him to instead go after the man responsible instead of all of humanity, but Dracula refuses to listen and attacks him. One year later, the archbishop hosts a celebration in defiance of Dracula. As promised, Dracula kills the archbishop, destroys the church and orders his demon army to kill every person left in Wallachia.

He saves their Elder from a pair of corrupt priests, who brings him back to his home to meet his fellow Speakers. Trevor insists they leave the city for their own safety, but the Elder refuses, as his grandchild has gone missing after venturing into the catacombs below the city in search of the \"sleeping soldier\", a legendary hero who they believe can defeat Dracula.

While traveling to the Belmont estate, Trevor's party is attacked by Dracula's forces; the group slays all the attackers, save one injured demon who escapes. At the castle, Isaac reminisces on his past, having killed his previous abusive master in a moment that shaped his ideals.

Frederator brought writer [[Warren Ellis]] aboard as the screenwriter for the series. In an interview with ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', Warren Ellis said that when he was contacted about ''Castlevania'' he had no previous knowledge of the series and discovered it was a \"Japanese transposition of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror films]] I grew up with and loved\".<ref name=\"paste magazine\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/warren-ellis-on-castlevania-the-legacy-of-hammer-h.html |title=Warren Ellis on Castlevania, the Legacy of Hammer Horror, and the Creative Liberation of Writing for Netflix |first=Toussaint |last=Egan |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=July 8, 2017 |website=Paste Magazine}}</ref> Ellis explained how he worked with ''Castlevania'' producer [[Koji Igarashi]] to fit the film into the timeline of the series, including writing a new backstory, and how he was frustrated that Igarashi wanted eight full re-writes of pre-production material before giving approval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/7/7/15934226/netflix-castlevania|title=Netflix's new Castlevania series is the most bingeable show at just under 100 minutes|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2017-07-07|website=Polygon|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> Ellis noted that Frederator's Kevin Kolde, who was slated to produce the work, did not want the film to be aimed at children, allowing Ellis to use gruesome imagery and scenes as necessary to tell the story he wanted to write, something that Ellis had found restrictive in working with normal television animation.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nIn adapting the game for the film, Ellis did not want to make a point-for-point adaption, but instead provide some material to flesh out the game's world and elements behind it. At this stage, the film was anticipated to be only 80 minutes long, which Ellis knew would not be enough to tell the full story he wanted, so was able to break apart his script into a trilogy of works, each part having a self-contained [[three-act structure]]; the first part would be to introduce the characters of Dracula, Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard and with a meaningful narrative resolution. In this manner, Ellis noted that if the other two parts were never greenlit, the first work \"doesn't demand the presence of the other two parts for it to work as its own thing\".<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |title=The First Time Warren Ellis Wrote A Castlevania Animation, Ten Years Ago |first=Rich |last=Johnson |date=February 9, 2017 |accessdate=July 11, 2017 |website=[[Bleeding Cool News]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311002425/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/02/09/first-time-warren-ellis-wrote-castlevania-animation-ten-years-ago/ |archivedate=March 11, 2017 }}</ref> Due to the limited time, Ellis opted to drop [[Grant DaNasty|Grant Danasty]], a pirate character in the game; Ellis noted that besides \"the stupid name\", he felt the pirate was misplaced in the setting and that the limited run time would not allow him to develop the character fully.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nSometime around 2008, work on the production stalled, and entered [[development hell]].<ref name=\"dtoid\">{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/10-years-of-purgatory-wasn-t-enough-to-keep-netflix-s-castlevania-down-447906.phtml | title = 10 years of purgatory wasn't enough to keep Netflix's Castlevania down | first = Peter | last = Glagowski | date = July 10, 2017 | accessdate = July 10, 2017 | website = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> Ellis had completed his script in June 2008, and the show's production blog had said in August 2008 that they were shopping around the idea as a theatrical release, but no further updates followed before the blog was quietly deleted.<ref name=\"bcn ellis 2007\"/>\n\nAround 2012, [[Adi Shankar]] was approached to direct a live-action version of Ellis' script. Shankar, who at the time had just finished work as executive producer of ''[[Dredd]]'', said that the party was looking to make a film in the style of the ''[[Underworld (film series)|Underworld]]'' films with a similar budget, representative of a small studio with large independent backing.

Powerhouse reached out to Frederator to help with the show's production.<ref name=\"dtoid\"/> According to Ellis, Netflix was very positive about his original scripts that he wrote in 2007, and so he had to only make a few changes to fit the Netflix format while staying true to the version of the script Konami had accepted.<ref name=\"paste magazine\"/> Shankar was approached with the opportunity

has been to paint Dracula not as a villain, but a tragic, doomed figure. According to him: \"The best villains, in general, are the heroes of their own story and the trick to making ''Castlevania'' resonate was this idea that Dracula isn't a bad guy, he isn't a villain, he's just a person consumed with darkness.
