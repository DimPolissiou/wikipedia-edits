After Truman's withdrawal, the president and other party leaders threw their support behind Stevenson, the moderate Governor of Illinois. Stevenson emerged victorious on the third presidential ballot of the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]], defeating Kefauver, Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]] of Georgia, and other candidates. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Senator  [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in [[World War II]]. With the support of [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]]. The Republicans chose [[Richard Nixon]], a young senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate.\n\nRepublicans attacked Truman's handling of the [[Korean War]] and the broader [[Cold War]], and alleged that [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spies had infiltrated the U.S. government. Democrats faulted Eisenhower for failing to condemn Republican Senator [[Joe McCarthy]] and other reactionary Republicans who they alleged had engaged in reckless and unwarranted attacks. Stevenson tried to separate himself from the unpopular Truman administration, instead campaigning on the popularity of the [[New Deal]] and lingering fears of another [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] under a Republican administration.\n\nEisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, \"I Like Ike.\" Eisenhower's popularity and Truman's unpopularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 55% of the popular vote. He carried every state outside of the [[Southern United States|South]] and won several Southern states that had almost always voted for Democrats since the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Republicans also [[United States elections, 1952|won control]] of both houses of Congress.\n\n==Nominees==\n\n===Republican Party===\n{{Main|Republican Party presidential primaries, 1952}}\n{{Further|1952 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1952'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Dwight D.

Eisenhower]], who became the candidate of the party's moderate eastern establishment; Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] from Ohio, the longtime leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing; Governor [[Earl Warren]] of California, who appealed to Western delegates and independent voters; and former Governor [[Harold Stassen]] of Minnesota, who still had a base of support in the Midwest.\n\nThe moderate Eastern Republicans were led by New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], the party's presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948. The moderates tended to be [[interventionism (politics)|interventionists]], who felt that America needed to fight the [[Cold War]] overseas and confront the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Eurasia]]; they were also willing to accept most aspects of the [[social welfare]] state created by the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s. The moderates were also concerned with ending the Republicans' losing streak in presidential elections; they felt that the personally popular Eisenhower had the best chance of beating the Democrats. For this reason, Dewey himself declined the notion of a third run for president, even though he still had a large amount of support within the party. The GOP had been out of power for 20 years, and the sentiment that a proper two-party system needed to be reestablished was strong, also a Republican Party in control of the White House would have more incentive to rein in unpopular demagogues such as Wisconsin Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].\n\nThe conservative Republicans, led by Taft, were based in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and parts of the South. The Midwest was a bastion of conservatism and isolationist sentiment, dislike of Europeans, in particular Great Britain, was common, and there was a widespread feeling that the British manipulated US foreign policy and were eager to kowtow to the Soviet Union, although attitudes were beginning to change among the younger generation who had fought in World War II. Taft had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 1940 and 1948 presidential elections, losing both times to moderate candidates from New York (Wilkie and Dewey). Taft, 63, felt that this was his last chance to run for president and so his friends and supporters worked extra hard to ensure that he would win the nomination.\n\nWarren, although highly popular in California, refused to campaign in the presidential primaries and thus limited his chances of winning the nomination. He did retain the support of the California delegation, and his supporters hoped that, in the event of an Eisenhower\u2013Taft deadlock, Warren might emerge as a compromise candidate.\n\nAfter being [[Draft Eisenhower|persuaded to run]], Eisenhower scored a major victory in the [[New Hampshire primary]], when his supporters wrote his name onto the ballot, giving him an upset victory over Taft. However, from there until the Republican Convention the primaries were divided fairly evenly between the two, and by the time the convention opened, the race for the nomination was still too close to call. Taft won the Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois, and South Dakota primaries, while Eisenhower won the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Oregon primaries. Stassen and Warren only won their home states of Minnesota and California respectively, which effectively ended their chances of earning the nomination. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] also got ten delegates from various states (mostly Oregon), but had made it clear from early in the race that he had no interest in being nominated.\n\n===Republican Convention===\nWhen the [[1952 Republican National Convention]] opened in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], most political experts rated Taft and Eisenhower as neck-and-neck in the delegate vote totals. Eisenhower's managers, led by Dewey and Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], accused Taft of \"stealing\" delegate votes in Southern states such as Texas and Georgia. They claimed that Taft's leaders in these states had unfairly denied delegate spots to Eisenhower supporters and put Taft delegates in their place. Lodge and Dewey proposed to evict the pro-Taft delegates in these states and replace them with pro-Eisenhower delegates; they called this proposal \"Fair Play.\" Although Taft and his supporters angrily denied this charge, the convention voted to support Fair Play 658 to 548, and Taft lost many Southern delegates. Eisenhower also received two more boosts, firstly when several uncommitted state delegations, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, decided to support him, and secondly when Stassen released his delegates and asked them to support Eisenhower, whose moderate policies he much preferred to those of Taft. The removal of many pro-Taft Southern delegates and the support of the uncommitted states decided the nomination in Eisenhower's favor.\n\nHowever, the mood at the convention was one of the most bitter and emotional in American history. When Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] from Illinois, a Taft supporter, pointed at Dewey on the convention floor during a speech and accused him of leading the Republicans \"down the road to defeat,\" mixed boos and cheers rang out from the delegates, and there were even fistfights between some Taft and Eisenhower delegates.\n\nIn the end, Eisenhower narrowly defeated Taft on the first ballot. To heal the wounds caused by the battle, he went to Taft's hotel suite and met with him. Taft issued a brief statement congratulating Eisenhower on his victory, but he was bitter about what he felt was the untrue \"stealing delegates\" charge, and he withheld his active support for Eisenhower for several weeks after the convention. In September 1952 Taft and Eisenhower met again at [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] in New York City, where Taft promised to support Eisenhower actively in exchange for Eisenhower agreeing to a number of requests. These included a demand that Eisenhower give Taft's followers a fair share of patronage positions if he won the election, and that Eisenhower agree to balance the federal budget and \"fight creeping domestic socialism in every field.\" Eisenhower agreed to the terms, and Taft campaigned hard for the Republican ticket.<ref>(Patterson, pp. 575-578)</ref> In fact, Eisenhower and Taft agreed on most domestic issues; their disagreements were primarily in foreign policy.<ref>(Patterson, pp. 591-592)</ref>\n\nThough there were initial suggestions that Warren could have earned the party's vice presidential slot for the second successive election if he were to withdraw and endorse Eisenhower, he ultimately chose not to do so. Eisenhower himself had been partial to giving the VP nod to Stassen, who had endorsed Eisenhower of his own accord and had generally similar political positions. The party bosses, however, were keen to find a running mate who could mollify Taft's supporters, as the schism between the moderate and conservative wings was so severe that in the worst case it could potentially lead to the conservatives bolting and running Taft as a third-party candidate.\n\nEisenhower had apparently given little thought to choosing his running mate. When asked, he replied that he assumed the convention would pick someone. The spot ultimately fell to the young California Senator [[Richard Nixon]], who was seen as being in the exact center of the GOP. Nixon was known as an aggressive campaigner and a fierce anti-communist, however he shied away from some of the more extreme ideas of the party's right wing, including isolationism and dismantling the New Deal. Most historians now believe that Eisenhower's nomination was primarily due to the feeling that he was a \"sure winner\" against the Democrats; most of the delegates were conservatives who would probably have supported Taft if they felt he could have won the general election.\n\nDespite not earning the presidential or vice presidential nominations, Warren would subsequently be appointed as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] in October 1953, while Stassen would hold various positions within Eisenhower's administration.\n\nThe balloting at the Republican Convention went as follows:<ref>(Richard C.

Truman. Since the newly passed [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] did not apply to whoever was president at the time of its passage, he was eligible to run again. But Truman entered 1952 with his popularity plummeting, according to polls. The bloody and indecisive [[Korean War]] was dragging into its third year, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s anti-Communist crusade was stirring public fears of an encroaching \"Red Menace,\" and the disclosure of widespread corruption among federal employees (including some high-level members of Truman's administration) left Truman at a low political ebb. Polls showed that he had a 66% [[United States presidential approval rating|disapproval rating]], a record only matched decades later by [[Richard Nixon]] and surpassed by [[George W. Bush]].<ref name=\"USAToday April 21, 2008-bushrating\">{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Page|authorlink= Susan Page|title=Disapproval of Bush breaks record|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-04-21-bushrating_N.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=April 23, 2008|date=April 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1952DemocraticPresidentialPrimaries.svg|thumb|400px|Kefauver won all but three primaries, but failed to win nomination]]\nTruman's main opponent was populist Tennessee Senator [[Estes Kefauver]], who had chaired a nationally televised investigation of [[organized crime]] in 1951 and was known as a crusader against crime and corruption. The [[The Gallup Organization#Gallup Poll|Gallup poll]] of February 15 showed Truman's weakness: nationally Truman was the choice of only 36% of Democrats, compared with 21% for Kefauver. Among independent voters, however, Truman had only 18% while Kefauver led with 36%. In the [[New Hampshire primary]], Kefauver upset Truman, winning 19,800 votes to Truman's 15,927 and capturing all eight delegates. Kefauver graciously said that he did not consider his victory \"a repudiation of Administration policies, but a desire...for new ideas and personalities.\" Stung by this setback, Truman soon announced that he would not seek re-election (however, Truman insisted in his memoirs that he had decided not to run for reelection well before his defeat by Kefauver).\n\nWith Truman's withdrawal, Kefauver became the front-runner for the nomination, and he won most of the primaries. Other primary winners were Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]], who won his home state of [[Minnesota presidential primary|Minnesota]], while Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]] from Georgia won the Florida primary and U.S. diplomat [[W. Averell Harriman]] won West Virginia. However, most states still chose their delegates to the Democratic Convention via state conventions, which meant that the party bosses&nbsp;\u2013 especially the mayors and governors of large Northern and Midwestern states and cities&nbsp;\u2013 were able to choose the Democratic nominee. These bosses (including Truman) strongly disliked Kefauver; his investigations of organized crime had revealed connections between [[American Mafia|Mafia]] figures and many of the big-city Democratic political organizations.<ref name=\"McKeever, p. 186\">(McKeever, p. 186)</ref> The party bosses thus viewed Kefauver as a maverick who could not be trusted, and they refused to support him for the nomination.<ref name=\"McKeever, p. 186\"/>\n\nInstead, with Truman taking the initiative, they began to search for other, more acceptable, candidates. However, most of the other candidates had a major weakness. Richard Russell had much Southern support, but his support of [[racial segregation]] and opposition to [[civil rights]] for Southern blacks led many liberal Northern and Midwestern delegates to reject him.<ref name=\"McKeever, p. 186\"/> Truman favored W. Averell Harriman of New York, but he had never held an elective office and was inexperienced in politics. Truman next turned to his vice-president, [[Alben W. Barkley]], but at 74 he was rejected as being too old by [[Trade union|labor union]] leaders.\nOther minor or favorite son candidates included Oklahoma Senator [[Robert S. Kerr]], Governor [[Paul A. Dever]] of Massachusetts, Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota, and Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] from Arkansas.\n\nOne candidate soon emerged who seemingly had few political weaknesses: Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. The grandson of former Vice-President [[Adlai E. Stevenson I|Adlai E. Stevenson]], he came from a distinguished family in Illinois and was well known as a gifted orator, intellectual, and political moderate. In the spring of 1952, Truman tried to convince Stevenson to take the presidential nomination, but Stevenson refused, stating that he wanted to run for re-election as Governor of Illinois. Yet Stevenson never completely took himself out of the race, and as the convention approached, many party bosses, as well as normally [[apolitical]] citizens, hoped that he could be \"drafted\" to run.\n\n===Democratic Convention===\nThe [[1952 Democratic National Convention]] was held in Chicago in the same coliseum the Republicans had gathered in several weeks earlier. Since the convention was being held in his home state, Governor Stevenson&nbsp;\u2013 who still proclaimed that he was not a presidential candidate&nbsp;\u2013 was asked to give the welcoming address to the delegates. He proceeded to give a witty and stirring address that led his supporters to begin a renewed round of efforts to nominate him, despite his protests. After meeting with [[Jacob Arvey]], the \"boss\" of the Illinois delegation, Stevenson finally agreed to enter his name as a candidate for the nomination. The party bosses from other large Northern and Midwestern states quickly joined in support. Kefauver led on the first ballot, but had far fewer votes than necessary to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot.\n\nAfter the delegates nominated Stevenson, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. After narrowing it down to Senators [[John Sparkman]], and [[A. S. Mike Monroney]], President Truman and a small group of political insiders chose Sparkman, a conservative and [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] from Alabama, for the nomination. The convention largely complied and nominated Sparkman as Stevenson's running mate. He was chosen because of his Southern identity and conservative record; party leaders hoped this factor would create a balanced ticket.\n\n==General election==\n[[File:CBS News' coverage of the 1952 United States presidential election.webm|thumb|CBS News' coverage of the 1952 United States presidential election]]\n\n===Campaign issues===\nThe Eisenhower campaign was one of the first presidential campaigns to make a major, concerted effort to win the female vote. Many of his radio and television commercials discussed topics such as education, inflation, ending the war in Korea, and other issues that were thought to appeal to women. The Eisenhower campaign made extensive use of female campaign workers. These workers made phone calls to likely Eisenhower voters, distributed \"Ike\" buttons and leaflets, and threw parties to build support for the GOP ticket in their neighborhoods. On election day, Eisenhower won a solid majority of the female vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/pols/3380/pres/1952.html |title=1952: The Election of a Military Hero |accessdate=November 20, 2008 |work=The Press and the Presidency |publisher=Kennesaw State University, Department of Political Science & International Affairs |date=August 31, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420132810/http://www.kennesaw.edu/pols/3380/pres/1952.html |archive-date=April 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nEisenhower campaigned by attacking \"Korea, Communism, and Corruption\"\u2014that is, what the Republicans regarded as the failures of the outgoing Truman administration to deal with these issues.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert North Roberts|author2=Scott John Hammond|author3=Valerie A.

Truman, formerly friends with Eisenhower, never forgot what he saw as a betrayal; he had previously thought Eisenhower would make a good president, but said, \"he has betrayed almost everything I thought he stood for.\"<ref name=\"time 2008\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1857862,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 10, 2008|title=When New President Meets Old, It's Not Always Pretty |first= Nancy|last=Gibbs|authorlink=Nancy Gibbs}}</ref>\n\nEisenhower retained his enormous personal popularity from his leading role in [[World War II]], and huge crowds turned out to see him around the nation. His campaign slogan, \"[[Draft Eisenhower#\"I like Ike\"|I Like Ike]],\" was one of the most popular in American history. Stevenson attracted the support of the young, emergent postwar intellectual class, however Eisenhower was seen as more appealing to Main Street. Stevenson was ridiculed in some quarters as too effeminate to be president, the staunchly conservative ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called him \"Adelaide\" Stevenson, even though he had a reputation as a ladies' man and several mistresses.\n\nA notable event of the 1952 campaign concerned a scandal that emerged when Richard Nixon, Eisenhower's running mate, was accused by several newspapers of receiving $18,000 in undeclared \"gifts\" from wealthy donors. In reality, contributions were by design only from early supporters and limited to $1,000, with full accountability.  Nixon, who had been accusing the Democrats of hiding crooks, suddenly found himself on the defensive. Eisenhower and his aides considered dropping Nixon from the ticket and picking another running mate.\n\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1952.png|thumb|right|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate. Shades of red are for Eisenhower (Republican) and shades of blue are for Stevenson (Democratic).]]\nEisenhower, who barely knew Nixon, waffled and refused to comment on the incident. Nixon saved his political career, however, with a dramatic half-hour speech, the \"[[Checkers speech]],\" on live television. In this speech, Nixon denied the charges against him, gave a detailed account of his modest financial assets, and offered a glowing assessment of Eisenhower's candidacy. The highlight of the speech came when Nixon stated that a supporter had given his daughters a gift&nbsp;\u2013 a dog named \"Checkers\"&nbsp;\u2013 and that he would not return it, because his daughters loved it. The \"Checkers speech\" led hundreds of thousands of citizens nationwide to wire the [[Republican National Committee]] urging the Republican Party to keep Nixon on the ticket, and Eisenhower stayed with him.\n\nDespite the red-baiting of the right wing of the GOP, the campaign on the whole was conducted with a considerable degree of dignity and Stevenson was seen as reinvigorating a Democratic Party that had become exhausted after 20 years in power and refreshing its appeal with younger voters. He accused Eisenhower of silently tolerating Joseph McCarthy's excesses. Stevenson went before the American Legion, a bastion of hardline conservatism, and boldly declared that there was nothing patriotic or American about what Joseph McCarthy was doing.\n\nEven with the dignified nature of the campaign, the dislike between the two candidates was visible; Stevenson criticized Eisenhower's non-condemnation of McCarthy and use of television spots, and Eisenhower, while he had initially respected Stevenson, in time came to view him as simply another career politician, something he strongly disliked.\n\nThe 1952 election campaign was the first one to make use of the new medium of television, in part thanks to the efforts of [[Rosser Reeves]], the head of the [[Ted Bates Agency]], a leading advertising firm. Reeves had initially proposed a series of radio spots to Thomas Dewey in the 1948 campaign, but Dewey considered them undignified, and Reeves maintained that Dewey might have won the election had he been slightly more open-minded.\n\nStudying Douglas MacArthur's keynote speech at the Republican convention in July, Reeves believed that the general's words were \"powerful\", but \"unfocused\" and \"all over the map\". Eisenhower's public speeches were even worse, he was unable to make his point to the voting public in a clear, intelligible manner. Reeves felt that Eisenhower needed to condense his message down to a few simple, easily digestible slogans.\n\nEisenhower at first also fared poorly on television and had a difficult time appearing relaxed and at ease on camera. The TV lighting was not flattering and it made him look old and unattractive, in particular his forehead tended to glisten under the lights. Eisenhower became upset when CBS correspondent Dave Schoenbrun pointed this out and suggested he try altering his poses to make his forehead less noticeable and also apply makeup so it would not shine from the lighting. Eventually, he gave in and agreed to these modifications. Reeves also wanted Eisenhower to not wear his eyeglasses on camera in order to look younger, but he could not read the prompter board without them, so Reeves devised a large, handwritten signboard.\n\nReeves's TV work, although pioneering, was the subject of considerable criticism on the grounds that he was attempting to sell a presidential candidate to the public in the same manner that one might sell a car or a brand of toothpaste. Adlai Stevenson for his part would have nothing to do with television at all and condemned Eisenhower's use of the medium, calling it \"selling the presidency like cereal\". He himself made a point of the fact that he did not own a TV or watch television, and many of his inner circle did likewise.\n\nBoth campaigns made use of television ads. A notable ad for Eisenhower was an issue-free, feel-good [[animated cartoon]] with a soundtrack song by [[Irving Berlin]] called \"I Like Ike.\" For the first time, a presidential candidate's personal medical history was released publicly, as were partial versions of his financial histories, because of the issues raised in Nixon's speech.<ref>''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890389,00.html \"National Affairs: Public Accounting,\" October 27, 1952], accessed November 18, 2010</ref> Near the end of the campaign, Eisenhower, in a major speech, announced that if he won the election he would go to Korea to see if he could end the war. His great military prestige, combined with the public's weariness with the conflict, gave Eisenhower the final boost he needed to win.\n\nThroughout the entire campaign, Eisenhower [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#United States presidential election.2C 1952|led in all opinion polls]], and by wide margins in most of them.\n\n===Citizens for Eisenhower===\nTo circumvent the local Republican Party apparatus mostly controlled by Taft supporters, the Eisenhower forces created a nationwide network of grass-roots clubs, \"Citizens for Eisenhower.\" Independents and Democrats were welcome, as the group specialized in canvassing neighborhoods and holding small group meetings. Citizens for Eisenhower hoped to revitalize the GOP by expanding its activist ranks and by supporting  moderate and internationalist policies. It did not endorse candidates other than Eisenhower. However Eisenhower paid it little attention after he won, and it failed to maintain its impressive starting momentum. Instead it energized the conservative Republicans, leading finally to the [[Barry Goldwater]] campaign of 1964. Long-time  Republican activists viewed the  newcomers with suspicion and hostility. More significantly, activism in support of Eisenhower did not translate into enthusiasm for the party cause.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = Robert | year = 2013 | title = Citizens for Eisenhower and the Republican Party, 1951\u20131965 | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/11872127/Citizens_for_Eisenhower_and_the_Republican_Party_1951_1965.pdf| journal = The Historical Journal | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 513\u2013536 | doi = 10.1017/S0018246X12000593 }}</ref>\n\n===Results===\nOn election day, Eisenhower won a decisive victory, winning over 55% of the popular vote and carrying thirty-nine of the forty-eight states. Stevenson did not win a single state north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] or west of Arkansas, whilst Eisenhower took three Southern states that the Republicans had won only once since [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]: Virginia, Florida, and Texas. Despite the Republican win in Florida, this remains the last time to date a Democrat has won [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]] before southwestern Florida was turned into a growing [[Sun Belt]] Republican stronghold, and is also the last time a Democrat has won [[Aiken County, South Carolina]], before the \"[[Solid South]]\" would collapse in the wake of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name=\"How\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century 'How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century']; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> 1952 is also, however, the last time a Republican won [[Yolo County, California]], or Native American [[Rolette County, North Dakota]], and the last until Donald Trump in 2016 that the Republicans won [[Pacific County, Washington]], or [[Swift County, Minnesota]].<ref name=\"How\"/> This was the last time the Republicans won Missouri until 1968 and the last time the Democrats won Kentucky until 1964. It is also the last time that a Republican won the election without Kentucky. Stevenson's 700-vote win was the smallest percentage margin in any state since [[Woodrow Wilson]] won New Hampshire by fifty-six votes in 1916.\n\nThis election was the first in which a computer (the [[UNIVAC I]]) was used to predict the results.<ref>[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/09/univac-the-troubled-life-of-americas-first-computer.ars UNIVAC: the troubled life of America's first computer] ''arstechnica.com''.

It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] won a landslide victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]].\n\nIncumbent Democratic President [[Harry S. Truman]] had remained silent about whether he would seek another full term, but the unpopular incumbent announced his withdrawal from the race following his defeat in the [[New Hampshire primary]] by Tennessee Senator [[Estes Kefauver]]. After Truman's withdrawal, the president and other party leaders threw their support behind Stevenson, the moderate Governor of Illinois. Stevenson emerged victorious on the third presidential ballot of the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]], defeating Kefauver, Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]] of Georgia, and other candidates. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Senator  [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in [[World War II]]. With the support of [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]]. The Republicans chose [[Richard Nixon]], a young senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate.\n\nRepublicans attacked Truman's handling of the [[Korean War]] and the broader [[Cold War]], and alleged that [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spies had infiltrated the U.S. government. Democrats faulted Eisenhower for failing to condemn Republican Senator [[Joe McCarthy]] and other reactionary Republicans who they alleged had engaged in reckless and unwarranted attacks. Stevenson tried to separate himself from the unpopular Truman administration, instead campaigning on the popularity of the [[New Deal]] and lingering fears of another [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] under a Republican administration.\n\nEisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, \"I Like Ike.\" Eisenhower's popularity and Truman's unpopularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 55% of the popular vote. He carried every state outside of the [[Southern United States|South]] and won several Southern states that had almost always voted for Democrats since the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Republicans also [[United States elections, 1952|won control]] of both houses of Congress.\n\n==Nominees==\n\n===Republican Party===\n{{Main|Republican Party presidential primaries, 1952}}\n{{Further|1952 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1952'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Dwight D.

Eisenhower]], who became the candidate of the party's moderate eastern establishment; Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] from Ohio, the longtime leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing; Governor [[Earl Warren]] of California, who appealed to Western delegates and independent voters; and former Governor [[Harold Stassen]] of Minnesota, who still had a base of support in the Midwest.\n\nThe moderate Eastern Republicans were led by New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], the party's presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948. The moderates tended to be [[interventionism (politics)|interventionists]], who felt that America needed to fight the [[Cold War]] overseas and confront the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Eurasia]]; they were also willing to accept most aspects of the [[social welfare]] state created by the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s. The moderates were also concerned with ending the Republicans' losing streak in presidential elections; they felt that the personally popular Eisenhower had the best chance of beating the Democrats. For this reason, Dewey himself declined the notion of a third run for president, even though he still had a large amount of support within the party. The GOP had been out of power for 20 years, and the sentiment that a proper two-party system needed to be reestablished was strong, also a Republican Party in control of the White House would have more incentive to rein in unpopular demagogues such as Wisconsin Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].\n\nThe conservative Republicans, led by Taft, were based in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and parts of the South. The Midwest was a bastion of conservatism and isolationist sentiment, dislike of Europeans, in particular Great Britain, was common, and there was a widespread feeling that the British manipulated US foreign policy and were eager to kowtow to the Soviet Union, although attitudes were beginning to change among the younger generation who had fought in World War II. Taft had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 1940 and 1948 presidential elections, losing both times to moderate candidates from New York (Wilkie and Dewey). Taft, 63, felt that this was his last chance to run for president and so his friends and supporters worked extra hard to ensure that he would win the nomination.\n\nWarren, although highly popular in California, refused to campaign in the presidential primaries and thus limited his chances of winning the nomination. He did retain the support of the California delegation, and his supporters hoped that, in the event of an Eisenhower\u2013Taft deadlock, Warren might emerge as a compromise candidate.\n\nAfter being [[Draft Eisenhower|persuaded to run]], Eisenhower scored a major victory in the [[New Hampshire primary]], when his supporters wrote his name onto the ballot, giving him an upset victory over Taft. However, from there until the Republican Convention the primaries were divided fairly evenly between the two, and by the time the convention opened, the race for the nomination was still too close to call. Taft won the Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois, and South Dakota primaries, while Eisenhower won the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Oregon primaries. Stassen and Warren only won their home states of Minnesota and California respectively, which effectively ended their chances of earning the nomination. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] also got ten delegates from various states (mostly Oregon), but had made it clear from early in the race that he had no interest in being nominated.\n\n===Republican Convention===\nWhen the [[1952 Republican National Convention]] opened in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], most political experts rated Taft and Eisenhower as neck-and-neck in the delegate vote totals. Eisenhower's managers, led by Dewey and Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], accused Taft of \"stealing\" delegate votes in Southern states such as Texas and Georgia. They claimed that Taft's leaders in these states had unfairly denied delegate spots to Eisenhower supporters and put Taft delegates in their place. Lodge and Dewey proposed to evict the pro-Taft delegates in these states and replace them with pro-Eisenhower delegates; they called this proposal \"Fair Play.\" Although Taft and his supporters angrily denied this charge, the convention voted to support Fair Play 658 to 548, and Taft lost many Southern delegates. Eisenhower also received two more boosts, firstly when several uncommitted state delegations, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, decided to support him, and secondly when Stassen released his delegates and asked them to support Eisenhower, whose moderate policies he much preferred to those of Taft. The removal of many pro-Taft Southern delegates and the support of the uncommitted states decided the nomination in Eisenhower's favor.\n\nHowever, the mood at the convention was one of the most bitter and emotional in American history. When Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] from Illinois, a Taft supporter, pointed at Dewey on the convention floor during a speech and accused him of leading the Republicans \"down the road to defeat,\" mixed boos and cheers rang out from the delegates, and there were even fistfights between some Taft and Eisenhower delegates.\n\nIn the end, Eisenhower narrowly defeated Taft on the first ballot. To heal the wounds caused by the battle, he went to Taft's hotel suite and met with him. Taft issued a brief statement congratulating Eisenhower on his victory, but he was bitter about what he felt was the untrue \"stealing delegates\" charge, and he withheld his active support for Eisenhower for several weeks after the convention. In September 1952 Taft and Eisenhower met again at [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] in New York City, where Taft promised to support Eisenhower actively in exchange for Eisenhower agreeing to a number of requests. These included a demand that Eisenhower give Taft's followers a fair share of patronage positions if he won the election, and that Eisenhower agree to balance the federal budget and \"fight creeping domestic socialism in every field.\" Eisenhower agreed to the terms, and Taft campaigned hard for the Republican ticket.<ref>(Patterson, pp. 575-578)</ref> In fact, Eisenhower and Taft agreed on most domestic issues; their disagreements were primarily in foreign policy.<ref>(Patterson, pp. 591-592)</ref>\n\nThough there were initial suggestions that Warren could have earned the party's vice presidential slot for the second successive election if he were to withdraw and endorse Eisenhower, he ultimately chose not to do so. Eisenhower himself had been partial to giving the VP nod to Stassen, who had endorsed Eisenhower of his own accord and had generally similar political positions. The party bosses, however, were keen to find a running mate who could mollify Taft's supporters, as the schism between the moderate and conservative wings was so severe that in the worst case it could potentially lead to the conservatives bolting and running Taft as a third-party candidate.\n\nEisenhower had apparently given little thought to choosing his running mate. When asked, he replied that he assumed the convention would pick someone. The spot ultimately fell to the young California Senator [[Richard Nixon]], who was seen as being in the exact center of the GOP. Nixon was known as an aggressive campaigner and a fierce anti-communist, however he shied away from some of the more extreme ideas of the party's right wing, including isolationism and dismantling the New Deal. Most historians now believe that Eisenhower's nomination was primarily due to the feeling that he was a \"sure winner\" against the Democrats; most of the delegates were conservatives who would probably have supported Taft if they felt he could have won the general election.\n\nDespite not earning the presidential or vice presidential nominations, Warren would subsequently be appointed as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] in October 1953, while Stassen would hold various positions within Eisenhower's administration.\n\nThe balloting at the Republican Convention went as follows:<ref>(Richard C.

Truman. Since the newly passed [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] did not apply to whoever was president at the time of its passage, he was eligible to run again. But Truman entered 1952 with his popularity plummeting, according to polls. The bloody and indecisive [[Korean War]] was dragging into its third year, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s anti-Communist crusade was stirring public fears of an encroaching \"Red Menace,\" and the disclosure of widespread corruption among federal employees (including some high-level members of Truman's administration) left Truman at a low political ebb. Polls showed that he had a 66% [[United States presidential approval rating|disapproval rating]], a record only matched decades later by [[Richard Nixon]] and surpassed by [[George W. Bush]].<ref name=\"USAToday April 21, 2008-bushrating\">{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Page|authorlink= Susan Page|title=Disapproval of Bush breaks record|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-04-21-bushrating_N.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=April 23, 2008|date=April 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1952DemocraticPresidentialPrimaries.svg|thumb|400px|Kefauver won all but three primaries, but failed to win nomination]]\nTruman's main opponent was populist Tennessee Senator [[Estes Kefauver]], who had chaired a nationally televised investigation of [[organized crime]] in 1951 and was known as a crusader against crime and corruption. The [[The Gallup Organization#Gallup Poll|Gallup poll]] of February 15 showed Truman's weakness: nationally Truman was the choice of only 36% of Democrats, compared with 21% for Kefauver. Among independent voters, however, Truman had only 18% while Kefauver led with 36%. In the [[New Hampshire primary]], Kefauver upset Truman, winning 19,800 votes to Truman's 15,927 and capturing all eight delegates. Kefauver graciously said that he did not consider his victory \"a repudiation of Administration policies, but a desire...for new ideas and personalities.\" Stung by this setback, Truman soon announced that he would not seek re-election (however, Truman insisted in his memoirs that he had decided not to run for reelection well before his defeat by Kefauver).\n\nWith Truman's withdrawal, Kefauver became the front-runner for the nomination, and he won most of the primaries. Other primary winners were Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]], who won his home state of [[Minnesota presidential primary|Minnesota]], while Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]] from Georgia won the Florida primary and U.S. diplomat [[W. Averell Harriman]] won West Virginia. However, most states still chose their delegates to the Democratic Convention via state conventions, which meant that the party bosses&nbsp;\u2013 especially the mayors and governors of large Northern and Midwestern states and cities&nbsp;\u2013 were able to choose the Democratic nominee. These bosses (including Truman) strongly disliked Kefauver; his investigations of organized crime had revealed connections between [[American Mafia|Mafia]] figures and many of the big-city Democratic political organizations.<ref name=\"McKeever, p. 186\">(McKeever, p. 186)</ref> The party bosses thus viewed Kefauver as a maverick who could not be trusted, and they refused to support him for the nomination.<ref name=\"McKeever, p. 186\"/>\n\nInstead, with Truman taking the initiative, they began to search for other, more acceptable, candidates. However, most of the other candidates had a major weakness. Richard Russell had much Southern support, but his support of [[racial segregation]] and opposition to [[civil rights]] for Southern blacks led many liberal Northern and Midwestern delegates to reject him.<ref name=\"McKeever, p. 186\"/> Truman favored W. Averell Harriman of New York, but he had never held an elective office and was inexperienced in politics. Truman next turned to his vice-president, [[Alben W. Barkley]], but at 74 he was rejected as being too old by [[Trade union|labor union]] leaders.\nOther minor or favorite son candidates included Oklahoma Senator [[Robert S. Kerr]], Governor [[Paul A. Dever]] of Massachusetts, Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota, and Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] from Arkansas.\n\nOne candidate soon emerged who seemingly had few political weaknesses: Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. The grandson of former Vice-President [[Adlai E. Stevenson I|Adlai E. Stevenson]], he came from a distinguished family in Illinois and was well known as a gifted orator, intellectual, and political moderate. In the spring of 1952, Truman tried to convince Stevenson to take the presidential nomination, but Stevenson refused, stating that he wanted to run for re-election as Governor of Illinois. Yet Stevenson never completely took himself out of the race, and as the convention approached, many party bosses, as well as normally [[apolitical]] citizens, hoped that he could be \"drafted\" to run.\n\n===Democratic Convention===\nThe [[1952 Democratic National Convention]] was held in Chicago in the same coliseum the Republicans had gathered in several weeks earlier. Since the convention was being held in his home state, Governor Stevenson&nbsp;\u2013 who still proclaimed that he was not a presidential candidate&nbsp;\u2013 was asked to give the welcoming address to the delegates. He proceeded to give a witty and stirring address that led his supporters to begin a renewed round of efforts to nominate him, despite his protests. After meeting with [[Jacob Arvey]], the \"boss\" of the Illinois delegation, Stevenson finally agreed to enter his name as a candidate for the nomination. The party bosses from other large Northern and Midwestern states quickly joined in support. Kefauver led on the first ballot, but had far fewer votes than necessary to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot.\n\nAfter the delegates nominated Stevenson, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. After narrowing it down to Senators [[John Sparkman]], and [[A. S. Mike Monroney]], President Truman and a small group of political insiders chose Sparkman, a conservative and [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] from Alabama, for the nomination. The convention largely complied and nominated Sparkman as Stevenson's running mate. He was chosen because of his Southern identity and conservative record; party leaders hoped this factor would create a balanced ticket.\n\n==General election==\n[[File:CBS News' coverage of the 1952 United States presidential election.webm|thumb|CBS News' coverage of the 1952 United States presidential election]]\n\n===Campaign issues===\nThe Eisenhower campaign was one of the first presidential campaigns to make a major, concerted effort to win the female vote. Many of his radio and television commercials discussed topics such as education, inflation, ending the war in Korea, and other issues that were thought to appeal to women. The Eisenhower campaign made extensive use of female campaign workers. These workers made phone calls to likely Eisenhower voters, distributed \"Ike\" buttons and leaflets, and threw parties to build support for the GOP ticket in their neighborhoods. On election day, Eisenhower won a solid majority of the female vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/pols/3380/pres/1952.html |title=1952: The Election of a Military Hero |accessdate=November 20, 2008 |work=The Press and the Presidency |publisher=Kennesaw State University, Department of Political Science & International Affairs |date=August 31, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420132810/http://www.kennesaw.edu/pols/3380/pres/1952.html |archive-date=April 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nEisenhower campaigned by attacking \"Korea, Communism, and Corruption\"\u2014that is, what the Republicans regarded as the failures of the outgoing Truman administration to deal with these issues.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert North Roberts|author2=Scott John Hammond|author3=Valerie A.

Historian Herbert Parmet says that although Stevenson:\n:tried to separate his campaign from Truman's record, his efforts failed to dispel the widespread recognition that, for a divided America, torn by paranoia and unable to understand what had disrupted the anticipated tranquility of the postwar world, the time for change had really arrived.

Truman, formerly friends with Eisenhower, never forgot what he saw as a betrayal; he had previously thought Eisenhower would make a good president, but said, \"he has betrayed almost everything I thought he stood for.\"<ref name=\"time 2008\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1857862,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 10, 2008|title=When New President Meets Old, It's Not Always Pretty |first= Nancy|last=Gibbs|authorlink=Nancy Gibbs}}</ref>\n\nEisenhower retained his enormous personal popularity from his leading role in [[World War II]], and huge crowds turned out to see him around the nation. His campaign slogan, \"[[Draft Eisenhower#\"I like Ike\"|I Like Ike]],\" was one of the most popular in American history. Stevenson attracted the support of the young, emergent postwar intellectual class, however Eisenhower was seen as more appealing to Main Street. Stevenson was ridiculed in some quarters as too effeminate to be president, the staunchly conservative ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called him \"Adelaide\" Stevenson, even though he had a reputation as a ladies' man and several mistresses.\n\nA notable event of the 1952 campaign concerned a scandal that emerged when Richard Nixon, Eisenhower's running mate, was accused by several newspapers of receiving $18,000 in undeclared \"gifts\" from wealthy donors. In reality, contributions were by design only from early supporters and limited to $1,000, with full accountability.  Nixon, who had been accusing the Democrats of hiding crooks, suddenly found himself on the defensive. Eisenhower and his aides considered dropping Nixon from the ticket and picking another running mate.\n\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1952.png|thumb|right|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate. Shades of red are for Eisenhower (Republican) and shades of blue are for Stevenson (Democratic).]]\nEisenhower, who barely knew Nixon, waffled and refused to comment on the incident. Nixon saved his political career, however, with a dramatic half-hour speech, the \"[[Checkers speech]],\" on live television. In this speech, Nixon denied the charges against him, gave a detailed account of his modest financial assets, and offered a glowing assessment of Eisenhower's candidacy. The highlight of the speech came when Nixon stated that a supporter had given his daughters a gift&nbsp;\u2013 a dog named \"Checkers\"&nbsp;\u2013 and that he would not return it, because his daughters loved it. The \"Checkers speech\" led hundreds of thousands of citizens nationwide to wire the [[Republican National Committee]] urging the Republican Party to keep Nixon on the ticket, and Eisenhower stayed with him.\n\nDespite the red-baiting of the right wing of the GOP, the campaign on the whole was conducted with a considerable degree of dignity and Stevenson was seen as reinvigorating a Democratic Party that had become exhausted after 20 years in power and refreshing its appeal with younger voters. He accused Eisenhower of silently tolerating Joseph McCarthy's excesses. Stevenson went before the American Legion, a bastion of hardline conservatism, and boldly declared that there was nothing patriotic or American about what Joseph McCarthy was doing.\n\nEven with the dignified nature of the campaign, the dislike between the two candidates was visible; Stevenson criticized Eisenhower's non-condemnation of McCarthy and use of television spots, and Eisenhower, while he had initially respected Stevenson, in time came to view him as simply another career politician, something he strongly disliked.\n\nThe 1952 election campaign was the first one to make use of the new medium of television, in part thanks to the efforts of [[Rosser Reeves]], the head of the [[Ted Bates Agency]], a leading advertising firm. Reeves had initially proposed a series of radio spots to Thomas Dewey in the 1948 campaign, but Dewey considered them undignified, and Reeves maintained that Dewey might have won the election had he been slightly more open-minded.\n\nStudying Douglas MacArthur's keynote speech at the Republican convention in July, Reeves believed that the general's words were \"powerful\", but \"unfocused\" and \"all over the map\". Eisenhower's public speeches were even worse, he was unable to make his point to the voting public in a clear, intelligible manner. Reeves felt that Eisenhower needed to condense his message down to a few simple, easily digestible slogans.\n\nEisenhower at first also fared poorly on television and had a difficult time appearing relaxed and at ease on camera. The TV lighting was not flattering and it made him look old and unattractive, in particular his forehead tended to glisten under the lights. Eisenhower became upset when CBS correspondent Dave Schoenbrun pointed this out and suggested he try altering his poses to make his forehead less noticeable and also apply makeup so it would not shine from the lighting. Eventually, he gave in and agreed to these modifications. Reeves also wanted Eisenhower to not wear his eyeglasses on camera in order to look younger, but he could not read the prompter board without them, so Reeves devised a large, handwritten signboard.\n\nReeves's TV work, although pioneering, was the subject of considerable criticism on the grounds that he was attempting to sell a presidential candidate to the public in the same manner that one might sell a car or a brand of toothpaste. Adlai Stevenson for his part would have nothing to do with television at all and condemned Eisenhower's use of the medium, calling it \"selling the presidency like cereal\". He himself made a point of the fact that he did not own a TV or watch television, and many of his inner circle did likewise.\n\nBoth campaigns made use of television ads. A notable ad for Eisenhower was an issue-free, feel-good [[animated cartoon]] with a soundtrack song by [[Irving Berlin]] called \"I Like Ike.\" For the first time, a presidential candidate's personal medical history was released publicly, as were partial versions of his financial histories, because of the issues raised in Nixon's speech.<ref>''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890389,00.html \"National Affairs: Public Accounting,\" October 27, 1952], accessed November 18, 2010</ref> Near the end of the campaign, Eisenhower, in a major speech, announced that if he won the election he would go to Korea to see if he could end the war. His great military prestige, combined with the public's weariness with the conflict, gave Eisenhower the final boost he needed to win.\n\nThroughout the entire campaign, Eisenhower [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#United States presidential election.2C 1952|led in all opinion polls]], and by wide margins in most of them.\n\n===Citizens for Eisenhower===\nTo circumvent the local Republican Party apparatus mostly controlled by Taft supporters, the Eisenhower forces created a nationwide network of grass-roots clubs, \"Citizens for Eisenhower.\" Independents and Democrats were welcome, as the group specialized in canvassing neighborhoods and holding small group meetings. Citizens for Eisenhower hoped to revitalize the GOP by expanding its activist ranks and by supporting  moderate and internationalist policies. It did not endorse candidates other than Eisenhower. However Eisenhower paid it little attention after he won, and it failed to maintain its impressive starting momentum. Instead it energized the conservative Republicans, leading finally to the [[Barry Goldwater]] campaign of 1964. Long-time  Republican activists viewed the  newcomers with suspicion and hostility. More significantly, activism in support of Eisenhower did not translate into enthusiasm for the party cause.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = Robert | year = 2013 | title = Citizens for Eisenhower and the Republican Party, 1951\u20131965 | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/11872127/Citizens_for_Eisenhower_and_the_Republican_Party_1951_1965.pdf| journal = The Historical Journal | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 513\u2013536 | doi = 10.1017/S0018246X12000593 }}</ref>\n\n===Results===\nOn election day, Eisenhower won a decisive victory, winning over 55% of the popular vote and carrying thirty-nine of the forty-eight states. Stevenson did not win a single state north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] or west of Arkansas, whilst Eisenhower took three Southern states that the Republicans had won only once since [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]: Virginia, Florida, and Texas. Despite the Republican win in Florida, this remains the last time to date a Democrat has won [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]] before southwestern Florida was turned into a growing [[Sun Belt]] Republican stronghold, and is also the last time a Democrat has won [[Aiken County, South Carolina]], before the \"[[Solid South]]\" would collapse in the wake of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name=\"How\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century 'How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century']; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> 1952 is also, however, the last time a Republican won [[Yolo County, California]], or Native American [[Rolette County, North Dakota]], and the last until Donald Trump in 2016 that the Republicans won [[Pacific County, Washington]], or [[Swift County, Minnesota]].<ref name=\"How\"/> This was the last time the Republicans won Missouri until 1968 and the last time the Democrats won Kentucky until 1964.

Additionally, as the basic unit for meeting the basic needs of its members, it provides a sense of boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment, ideally builds a person into a functional adult, transmits culture, and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge.\n\n[[Anthropologist]]s generally classify most family organizations as [[Matrifocal family|matrifocal]] (a mother and her children); patrifocal (a father and his children); conjugal (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the [[nuclear family]]); [[avuncular]] (for example, a grandparent, a brother, his sister, and her children); or [[Extended family|extended]] (parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family).\n\nMembers of the [[immediate family]] may include spouses, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters. Members of the extended family may include aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and [[Sibling-in-law|siblings-in-law]]. Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them, and the legal definition of \"immediate family\" varies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/i/immediate-family/|title=Immediate Family Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> Sexual relations with family members are regulated by rules concerning [[incest]] such as the [[incest taboo]].\n\nThe field of [[genealogy]] aims to trace family lineages through history. The family is also an important economic unit studied in [[family economics]].

'All the family turned up for the funeral... But of course, my brother didn't bring his family along\u2014 they're much too young.' Here the reference is to the offspring (as distinct from 'all' the family). The neighbors were very good, too. 'The Jones came, and their two children. It was nice, the whole family turning up like that.' Here the usage is more restricted than 'relatives' or 'his relatives,' but includes just both parents and offspring. 'Of course, the children will be leaving home soon. It's always sad to see the family break up like that.'

Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818\u20131881) performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world. Although much of his work is now considered dated, he argued that [[kinship]] terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions. For example, most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between a child and a parent). Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and [[marriage]] (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than \"blood\").\n\nMorgan made a distinction between kinship systems that use ''classificatory'' terminology and those that use ''descriptive'' terminology. Classificatory systems are generally and erroneously understood to be those that \"class together\" with a single term relatives who actually do not have the same type of relationship to ego. (What defines \"same type of relationship\" under such definitions seems to be genealogical relationship. This is problematic given that any genealogical description, no matter how standardized, employs words originating in a folk understanding of kinship.) What Morgan's terminology actually differentiates are those (classificatory) kinship systems that do not distinguish lineal and collateral relationships and those (descriptive) kinship systems that do. Morgan, a lawyer, came to make this distinction in an effort to understand [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] inheritance practices. A Seneca man's effects were inherited by his sisters' children rather than by his own children.<ref>Tooker, Elisabeth.

Typically, societies with conjugal families also favor [[neolocal]] residence; thus upon marriage, a person separates from the nuclear family of their childhood (family of orientation) and forms a new nuclear family (family of procreation). Such systems generally assume that the mother's husband is also the biological father. The system uses highly descriptive terms for the nuclear family and progressively more [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]] as the relatives become more and more collateral \n\n===Nuclear family===\nThe system emphasizes the nuclear family Members of the nuclear family use highly descriptive kinship terms, identifying directly only the husband, wife, mother, father, son, daughter, brother, and sister. All other relatives are grouped together into categories. Members of the nuclear family may be lineal or collateral. Kin, for whom these are family, refer to them in descriptive terms that build on the terms used within the nuclear family or use the nuclear family term directly.\n\nNuclear family of orientation\n* '''[[Brother]]''': the male child of a parent\n* '''[[Sister]]''': the female child of a parent\n* '''[[Father]]''': a [[male]] [[parent]].\n** '''[[Grandfather]]''': the father of a parent.\n* '''[[Mother]]''': a [[female]] parent.\n** '''[[Grandmother]]''': the mother of a parent.\n\nNuclear conjugal family\n* '''[[Husband]]''': a male [[spouse]].\n* '''[[Wife]]''': a female spouse.\n* '''[[Son]]''': a male [[child]] of the parent(s).\n** '''Grandson''': a child's son.\n* '''[[Daughter]]''': a female child of the parent(s).\n** '''Granddaughter''': a child's daughter.\n\nNuclear non-lineal family\n* '''[[Stepparent]]''': a spouse of a parent that is not a biological parent\n* '''Sibling''': sister or brother\n** '''[[Half-sibling]]''': a sibling with whom the subject shares only one biological parent\n** '''[[Step-sibling]]''': a child of a parent that is not a biological parent\n\n===Collateral relatives===\nA sibling is a collateral relative with a minimal removal. For collateral relatives with one additional removal, one generation more distant from a common ancestor on one side, more classifications terms come into play.  These terms ([[Aunt]], [[Uncle]], [[Niece]], and [[Nephew]]) do not build on the terms used within the nuclear family as most are not traditionally members of the household. Collateral relatives with additional removals on each side are '''Cousins'''. This is the most classifications term and can be distinguished by degrees of collaterality and by generation.\n\nWhen only the subject has the additional removal, the relative is the subjects parents siblings, the terms '''Aunt''' and '''Uncle''' are used for female and male relatives respectively. When only the relative has the additional removal, the relative is the subjects siblings child, the terms  '''Niece''' and '''Nephew''' are used for female and male relatives respectively. With further removal by the subject for aunts and uncles and by the relative for nieces and nephews the prefix \"grand-\" modifies these terms. With further removal the prefix becomes \"great-grand-,\" adding another \"great-\" for each additional generation. \n\nWhen the subject and the relative have an additional removal they are cousins. A cousin with minimal removal is a first cousin, i.e. the child of the subjects uncle or aunt. '''Degrees''' and '''removals''' are used to more precisely describe the relationship between cousins. The ''degree'' is the number of generations subsequent to the common ancestor before a parent of one of the cousins is found, while the ''removal'' is the difference between the number of generations from each cousin to the common ancestor (the difference between the generations the cousins are from).<ref name=DictGen>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia =A Dictionary of Genetics |year =2013 |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |publisher =Oxford University Press |id =8}}</ref><ref name=DictWebster>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cousin |title=Definition of Cousin by Merriam-Webster |website=merriam-webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\nCousins of an older generation (in other words, one's parents' first cousins), although technically first cousins once removed, are often classified with \"aunts\" and \"uncles.\" \n\n===Aggregate relatives===\nEnglish-speakers mark relationships by marriage (except for wife/husband) with the tag \"-in-law.\" The mother and father of one's spouse become one's mother-in-law and father-in-law; the wife of one's son becomes one's daughter-in-law and the husband of one's daughter becomes one's son-in-law. The term \"[[sister-in-law]]\" refers to three essentially different relationships, either the wife of one's brother, or the sister of one's spouse. \"[[Brother-in-law]]\" is the husband of one's sister, or the brother of one's spouse. The terms \"half-brother\" and \"half-sister\" indicate siblings who share only one biological parent. The term \"[[aunt-in-law]]\" is the wife of one's uncle, or the aunt of one's spouse. \"[[Uncle-in-law]]\" is the husband of one's aunt, or the uncle of one's spouse. \"[[Cousin-in-law]]\" is the spouse of one's cousin, or the cousin of one's spouse. The term \"[[niece-in-law]]\" is the wife of one's nephew, or the niece of one's spouse. \"[[Nephew-in-law]]\" is the husband of one's niece, or the nephew of one's spouse. The grandmother and grandfather of one's spouse become one's grandmother-in-law and grandfather-in-law; the wife of one's grandson becomes one's granddaughter-in-law and the husband of one's granddaughter becomes one's grandson-in-law. \n\nIn [[Indian English]] a sibling in law who is the spouse of your sibling can be referred to as a co-sibling (specificity a co-sister<ref name=\"Ca-CoS\">{{cite web |title=Co-Sister |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/co-sister |website=Cambridge Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge Dictionary |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> or co-brother<ref name=\"Ca-CoB\">{{cite web |title=Co-Brother|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/co-brother|website=Cambridge Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge Dictionary |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>).\n\n==Types of kinship==\n\n===Patrilineal===\n[[Patrilineality]], also known as ''the male line'' or ''agnatic kinship'', is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through his or her father's [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].<ref>Benokraitis, N.V. ''Marriages and Families.'' 7th Edition, Pearson Education, Inc., 2011</ref> It generally involves the [[inheritance]] of property, rights, names, or titles by persons related through [[male]] kin.\n\nA patriline (\"father line\") is a person's father, and additional [[ancestor]]s that are traced only through males. One's patriline is thus a record of descent from a man in which the individuals in all intervening generations are male. In [[cultural anthropology]], a patrilineage is a [[Consanguinity|consanguineal]] male and female [[Kinship|kinship group]], each of whose members is descended from the common ancestor through male forebears.\n\n===Matrilineal===\n[[Matrilineality]] is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through his or her mother's [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].\n\nIt may also correlate with a [[societal system]] in which each person is identified with their matriline\u2014their mother's [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]\u2014and which can involve the [[inheritance]] of property and titles. A matriline is a [[line of descent]] from a [[female]] [[ancestor]] to a descendant in which the individuals in all intervening generations are mothers{{spndash}}in other words, a \"mother line\".\n\nIn a matrilineal descent system, an individual is considered to belong to the same [[descent group]] as her or his mother. This matrilineal descent pattern is in contrasts to the more common pattern of patrilineal descent pattern.\n\n===Bilateral descent===\n[[Bilateral descent]] is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through both the paternal and maternal sides. The relatives on the mother's side and father's side are equally important for emotional ties or for transfer of property or wealth. It is a family arrangement where descent and inheritance are passed equally through both parents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shepard |first=Jon <!-- |authorlink=Jon M.

Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and [[marriage]] (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than \"blood\").\n\nMorgan made a distinction between kinship systems that use ''classificatory'' terminology and those that use ''descriptive'' terminology. Classificatory systems are generally and erroneously understood to be those that \"class together\" with a single term relatives who actually do not have the same type of relationship to ego. (What defines \"same type of relationship\" under such definitions seems to be genealogical relationship. This is problematic given that any genealogical description, no matter how standardized, employs words originating in a folk understanding of kinship.) What Morgan's terminology actually differentiates are those (classificatory) kinship systems that do not distinguish lineal and collateral relationships and those (descriptive) kinship systems that do. Morgan, a lawyer, came to make this distinction in an effort to understand [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] inheritance practices. A Seneca man's effects were inherited by his sisters' children rather than by his own children.<ref>Tooker, Elisabeth.

Typically, societies with conjugal families also favor [[neolocal]] residence; thus upon marriage, a person separates from the nuclear family of their childhood (family of orientation) and forms a new nuclear family (family of procreation). Such systems generally assume that the mother's husband is also the biological father. The system uses highly descriptive terms for the nuclear family and progressively more [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]] as the relatives become more and more collateral \n\n===Nuclear family===\nThe system emphasizes the nuclear family Members of the nuclear family use highly descriptive kinship terms, identifying directly only the husband, wife, mother, father, son, daughter, brother, and sister. All other relatives are grouped together into categories. Members of the nuclear family may be lineal or collateral. Kin, for whom these are family, refer to them in descriptive terms that build on the terms used within the nuclear family or use the nuclear family term directly.\n\nNuclear family of orientation\n* '''[[Brother]]''' the male child of a parent\n* '''[[Sister]]''': the female child of a parent\n* '''[[Father]]''': a [[male]] [[parent]].\n** '''[[Grandfather]]''': the father of a parent.\n* '''[[Mother]]''': a [[female]] parent.\n** '''[[Grandmother]]''': the mother of a parent.\n\nNuclear conjugal family\n* '''[[Husband]]''': a male [[spouse]].\n* '''[[Wife]]''': a female spouse.\n* '''[[Son]]''': a male [[child]] of the parent(s).\n** '''Grandson''': a child's son.\n* '''[[Daughter]]''': a female child of the parent(s).\n** '''Granddaughter''': a child's daughter.\n\nNuclear non-lineal family\n* '''[[Stepparent]]''': a spouse of a parent that is not a biological parent\n* '''Sibling''': sister or brother\n** '''[[Half-sibling]]''': a sibling with whom the subject shares only one biological parent\n** '''[[Step-sibling]]''': a child of a parent that is not a biological parent\n\n===Collateral relatives===\nA sibling is a collateral relative with a minimal removal. For collateral relatives with one additional removal, one generation more distant from a common ancestor on one side, more classifications terms come into play.  These terms ([[Aunt]], [[Uncle]], [[Niece]], and [[Nephew]]) do not build on the terms used within the nuclear family as most are not traditionally members of the household. Collateral relatives with additional removals on each side are '''Cousins'''. This is the most classifications term and can be distinguished by degrees of collaterality and by generation.\n\nWhen only the subject has the additional removal, the relative is the subjects parents siblings, the terms '''Aunt''' and '''Uncle''' are used for female and male relatives respectively. When only the relative has the additional removal, the relative is the subjects siblings child, the terms  '''Niece''' and '''Nephew''' are used for female and male relatives respectively. With further removal by the subject for aunts and uncles and by the relative for nieces and nephews the prefix \"grand-\" modifies these terms. With further removal the prefix becomes \"great-grand-,\" adding another \"great-\" for each additional generation. \n\nWhen the subject and the relative have an additional removal they are cousins. A cousin with minimal removal is a first cousin, i.e. the child of the subjects uncle or aunt. '''Degrees''' and '''removals''' are used to more precisely describe the relationship between cousins. The ''degree'' is the number of generations subsequent to the common ancestor before a parent of one of the cousins is found, while the ''removal'' is the difference between the number of generations from each cousin to the common ancestor (the difference between the generations the cousins are from).<ref name=DictGen>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia =A Dictionary of Genetics |year =2013 |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |publisher =Oxford University Press |id =8}}</ref><ref name=DictWebster>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cousin |title=Definition of Cousin by Merriam-Webster |website=merriam-webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\nCousins of an older generation (in other words, one's parents' first cousins), although technically first cousins once removed, are often classified with \"aunts\" and \"uncles.\" \n\n===Aggregate relatives===\nEnglish-speakers mark relationships by marriage (except for wife/husband) with the tag \"-in-law.\" The mother and father of one's spouse become one's mother-in-law and father-in-law; the wife of one's son becomes one's daughter-in-law and the husband of one's daughter becomes one's son-in-law. The term \"[[sister-in-law]]\" refers to three essentially different relationships, either the wife of one's brother, or the sister of one's spouse. \"[[Brother-in-law]]\" is the husband of one's sister, or the brother of one's spouse. The terms \"half-brother\" and \"half-sister\" indicate siblings who share only one biological parent. The term \"[[aunt-in-law]]\" is the wife of one's uncle, or the aunt of one's spouse. \"[[Uncle-in-law]]\" is the husband of one's aunt, or the uncle of one's spouse. \"[[Cousin-in-law]]\" is the spouse of one's cousin, or the cousin of one's spouse. The term \"[[niece-in-law]]\" is the wife of one's nephew, or the niece of one's spouse. \"[[Nephew-in-law]]\" is the husband of one's niece, or the nephew of one's spouse. The grandmother and grandfather of one's spouse become one's grandmother-in-law and grandfather-in-law; the wife of one's grandson becomes one's granddaughter-in-law and the husband of one's granddaughter becomes one's grandson-in-law. \n\nIn [[Indian English]] a sibling in law who is the spouse of your sibling can be referred to as a co-sibling (specificity a co-sister<ref name=\"Ca-CoS\">{{cite web |title=Co-Sister |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/co-sister |website=Cambridge Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge Dictionary |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> or co-brother<ref name=\"Ca-CoB\">{{cite web |title=Co-Brother|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/co-brother|website=Cambridge Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge Dictionary |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>).\n\n==Types of kinship==\n\n===Patrilineal===\n[[Patrilineality]], also known as ''the male line'' or ''agnatic kinship'', is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through his or her father's [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].<ref>Benokraitis, N.V. ''Marriages and Families.'' 7th Edition, Pearson Education, Inc., 2011</ref> It generally involves the [[inheritance]] of property, rights, names, or titles by persons related through [[male]] kin.\n\nA patriline (\"father line\") is a person's father, and additional [[ancestor]]s that are traced only through males. One's patriline is thus a record of descent from a man in which the individuals in all intervening generations are male. In [[cultural anthropology]], a patrilineage is a [[Consanguinity|consanguineal]] male and female [[Kinship|kinship group]], each of whose members is descended from the common ancestor through male forebears.\n\n===Matrilineal===\n[[Matrilineality]] is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through his or her mother's [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].\n\nIt may also correlate with a [[societal system]] in which each person is identified with their matriline\u2014their mother's [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]\u2014and which can involve the [[inheritance]] of property and titles. A matriline is a [[line of descent]] from a [[female]] [[ancestor]] to a descendant in which the individuals in all intervening generations are mothers{{spndash}}in other words, a \"mother line\".\n\nIn a matrilineal descent system, an individual is considered to belong to the same [[descent group]] as her or his mother. This matrilineal descent pattern is in contrasts to the more common pattern of patrilineal descent pattern.\n\n===Bilateral descent===\n[[Bilateral descent]] is a form of kinship system in which an individual's family membership derives from and is traced through both the paternal and maternal sides. The relatives on the mother's side and father's side are equally important for emotional ties or for transfer of property or wealth. It is a family arrangement where descent and inheritance are passed equally through both parents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shepard |first=Jon <!-- |authorlink=Jon M.

He first appears in the original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' as an unplayable character, challenging the player before the final fight with [[Shang Tsung]]. Goro is a member of the four-armed half-human, half-dragon race, called the Shokan. In the original game he has been champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament for 500 years before being defeated by eventual tournament champion Liu Kang. Unlike most characters in the game, who were digitized representations of live actors, Goro was a clay sculpture animated through stop motion.\n\nThe character was not in the next two ''Mortal Kombat'' titles, which instead featured two other Shokan fighters, [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat)|Kintaro]] and [[Sheeva]]. He returned in ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', this time as a [[playable character]]. Goro returned in the home versions of ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'' as a sub-boss and an unlockable character. In contrast to his previous role as a villain, in the storyline of ''Mortal Kombat 4'' he aligns himself on the side of good. He returned to a villainous role as a playable character in the [[GameCube]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of ''[[Mortal Kombat Deception]]'', forming a pact with [[Shao Kahn]]. Goro also made subsequent appearances in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' as well as the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' reboot]] and its sequel ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]''.\n\nGoro is seen as one of the iconic characters of the series, with various publications listing him as one of the most memorable and difficult bosses in video game history. He has also appeared in other franchise media, such as [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|comics]] and the [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|live action film]] as well as its animated film, ''[[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]]''.\n\n==Concept and design==\nAccording to [[John Tobias]], Goro was created when he and [[Ed Boon]] discussed bringing \"a big brooding character\" to the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''. The original concept of the character was a two-handed humanoid character Rokuro, a member of \"a race of demon warriors called Rokuro-kubi (demons of the dark)\" wrongly \"reputed as savage barbarians\", who would join the tournament \"to restore the pride and respect of his race\".<ref>[http://twitpic.com/6kj7fq Another page from my ancient MK notebook: a discarded charact... on Twitpic].</ref> The idea for a [[stop motion]] animated monster boss and a character with four arms came from the films ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]] ''and ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retrozap.com/argcast-mini-14-making-mortal-kombat-with-john-tobias/|title=ARGcast Mini #14: Making Mortal Kombat with John Tobias|last=ARGpodcast|date=2018-06-26|website=RetroZap|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref> and from one of the [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad]] movies, respectively.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Game Makers: The Artists|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1996|page=34-36}}</ref> \n\nUnlike other characters in the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Goro was not based on a digitized actor but instead on a clay sculpture created by Richard Divizio's friend Curt Chiarelli. Tobias, who considers Goro probably his favourite character in the series,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z7bAEMVRMU|title=Mortal Kombat II 25th Anniversary Interview w/ John Tobias and Matt Campy|first=|last=Dude Nobody Cares|accessdate=27 December 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> recalled: \"Goro was originally called Gongoro, but we decided to shorten his name. My original concept sketch had Goro with 3 fingers and a thumb on each hand. Curt Chiarelli wisely changed it to 2 fingers and a thumb.\"<ref>[https://twitter.com/therealsaibot John Tobias (@therealsaibot) on Twitter] ([http://twitpic.com/6dneq8 the original concept art]).</ref> Chiarelli elaborated: \"In my experience and opinion, the first cardinal rule of fantasy character design is maintaining the illusion of anatomical and physiological functionality within the framework of a consistent, aesthetic integrity; and the second is that the simpler and cleaner the forms, the more iconic the creature will be. I suggested some minor revisions, like a decrease in the diameter of Goro\u2019s biceps to facilitate easier animation of the arms, as well as make the number of digits on his hands and feet uniform, as is the pattern in all [[vertebrates]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-mortal-kombat|title=An Oral History of \u2018Mortal Kombat\u2019|date=2018-11-26|website=MEL Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref> \n\nAfter creating it, he used it as a base for a latex model to make a 12-inch tall painted miniature. After recording a video of an actor making motions similar to those Goro would make in the game, Tobias used stop motion animation to move the miniature's body to match the actor's movements frame for frame.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[GamePro]] |author= |pages=114\u2013115 |title=The Minds Behind Mortal Kombat II |issue=59 |date=June 1994}}</ref> According to Boon, the clay sculpture used to animate Goro in the first ''Mortal Kombat'' was twisted around and bent so many times that it simply fell apart. In Goro's ''Deception'' bio card, when explaining how Goro was animated, Boon mentions a second model for Goro had also been created; this second model was not used for animation and is still in usable condition to this day, and is also currently in Boon's personal possession.\n\n==In video games==\nGoro became Grand Champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament after defeating the [[Kung Lao#Great Kung Lao|Great Kung Lao]]. For 500 years, he remained undefeated and helped Shang Tsung grow ever closer to achieving Shao Kahn's goal of domination over Earthrealm. In his 10th title defense, however, he faced Liu Kang. Making use of Goro's overconfidence after years of being the undefeated warrior, Liu Kang was able to secure victory. Goro disappeared during the tournament's aftermath, and he was believed to be dead. It is theorized that he actually retreated to his kingdom during this time. Goro is succeeded by another member of his race, [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Kintaro|Kintaro]], as Kahn's right-hand man during the events of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''. Goro reappears in ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'' as a playable character as well as in the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|2011 game]].\n\nGoro would resurface after Kahn's downfall, during the events of ''Mortal Kombat 4''. Despite having the intent to avenge his losses at Liu Kang's hands, Goro began to take an interest in the matters of his own race and joined his fellow Shokans in a war against the Centaurians. Princess [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Kitana]] intervened and negotiated a truce and peace accord between the two races. The meeting was interrupted by [[Kung Lao]] who desired to challenge his ancestor's killer. The Shaolin monk lashed out with a ceremonial strike of revenge that left Goro's chest scarred. Considering the score settled, the two shook hands. When Shinnok and his legion were defeated and Edenia was free once more, Goro and the Shokan race decided to ally themselves with the Edenians, agreeing to sign a peace treaty with the Centaurs as a condition of their new partnership.\n\nYears later, during the time of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', the united Edenian and Shokan forces attacked the weakened Shao Kahn's armies. Exhausted from battle, Goro was struck from behind by [[Noob Saibot]]. He was mortally wounded, apparently dying from the injury, and Kitana held a royal funeral for the fallen Shokan prince. However, Goro was able to survive, being saved from death by Shao Kahn himself, with the promise of returning the Shokans to their former glory and the banishment of the Centaurs in exchange for his allegiance. Agreeing to these terms, Goro placed his royal seal on a nearby disfigured fallen Shokan (whom Kitana and the Shokan army found and mistook for him, successfully deceiving them while hiding his defection), and resumed his place at Shao Kahn's side. Goro also appears as a boss character in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'', attacking both Liu Kang and Kung Lao.\n\nIn Konquest Mode of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'', Goro is confronted in Shao Kahn's fortress by [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Taven|Taven]] who wishes to kill [[Quan Chi]] but must get past Goro in order to do so. Taven eventually defeats Goro, who storms off. In the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|2011 game]], Goro reprises his role from the first tournaments. Goro is playable in the 2015 ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' as a bonus pre-order character. His absence from the main story mode is answered in the prequel comics: the Shokan did not ally with Mileena or Kotal Kahn, and thus were shunned by both and forced into being outcasts. He also serves as the last character the player faces before Shinnok in the Classic Ladder mode. By ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', Goro is revealed to have been killed. His corpse also appears in his lair.\n\n==In other media==\nGoro had a prominent role in [[Malibu Comics|Malibu's]] [[Mortal Kombat (Malibu Comics)|''Mortal Kombat'' comic book adaptations]] and was the first character to have his own three-issue miniseries, entitled ''Goro: Prince of Pain''. Goro's story did not differ greatly from his in-game profiles, being the Mortal Kombat champion and having previously bested the Great Kung Lao. He was also portrayed as an unstoppable force, easily dispatching the Earthrealm warriors alone, and only having a hard time against [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]. He remained undefeated during the first three issues of the ''Blood & Thunder'' series, having lost for the first time in the second issue of ''Prince of Pain'' against [[Mortal Kombat (comics)#Original characters|Zaggot]]'s creation, the Kombatant. In the following ''Battlewave'' series, he remained on Earth after his defeat, and, to appease for his failure, started hunting down the Earthrealm warriors; he injured [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]] in battle but was unable to defeat Liu Kang. In the fourth issue he had a mini-story at the end (\"When Titans Clash\") where he returned to Outworld to fight for Shao Kahn, settling a rivalry with Kintaro along the way.\n\nGoro appears as the champion of Mortal Kombat in the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' movie, in accordance with his original story. In the movie, Goro is portrayed as an evil warrior, steeped in the authoritarian traditions of Outworld and does not look favorably upon humans. After defeating a long series of opponents, including [[Johnny Cage]]'s friend Art Lean, he is in turn defeated and sent falling off a cliff to his death by Cage. For the film's production, Goro was an animatronic suit (costing over $1 million and requiring over a dozen puppeters to operate entirely<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3358036/story-behind-1995s-mortal-kombat-incredible/|title=The Story Behind 1995's 'Mortal Kombat' Is Incredible|website=bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVi2klX_feE|title=MORTAL KOMBAT Goro Animatronic Suit BTS|accessdate=27 December 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], with vocal effects also provided by [[Frank Welker]]. \n\nIn the novel based on the film, Goro was shown to be a slightly more noble creature.

He first appears in the original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' as an unplayable character, challenging the player before the final fight with [[Shang Tsung]]. Goro is a member of the four-armed half-human, half-dragon race, called the Shokan. In the original game he has been champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament for 500 years before being defeated by eventual tournament champion Liu Kang. Unlike most characters in the game, who were digitized representations of live actors, Goro was a clay sculpture animated through stop motion.\n\nThe character was not in the next two ''Mortal Kombat'' titles, which instead featured two other Shokan fighters, [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat)|Kintaro]] and [[Sheeva]]. He returned in ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', this time as a [[playable character]]. Goro returned in the home versions of ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'' as a sub-boss and an unlockable character. In contrast to his previous role as a villain, in the storyline of ''Mortal Kombat 4'' he aligns himself on the side of good. He returned to a villainous role as a playable character in the [[GameCube]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of ''[[Mortal Kombat Deception]]'', forming a pact with [[Shao Kahn]]. Goro also made subsequent appearances in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' as well as the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' reboot]] and its sequel ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]''.\n\nGoro is seen as one of the iconic characters of the series, with various publications listing him as one of the most memorable and difficult bosses in video game history. He has also appeared in other franchise media, such as [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|comics]] and the [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|live action film]] as well as its animated film, ''[[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]]''.\n\n==Concept and design==\nAccording to [[John Tobias]], Goro was created when he and [[Ed Boon]] discussed bringing \"a big brooding character\" to the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''. The original concept of the character was a two-handed humanoid character Rokuro, a member of \"a race of demon warriors called Rokuro-kubi (demons of the dark)\" wrongly \"reputed as savage barbarians\", who would join the tournament \"to restore the pride and respect of his race\".<ref>[http://twitpic.com/6kj7fq Another page from my ancient MK notebook: a discarded charact... on Twitpic].</ref> The idea for a [[stop motion]] animated monster boss and a character with four arms came from the films ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]] ''and ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retrozap.com/argcast-mini-14-making-mortal-kombat-with-john-tobias/|title=ARGcast Mini #14: Making Mortal Kombat with John Tobias|last=ARGpodcast|date=2018-06-26|website=RetroZap|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref> and from one of the [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad]] movies, respectively.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Game Makers: The Artists|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1996|page=34-36}}</ref> \n\nUnlike other characters in the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Goro was not based on a digitized actor but instead on a clay sculpture created by Richard Divizio's friend Curt Chiarelli. Tobias, who considers Goro probably his favourite character in the series,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z7bAEMVRMU|title=Mortal Kombat II 25th Anniversary Interview w/ John Tobias and Matt Campy|first=|last=Dude Nobody Cares|accessdate=27 December 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> recalled: \"Goro was originally called Gongoro, but we decided to shorten his name. My original concept sketch had Goro with 3 fingers and a thumb on each hand. Curt Chiarelli wisely changed it to 2 fingers and a thumb.\"<ref>[https://twitter.com/therealsaibot John Tobias (@therealsaibot) on Twitter] ([http://twitpic.com/6dneq8 the original concept art]).</ref> Chiarelli elaborated: \"In my experience and opinion, the first cardinal rule of fantasy character design is maintaining the illusion of anatomical and physiological functionality within the framework of a consistent, aesthetic integrity; and the second is that the simpler and cleaner the forms, the more iconic the creature will be. I suggested some minor revisions, like a decrease in the diameter of Goro\u2019s biceps to facilitate easier animation of the arms, as well as make the number of digits on his hands and feet uniform, as is the pattern in all [[vertebrates]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-mortal-kombat|title=An Oral History of \u2018Mortal Kombat\u2019|date=2018-11-26|website=MEL Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref> \n\nAfter creating it, he used it as a base for a latex model to make a 12-inch tall painted miniature. After recording a video of an actor making motions similar to those Goro would make in the game, Tobias used stop motion animation to move the miniature's body to match the actor's movements frame for frame.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[GamePro]] |author= |pages=114\u2013115 |title=The Minds Behind Mortal Kombat II |issue=59 |date=June 1994}}</ref> According to Boon, the clay sculpture used to animate Goro in the first ''Mortal Kombat'' was twisted around and bent so many times that it simply fell apart. In Goro's ''Deception'' bio card, when explaining how Goro was animated, Boon mentions a second model for Goro had also been created; this second model was not used for animation and is still in usable condition to this day, and is also currently in Boon's personal possession.\n\n==In video games==\nGoro became Grand Champion of the Mortal Kombat tournament after defeating the [[Kung Lao#Great Kung Lao|Great Kung Lao]]. For 500 years, he remained undefeated and helped Shang Tsung grow ever closer to achieving Shao Kahn's goal of domination over Earthrealm. In his 10th title defense, however, he faced Liu Kang. Making use of Goro's overconfidence after years of being the undefeated warrior, Liu Kang was able to secure victory. Goro disappeared during the tournament's aftermath, and he was believed to be dead. It is theorized that he actually retreated to his kingdom during this time. Goro is succeeded by another member of his race, [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Kintaro|Kintaro]], as Kahn's right-hand man during the events of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''. Goro reappears in ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'' as a playable character as well as in the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|2011 game]].\n\nGoro would resurface after Kahn's downfall, during the events of ''Mortal Kombat 4''. Despite having the intent to avenge his losses at Liu Kang's hands, Goro began to take an interest in the matters of his own race and joined his fellow Shokans in a war against the Centaurians. Princess [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Kitana]] intervened and negotiated a truce and peace accord between the two races. The meeting was interrupted by [[Kung Lao]] who desired to challenge his ancestor's killer. The Shaolin monk lashed out with a ceremonial strike of revenge that left Goro's chest scarred. Considering the score settled, the two shook hands. When Shinnok and his legion were defeated and Edenia was free once more, Goro and the Shokan race decided to ally themselves with the Edenians, agreeing to sign a peace treaty with the Centaurs as a condition of their new partnership.\n\nYears later, during the time of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', the united Edenian and Shokan forces attacked the weakened Shao Kahn's armies. Exhausted from battle, Goro was struck from behind by [[Noob Saibot]]. He was mortally wounded, apparently dying from the injury, and Kitana held a royal funeral for the fallen Shokan prince. However, Goro was able to survive, being saved from death by Shao Kahn himself, with the promise of returning the Shokans to their former glory and the banishment of the Centaurs in exchange for his allegiance. Agreeing to these terms, Goro placed his royal seal on a nearby disfigured fallen Shokan (whom Kitana and the Shokan army found and mistook for him, successfully deceiving them while hiding his defection), and resumed his place at Shao Kahn's side. Goro also appears as a boss character in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'', attacking both Liu Kang and Kung Lao.\n\nIn Konquest Mode of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'', Goro is confronted in Shao Kahn's fortress by [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Taven|Taven]] who wishes to kill [[Quan Chi]] but must get past Goro in order to do so. Taven eventually defeats Goro, who storms off. In the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|2011 game]], Goro reprises his role from the first tournaments. Goro is playable in the 2015 ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' as a bonus pre-order character. His absence from the main story mode is answered in the prequel comics: the Shokan did not ally with Mileena or Kotal Kahn, and thus were shunned by both and forced into being outcasts. He also serves as the last character the player faces before Shinnok in the Classic Ladder mode. By ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', Goro is revealed to have been killed. His corpse also appears in his lair.\n\n==In other media==\nGoro had a prominent role in [[Malibu Comics|Malibu's]] [[Mortal Kombat (Malibu Comics)|''Mortal Kombat'' comic book adaptations]] and was the first character to have his own three-issue miniseries, entitled ''Goro: Prince of Pain''. Goro's story did not differ greatly from his in-game profiles, being the Mortal Kombat champion and having previously bested the Great Kung Lao.

This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.\n# '''Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes:''' Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.\n# '''Protect data privacy and data security:''' Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students\u2019 data privacy.\n# '''Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching:''' Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.\n# '''Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes:''' Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students\u2019 knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.\n# '''Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools:''' Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.\n# '''Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms:''' Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.\n# '''Develop distance learning rules and monitor students\u2019 learning process:''' Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning.

This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.\n# '''Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes:''' Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.\n# '''Protect data privacy and data security:''' Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students\u2019 data privacy.\n# '''Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching:''' Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.\n# '''Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes:''' Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students\u2019 knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.\n# '''Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools:''' Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.\n# '''Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms:''' Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.\n# '''Develop distance learning rules and monitor students\u2019 learning process:''' Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning. Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students\u2019 learning process. Try to use tools to support submission of students\u2019 feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students\u2019 feedback\n# '''Define the duration of distance learning units based on students\u2019 self-regulation skills:''' Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students\u2019 self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes. Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students. \n# '''Create communities and enhance connection:''' Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures|title=How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures|date=2020-03-06|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on science and technology]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on religion]]\n*[[List of major events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = 290 million students out of school due to COVID-19: UNESCO releases first global numbers and mobilizes response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence = \n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Adverse consequences of school closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures UNESCO - COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Impact of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic on education}}\n[[Category:2020 in education]]\n[[Category:Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Education]]\n[[Category:Education and health]]\n", "name_user": "Ain92", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDistance learning:Copyedit (minor)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_on_education"}
