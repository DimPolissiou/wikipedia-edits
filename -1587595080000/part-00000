Several large servers employ a staff of developers, managers, and artists.<ref name=kotaku/> As of 2014, the Shotbow server employed three full-time and five part-time employees. According to Matt Sundberg, the server's owner, \"large server networks are incredibly expensive to run and are very time consuming.\"<ref name=\"kotaku2\">{{Cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/why-people-are-mad-about-minecrafts-new-changes-1592190004 |title=Why People Are Mad About Minecraft's New Changes |last=Marinconz |first=Steve |date=June 17, 2014 |work=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref> According to Chad Dunbar, the founder of ''MCGamer'', \"it really costs to run networks above 1000 concurrent players.\" This includes salaries, hardware, bandwidth, and DDoS protection,<ref name=rps/> and so monthly expenses can cost thousands of dollars.<ref name=kotaku/> Dunbar stated that ''MCGamer'', which has had over 50,000 daily players, has expenses that can be \"well into the five-figure marks\" per month.

Some Notable plug-in software include CraftBukkit, Spigot, Paper and Sponge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/what-is-spigot-craftbukkit-bukkit-vanilla-forg/|title=What is Spigot?

Some server software, like Glowstone does not modify the game\u2019s base code, however these can cause many bugs. BungeeCord and Waterfall are two notable server software which allow multiple servers to be linked up together. Most popular servers use BungeeCord or Waterfall for linking up their servers. Many whitelisted YouTuber servers, like HermitCraft run the vanilla server software provided by Mojang.\n\nBedrock edition server software are usually run custom versions of server software, usually written in Java, JavaScript or PHP. The most popular server software for plugins and optimizations include Pocketmine-MP, NukkitX, Altay and Jukebox.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition_server_software|title=Bedrock Edition server software|website=Minecraft Wiki|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> WaterDog and Nemisys are popular server linking software. Some server software, like DragonProxy, ProtocolSupport and Geyser allow Bedrock Edition clients to play on Java Edition servers. Aside from plugins and optimizations, people running Bedrock Edition servers use custom server software for compatability, as the official Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software is made only for Ubuntu and Windows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/|title=Minecraft Server
