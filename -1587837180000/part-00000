His first appearance was in the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''D\u014dbutsu no Mori'', released in Europe and North America on the [[GameCube]] as ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]''. Mr. Resetti is a [[Mole (animal)|mole]] whose role in the series is to remind players to save before quitting the game, and to give a lecture if they do not.

In order to prevent this, the development team implemented Mr. Resetti, in hopes that players who want to cheat would be deterred due to the long speeches. If a player resets the game enough, Mr. Resetti will want the player to type out sentences such as \"I am stupid.\" and \"I stink.\" Contrary to popular belief, Mr. Resetti does not delete the player's saved file if that player keeps resetting the game. Mr. Resetti's English dialogue in ''Animal Crossing'' was written by Nintendo Treehouse team member Tim O'Leary, who intended the character to speak with a deep [[New York City English|Bronx accent]] to complement the character's [[Kansai dialect|Osaka accent]] in the original Japanese.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200310/N03.1010.1805.22997.htm |title=Interview: Bill Trinen Of Nintendo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031205115536/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200310/N03.1010.1805.22997.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2003 |date=October 10, 2003 |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> He is designed to make the player believe he knows them and is yelling directly at them, and the European ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk|Let's Go to the City]]'' manual warns that young children may find Mr. Resetti's authoritative tone of voice disturbing.<ref name=\"kotaku\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5106112/nintendo-animal-crossings-resetti-may-be-disturbing-to-young-children |title=Nintendo: Animal Crossing's Resetti \"May Be Disturbing To Young Children\" |website=[[Kotaku]] |author=Luke Plunkett |date=Dec 10, 2008 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\nMr. Resetti's role in the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series is to advise the player to remember to save before quitting the game.

Internationally, she was most notable for strong supporting parts in her later years in a number of [[Ingmar Bergman]]-films.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn '''Siri Naima Matilda Wifstrand''' in [[Stockholm]] in 1890, she was raised by her mother in Fleminggatan. Wifstrand never trained acting but learned the art thoroughly when she in 1905 joined the Anna Lundberg Theatre Company, a well reputed and respected theatre company in Sweden at the time. She travelled with them for a number of years, appearing in small parts and in extra parts. This eventually led her to small parts at theatres in [[Helsinki]] and around [[Stockholm]]. But at this time Wifstrand did not have her mind set on acting, instead she sought to be a singer. And it was as a grand operetta singer she became famous and enjoyed a much successful star career for 30 years in Sweden (her speaking parts as an actress came long after; when she after singing-career gradually turned to acting in the 1940s and then earned acclaim as one of Sweden's finest supporting and character actresses on stage and film).\n\n===Career and break-through===\nWifstrand studied music and singing in Stockholm at the Swedish Royal Academy of Music and in 1910 she went to London and further trained for [[Raymond von zur M\u00fchlen]]. After her studies she was one of the most acknowledged operetta singers in Scandinavia. She worked at [[Oscarsteatern]] (Sweden's foremost operetta and musical stage) 1913\u20131918 and for years to come toured Sweden and Scandinavia. Her big break-through came as Countess Stasi in [[Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]]'s operetta ''[[Die Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1sf\u00fcrstin]]'' in 1916. She worked in the 1920s mainly at the opera houses in [[Oslo]] and [[Copenhagen]]. For many years she lived in London where she also performed with [[troubadour]]-songs alone along with her guitar. A curiosity here is that when the first attempts at broadcast television took place in Britain Wifstrand became one of the first \"TV-stars\", so to speak, as she appeared on TV in the 1930s and performed a number of songs.\n\n[[File:Naima wifstrand-czardasfurstinnan.jpg|210px|right|thumb|Wifstrand as Countess Stasi in K\u00e1lm\u00e1n's ''Die Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1sf\u00fcrstin'', 1916]]\nIn 1937 Swedish stage director Per Lindberg cast her as Mother Peachum in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (in Swe: ''Tolvskillingsoperan'') which became a hugely successful production and toured with [[Riksteatern]]. When Bertolt Brecht later left Germany because of [[Nazism|the Nazis]] he first moved to Sweden where he lived for a time and wrote the part ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children|Mother Courage]]'' especially for Wifstrand \u2013 but sadly, she herself never got to play the part in what became one of Brecht's most successful plays. During his stay in Sweden, Wifstrand had helped Brecht both financially and also personally with accommodation.\n\n===Filming and Bergman===\n[[File:Joh dollarprinsessan.jpg|210px|right|thumb|As Daisy in [[Die Dollarprinzessin|''The Dollar Princess'']], 1909]]\nNaima Wifstrand in the 1940s planned to retire from her own stage career by turning to directing, first at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] 1944\u20131946. However, due to some successful supporting parts in some Swedish 1940s films \u2013 where Naima surprised critics and proved herself a surprisingly strong and charismatic character actress \u2013 a number of Sweden's young stage and film directors approached her and offered her parts in dramatic productions on stage: one of these young directors was [[Ingmar Bergman]]. Later on Wifstrand became one of the director's most reliable and longtime ensemble actors. She was part of Bergman's ensemble (1954\u20131961) during all his legendary years at [[Malm\u00f6 City Theatre]]. Later he would also cast her in some of his most memorable early films, including ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' and ''[[The Magician (1958 film)|The Magician]]''. Aside from this she also worked with the new established [[Stockholm City Theatre]] 1962\u20131963 and at [[Gothenburg City Theatre]] from 1964.\n\nNaima Wifstrand was married to captain Erling Nielsen from 1921 to 1928.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[Madame bes\u00f8ker Oslo]]'' (1927) - Madam Vera\n* ''Pjerrot'' (1931)\n* ''Pierrot gr\u00e6der'' (1931)\n* ''Kungsgatan'' (1943) - Caretaker's Wife\n* ''En dotter f\u00f6dd'' (1944) - Edit\n* ''Se opp f\u00f6r spioner!''

When Bertolt Brecht later left Germany because of [[Nazism|the Nazis]] he first moved to Sweden where he lived for a time and wrote the part ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children|Mother Courage]]'' especially for Wifstrand \u2013 but sadly, she herself never got to play the part in what became one of Brecht's most successful plays. During his stay in Sweden, Wifstrand had helped Brecht both financially and also personally with accommodation.\n\n===Filming and Bergman===\n[[File:Joh dollarprinsessan.jpg|210px|right|thumb|As Daisy in [[Die Dollarprinzessin|''The Dollar Princess'']], 1909]]\nNaima Wifstrand in the 1940s planned to retire from her own stage career by turning to directing, first at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] 1944\u20131946. However, due to some successful supporting parts in some Swedish 1940s films \u2013 where Naima surprised critics and proved herself a surprisingly strong and charismatic character actress \u2013 a number of Sweden's young stage and film directors approached her and offered her parts in dramatic productions on stage: one of these young directors was [[Ingmar Bergman]]. Later on Wifstrand became one of the director's most reliable and longtime ensemble actors. She was part of Bergman's ensemble (1954\u20131961) during all his legendary years at [[Malm\u00f6 City Theatre]]. Later he would also cast her in some of his most memorable early films, including ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' and ''[[The Magician (1958 film)|The Magician]]''. Aside from this she also worked with the new established [[Stockholm City Theatre]] 1962\u20131963 and at [[Gothenburg City Theatre]] from 1964.\n\nNaima Wifstrand was married to captain Erling Nielsen from 1921 to 1928.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[Madame bes\u00f8ker Oslo]]'' (1927) - Madam Vera\n* ''Pjerrot'' (1931)\n* ''Pierrot gr\u00e6der'' (1931)\n* ''Kungsgatan'' (1943) - Caretaker's Wife\n* ''En dotter f\u00f6dd'' (1944) - Edit\n* ''Se opp f\u00f6r spioner!''

His actions allowed for the battery to initially remove the immediate threat posed by the Germans and continue firing and then for its guns eventually hauled to safety later in the evening. Early the next morning, 23 April, when Fisher had obtained four more men from the 14th Battalion, he went forward again into St. Julien to fire on the swarming Germans.

'''Office''', is a family of [[client software]], [[server software]], and services developed by [[Microsoft]]. It was first announced by [[Bill Gates]] on August 1, 1988, at [[COMDEX]] in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an [[office suite]] (bundled set of productivity [[application software|applications]]), the first version of Office contained [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] data integration and [[Visual Basic for Applications]] scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the [[Office Business Applications]] brand. On July 10, 2012, [[Softpedia]] reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-s-Office-Has-Over-One-Billion-Users-280426.shtml |title=Microsoft\u2019s Office Has over One Billion Users |work=[[Softpedia]] |publisher=SoftNews |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOffice is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the [[desktop computer|desktop]] version, available for [[personal computer|PCs]] running the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] [[operating system]]s. Microsoft also maintains [[mobile device|mobile]] apps for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. [[Office on the web]] is a version of the software that runs within a [[web browser]].\n\nSince [[Office 2013]], Microsoft has promoted [[Office 365]] as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a [[subscription business model]], and users receive free feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and [[cloud computing]] integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales.\n\nThe current on-premises, desktop version of Office is [[Microsoft Office 2019|Office 2019]], released on September 24, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-office-2019-for-windows-and-mac/|title=Microsoft starts rolling out Office 2019 for Windows and Mac|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|List of Microsoft Office programs}}\n\n===Desktop and mobile applications===\n* '''[[Microsoft Word]]:''' a [[word processor]] included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued [[Microsoft Works]]. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and introduced the [[computer mouse]] to more users. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of [[LisaWrite]] and [[MacWrite]], Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer [[WYSIWYG]] features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of [[Office Open XML]], which was later standardized by [[Ecma International]] as an [[open format]]. Support for [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[OpenDocument]] (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with [[Service Pack]] 2 for Word 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501133844/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n* '''[[Microsoft Excel]]:''' a [[spreadsheet]] editor that originally competed with the dominant [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and eventually outsold it. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac OS in 1985 and the first Windows version (numbered 2.05 to line up with the Mac) in November 1987.\n* '''[[Microsoft PowerPoint]]:''' a [[presentation program]] used to create [[slideshows]] composed of text, graphics, and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and shown by the presenter or printed out on [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]] or [[Presentation slide|slides]].\n* '''[[Microsoft Outlook]]''' (not to be confused with [[Microsoft Outlook Express|Outlook Express]], [[Outlook.com]] or [[Outlook on the web]]): a [[personal information manager]] that replaces [[Windows Messaging]], [[Microsoft Mail]], and [[Schedule+]] starting in Office 97; it includes an e-mail client, calendar, task manager and address book. On the Mac OS, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]. In Office 2001, it introduced an alternative application with a slightly different feature set called [[Microsoft Entourage]]. It reintroduced Outlook in Office 2011, replacing Entourage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fried |first=Ina |title=Next Mac Office, due by 2010's end, gets Outlook |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10308997-56.html | work=[[CNET News]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref>\n* '''[[Microsoft OneNote]]''': a [[Notetaking software|notetaking program]] that gathers handwritten or typed notes, drawings, [[screenshot|screen clippings]] and audio commentaries. Notes can be shared with other OneNote users over the Internet or a network. OneNote was initially introduced as a standalone app that was not included in any [[Microsoft Office 2003]] edition. However, OneNote eventually became a core component of Microsoft Office; with the release of [[Microsoft Office 2013]], OneNote was included in all Microsoft Office offerings<!--not editions!-->. OneNote is also available as a [[web application|web app]] on [[Office Online]], a [[freemium]] (and later [[freeware]]) Windows desktop app, a [[mobile app]] for [[Windows Phone]],  [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Symbian]], and a [[Metro (design language)|Metro-style]] app for [[Windows 8]] or later.\n* '''[[Skype for Business]]:''' an integrated communications client for conferences and meetings in real-time, it is the only Microsoft Office desktop app that is neither useful without a proper network infrastructure nor has the \"Microsoft\" prefix in its name.\n* '''[[Microsoft Teams]]:''' a platform that combines workplace chat, meetings, notes, and attachments. Microsoft announced that Teams would eventually replace Skype for Business.\n\n===Windows-only apps===\n* '''[[Microsoft Publisher]]:''' a [[desktop publishing]] app for Windows mostly used for designing brochures, labels, calendars, greeting cards, business cards, newsletters,  web site, and postcards. \n* '''[[Microsoft Access]]:''' a [[database management system]] for Windows that combines the [[Relational database management system|relational]] [[Microsoft Jet Database Engine]] with a graphical user interface and software development tools.

It also has a native app for [[iOS]] and [[Windows 10]].\n* '''[[Microsoft Office shared tools#Delve|Delve]]:''' Allows [[Office 365]] users to search and manage their emails, meetings, contacts, social networks and documents stored on OneDrive or Sites in Office 365. \n* '''[[Microsoft Forms]]:''' An [[Survey data collection#Online surveys|online survey creator]], available for Office 365 Education subscribers.\n* '''[[OneDrive]]:''' A file hosting service that allows users to sync files and later access them from a web browser or mobile device.\n* '''[[Outlook.com]]:''' Free [[webmail]] with a user interface similar to [[Microsoft Outlook]].\n* '''[[Outlook on the web]]:''' Similar to Outlook.com but more comprehensive and available only through Office 365 and [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] offerings.\n* '''[[Microsoft Planner]]:''' A planning application available on the Microsoft Office 365 platform.\n* '''[[Microsoft Stream]]:''' A corporate [[video sharing service]] for enterprise users with an Office 365 Academic or Enterprise license.\n* '''[[Microsoft Bookings]]:''' An appointment booking application on the Microsoft Office 365 platform.\n\n==Office on the web==\n{{Main|Office on the web}}\nOffice on the web is a free lightweight [[web app|web version]] of Microsoft Office and primarily includes four web applications: [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft Powerpoint|Powerpoint]] and [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]]. The offering also includes [[Outlook.com]] and [[OneDrive]] which are accessible through a unified app switcher.\n\n==Common features==\nMost versions of Microsoft Office (including Office 97 and later) use their own [[widget toolkit|widget]] set and do not exactly match the native operating system. This is most apparent in Microsoft Office XP and 2003, where the standard [[Menu (computing)|menus]] were replaced with a colored, flat-looking, shadowed menu style. The user interface of a particular version of Microsoft Office often heavily influences a subsequent version of Microsoft Windows. For example, the [[toolbar]], colored [[Button (computing)|buttons]] and the gray-colored 3D look of Office 4.3 were added to Windows 95, and the [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon]], introduced in Office 2007, has been incorporated into several programs bundled with [[Windows 7]] and later. In 2012, Office 2013 replicated the flat, box-like design of [[Windows 8]].\n\nUsers of Microsoft Office may access external data via connection-specifications saved in Office Data Connection (.odc) files.<ref>{{cite book|last=DeMarco|first=Jim|authorlink=|title=Pro Excel 2007 VBA|date=February 1, 2008|publisher=Apress|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-59059-957-0|page=361|quote= External data is accessed through a connection file, such as an Office Data Connection (ODC) file (.odc)}}</ref>\n\nBoth Windows and Office use [[service pack]]s to update software. Office had non-cumulative [[Patch (computing)|service release]]s, which were discontinued after Office 2000 Service Release 1.\n\nPast versions of Office [[Easter eggs in Microsoft products|often contained Easter eggs]]. For example, Excel 97 contained a reasonably functional flight-simulator.\n\n==File formats and metadata==\nMicrosoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats based on the OLE [[Compound File Binary Format]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Office File Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc313118.aspx|work=[[MSDN#Library|MSDN Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html | title=We Can Put an End to Word Attachments | last=Stallman | first = Richard M. | publisher=Free Software Foundation | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available for download and granted any possible patents rights for use or implementations of those binary format for free under the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise|Open Specification Promise]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spolsky|first1=Joel|title=Why are the Microsoft Office file formats so complicated?

In addition, the company does not provide users of its (Office) software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company. Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and \"sends home\" is diagnostics. Researchers also observed that Microsoft \"seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU\". However, they discovered the software packages collected additional data that contained private user information, some of which was stored on servers located in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/rapporten/2018/11/07/data-protection-impact-assessment-op-microsoft-office/Update+on+negotiations+between+Dutch+central+government+and+Microsoft+on+GDPR+compliance+November+7.pdf|last=Netherlands Ministry of Justice|title=Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Microsoft Office 2016 and 365}}</ref> The Netherlands Ministry of Justice hired Privacy Company to probe and evaluate the use of Microsoft Office products in the public sector.<ref name=\"The Register\"/> \"Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus [[Microsoft Access]] 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in [[CD-ROM]] form, it also included [[Microsoft Bookshelf|Bookshelf]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP.

Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]].\n\n====Microsoft Office 2000 to 2003====\n'''[[Microsoft Office 2000]]''' (Office 9.0) introduced [[adaptive]] menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user.

Office 2000 automatically trusts [[macro (computer science)|macros]] (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. The Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]], remained in Brazil and was also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.\n\n'''[[Microsoft Office XP]]''' (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the [[Safe Mode]] feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted [[Windows registry|registry]] or a faulty add-in. [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]] is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010. Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as [[handwriting recognition]].

'''Office''', is a family of [[client software]], [[server software]], and services developed by [[Microsoft]]. It was first announced by [[Bill Gates]] on August 1, 1988, at [[COMDEX]] in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an [[office suite]] (bundled set of productivity [[application software|applications]]), the first version of Office contained [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] data integration and [[Visual Basic for Applications]] scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the [[Office Business Applications]] brand. On July 10, 2012, [[Softpedia]] reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-s-Office-Has-Over-One-Billion-Users-280426.shtml |title=Microsoft\u2019s Office Has over One Billion Users |work=[[Softpedia]] |publisher=SoftNews |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOffice is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the [[desktop computer|desktop]] version, available for [[personal computer|PCs]] running the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] [[operating system]]s. Microsoft also maintains [[mobile device|mobile]] apps for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. [[Office on the web]] is a version of the software that runs within a [[web browser]].\n\nSince [[Office 2013]], Microsoft has promoted [[Office 365]] as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a [[subscription business model]], and users receive free feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and [[cloud computing]] integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales.\n\nThe current on-premises, desktop version of Office is [[Microsoft Office 2019|Office 2019]], released on September 24, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-office-2019-for-windows-and-mac/|title=Microsoft starts rolling out Office 2019 for Windows and Mac|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|List of Microsoft Office programs}}\n\n===Desktop and mobile applications===\n* '''[[Microsoft Word]]:''' a [[word processor]] included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued [[Microsoft Works]]. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and introduced the [[computer mouse]] to more users. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of [[LisaWrite]] and [[MacWrite]], Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer [[WYSIWYG]] features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of [[Office Open XML]], which was later standardized by [[Ecma International]] as an [[open format]]. Support for [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[OpenDocument]] (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with [[Service Pack]] 2 for Word 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501133844/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n* '''[[Microsoft Excel]]:''' a [[spreadsheet]] editor that originally competed with the dominant [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and eventually outsold it.

On the Mac OS, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]].

OneNote is also available as a [[web application|web app]] on [[Office Online]], a [[freemium]] (and later [[freeware]]) Windows desktop app, a [[mobile app]] for [[Windows Phone]],  [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Symbian]], and a [[Metro (design language)|Metro-style]] app for [[Windows 8]] or later.\n* '''[[Skype for Business]]:''' an integrated communications client for conferences and meetings in real-time, it is the only Microsoft Office desktop app that is neither useful without a proper network infrastructure nor has the \"Microsoft\" prefix in its name.\n* '''[[Microsoft Teams]]:''' a platform that combines workplace chat, meetings, notes, and attachments.

The offering also includes [[Outlook.com]] and [[OneDrive]] which are accessible through a unified app switcher.\n\n==Common features==\nMost versions of Microsoft Office (including Office 97 and later) use their own [[widget toolkit|widget]] set and do not exactly match the native operating system. This is most apparent in Microsoft Office XP and 2003, where the standard [[Menu (computing)|menus]] were replaced with a colored, flat-looking, shadowed menu style. The user interface of a particular version of Microsoft Office often heavily influences a subsequent version of Microsoft Windows. For example, the [[toolbar]], colored [[Button (computing)|buttons]] and the gray-colored 3D look of Office 4.3 were added to Windows 95, and the [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon]], introduced in Office 2007, has been incorporated into several programs bundled with [[Windows 7]] and later. In 2012, Office 2013 replicated the flat, box-like design of [[Windows 8]].\n\nUsers of Microsoft Office may access external data via connection-specifications saved in Office Data Connection (.odc) files.<ref>{{cite book|last=DeMarco|first=Jim|authorlink=|title=Pro Excel 2007 VBA|date=February 1, 2008|publisher=Apress|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-59059-957-0|page=361|quote= External data is accessed through a connection file, such as an Office Data Connection (ODC) file (.odc)}}</ref>\n\nBoth Windows and Office use [[service pack]]s to update software. Office had non-cumulative [[Patch (computing)|service release]]s, which were discontinued after Office 2000 Service Release 1.\n\nPast versions of Office [[Easter eggs in Microsoft products|often contained Easter eggs]]. For example, Excel 97 contained a reasonably functional flight-simulator.\n\n==File formats and metadata==\nMicrosoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats based on the OLE [[Compound File Binary Format]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Office File Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc313118.aspx|work=[[MSDN#Library|MSDN Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html | title=We Can Put an End to Word Attachments | last=Stallman | first = Richard M. | publisher=Free Software Foundation | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available for download and granted any possible patents rights for use or implementations of those binary format for free under the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise|Open Specification Promise]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spolsky|first1=Joel|title=Why are the Microsoft Office file formats so complicated?

Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Windows platform ([[LibreOffice]], all platforms), macOS platform ([[iWork]] '08, [[NeoOffice]], [[LibreOffice]]) and [[Linux]] ([[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.0). In addition, Office 2010, Service Pack 2 for Office 2007, and Office 2016 for Mac supports the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for opening and saving documents - only the old [[OpenDocument|ODF]] 1.0 (2006 ISO/IEC standard) is supported, not the 1.2 version (2015 ISO/IEC standard).\n\nMicrosoft provides the ability to [[metadata removal tool|remove metadata]] from Office documents.

In addition, the company does not provide users of its (Office) software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company. Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and \"sends home\" is diagnostics. Researchers also observed that Microsoft \"seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU\". However, they discovered the software packages collected additional data that contained private user information, some of which was stored on servers located in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/rapporten/2018/11/07/data-protection-impact-assessment-op-microsoft-office/Update+on+negotiations+between+Dutch+central+government+and+Microsoft+on+GDPR+compliance+November+7.pdf|last=Netherlands Ministry of Justice|title=Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Microsoft Office 2016 and 365}}</ref> The Netherlands Ministry of Justice hired Privacy Company to probe and evaluate the use of Microsoft Office products in the public sector.<ref name=\"The Register\"/> \"Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.
