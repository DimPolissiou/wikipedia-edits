Its architecture is a [[front controller]], routing all requests for non-static [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]<nowiki/>s to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable [[permalink]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wpshout.com/wordpress-front-controller/|title=WordPress and the Front Controller Design Pattern {{!}} WPShout|date=2014-02-11|newspaper=WPShout|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517172044/http://wpshout.com/wordpress-front-controller/|archive-date=May 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Themes ===\nWordPress users may install and switch among different [[Theme (computing)|themes]]. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present and every theme should be designed  using WordPress standards with structured [[PHP]], valid [[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language), and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS). Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress \"Appearance\" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory, for example via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://codex.wordpress.org |title=Theme Installation |publisher=Codex.wordpress.org |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426211036/http://codex.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=April 26, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[PHP]], [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] found in themes can be directly modified to alter theme behavior, or a theme can be a \"child\" theme that inherits settings from another theme and selectively overrides features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|title=Child Themes \"WordPress Codex|website=codex.wordpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222110349/https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|archive-date=February 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual [https://growupnext.com WordPress developers]. WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes. The free theme Underscores created by the WordPress developers has become a popular basis for new themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |title=Introduction To Underscores: A WordPress Starter Theme With Konstantin Obenland |first=Jeff |last=Chandler |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819111713/https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Plugins ===\nWordPress' [[plugin (computing)|plugin]] architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog. As of January 2020, WordPress.org has 55,487 plugins available,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wordpress.org/plugins/|title=WordPress > WordPress Plugins|publisher=WordPress|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126184743/https://wordpress.org/plugins/|archive-date=January 26, 2020|url-status=live|accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref> each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs.  However, this does not include the premium plugins that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from [[search engine optimization|search engine optimization (SEO)]], to [[client portal]]s used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of [[GUI widget|widgets]] and [[navigation bar]]s. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.\n\nWeb developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.\n\n=== Mobile applications ===\nPhone apps for WordPress exist for [[WebOS]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for WebOS |work=WordPress |accessdate=March 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zrM7ZQpF?url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Android (operating system)|Android]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |title=WordPress publishes native Android application |publisher=Android and Me |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721081639/http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[iOS]] (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad),<ref name=\"altafsayani\">{{cite web |url=http://www.altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch/ |title=Idea: WordPress App For iPhone and iPod Touch |work=WordPress iPhone & iPod Touch |date=July 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314142538/http://altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch |archive-date=March 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|url=https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|title=18 Million WordPress Blogs Land on the iPad|date=March 24, 2011|work=ReadWriteWeb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123112140/https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|archive-date=November 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Windows Phone]], and [[BlackBerry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for BlackBerry |work=WordPress |accessdate=December 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20131106094925/http://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> These applications, designed by [[Automattic]], have options such as adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats.<ref name=\"altafsayani\" /><ref name=\"post\" />\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nThe [[WordPress Accessibility Team]] has worked to improve the accessibility for core WordPress as well as support a clear identification of accessible themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/ |title=Make WordPress Accessible |work=WordPress}}</ref> The WordPress Accessibility Team provides continuing educational support about web accessibility and inclusive design.

Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|smart quotes]]). WordPress also supports the [[Trackback]] and [[Pingback]] standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of a number of plugins that allow for a variety of customized editing features.\n\n== Multi-user and multi-blogging ==\nPrior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS adds eight new data tables for each blog.\n\nAs of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/ |title=WordPress 3.0 \"Thelonious\" |publisher=WordPress.org |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630061059/http://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/ |archive-date=June 30, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n''b2/cafelog'', more commonly known as ''b2'' or ''cafelog'', was the precursor to WordPress.<ref>{{cite video |people=Andrew Warner, [[Matt Mullenweg]] |date=September 10, 2009 |title=The Biography Of WordPress&nbsp;\u2013 With Matt Mullenweg |url=http://mixergy.com/the-biography-of-wordpress-with-matt-mullenweg/ |format=[[MPEG-4 Part 14]] |medium=Podcast |publisher=Mixergy |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |time=10:57 |quote=b2 had actually, through a series of circumstances, essentially become abandoned. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914084204/http://mixergy.com/the-biography-of-wordpress-with-matt-mullenweg/ |archive-date=September 14, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> b2/cafelog was estimated to have been installed on approximately 2,000 blogs as of May 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valdrighi |first=Michel |title=b2 test weblog \u2013 post dated 23.05.03 |url=http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=500 |accessdate=May 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522163322/http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=500 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was written in PHP for use with [[MySQL]] by Michel Valdrighi, who is now a contributing developer to WordPress.

It is especially important to keep WordPress plugins updated because would-be [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] can easily list all the plugins a site uses, and then run scans searching for any vulnerabilities against those plugins. If vulnerabilities are found, they may be exploited to allow hackers to, for example, upload their own files (such as a [[web shell]]) that collect sensitive information.\n\nDevelopers can also use tools to analyze potential vulnerabilities, including WPScan, WordPress Auditor and WordPress Sploit Framework developed by 0pc0deFR. These types of tools research known vulnerabilities, such as a [[Cross-site request forgery|CSRF]], [[Local File Inclusion|LFI]], [[File inclusion vulnerability|RFI]], [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]], SQL injection and user enumeration. However, not all vulnerabilities can be detected by tools, so it is advisable to check the code of plugins, themes and other add-ins from other developers.\n\nIn March 2015, it was reported by many security experts and SEOs, including Search Engine Land, that a [[SEO]] plugin for WordPress called [[Yoast]] which is used by more than 14 million users worldwide has a vulnerability which can lead to an exploit where hackers can do a Blind SQL injection.<ref>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2292 \"CVE-2015-2292\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614212804/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2292 |date=June 14, 2017 }}, Retrieved on July 7, 2017</ref><ref>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2293 \"CVE-2015-2293\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615040555/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2293 |date=June 15, 2017 }}, Retrieved on July 7, 2017</ref> To fix that issue they immediately introduced a newer version 1.7.4 of the same plugin to avoid any disturbance on web because of the security lapse that the plugin had.<ref>Barry Schwartz [http://searchengineland.com/yoast-wordpress-seo-plugin-vulnerable-to-hackers-216656 \"Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin Vulnerable To Hackers\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211201247/http://searchengineland.com/yoast-wordpress-seo-plugin-vulnerable-to-hackers-216656 |date=February 11, 2016 }}, Retrieved on February 13, 2016.</ref>\n\nIn January 2017, security auditors at Sucuri identified a vulnerability in the WordPress [[REST API]] that would allow any unauthenticated user to modify any post or page within a site running WordPress 4.7 or greater.

Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content.

Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress \"Appearance\" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory, for example via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://codex.wordpress.org |title=Theme Installation |publisher=Codex.wordpress.org |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426211036/http://codex.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=April 26, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[PHP]], [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] found in themes can be directly modified to alter theme behavior, or a theme can be a \"child\" theme that inherits settings from another theme and selectively overrides features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|title=Child Themes \"WordPress Codex|website=codex.wordpress.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222110349/https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes|archive-date=February 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers. WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes. The free theme Underscores created by the WordPress developers has become a popular basis for new themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |title=Introduction To Underscores: A WordPress Starter Theme With Konstantin Obenland |first=Jeff |last=Chandler |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819111713/https://wptavern.com/introduction-to-underscores-a-wordpress-starter-theme-with-konstantin-obenland |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Plugins ===\nWordPress' [[plugin (computing)|plugin]] architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or blog.

However, this does not include the premium plugins that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from [[search engine optimization|search engine optimization (SEO)]], to [[client portal]]s used to display private information to logged in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of [[GUI widget|widgets]] and [[navigation bar]]s. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.\n\nWeb developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.\n\n=== Mobile applications ===\nPhone apps for WordPress exist for [[WebOS]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for WebOS |work=WordPress |accessdate=March 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zrM7ZQpF?url=https://webos.wordpress.org/ |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Android (operating system)|Android]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |title=WordPress publishes native Android application |publisher=Android and Me |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721081639/http://androidandme.com/2010/02/news/wordpress-publishes-native-android-application/ |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[iOS]] (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad),<ref name=\"altafsayani\">{{cite web |url=http://www.altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch/ |title=Idea: WordPress App For iPhone and iPod Touch |work=WordPress iPhone & iPod Touch |date=July 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314142538/http://altafsayani.com/2008/07/12/wordpress-app-for-iphone-and-ipod-touch |archive-date=March 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|url=https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|title=18 Million WordPress Blogs Land on the iPad|date=March 24, 2011|work=ReadWriteWeb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123112140/https://readwrite.com/2011/03/23/18_million_wordpress_blogs_land_on_the_ipad/|archive-date=November 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Windows Phone]], and [[BlackBerry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |title=WordPress for BlackBerry |work=WordPress |accessdate=December 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20131106094925/http://blackberry.wordpress.org/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> These applications, designed by [[Automattic]], have options such as adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats.<ref name=\"altafsayani\" /><ref name=\"post\" />\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nThe [[WordPress Accessibility Team]] has worked to improve the accessibility for core WordPress as well as support a clear identification of accessible themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/ |title=Make WordPress Accessible |work=WordPress}}</ref> The WordPress Accessibility Team provides continuing educational support about web accessibility and inclusive design.

Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|smart quotes]]). WordPress also supports the [[Trackback]] and [[Pingback]] standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of a number of plugins that allow for a variety of customized editing features.\n\n== Multi-user and multi-blogging ==\nPrior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS adds eight new data tables for each blog.\n\nAs of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/ |title=WordPress 3.0 \"Thelonious\" |publisher=WordPress.org |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630061059/http://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/ |archive-date=June 30, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n''b2/cafelog'', more commonly known as ''b2'' or ''cafelog'', was the precursor to WordPress.<ref>{{cite video |people=Andrew Warner, [[Matt Mullenweg]] |date=September 10, 2009 |title=The Biography Of WordPress&nbsp;\u2013 With Matt Mullenweg |url=http://mixergy.com/the-biography-of-wordpress-with-matt-mullenweg/ |format=[[MPEG-4 Part 14]] |medium=Podcast |publisher=Mixergy |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |time=10:57 |quote=b2 had actually, through a series of circumstances, essentially become abandoned. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914084204/http://mixergy.com/the-biography-of-wordpress-with-matt-mullenweg/ |archive-date=September 14, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> b2/cafelog was estimated to have been installed on approximately 2,000 blogs as of May 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valdrighi |first=Michel |title=b2 test weblog \u2013 post dated 23.05.03 |url=http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=500 |accessdate=May 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522163322/http://cafelog.com/index.php?p=500 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was written in PHP for use with [[MySQL]] by Michel Valdrighi, who is now a contributing developer to WordPress.

It is especially important to keep WordPress plugins updated because would-be [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] can easily list all the plugins a site uses, and then run scans searching for any vulnerabilities against those plugins. If vulnerabilities are found, they may be exploited to allow hackers to, for example, upload their own files (such as a [[web shell]]) that collect sensitive information.\n\nDevelopers can also use tools to analyze potential vulnerabilities, including WPScan, WordPress Auditor and WordPress Sploit Framework developed by 0pc0deFR. These types of tools research known vulnerabilities, such as a [[Cross-site request forgery|CSRF]], [[Local File Inclusion|LFI]], [[File inclusion vulnerability|RFI]], [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]], SQL injection and user enumeration. However, not all vulnerabilities can be detected by tools, so it is advisable to check the code of plugins, themes and other add-ins from other developers.\n\nIn March 2015, it was reported by many security experts and SEOs, including Search Engine Land, that a [[SEO]] plugin for WordPress called [[Yoast]] which is used by more than 14 million users worldwide has a vulnerability which can lead to an exploit where hackers can do a Blind SQL injection.<ref>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2292 \"CVE-2015-2292\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614212804/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2292 |date=June 14, 2017 }}, Retrieved on July 7, 2017</ref><ref>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2293 \"CVE-2015-2293\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615040555/http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2293 |date=June 15, 2017 }}, Retrieved on July 7, 2017</ref> To fix that issue they immediately introduced a newer version 1.7.4 of the same plugin to avoid any disturbance on web because of the security lapse that the plugin had.<ref>Barry Schwartz [http://searchengineland.com/yoast-wordpress-seo-plugin-vulnerable-to-hackers-216656 \"Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin Vulnerable To Hackers\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211201247/http://searchengineland.com/yoast-wordpress-seo-plugin-vulnerable-to-hackers-216656 |date=February 11, 2016 }}, Retrieved on February 13, 2016.</ref>\n\nIn January 2017, security auditors at Sucuri identified a vulnerability in the WordPress [[REST API]] that would allow any unauthenticated user to modify any post or page within a site running WordPress 4.7 or greater.

The story features a fighting squad of six girls (Koi Koi Seven) belonging to the Gok\u014d Academy who fight daily to protect the Earth's peace and future, as well as the hopeless Tanaka Tetsuro. ''Koi Koi Seven'' was serialized in [[Akita Shoten]]\u2019s ''[[Champion Red]]'' line of magazines from 2002 to 2007. The series was adapted into a 13-episode [[anime]] television series which was broadcast between April 4, 2005 and June 26, 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nTetsuro Tanaka is transferred to Gokoh Academy full of high expectations. However, expectations fade with a bad premonition the moment he steps onto the campus and finds all the students except him are girls. A series of strange events fall upon him. Then, six girls who are called Koi Koi Seven appear as his guardians. Army combat helicopters and anti-tank guns attack Tetsuro for no particular reason as he tries to survive each day in the academy. Surrounded by many girls he gets into trouble every day because he often sees them naked, usually by mistake. In the dorm the same problem continues with the Koi Koi 7 team walking around the house in their underwear. On top of this, Celonious 28 also chases after him all the time because she wants to be with him. As well, Asuka Yayoi feels jealous of him because she loves him and she doesn't want him to hang around with other girls, which is very difficult because he is the only boy in the school and the girls are after him all the time. In general each girl of the Koi Koi 7 team has secret feelings for Tetsuro but they don't show them.\n\n== Characters ==\n;{{nihongo|Tetsuro Tanaka|\u7530\u4e2d \u54f2\u6717|Tanaka Tetsur\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Tai]]}}\n:Tetsuro becomes the focus of attention for the entire school as he is the only male student. He can't seem to remember the reason why Yayoi always wants to be with him. He also comes to a difficult situation when by mistake he looks at the bra and panties of his roommates. Finally he has feelings for each girl of the Koi Koi Seven's team but he cannot show them for fear of the girls' anger.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yayoi Asuka|\u98db\u9ce5 \u30e4\u30e8\u30a4|Asuka Yayoi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Got\u014d]]}}\n: The main heroine of the story. She is part of a group of girls who call themselves the \"Koi Koi 7\". She had apparently known Tetsuro when they were younger. She claims to have a reason for wanting to be with him all the time. She likes crab bread, a trait which is often exploited by Gokoh Five. She also has the ability to fly and has white angel like wings. However, sometimes she becomes annoying to Tetsuro which led him to ignore her.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sakuya Kazamatsuri|\u98a8\u796d \u30b5\u30af\u30e4|Kazamatsuri Sakuya}}\n:{{voiced by|Ayako It\u014d}}\n: She is one of Tetsuro's roommates. She is an expert at many firearms and often is seen pulling them out of nowhere (including a bazooka). She's the most talkative and the one that always gets on to Tetsuro. She calls Tetsuro <<kinky>> and tries to express her feelings for him with kinky ideas herself. She always feels comfortable and she doesn't mind walking around naked even if Tetsuro is in front of her. These make her the main sexy character in Tetsuro's imagination.  She also has a tendency to smoke and skip classes making others believe she is a delinquent.\n\n;{{nihongo|Miyabi Tsukuyomi|\u6708\u8aad \u30df\u30e4\u30d3|Tsukuyomi Miyabi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Akiko Kawase (actress)|Akiko Kawase]]}}\n:She is another roommate of Tetsuro. She can use her hair to form a nearly-impenetrable shield or as an attack weapon. She is very popular in the school even though she finds it annoying. In the anime her background remains a mystery, it only shows her cutting her wrist and blood is flowing out. She believes that Tetsuro is different from the other boys because he always cares for her. In other words, she also has feelings for him.  She also has expressed a lack of caring for the lives of the other Koi Koi Seven like grabbing them around the throat with her hair and pulling them along because they are too slow.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hifumi Inokai|\u732a\u98fc \u30d2\u30d5\u30df|Inokai Hifumi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kimiko Koyama]]}}\n:Another one of Tetsuro's roommates. Rivalling Otome for the most flat chest, she is normally calm until provoked. She is the only one who is stronger than Akiwo. She tends the school [[garden]] commonly and is generally good friends with Akiwo. She had been very unfair with Tetsuro while she knocked him down because he saw her butt by mistake.\n\n;{{nihongo|Akiwo Suzuka|\u9234\u9e7f \u30a2\u30ad\u30f2|Suzuka Akiwo}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bko Gibu]]}}\n: Another one of Tetsuro's roommates. She is very busty and has orange hair. She has \"Superman-like\" powers like super strength and the ability to [[fly]]. But she has mentioned that she has not always been like this. She told Tetsuro that she used to be someone who was very weak and had to be rescued all the time. She explained that she kept telling herself that she should change. She is also a huge fan of \"Kinorangers\", which is most likely a Parody of the 1980 Super sentai series [[Denshi Sentai Denjiman]] since their suits resembles the Denjiman Suits.  She was the one to come up with the name Koi Koi 7. She believes that each person can become strong. So she felt proud of Tetsuro when he shot the kinky monster. After that she started to have feelings for him too.  She often goes off on her own.\n\n;{{nihongo|Otome Chono|\u8776\u91ce \u30aa\u30c8\u30e1|Chono Otome}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bna Inamura]]}}\n: Another one of Tetsuro's roommates. She has a very calm personality which makes her less aggressive than the other girls in the group. In the anime she has been seen \"charging up\" using a plug during breakfast, also in the group she is the person who gives the orders and information to the rest of the group after analyzing the data. Otome's comments often include words like \"incomprehensible,\" making her \"robot-like.\" Later in the anime she is revealed to be a [[robot]]. Even though she is a robot, she still dreams and has feelings like the feelings she has for Tetsuro, even though she cannot even comprehend those feelings herself. However Tetsuro made her very happy saying to her that she is an absolutely normal girl.  She wears large ribbons in her hair.\n\n;Kozoma :(people who joined the school in their senior year) This group includes all six girls in the Koi Koi 7, plus Tetsuro.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yayoi Asuka (Celonius 28)|\u30a2\u30b9\u30ab\u30e4\u30e8\u30a4 (\u30bb\u30ed\u30cb\u30a2\u30b928\u53f7)|}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nana Mizuki]]}}\n:A mysterious girl with an eyepatch. She believes that she is the real Yayoi that Tetsuro met in his past, due to being a part of a nationwide security system designed to watch and protect Yayoi and  Tetsuro. She was then rebuilt as a [[gynoid]] and through the events of the story was mostly destroyed. With all her memory erased she is rebuilt as a robot but in a much younger form (much like Otome as she is in her spare body), now called Gantai she has the mentality of a child. Early on she thought that nobody loved her, but Tetsuro changes her mind showing her that everyone loves her. After that she tries to take care of Tetsuro and make him happy.

Still not satisfied, Miya reactivates her mecha, merging all five into a super-robot, only to be  humiliated by a malfunction.\n\nCelonius 28 makes her first appearance, floating alone in the pool, calling Tetsuro's name.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 03\n| NumParts            = 2\n| Title_1             = Special Effects Are On Fire!\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Tokusatsu Jimoe (Geki Faiy\u0101)!\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u7279\u64ae\u6fc0\u71c3(\u30b2\u30ad\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc)\uff01\n| Title_2             = Beyond Akiwo\u2019s Heart\u2026What?\n| TranslitTitle_2     = Akiwo, Kokoro no Mukou ni\u2026desu~\n| NativeTitle_2       = \u30a2\u30ad\u30f2\u3001\u5fc3\u306e\u5411\u3053\u3046\u306b\u2026\u3067\u3059\uff5e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2005|4|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = Garbed as one of her favorite cartoon heroes, Akiwo battles the nefarious Sailor-Bloomer Mask, a vacuum-equipped villain who sucks the [[Japanese school uniform#Sailor outfit|uniforms]] off of unsuspecting high school girls, leaving them screaming in their underwear.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 04\n| NumParts            = 2\n| Title_1             = Beautiful Flowers Are Soon Picked!\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Bijinhakumei!?\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u7f8e\u4eba\u8584\u547d\uff01\uff1f\n| Title_2             = What Is Otome's Daydream?\n| TranslitTitle_2     = Otome-chan wa Nani o Yumemiru? desu~\n| NativeTitle_2       = \u30f2\u30c8\u30e1\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u4f55\u3092\u5922\u307f\u308b\uff1f\u3067\u3059\uff5e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2005|4|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = It rains.

The story features a fighting squad of six girls (Koi Koi Seven) belonging to the Gok\u014d Academy who fight daily to protect the Earth's peace and future, as well as the hopeless Tanaka Tetsuro. ''Koi Koi Seven'' was serialized in [[Akita Shoten]]\u2019s ''[[Champion Red]]'' line of magazines from 2002 to 2007. The series was adapted into a 13-episode [[anime]] television series which was broadcast between April 4, 2005 and June 26, 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nTetsuro Tanaka is transferred to Gokoh Academy full of high expectations. However, expectations fade with a bad premonition the moment he steps onto the campus and finds all the students except him are girls. A series of strange events fall upon him. Then, six girls who are called Koi Koi Seven appear as his guardians. Army combat helicopters and anti-tank guns attack Tetsuro for no particular reason as he tries to survive each day in the academy. Surrounded by many girls he gets into trouble every day because he often sees them naked, usually by mistake. In the dorm the same problem continues with the Koi Koi 7 team walking around the house in their underwear. On top of this, Celonious 28 also chases after him all the time because she wants to be with him. As well, Asuka Yayoi feels jealous of him because she loves him and she doesn't want him to hang around with other girls, which is very difficult because he is the only boy in the school and the girls are after him all the time. In general each girl of the Koi Koi 7 team has secret feelings for Tetsuro but they don't show them.\n\n== Characters ==\n;{{nihongo|Tetsuro Tanaka|\u7530\u4e2d \u54f2\u6717|Tanaka Tetsur\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Tai]]}}\n:Tetsuro becomes the focus of attention for the entire school as he is the only male student. He can't seem to remember the reason why Yayoi always wants to be with him. He also comes to a difficult situation when by mistake he looks at the bra and panties of his roommates. Finally he has feelings for each girl of the Koi Koi Seven's team but he cannot show them for fear of the girls' anger.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yayoi Asuka|\u98db\u9ce5 \u30e4\u30e8\u30a4|Asuka Yayoi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Got\u014d]]}}\n: The main heroine of the story. She is part of a group of girls who call themselves the \"Koi Koi 7\". She had apparently known Tetsuro when they were younger. She claims to have a reason for wanting to be with him all the time. She likes crab bread, a trait which is often exploited by Gokoh Five. She also has the ability to fly and has white angel like wings. However, sometimes she becomes annoying to Tetsuro which led him to ignore her.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sakuya Kazamatsuri|\u98a8\u796d \u30b5\u30af\u30e4|Kazamatsuri Sakuya}}\n:{{voiced by|Ayako It\u014d}}\n: She is one of Tetsuro's roommates. She is an expert at many firearms and often is seen pulling them out of nowhere (including a bazooka). She's the most talkative and the one that always gets on to Tetsuro. She calls Tetsuro <<kinky>> and tries to express her feelings for him with kinky ideas herself. She always feels comfortable and she doesn't mind walking around naked even if Tetsuro is in front of her. These make her the main sexy character in Tetsuro's imagination.  She also has a tendency to smoke and skip classes making others believe she is a delinquent.\n\n;{{nihongo|Miyabi Tsukuyomi|\u6708\u8aad \u30df\u30e4\u30d3|Tsukuyomi Miyabi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Akiko Kawase (actress)|Akiko Kawase]]}}\n:She is another roommate of Tetsuro. She can use her hair to form a nearly-impenetrable shield or as an attack weapon. She is very popular in the school even though she finds it annoying. In the anime her background remains a mystery, it only shows her cutting her wrist and blood is flowing out. She believes that Tetsuro is different from the other boys because he always cares for her. In other words, she also has feelings for him.  She also has expressed a lack of caring for the lives of the other Koi Koi Seven like grabbing them around the throat with her hair and pulling them along because they are too slow.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hifumi Inokai|\u732a\u98fc \u30d2\u30d5\u30df|Inokai Hifumi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kimiko Koyama]]}}\n:Another one of Tetsuro's roommates. Rivalling Otome for the most flat chest, she is normally calm until provoked. She is the only one who is stronger than Akiwo. She tends the school [[garden]] commonly and is generally good friends with Akiwo. She had been very unfair with Tetsuro while she knocked him down because he saw her butt by mistake.\n\n;{{nihongo|Akiwo Suzuka|\u9234\u9e7f \u30a2\u30ad\u30f2|Suzuka Akiwo}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bko Gibu]]}}\n: Another one of Tetsuro's roommates. She is very busty and has orange hair. She has \"Superman-like\" powers like super strength and the ability to [[fly]]. But she has mentioned that she has not always been like this. She told Tetsuro that she used to be someone who was very weak and had to be rescued all the time. She explained that she kept telling herself that she should change. She is also a huge fan of \"Kinorangers\", which is most likely a Parody of the 1980 Super sentai series [[Denshi Sentai Denjiman]] since their suits resembles the Denjiman Suits.  She was the one to come up with the name Koi Koi 7. She believes that each person can become strong. So she felt proud of Tetsuro when he shot the kinky monster. After that she started to have feelings for him too.  She often goes off on her own.\n\n;{{nihongo|Otome Chono|\u8776\u91ce \u30aa\u30c8\u30e1|Chono Otome}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bna Inamura]]}}\n: Another one of Tetsuro's roommates. She has a very calm personality which makes her less aggressive than the other girls in the group. In the anime she has been seen \"charging up\" using a plug during breakfast, also in the group she is the person who gives the orders and information to the rest of the group after analyzing the data. Otome's comments often include words like \"incomprehensible,\" making her \"robot-like.\" Later in the anime she is revealed to be a [[robot]]. Even though she is a robot, she still dreams and has feelings like the feelings she has for Tetsuro, even though she cannot even comprehend those feelings herself.

Somehow Mifumi remembers Akio's name long enough to scream for help, but her personality is not restored until she eats the raw mandoragora.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| NumParts            = 2\n| Title_1             = A Gorgeous Party!?\n| TranslitTitle_1     = Shuchinikurin!?\n| NativeTitle_1       = \u9152\u6c60\u8089\u6797\uff01\uff1f\n| Title_2             = Miya Explodes!

Despite the high-rise development of the central business district, the cathedral's imposing structure and twin spires make it a landmark from every direction. In 2008, St Mary's Cathedral became the focus of [[World Youth Day 2008]] and was visited by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] who consecrated the new forward altar. The cathedral was designed by [[William Wardell]] and built from 1866 to 1928. It is also known as '''St Mary's Catholic Cathedral and Chapter House''', '''Saint Mary's Cathedral''' and '''St Mary's Cathedral'''.

Many of the people to arrive in Sydney at that time were military, some with wives and family; there were also some free settlers. The first chaplain of the colony was the Reverend [[Richard Johnson (chaplain)|Richard Johnson]] of the [[Church of England]]. No specific provision was made for the religious needs of those many convicts and settlers who were Roman Catholics. To redress this, an [[Irish Catholic]] priest, a Father O'Flynn, travelled to the colony of New South Wales but, as he arrived without government sanction, he was sent home.\n\nIt was not until 1820 that two priests, Father Conolly and Father [[John Therry]], arrived to officially minister to the Roman Catholics in Australia. Father Conolly went to Tasmania and Father Therry remained in Sydney. Therry claimed that, on the day of his arrival, he had a vision of a mighty church of golden stone dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] raising its twin spires above the city of Sydney.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19710926&id=IQRkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KuUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2352,9716840&hl=en | title=A threat to the bells of St Mary's | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=26 September 1971 | agency=Fairfax Media | accessdate=2 May 2016 | author=Freeman, James}}</ref> This vision came to pass, but not until after 180 years and three intermediate buildings.\n\n===One church after another===\n[[File:Roman Catholic Church, Hyde Park, Sydney.jpg|thumb|left|The first St Mary's, Hyde Park, 1840s]]\n[[File:Construction, St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of St. Mary's Cathedral, 1920s. The spires would not be added until the 2000s.]]\nFather Therry applied for a grant of land on which to build a church. He asked for land on the western side of Sydney, towards [[Darling Harbour]]. But the land allocated to him was towards the East, adjacent to a number of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s building projects, the hospital of 1811, the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] and [[St. James Church, Sydney|St James']] Anglican church which was also used as a law court. The site for the Catholic church overlooked a barren area upon which the bricks for Macquarie's buildings were made. The area is now Hyde Park, with avenues of trees and the Archibald Fountain.\n\nThe foundation stone for the first St Mary's was laid on 29 October 1821 by Governor Macquarie. Built by [[James Dempsey (builder)|James Dempsey]], it was a simple cruciform stone structure which paid homage to the rising fashion for the [[Neo Gothic|Gothic]] style in its pointed windows and pinnacles. In 1835, [[John Polding]] became the first archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia. In 1851 the church was modified to the designs of [[Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Father Therry died on 25 May 1864. On 29 June 1865, the church caught fire and was destroyed.\n\nThe then archdeacon, Father McEnroe, immediately set about planning and fund raising in order to build the present cathedral, based upon a plan drawn up by Archbishop Polding. Polding wrote to [[William Wardell]], a pupil of [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], the most prominent architect of the [[Gothic Revival]] movement. Polding was impressed with Wardell's building of [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. In his letter, Polding gives Wardell a completely free hand in the design, saying ''\"Any plan, any style, anything that is beautiful and grand, to the extent of our power.\"''<ref>Polding's letter to Wardell, 10 October 1865</ref> Wardell had also designed and commenced work on [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]] in 1858.\n\nThere were to be two intermediate stages. A temporary wooden church was constructed, which was also destroyed by fire in the summer of 1869. The third temporary provision was a sturdy brick building on the site, not of the cathedral but of St Mary's School, which it was to serve long after the present structure was in use.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney HDR.jpg|thumb|left|Main front, facing south]]\nArchbishop Polding laid the foundation stone for the present cathedral in 1868.<ref>B. McAteer, The laying of the foundation stone of St Mary's Cathedral 1868, ''Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society'' 19 (1998), 7-8.</ref> It was to be a huge and ambitious structure with a wide nave and aisle and three towers. Polding did not live to see it in use as he died in 1877. Five years later, on 8 September 1882, his successor, [[Roger Vaughan|Archbishop Vaughan]], presided at the dedication Mass. Archbishop Vaughan gave the peal of bells which were rung for the first time on that day. Vaughan died while in England in 1883.\n\nThe cathedral's builder (for this stage) was [[John Young (building contractor)|John Young]], who also built a large sandstone house in the [[Gothic Revival]] style, known as \"[[The Abbey, Annandale|The Abbey]]\", in [[Annandale, New South Wales]].<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/35</ref>\n\nBut St Mary's was still far from finished, the work proceeding under [[Patrick Francis Moran|Cardinal Moran]]. In 1913 [[Michael Kelly (bishop)|Archbishop Kelly]] laid the foundation stone for the nave, which continued under the architects [[Hennessy & Hennessy|Hennessy, Hennessy and Co]]. In 1928 Kelly dedicated the nave in time for the commencement of the 29th [[International Eucharistic Congress]]. A slight difference of colour and texture of the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] on the internal walls marks the division between the first and second stage of building.\n\nFollowing the death in office of Prime Minister [[Joseph Lyons]] in April 1939, he lay in state at St Mary's for several days before being taken to his home town of [[Devonport, Tasmania]], for burial.<ref>{{cite book|first=Anne|last=Henderson|authorlink=Anne Henderson|title=Joseph Lyons: THe People's Prime Minister|year=2011|publisher=UNSW Press|page=430}}</ref>\n\nThe decoration and enrichment of the cathedral continued with the remains of [[Roger Vaughan|Archbishop Vaughan]] being returned to Sydney and buried within the Chapel of the [[St Patrick|Irish Saints]]. The richly decorated crypt which enshrines the bodies of many of the early priests and bishops was not completed until 1961 when it was dedicated by [[Norman Thomas Gilroy|Cardinal Gilroy]].\n\nFor many years the two squared-off towers of the fa\u00e7ade gave a disappointing appearance to an otherwise-elegant building.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was from time to time suggested pinnacles should be put up to match the central tower as it appeared plain that William Wardell's proposed spires would never be built. But with the assistance of a grant from the Government to mark the new millennium, the spires were eventually built in 2000.\n\n===Since 2000===\nIn 2008, St Mary's Cathedral became the focus of [[World Youth Day 2008]] and was visited by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] who, in his homily on 19 July, made the historic full apology for [[child sex abuse]] by Catholic priests in Australia, of whom 107 have been committed by the courts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtGYmNq72j_-TNnXfLbSdMgiTPMQ?hl=en |title=Pope apologises for 'evil' of child sex abuse |work=Agence France-Presse |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112181810/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtGYmNq72j_-TNnXfLbSdMgiTPMQ?hl=en |archivedate=12 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/burningIssues/idUKSYD1805020080719 |title=Pope apologises for Church sex abuse |work=Reuters UK |date=19 July 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |author=Pullella, Philip |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112043747/http://uk.reuters.com/article/burningIssues/idUKSYD1805020080719 |archivedate=12 January 2009 }}</ref> On 16 December 2014, Archbishop [[Anthony Fisher]] invoked the special prayers in the [[Roman Missal]] from the \"mass in times of civil disturbance\" for the victims of the [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chilling terror act brought central Sydney to a halt|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/story-e6frg71x-1227157249902|publisher=The Australian|date=16 December 2014|access-date=3 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217094407/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/story-e6frg71x-1227157249902|archive-date=17 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A memorial service was held at the cathedral on the morning of 19 December for Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, in attendance were the Governor-General [[Peter Cosgrove]], then-Minister of Communications [[Malcolm Turnbull]], Senator [[Arthur Sinodinos]], Premier of New South Wales [[Mike Baird]], and then-Minister of Transport [[Gladys Berejiklian]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/sydney-siege/sydney-siege-hell-has-touched-us/news-story/5dc434662461901a56148d1338d55e2c | title=Sydney siege: \u2019Hell has touched us\u2019 | work=The Australian | date=16 December 2014 | agency=News Corp Australia | accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/news-story/7eb7fc591dda5371339aa5fdbac55ab0 | title=Chilling terror act brought central Sydney to a halt | work=The Australian | date=16 December 2014 | agency=News Corp Australia | accessdate=3 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512210624/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/news-story/7eb7fc591dda5371339aa5fdbac55ab0 | archive-date=12 May 2017 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kerin|first1=Lindy|title=Memorial service at St Mary's Cathedral for Sydney hostage victims|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4151947.htm|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=19 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112044056/http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4151947.htm|archive-date=12 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:S\u00eddney-Australia42.JPG|thumb|left|upright=2|View from the [[Sydney Tower]].]]\n\n===Plan===\nSt Mary's Cathedral is unusual among large cathedrals in that, because of its size, the plan of the city around it and the fall of the land, it is oriented in a north\u2013south direction rather than the usual east\u2013west. The liturgical East End is at the north and the West Front is to the south.\n\nThe plan of the cathedral is a conventional English cathedral plan, cruciform in shape, with a tower over the crossing of the nave and transepts and twin towers at the West Front (in this case, the south). The chancel is square-ended, like the chancels of [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]], [[York Minster|York]] and several other English cathedrals. There are three processional doors in the south with additional entrances conveniently placed in the transept facades so that they lead from [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and from the presbytery buildings and school adjacent the cathedral.\n\n===Style===\nThe architecture is typical of the Gothic Revival of the 19th century, inspired by the journals of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], the writings of [[John Ruskin]] and the architecture of [[Augustus Welby Pugin]]. At the time that the foundation stone was laid, the architect [[Edmund Blacket]] had just completed Sydney's very much smaller Anglican cathedral in the [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style and the Main Building of Sydney University. St Mary's, when William Wardell's plan was realised, was to be a much larger, more imposing and more sombre structure than the smaller [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's]] and, because of its fortuitous siting, still dominates many views of the city despite the high-rise buildings.\n\nThe style of the cathedral is [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Geometric Decorated Gothic]], the archaeological antecedent being the ecclesiastical architecture of late 13th century England. It is based fairly closely on the style of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tracery of the huge chancel window being almost a replica of that at Lincoln.\n\n===Exterior===\n[[File:St Mary's Cathedral from the north-west.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|The cathedral seen from the north-west]]\nThe lateral view of the building from Hyde Park is marked by the regular progression of Gothic windows with pointed arches and simple tracery. The upper roofline is finished with a pierced parapet, broken by decorative gables above the clerestorey windows, above which rises a steeply pitched slate roof with many small dormers in the French manner. The roofline of the aisles is decorated with carved bosses between the sturdy buttresses which support flying [[buttress]]es to the [[clerestorey]].\n\nFacing Hyde Park, the transept provides the usual mode of public entrance, as is common in many French cathedrals, and has richly decorated doors which, unlike those of the main front, have had their carved details completed and demonstrate the skills of local craftsmen in both designing and carving in the Gothic style. Included in the foliate bosses are Australian native plants such as the [[waratah]], [[floral emblem]] of [[New South Wales]].\n\nSt Mary's Cathedral is generally approached on foot from the city through Hyde Park, where the transept front and central tower rise up behind the [[Archibald Fountain]]. During the 20th century the gardeners of Hyde Park have further enhanced the vista by laying out a garden on the cathedral side of the park in which the plantings have often taken the form of a cross.\n\nDespite the many English features of the architecture including its interior and chancel termination, the entrance fa\u00e7ade is not English at all. It is a design loosely based on the most famous of all Gothic west fronts, that of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] with its balance of vertical and horizontal features, its three huge portals and its central rose window. There are two more large [[rose window]]s, one in each of the transepts. The French fa\u00e7ade was, however, intended to have twin stone spires like those of [[Lichfield Cathedral]], but they were not to be put in place until 132 years after the building was commenced.\n\n[[File:The south facing main front of St Mary's Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The south facing main front of St Mary's Cathedral]]\nThe crossing tower, which holds the bells, is quite stocky but its silhouette is made elegant by the provision of tall crocketted pinnacles. The completed spires of the main front enhance the view of the cathedral along College Street and particularly the ceremonial approach from the flight of stairs in front of the cathedral. Standing at {{convert|74.6|m|ft}}, they make St Mary's the fourth tallest church in Australia, after the triple-spired [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]], [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne]] and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bendigo]].\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:St Mary's Cathedral adjusted.JPG|thumb|upright=2|left|Interior during a Mass in 2009]]\nIn cross-section the cathedral is typical of most large churches in having a high central nave and an aisle on either side, which serve to buttress the nave and provide passage around the interior. The interior of the nave thus rises in three stages, the arcade, the gallery and the clerestory which has windows to light the nave. See [[cathedral diagram]]\nThe building is of golden-coloured sandstone which has weathered externally to golden-brown. The roof is of red cedar, that of the nave being of an open arch-braced construction enlivened by decorative pierced carvings. The chancel is vaulted with timber, which was probably intended to be richly decorated in red, blue and gold after the manner of the wooden roof at Peterborough, but this did not eventuate, and the warm colour of the timber contrasts well with the stonework.\n\nThe side aisles are vaulted in stone, with a large round boss at the centre of each ribbed vault. Children who, over the years, have crawled into the arched space beneath the pulpit have discovered another such beautiful carved boss, in miniature and usually unseen. On all the terminals of arches within the buildings are carved heads of saints. Those that are near the [[confessional]]s are at eye-level and may be examined for their details.\n\nThe screen behind the high altar is delicately carved in [[Oamaru limestone]] from New Zealand. It contains niches filled with statues like the similar niches in the [[altar of Our Lady]] located directly behind it. There are two large chapels and two smaller ones, the larger being the Chapel of the [[Sacred Heart]] and the Chapel of the Irish Saints. On either side of the Lady Chapel are the Chapels of Ss [[St Joseph|Joseph]] and [[St Peter|Peter]] all with ornately carved altars and a small statue in each niche. The embellished mosaics in the Kelly Chapel floor were laid by Melocco Co in 1937 approximately the same time as the mosaic floor in the Lady Chapel of [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]] also designed by Wardell.\n[[File:St. Mary's Cathedral - Sydney - Stained Glass - 018 - Detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The chancel window depicts a vision of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary enthroned in Heaven.]]\n\n===Lighting===\nBecause of the brightness of Australian sunlight, it was decided at the time of construction to glaze the [[clerestory]] with yellow glass. This glazing has darkened over the years, permitting little light to enter. The yellow glazing contrasts with the predominantly blue stained glass of the lower windows. To counteract the darkness, the cathedral installed extensive lighting in the 1970s, designed to give more-or-less equal illumination to all parts of the buildings. The interior is lit with a diffuse yellow glow, which, like the upper windows, is in contrast to the effects of the natural light which penetrates through the white areas of the stained glass. The installed lighting counteracts the pattern of light and shade that would normally exists in a cathedral of the Gothic style by illuminating most brightly those parts of the structure which would normally be subdued.\n\n===Stained glass===\nThe cathedral's stained glass is all the work of [[Hardman & Co.]] and covers a period of about 50 years.\n\nThere are about 40 pictorial windows representing several themes and culminating in the chancel window showing the [[Fall of Man]] and Mary, crowned and enthroned beside Jesus as he sits in judgement, pleading Jesus' mercy upon Christians.\n\nOther windows include the mysteries of the [[rosary]], the [[Nativity of Christ|birth]] and childhood of Jesus and [[lives of the saints]]. Stylistically, the windows move from the [[Gothic Revival]] of the 19th century to a more painterly and lavish style of the early 20th century.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Details of the architecture\" heights=\"170px\" widths=\"250px\">\nFile:StMarysCathedral Carving.JPG|Carvings around the transept portal include Australian flora\nFile:StMarysCathedral AisleVault.JPG|The aisles have ribbed stone vaulting with carved bosses\nFile:St Marys Cathedral Nave.JPG|The ceiling of the central bell tower is of painted oak\nFile:St Mary's Cathedral The sanctuary 201708.jpg|The sanctuary prepared for a service\n</gallery>\n\n==Treasures==\nSt Mary's is full of treasures and devotional objects. Around the walls of the aisles are located the [[Stations of the Cross]], painted in oils by L. Chovet of Paris and selected for St Mary's by Cardinal Moran in 1885. In the western transept is a marble replica of Michelangelo's [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]], the original of which is in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome. This sculpture was brought to Australia for display in David Jones Ltd. department store and was later donated to the cathedral.\n\nLocated previously in the crypt, where it was touched in the evening by the setting sun, was the Grave of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier]], a realistic depiction of a dead soldier sculpted by [[George Washington Lambert]]. Although previously visible to the public from above, the tomb has now been moved into the aisle of the cathedral, to give the public greater access to it.\n\nThe crypt has an extensive mosaic floor, the achievement of Peter Melocco and his firm. This design has as its foundation a cross elaborately decorated like a vast [[Celtic Art|Celtic]] [[illuminated manuscript]], with rondels showing the [[Genesis creation myth|Days of Creation]] and the titles of the Virgin Mary.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Treasures of the cathedral\" heights=\"210px\" widths=\"260px\">\nFile:St. Mary's Cathedral - Sydney - Painting - 10.jpg|[[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] from the [[Stations of the Cross]] by L.

Of two manuals and 23 stops, it was the largest organ in Australia until its destruction by fire in 1865.\n* In 1942 a pipe organ built by [[Joseph Howell Whitehouse]] of Brisbane, (1874\u20131954), was installed in the gallery at the end of the nave, above the main door.\n* Between 1959 and 1971 [[Ronald Sharp]] (b. 1929) installed an electric-action pipe organ in the triforium gallery of the sanctuary, but this was never completed. This is only used for the weekly Novena Mass in the Lady Chapel.\n* In 1997 a new [[pipe organ]] was built by [[Orgues L\u00e9tourneau]] of Saint Hyacinthe, Quebec, and installed on a new gallery built around the rose window in the western transept. It was completed in 1999 and dedicated by Cardinal Clancy. The L\u00e9tourneau organ is of three manuals and 46 stops. In addition to being played from the gallery, it may be played with the Whitehouse organ, from a four-manual mobile electronic console located at floor level. \n* There is a Rodgers digital organ in the quire, which accompanies the daily choral liturgies. \n* There is an organ in the crypt, made by Bellsham Pipe Organs (1985), which is used for liturgies within the crypt.\n{{-}}\n\n===Choirs===\nThere are two choirs that sing liturgically at the cathedral. The Cathedral Choir sings almost daily. There is also a voluntary adult choir, the St Mary's Singers, which sings regularly for services and occasional concerts.\n\n====St Mary's Cathedral Choir====\nBegun in the 19th century as a mixed voice choir, the [[St Mary's Cathedral Choir, Sydney|St Mary's Cathedral Choir]] has been a traditional English-style cathedral choir of men and boys since 1955. There are usually 24 choristers (boy trebles and altos) and 12 lay clerks (professional countertenors, tenors and basses). The choir sings Mass and Vespers daily (excluding Friday) and is the oldest continuous musical institution in Australia.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/city-east/tv-talent-shows-have-nothing-on-the-st-marys-cathedral-choir-when-it-comes-to-uncovering-our-young-singing-stars/news-story/59b975b87e200397512a686889bf9817 | title=TV talent shows have nothing on the St Mary's Cathedral Choir when it comes to uncovering our young singing stars | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=31 July 2014 | agency=News Corp Australia | accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref> They perform works ranging from [[Gregorian Chant]], [[Polyphony#Western Europe and Roman Catholicism|Sacred Polyphony]] and Renaissance compositions to 21st century compositions.\n\n====Cathedral Scholars====\nChoristers from the Cathedral Choir whose voices have broken continue their training as part of this special ensemble.

There have been three separate [[ring of bells|rings of bells]] at the cathedral, all cast by the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] of London. The first, of eight bells, arrived in Sydney in August 1843, and were installed in a wooden campanile located away from the main building (approximately where the pulpit is today). They were the first bells hung for [[change ringing]] in Australia and rang for the first time on New Year's Day 1844. When the cathedral was destroyed by fire in June 1865, the bells escaped damage. Construction of new cathedral began in 1866, and during 1868 the bells were removed from the campanile and installed in the new tower, which was situated where the south-western tower now stands. In 1881 the bells were traded in for a new ring of eight which were installed the following year (the Whitechapel Foundry was then using the name Mears & Stainbank). In 1885 a contract was signed for the construction of the Central Tower (the Moran Tower) to which the bells were transferred in 1898.\n\nA century later an entirely new ring was ordered. Today the Central Tower houses a ring of twelve bells, plus two additional bells which allow alternative groups of bells to be rung, depending on the number and skill of the ringers available.<ref>[http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Sydney&DoveID=SYDNEY+++R Sydney, Basilica of S Mary] in [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]].

The bells are rung regularly before Solemn Mass on Sundays and on major feast days. They are also rung by arrangement for weddings and funerals and to mark important civic occasions. The bells of St Mary's were heard leading the ringing which marked the centenary of Australian Federation. They are also rung as part of the finale to Sydney's [[Symphony in the Domain]] concert in January, in unison with [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]]. The ringing and care of the bells is entrusted to the St Mary's Basilica Society of Change Ringers, members of [[The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bell ringers|url=http://www.stmaryscathedral.org.au/get-involved/bell-ringers.html|publisher=St Mary's Cathedral|accessdate=3 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308180026/http://www.stmaryscathedral.org.au/get-involved/bell-ringers.html|archive-date=8 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Caitlin|title=The Bell Ringers of St. Mary's|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/intothemusic/the-bell-ringers-of-st-mary27s/5357220|work=Into The Music|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|accessdate=9 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409181823/http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/intothemusic/the-bell-ringers-of-st-mary27s/5357220|archive-date=9 April 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n[[File:SaintMarys CathedralSydney.jpg|thumb|center|450px|Panorama of the interior of St Mary's, showing views into the chancel and the transepts]]\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 30 September 2003, the cathedral site is the oldest place maintaining its use as a place of worship for the Catholic community in Australia. It is the site of the original St Mary's Cathedral, the first Catholic church in Australia and is the first land granted to the Catholic Church in Australia. It also the oldest permanent place of residence of Catholic clergy and can be said to be the birthplace of Catholicism in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\nThe cathedral is associated with significant figures in the history of the Catholic Church in Australia, notably with Father Therry, archbishops Polding and Vaughan, Cardinal Moran and Archbishop Kelly. It is also associated with important persons of the 19th and 20th centuries, including governor Macquarie and [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] and the architects Greenway, Pugin, Wardell and Hennessy. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Sydney and the mother diocese of Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\nThe cathedral is of major architectural significance as the largest 19th century ecclesiastical building in the English Gothic style anywhere in the world. The Cathedral Chapter Hall located to the east is significant as the oldest building extant on the site, possibly the oldest surviving Catholic school building in Australia and evidence to suggest an important direct involvement in its design by Pugin.<ref name=nswshr-1709/><ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1>State Projects, 1995</ref>\n\nSt Mary's Catholic Cathedral was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 3 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe cathedral site is the oldest place maintaining its use as a place of worship for the Catholic community in this country. It is the site of the original St Mary's Cathedral, the first Catholic church in Australia, which was destroyed by fire in 1865. The site is significant for being the first land granted to the Catholic Church in Australia. Being the site where Governor Macquarie laid the foundation stone of the first St Mary's, the cathedral site symbolises the reconciliation of the Catholic Church and the Australian state. The site of St Mary's Cathedral is also significant as the oldest permanent place of residence of Catholic clergy in Australia. For these reasons, the site of St Mary's Cathedral can be said to be the birthplace of Catholicism in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\nIt is the place where the International Eucharistic Congresses of 1928 and 1954 were celebrated at St Mary's. The cathedral is also where the first pope to visit Australia celebrated Mass and, through its organists and choir masters, has played an important role in the musical [[history of Sydney]]. The Cathedral Chapter Hall located to the east is significant as the oldest building extant on the site. It is possibly the oldest surviving Catholic school building in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/> The use of the Chapter Hall as a school and general purpose hall has been continuous since erection and its role as an early public meeting place is highly significant. The Chapter Hall is the oldest building on the St Mary's site.<ref name=nswshr-1709/><ref name=bennett>Bennett, 1987.</ref>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe cathedral is associated with significant figures in the history of the Catholic Church in Australia, notably with Father Therry, Archbishops Polding and Vaughan, Cardinal Moran and Archbishop Kelly, all of whom are buried in the crypt. It is also associated with important persons of the 19th and 20th centuries, including Governors Macquarie and Bourke, and architects Greenway, Pugin, Wardell and Hennessy.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/> The Chapter Hall's Gothic Revival style blends well with the cathedral and is aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-1709/><ref name=bennett/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe cathedral is sited along a ridge running north\u2013south on the eastern edge of the central area of the city and projects a dominating and inspiring presence, its roof and towers rising up above the neighbouring buildings and trees. The four arms of its plan establish axes that link it to the harbour and [[Woolloomooloo]], to [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and to College and Macquarie Streets. The long English form of the building restates and reinforces these axes, powerfully weaving the cathedral into the urban fabric. As well as providing majestic vistas from the harbour and [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], from Hyde Park and the adjacent streets, and from the elevated viewpoints of many central city buildings, the cathedral offers from within beautifully framed and precious vistas of the surrounding city. It is the largest nineteenth-century ecclesiastical building in the English archaeological Gothic style anywhere in the world. The refinement and scholarship of its composition and details are of the highest rank. Together with St Patrick's Cathedral in [[Melbourne]], St Mary's is the major ecclesiastical work of architect William Wardell, a Gothic Revival architect of international significance practising in Australia. The cathedral is a repository of many items of aesthetic significance from the stained glass windows to the altars, statues, vestments, liturgical objects, paintings and mosaics and is important as a venue for musical events and has a considerable role in the practice of bell ringing in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/><ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nSt Mary's Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Sydney and the mother diocese of Australia. In its physical and spiritual presence it proclaims the faith of the Catholic church. It is primarily a house of sacrament, prayer and worship. It is also a great civic edifice of importance to all the people of Sydney. Built on the site of the first official catholic church in the colony, the present cathedral complex links back through two centuries, without interruption, to the beginnings of the Catholic faith in Australia. It is a focus for the Catholic community of Australia, while through its musical and other artistic activities, it is an important part of the cultural life of Sydney.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/><ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nA major sandstone building in Sydney, the physical fabric of the cathedral demonstrates the quality of craft, engineering skill and sense of place achieved in yellow block sandstone structures in Victorian Sydney. The completion of the southern front end of the Cathedral by Hennessy Hennessy and Co demonstrates innovative building technology at the beginning of this century, especially in the techniques employed in the construction of the foundations and crypt.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/><ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Mary's is a rare example of the 19th century Gothic style Catholic cathedral.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/> The chapter hall is the only remaining intact building relating to John Bede Polding, the first Archbishop of Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709/><ref name=bennett/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Mary's Cathedral and Chapter House has represented the centre of Catholic worship and culture in Sydney (and arguably the State) since its construction in the 1870s.<ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Statue of St Mary of the Cross at St Mary's Cathedral.jpg|Statue of

It is located on [[College Street, Sydney|College Street]] near the eastern border of the [[Sydney central business district]] in the [[City of Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. Despite the high-rise development of the central business district, the cathedral's imposing structure and twin spires make it a landmark from every direction. In 2008, St Mary's Cathedral became the focus of [[World Youth Day 2008]] and was visited by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] who consecrated the new forward altar. The cathedral was designed by [[William Wardell]] and built from 1866 to 1928. It is also known as '''St Mary's Catholic Cathedral and Chapter House''', '''Saint Mary's Cathedral''' and '''St Mary's Cathedral'''. The property was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 3 September 2004.<ref name=nswshr-1709>{{cite NSW SHR|5055071|St. Mary's Catholic Cathedral and Chapter House|hr=01709|fn=S91/02385|accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nSydney was established as a penal settlement on [[Australia Day|26 January]] 1788 in the name of [[King George III]] by Captain [[Arthur Phillip]], for prisoners transported from Britain. Many of the people to arrive in Sydney at that time were military, some with wives and family; there were also some free settlers. The first chaplain of the colony was the Reverend [[Richard Johnson (chaplain)|Richard Johnson]] of the [[Church of England]]. No specific provision was made for the religious needs of those many convicts and settlers who were Roman Catholics. To redress this, an [[Irish Catholic]] priest, a Father O'Flynn, travelled to the colony of New South Wales but, as he arrived without government sanction, he was sent home.\n\nIt was not until 1820 that two priests, Father Conolly and Father [[John Therry]], arrived to officially minister to the Roman Catholics in Australia. Father Conolly went to Tasmania and Father Therry remained in Sydney. Therry claimed that, on the day of his arrival, he had a vision of a mighty church of golden stone dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] raising its twin spires above the city of Sydney.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19710926&id=IQRkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KuUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2352,9716840&hl=en | title=A threat to the bells of St Mary's | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=26 September 1971 | agency=Fairfax Media | accessdate=2 May 2016 | author=Freeman, James}}</ref> This vision came to pass, but not until after 180 years and three intermediate buildings.\n\n===One church after another===\n[[File:Roman Catholic Church, Hyde Park, Sydney.jpg|thumb|left|The first St Mary's, Hyde Park, 1840s]]\n[[File:Construction, St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of St. Mary's Cathedral, 1920s. The spires would not be added until the 2000s.]]\nFather Therry applied for a grant of land on which to build a church. He asked for land on the western side of Sydney, towards [[Darling Harbour]]. But the land allocated to him was towards the East, adjacent to a number of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s building projects, the hospital of 1811, the [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] and [[St. James Church, Sydney|St James']] Anglican church which was also used as a law court. The site for the Catholic church overlooked a barren area upon which the bricks for Macquarie's buildings were made. The area is now Hyde Park, with avenues of trees and the Archibald Fountain.\n\nThe foundation stone for the first St Mary's was laid on 29 October 1821 by Governor Macquarie. Built by [[James Dempsey (builder)|James Dempsey]], it was a simple cruciform stone structure which paid homage to the rising fashion for the [[Neo Gothic|Gothic]] style in its pointed windows and pinnacles. In 1835, [[John Polding]] became the first archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia. In 1851 the church was modified to the designs of [[Augustus Welby Pugin]]. Father Therry died on 25 May 1864. On 29 June 1865, the church caught fire and was destroyed.\n\nThe then archdeacon, Father McEnroe, immediately set about planning and fund raising in order to build the present cathedral, based upon a plan drawn up by Archbishop Polding. Polding wrote to [[William Wardell]], a pupil of [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], the most prominent architect of the [[Gothic Revival]] movement. Polding was impressed with Wardell's building of [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. In his letter, Polding gives Wardell a completely free hand in the design, saying ''\"Any plan, any style, anything that is beautiful and grand, to the extent of our power.\"''<ref>Polding's letter to Wardell, 10 October 1865</ref> Wardell had also designed and commenced work on [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]] in 1858.\n\nThere were to be two intermediate stages. A temporary wooden church was constructed, which was also destroyed by fire in the summer of 1869. The third temporary provision was a sturdy brick building on the site, not of the cathedral but of St Mary's School, which it was to serve long after the present structure was in use.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney HDR.jpg|thumb|left|Main front, facing south]]\nArchbishop Polding laid the foundation stone for the present cathedral in 1868.<ref>B. McAteer, The laying of the foundation stone of St Mary's Cathedral 1868, ''Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society'' 19 (1998), 7-8.</ref> It was to be a huge and ambitious structure with a wide nave and aisle and three towers. Polding did not live to see it in use as he died in 1877. Five years later, on 8 September 1882, his successor, [[Roger Vaughan|Archbishop Vaughan]], presided at the dedication Mass. Archbishop Vaughan gave the peal of bells which were rung for the first time on that day. Vaughan died while in England in 1883.\n\nThe cathedral's builder (for this stage) was [[John Young (building contractor)|John Young]], who also built a large sandstone house in the [[Gothic Revival]] style, known as \"[[The Abbey, Annandale|The Abbey]]\", in [[Annandale, New South Wales]].<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/35</ref>\n\nBut St Mary's was still far from finished, the work proceeding under [[Patrick Francis Moran|Cardinal Moran]]. In 1913 [[Michael Kelly (bishop)|Archbishop Kelly]] laid the foundation stone for the nave, which continued under the architects [[Hennessy & Hennessy|Hennessy, Hennessy and Co]]. In 1928 Kelly dedicated the nave in time for the commencement of the 29th [[International Eucharistic Congress]]. A slight difference of colour and texture of the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] on the internal walls marks the division between the first and second stage of building.\n\nFollowing the death in office of Prime Minister [[Joseph Lyons]] in April 1939, he lay in state at St Mary's for several days before being taken to his home town of [[Devonport, Tasmania]], for burial.<ref>{{cite book|first=Anne|last=Henderson|authorlink=Anne Henderson|title=Joseph Lyons: THe People's Prime Minister|year=2011|publisher=UNSW Press|page=430}}</ref>\n\nThe decoration and enrichment of the cathedral continued with the remains of [[Roger Vaughan|Archbishop Vaughan]] being returned to Sydney and buried within the Chapel of the [[St Patrick|Irish Saints]]. The richly decorated crypt which enshrines the bodies of many of the early priests and bishops was not completed until 1961 when it was dedicated by [[Norman Thomas Gilroy|Cardinal Gilroy]].\n\nFor many years the two squared-off towers of the fa\u00e7ade gave a disappointing appearance to an otherwise-elegant building.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was from time to time suggested pinnacles should be put up to match the central tower as it appeared plain that William Wardell's proposed spires would never be built. But with the assistance of a grant from the Government to mark the new millennium, the spires were eventually built in 2000.\n\n===Since 2000===\nIn 2008, St Mary's Cathedral became the focus of [[World Youth Day 2008]] and was visited by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] who, in his homily on 19 July, made the historic full apology for [[child sex abuse]] by Catholic priests in Australia, of whom 107 have been committed by the courts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtGYmNq72j_-TNnXfLbSdMgiTPMQ?hl=en |title=Pope apologises for 'evil' of child sex abuse |work=Agence France-Presse |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112181810/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtGYmNq72j_-TNnXfLbSdMgiTPMQ?hl=en |archivedate=12 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/burningIssues/idUKSYD1805020080719 |title=Pope apologises for Church sex abuse |work=Reuters UK |date=19 July 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |author=Pullella, Philip |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112043747/http://uk.reuters.com/article/burningIssues/idUKSYD1805020080719 |archivedate=12 January 2009 }}</ref> On 16 December 2014, Archbishop [[Anthony Fisher]] invoked the special prayers in the [[Roman Missal]] from the \"mass in times of civil disturbance\" for the victims of the [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chilling terror act brought central Sydney to a halt|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/story-e6frg71x-1227157249902|publisher=The Australian|date=16 December 2014|access-date=3 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217094407/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/story-e6frg71x-1227157249902|archive-date=17 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A memorial service was held at the cathedral on the morning of 19 December for Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, in attendance were the Governor-General [[Peter Cosgrove]], then-Minister of Communications [[Malcolm Turnbull]], Senator [[Arthur Sinodinos]], Premier of New South Wales [[Mike Baird]], and then-Minister of Transport [[Gladys Berejiklian]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/sydney-siege/sydney-siege-hell-has-touched-us/news-story/5dc434662461901a56148d1338d55e2c | title=Sydney siege: \u2019Hell has touched us\u2019 | work=The Australian | date=16 December 2014 | agency=News Corp Australia | accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/news-story/7eb7fc591dda5371339aa5fdbac55ab0 | title=Chilling terror act brought central Sydney to a halt | work=The Australian | date=16 December 2014 | agency=News Corp Australia | accessdate=3 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512210624/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/chilling-terror-act-brought-central-sydney-to-a-halt/news-story/7eb7fc591dda5371339aa5fdbac55ab0 | archive-date=12 May 2017 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kerin|first1=Lindy|title=Memorial service at St Mary's Cathedral for Sydney hostage victims|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4151947.htm|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=19 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112044056/http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4151947.htm|archive-date=12 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:S\u00eddney-Australia42.JPG|thumb|left|upright=2|View from the [[Sydney Tower]].]]\n\n===Plan===\nSt Mary's Cathedral is unusual among large cathedrals in that, because of its size, the plan of the city around it and the fall of the land, it is oriented in a north\u2013south direction rather than the usual east\u2013west. The liturgical East End is at the north and the West Front is to the south.\n\nThe plan of the cathedral is a conventional English cathedral plan, cruciform in shape, with a tower over the crossing of the nave and transepts and twin towers at the West Front (in this case, the south). The chancel is square-ended, like the chancels of [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]], [[York Minster|York]] and several other English cathedrals. There are three processional doors in the south with additional entrances conveniently placed in the transept facades so that they lead from [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and from the presbytery buildings and school adjacent the cathedral.\n\n===Style===\nThe architecture is typical of the Gothic Revival of the 19th century, inspired by the journals of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], the writings of [[John Ruskin]] and the architecture of [[Augustus Welby Pugin]]. At the time that the foundation stone was laid, the architect [[Edmund Blacket]] had just completed Sydney's very much smaller Anglican cathedral in the [[Perpendicular Gothic]] style and the Main Building of Sydney University. St Mary's, when William Wardell's plan was realised, was to be a much larger, more imposing and more sombre structure than the smaller [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's]] and, because of its fortuitous siting, still dominates many views of the city despite the high-rise buildings.\n\nThe style of the cathedral is [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Geometric Decorated Gothic]], the archaeological antecedent being the ecclesiastical architecture of late 13th century England. It is based fairly closely on the style of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tracery of the huge chancel window being almost a replica of that at Lincoln.\n\n===Exterior===\n[[File:St Mary's Cathedral from the north-west.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|The cathedral seen from the north-west]]\nThe lateral view of the building from Hyde Park is marked by the regular progression of Gothic windows with pointed arches and simple tracery. The upper roofline is finished with a pierced parapet, broken by decorative gables above the clerestorey windows, above which rises a steeply pitched slate roof with many small dormers in the French manner. The roofline of the aisles is decorated with carved bosses between the sturdy buttresses which support flying [[buttress]]es to the [[clerestorey]].\n\nFacing Hyde Park, the transept provides the usual mode of public entrance, as is common in many French cathedrals, and has richly decorated doors which, unlike those of the main front, have had their carved details completed and demonstrate the skills of local craftsmen in both designing and carving in the Gothic style. Included in the foliate bosses are Australian native plants such as the [[waratah]], [[floral emblem]] of [[New South Wales]].\n\nSt Mary's Cathedral is generally approached on foot from the city through Hyde Park, where the transept front and central tower rise up behind the [[Archibald Fountain]]. During the 20th century the gardeners of Hyde Park have further enhanced the vista by laying out a garden on the cathedral side of the park in which the plantings have often taken the form of a cross.\n\nDespite the many English features of the architecture including its interior and chancel termination, the entrance fa\u00e7ade is not English at all. It is a design loosely based on the most famous of all Gothic west fronts, that of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] with its balance of vertical and horizontal features, its three huge portals and its central rose window. There are two more large [[rose window]]s, one in each of the transepts. The French fa\u00e7ade was, however, intended to have twin stone spires like those of [[Lichfield Cathedral]], but they were not to be put in place until 132 years after the building was commenced.\n\n[[File:The south facing main front of St Mary's Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The south facing main front of St Mary's Cathedral]]\nThe crossing tower, which holds the bells, is quite stocky but its silhouette is made elegant by the provision of tall crocketted pinnacles. The completed spires of the main front enhance the view of the cathedral along College Street and particularly the ceremonial approach from the flight of stairs in front of the cathedral. Standing at {{convert|74.6|m|ft}}, they make St Mary's the fourth tallest church in Australia, after the triple-spired [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]], [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne]] and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bendigo]].\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:St Mary's Cathedral adjusted.JPG|thumb|upright=2|left|Interior during a Mass in 2009]]\nIn cross-section the cathedral is typical of most large churches in having a high central nave and an aisle on either side, which serve to buttress the nave and provide passage around the interior. The interior of the nave thus rises in three stages, the arcade, the gallery and the clerestory which has windows to light the nave. See [[cathedral diagram]]\nThe building is of golden-coloured sandstone which has weathered externally to golden-brown. The roof is of red cedar, that of the nave being of an open arch-braced construction enlivened by decorative pierced carvings. The chancel is vaulted with timber, which was probably intended to be richly decorated in red, blue and gold after the manner of the wooden roof at Peterborough, but this did not eventuate, and the warm colour of the timber contrasts well with the stonework.\n\nThe side aisles are vaulted in stone, with a large round boss at the centre of each ribbed vault. Children who, over the years, have crawled into the arched space beneath the pulpit have discovered another such beautiful carved boss, in miniature and usually unseen. On all the terminals of arches within the buildings are carved heads of saints. Those that are near the [[confessional]]s are at eye-level and may be examined for their details.\n\nThe screen behind the high altar is delicately carved in [[Oamaru limestone]] from New Zealand. It contains niches filled with statues like the similar niches in the [[altar of Our Lady]] located directly behind it. There are two large chapels and two smaller ones, the larger being the Chapel of the [[Sacred Heart]] and the Chapel of the Irish Saints. On either side of the Lady Chapel are the Chapels of Ss [[St Joseph|Joseph]] and [[St Peter|Peter]] all with ornately carved altars and a small statue in each niche. The embellished mosaics in the Kelly Chapel floor were laid by Melocco Co in 1937 approximately the same time as the mosaic floor in the Lady Chapel of [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]] also designed by Wardell.\n[[File:St. Mary's Cathedral - Sydney - Stained Glass - 018 - Detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The chancel window depicts a vision of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary enthroned in Heaven.]]\n\n===Lighting===\nBecause of the brightness of Australian sunlight, it was decided at the time of construction to glaze the [[clerestory]] with yellow glass. This glazing has darkened over the years, permitting little light to enter. The yellow glazing contrasts with the predominantly blue stained glass of the lower windows. To counteract the darkness, the cathedral installed extensive lighting in the 1970s, designed to give more-or-less equal illumination to all parts of the buildings. The interior is lit with a diffuse yellow glow, which, like the upper windows, is in contrast to the effects of the natural light which penetrates through the white areas of the stained glass. The installed lighting counteracts the pattern of light and shade that would normally exists in a cathedral of the Gothic style by illuminating most brightly those parts of the structure which would normally be subdued.\n\n===Stained glass===\nThe cathedral's stained glass is all the work of [[Hardman & Co.]] and covers a period of about 50 years.\n\nThere are about 40 pictorial windows representing several themes and culminating in the chancel window showing the [[Fall of Man]] and Mary, crowned and enthroned beside Jesus as he sits in judgement, pleading Jesus' mercy upon Christians.\n\nOther windows include the mysteries of the [[rosary]], the [[Nativity of Christ|birth]] and childhood of Jesus and [[lives of the saints]]. Stylistically, the windows move from the [[Gothic Revival]] of the 19th century to a more painterly and lavish style of the early 20th century.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Details of the architecture\" heights=\"170px\" widths=\"250px\">\nFile:StMarysCathedral Carving.JPG|Carvings around the transept portal include Australian flora\nFile:StMarysCathedral AisleVault.JPG|The aisles have ribbed stone vaulting with carved bosses\nFile:St Marys Cathedral Nave.JPG|The ceiling of the central bell tower is of painted oak\nFile:St Mary's Cathedral The sanctuary 201708.jpg|The sanctuary prepared for a service\n</gallery>\n\n==Treasures==\nSt Mary's is full of treasures and devotional objects. Around the walls of the aisles are located the [[Stations of the Cross]], painted in oils by L. Chovet of Paris and selected for St Mary's by Cardinal Moran in 1885. In the western transept is a marble replica of Michelangelo's [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]], the original of which is in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome. This sculpture was brought to Australia for display in David Jones Ltd. department store and was later donated to the cathedral.\n\nLocated previously in the crypt, where it was touched in the evening by the setting sun, was the Grave of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier]], a realistic depiction of a dead soldier sculpted by [[George Washington Lambert]]. Although previously visible to the public from above, the tomb has now been moved into the aisle of the cathedral, to give the public greater access to it.\n\nThe crypt has an extensive mosaic floor, the achievement of Peter Melocco and his firm. This design has as its foundation a cross elaborately decorated like a vast [[Celtic Art|Celtic]] [[illuminated manuscript]], with rondels showing the [[Genesis creation myth|Days of Creation]] and the titles of the Virgin Mary.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Treasures of the cathedral\" heights=\"210px\" widths=\"260px\">\nFile:St. Mary's Cathedral - Sydney - Painting - 10.jpg|[[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] from the [[Stations of the Cross]] by L.

Of two manuals and 23 stops, it was the largest organ in Australia until its destruction by fire in 1865.\n* In 1942 a pipe organ built by [[Joseph Howell Whitehouse]] of Brisbane, (1874\u20131954), was installed in the gallery at the end of the nave, above the main door.\n* Between 1959 and 1971 [[Ronald Sharp]] (b. 1929) installed an electric-action pipe organ in the triforium gallery of the sanctuary, but this was never completed. This is only used for the weekly Novena Mass in the Lady Chapel.\n* In 1997 a new [[pipe organ]] was built by [[Orgues L\u00e9tourneau]] of Saint Hyacinthe, Quebec, and installed on a new gallery built around the rose window in the western transept. It was completed in 1999 and dedicated by Cardinal Clancy. The L\u00e9tourneau organ is of three manuals and 46 stops. In addition to being played from the gallery, it may be played with the Whitehouse organ, from a four-manual mobile electronic console located at floor level. \n* There is a Rodgers digital organ in the quire, which accompanies the daily choral liturgies. \n* There is an organ in the crypt, made by Bellsham Pipe Organs (1985), which is used for liturgies within the crypt.\n{{-}}\n\n===Choirs===\nThere are two choirs that sing liturgically at the cathedral. The Cathedral Choir sings almost daily. There is also a voluntary adult choir, the St Mary's Singers, which sings regularly for services and occasional concerts.\n\n====St Mary's Cathedral Choir====\nBegun in the 19th century as a mixed voice choir, the [[St Mary's Cathedral Choir, Sydney|St Mary's Cathedral Choir]] has been a traditional English-style cathedral choir of men and boys since 1955. There are usually 24 choristers (boy trebles and altos) and 12 lay clerks (professional countertenors, tenors and basses). The choir sings Mass and Vespers daily (excluding Friday) and is the oldest continuous musical institution in Australia.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/city-east/tv-talent-shows-have-nothing-on-the-st-marys-cathedral-choir-when-it-comes-to-uncovering-our-young-singing-stars/news-story/59b975b87e200397512a686889bf9817 | title=TV talent shows have nothing on the St Mary's Cathedral Choir when it comes to uncovering our young singing stars | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=31 July 2014 | agency=News Corp Australia | accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref> They perform works ranging from [[Gregorian Chant]], [[Polyphony#Western Europe and Roman Catholicism|Sacred Polyphony]] and Renaissance compositions to 21st century compositions.\n\n====Cathedral Scholars====\nChoristers from the Cathedral Choir whose voices have broken continue their training as part of this special ensemble.

There have been three separate [[ring of bells|rings of bells]] at the cathedral, all cast by the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] of London. The first, of eight bells, arrived in Sydney in August 1843, and were installed in a wooden campanile located away from the main building (approximately where the pulpit is today). They were the first bells hung for [[change ringing]] in Australia and rang for the first time on New Year's Day 1844. When the cathedral was destroyed by fire in June 1865, the bells escaped damage. Construction of new cathedral began in 1866, and during 1868 the bells were removed from the campanile and installed in the new tower, which was situated where the south-western tower now stands. In 1881 the bells were traded in for a new ring of eight which were installed the following year (the Whitechapel Foundry was then using the name Mears & Stainbank). In 1885 a contract was signed for the construction of the Central Tower (the Moran Tower) to which the bells were transferred in 1898.\n\nA century later an entirely new ring was ordered. Today the Central Tower houses a ring of twelve bells, plus two additional bells which allow alternative groups of bells to be rung, depending on the number and skill of the ringers available.<ref>[http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Sydney&DoveID=SYDNEY+++R Sydney, Basilica of S Mary] in [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]].

The bells of St Mary's were heard leading the ringing which marked the centenary of Australian Federation. They are also rung as part of the finale to Sydney's [[Symphony in the Domain]] concert in January, in unison with [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]].

It is possibly the oldest surviving Catholic school building in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/> The use of the Chapter Hall as a school and general purpose hall has been continuous since erection and its role as an early public meeting place is highly significant.

It is also associated with important persons of the 19th and 20th centuries, including Governors Macquarie and Bourke, and architects Greenway, Pugin, Wardell and Hennessy.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/> The Chapter Hall's Gothic Revival style blends well with the cathedral and is aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-1709/><ref name=bennett/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe cathedral is sited along a ridge running north\u2013south on the eastern edge of the central area of the city and projects a dominating and inspiring presence, its roof and towers rising up above the neighbouring buildings and trees. The four arms of its plan establish axes that link it to the harbour and [[Woolloomooloo]], to [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and to College and Macquarie Streets. The long English form of the building restates and reinforces these axes, powerfully weaving the cathedral into the urban fabric. As well as providing majestic vistas from the harbour and [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], from Hyde Park and the adjacent streets, and from the elevated viewpoints of many central city buildings, the cathedral offers from within beautifully framed and precious vistas of the surrounding city. It is the largest nineteenth-century ecclesiastical building in the English archaeological Gothic style anywhere in the world. The refinement and scholarship of its composition and details are of the highest rank. Together with St Patrick's Cathedral in [[Melbourne]], St Mary's is the major ecclesiastical work of architect William Wardell, a Gothic Revival architect of international significance practising in Australia. The cathedral is a repository of many items of aesthetic significance from the stained glass windows to the altars, statues, vestments, liturgical objects, paintings and mosaics and is important as a venue for musical events and has a considerable role in the practice of bell ringing in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/><ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nSt Mary's Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Sydney and the mother diocese of Australia. In its physical and spiritual presence it proclaims the faith of the Catholic church. It is primarily a house of sacrament, prayer and worship. It is also a great civic edifice of importance to all the people of Sydney. Built on the site of the first official catholic church in the colony, the present cathedral complex links back through two centuries, without interruption, to the beginnings of the Catholic faith in Australia. It is a focus for the Catholic community of Australia, while through its musical and other artistic activities, it is an important part of the cultural life of Sydney.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/><ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nA major sandstone building in Sydney, the physical fabric of the cathedral demonstrates the quality of craft, engineering skill and sense of place achieved in yellow block sandstone structures in Victorian Sydney. The completion of the southern front end of the Cathedral by Hennessy Hennessy and Co demonstrates innovative building technology at the beginning of this century, especially in the techniques employed in the construction of the foundations and crypt.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/><ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Mary's is a rare example of the 19th century Gothic style Catholic cathedral.<ref name=nswshr-1709-1709-1/> The chapter hall is the only remaining intact building relating to John Bede Polding, the first Archbishop of Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1709/><ref name=bennett/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Mary's Cathedral and Chapter House has represented the centre of Catholic worship and culture in Sydney (and arguably the State) since its construction in the 1870s.<ref name=nswshr-1709/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Statue of St Mary of the Cross at St Mary's Cathedral.jpg|Statue of [[Mary MacKillop|St Mary of the Cross]] at the College Street doors\nFile:View of the Sanctuary from the crossing at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.jpg|A view of the Sanctuary from the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]\nFile:StMarysCathedralSydneyChapeloftheSacredHeart.jpg|Chapel of the Sacred Heart\nFile:North-eastern side altar at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.jpg|Chapel of St Joseph\nFile:StMarysCathedralSydneyChapelofOurLady.jpg|Chapel of Our Lady with stained glass windows above, the reredos features statues of influential female saints\nFile:North-western side altar at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.jpg|Chapel of St Peter with reredos depicting Jesus entrusting St Peter with the Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven\nFile:Southeastern side altar at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.jpg|Chapel of the Irish Saints with reredos depicting [[the Crucifixion]], flanked by statues of St Patrick and [[Brigit of Kildare|Brigid of Ireland]].\nFile:Vestments of Oliver Plunket in St Mary's Cathedral.jpg|The vestments of St [[Oliver Plunkett]], Archbishop of Armagh, who was implicated in the [[Popish Plot]] and executed in Tyburn.\nFile:Gourbeillon \"Our Lady and the child Jesus\" (c.1850).jpg|A statue by Fr John Dom Eugene Gourbeillon OSB of \"Our Lady and the child Jesus\", the only surviving statue from the first cathedral\nFile:Statue of St Patrick at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.jpg|Statue of [[Saint Patrick]] presented to the Cathedral by the Saint Patrick's Branch of the [[Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society]].\nFile:St Mary's Cathedral -

The 280-square-foot video wall, claimed to be the largest surveillance screen in the country, is being installed at the control room of Police Commissioner Mr. Rakesh Asthana (IPS). This will help the police view the entire city live through 10,000 CCTV cameras across the city. Surat police have decided to install 5,000 CCTV cameras at sensitive points across the city. While 1,000 cameras will be night vision cameras, 4,000 others will be simple CCTV cameras. This has been installed on PPP base with the help of the city's businessmen, city's social persons, Surat Municipal Corporation and Surat City Police.\n<ref>{{cite news|author=Business Standard |url=http://www.business-standard.com/generalnews/news/surat-to-have-new-security-system/111831/ |title=Surat to have new security system |publisher=Business Standard |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Business Standard India }}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{bar box\n|title=Religions in Surat<ref name=2011census>{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/343-surat.html|title=Surat City Population Census 2011 \u2013 Gujarat|access-date=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629044525/http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/343-surat.html|archive-date=29 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|titlebar=#Fcd116\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|orange|85.31}}\n{{bar percent|[[Islam]]|green|11.63}}\n{{bar percent|[[Jainism]]|yellow|2.31}}\n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|blue|0.28}}\n{{bar percent|Christianity|pink|0.25}}\n{{bar percent|Others/not stated|black|0.23}}\n|caption=<small>Includes [[Sikh]]s (0.10%).</small>}}\n\n{{IndiaCensusPop|state=\n|title= Population Growth of Surat\n|1810= 73000\n|1871= 107100\n|1881= 109800\n|1891= 109200\n|1901= 119300\n|1911= 114900\n|1921= 117400\n|1931= 98900\n|1941= 171400\n|1951= 223200\n|1961= 288000\n|1968= 368900\n|1971= 492700\n|1981= 912600\n|1991= 1519000\n|2001= 2811614\n|2011= 4591246\n|2013= 5300000\n|footnote= source:<ref name=\"censubbsindia1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Asia/indiat.htm|title=Historical Census of India|access-date=23 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217053707/http://www.populstat.info/Asia/indiat.htm|archive-date=17 February 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n}}\nAccording to the 2011 India census, the population of Surat is 4,462,002.

The ads featured a jingle that said \"It's so satisfying\" and had the classic hand that would open and close showing a handful of peanuts converting to a Snickers bar. \"Packed with peanuts, Snickers really satisfies\" was shown in the commercials.\n\n===1984 Olympics===\nMars paid $5 million to have Snickers and M&M's named the \"official snack\" of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], outraging nutritionists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/06/Nutritionists-soured-by-Olympic-candy-endorsement/2304439534800/|title=Nutritionists soured by Olympic candy endorsement|date=December 6, 1983|work=UPI}}</ref> Sports promotions in international games continued to be a prominent marketing tool for Mars, that would keep Snickers as an international brand while also selling local bars in some markets.<ref name=\"Varey2002\">{{cite book|author=Richard Varey|title=Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2VO0nKqYOMC&pg=PT141|date=September 11, 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-58159-7|pages=141\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Not Going Anywhere For a While?===\nBeginning in 1995, Snickers ran ads which featured someone making a self-inflicted mistake, with the voice-over saying \"Not going anywhere for a while? Grab a Snickers!\" The tag line at the end of each ad proclaimed, \"Hungry? Why Wait?\"\n\nOne such ad had a player for a fictional [[American football]] team showing off his new [[tattoo]] of the team's logo on his back to his teammates. He then shows it to his head coach who, after complimenting the tattoo, immediately tells him that he's been [[Trade (sports)|traded]] to Miami. The player then goes to have his old team's logo replaced with the new team's logo.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSome of the ads were done in conjunction with the [[National Football League]], with whom Snickers had a sponsorship deal at the time. One ad featured a member of the grounds crew at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] painting the field for an upcoming [[Kansas City Chiefs]] game in hot, late-summer weather. After finishing one of the end zones, and visibly exhausted, one of the Chiefs players walks up to him and says the field looks great, \"but who are the Chefs?\", showing that despite all the hard work the painter accidentally omitted the \"i\" in Chiefs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.advertolog.com/snickers/adverts/chefs-461055/ |title=Snickers Adverts And Commercials Archive CHEFS |publisher=AdvertoLog.com |date=March 15, 2015 |accessdate=March 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103350/http://www.advertolog.com/snickers/adverts/chefs-461055/ |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Another had [[Marv Levy]] in the [[Buffalo Bills]] locker room lecturing his team that \"no one's going anywhere\" until the Bills figure out how to actually win a [[Super Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/marketing-100-snickers-santa-cruz-hughes/72184/|title=THE MARKETING 100: SNICKERS: SANTA CRUZ HUGHES|work=Advertising Age|last=Pollack|first=Jordan|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Snickers Feast===\nIn 2007, Snickers launched a campaign which featured [[Henry VIII]] and a Viking among others who attend the \"Snickers Feast\". It consisted of various commercials of the gang and their adventures on the feast.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Super Bowl XLI commercial===\nOn February 4, 2007, during [[Super Bowl XLI]], Snickers commercials aired. This resulted in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, Masterfoods USA of [[Hackettstown, New Jersey]], a division of [[Mars, Incorporated]]. The commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally touching lips while sharing a Snickers bar. After quickly pulling away, one mechanic says, \"I think we just accidentally kissed.\", and another mechanic exclaims, \"Quick! Do something manly!\" and in three of the four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with a very large [[pipe wrench]], and drinking [[motor oil]] and [[windshield washer fluid]]. In the fourth version, however, a third mechanic shows up and asks \"Is there room for three in this [[The Love Boat|Love Boat]]?\"\n\nComplaints were lodged against Masterfoods that the ads were [[homophobia|homophobic]]. [[Human Rights Campaign]] president [[Joe Solmonese]] is quoted as saying<blockquote>\"This type of jeering from professional sports figures at the sight of two men kissing fuels the kind of anti-gay bullying that haunts countless gay and lesbian school children on playgrounds all across the country.\"<ref name=\"playground\">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,250575,00.html Snickers Ad of Men Accidentally Kissing Pulled After Complaints From Gay Groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208023039/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C250575%2C00.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}, FOX Business.

Another advertisement featured Mr. T launching bars at a swimmer who appeared to refuse to get in a swimming pool because of the cold temperature of the water. In 2008, a European Snickers commercial in which Mr. T uses a [[Jeep]]-mounted [[Minigun]] to fire Snickers bars at a speedwalker for being a \"disgrace to the man race\" was pulled after complaints from a US pressure group that the advertisement was homophobic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/advertising |title=Don't give us none of that jibba jabba |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 4, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2009 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}</ref> These advertisements usually ended with Mr. T saying \"Snickers: Get Some Nuts!\"\n\n===NASCAR===\nIn [[NASCAR]] racing, Snickers (and the rest of the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] affiliated brands) sponsor [[Kyle Busch]]'s #18 Toyota for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]]. Prior to that the brand served as a primary sponsor for [[Ricky Rudd]]'s #88 [[Yates Racing|Robert Yates Racing]] Ford as well as an associate sponsor for the team's #38 car driven first by [[Elliott Sadler]] and then by [[David Gilliland]], and an associate sponsor for the [[Ginn Racing|MB2 Motorsports]] #36 Pontiac driven by [[Derrike Cope]], [[Ernie Irvan]], [[Ken Schrader]], and others. In 1990, [[Bobby Hillin]] drove for [[Stavola Brothers Racing]] in the #8 Snickers Buick, marking the candy's first appearance as a sponsor; it had since been driven by [[Rick Wilson (racing driver)|Rick Wilson]] and [[Dick Trickle]].\n\n===FIFA World Cup & UEFA Euro Sponsorship===\nSnickers was the Official Sponsor of the [[FIFA World Cup]] from [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] until [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] editions and the [[UEFA European Championship]] from [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]] until [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]].\n\n===You're Not You When You're Hungry===\nIn 2010, a new advertising campaign was launched, usually based around people turning into different people (usually celebrities) as a result of hunger (taking the new campaign's name \"You're Not You When You're Hungry\" quite literally). The tagline varied depending on the commercial's location or what variety the commercial is showing.\n\nIn 2010, [[Betty White]] and [[Abe Vigoda]] appeared in the first Snickers commercial in this campaign, playing [[American football]]. The commercial was ranked by [[ADBOWL]] as the best advertisement of the year. This commercial was also briefly spoofed in an episode of ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]'' on [[ESPN2]] with [[Michelle Beadle]] playing the role instead of [[Betty White]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mankindunplugged.com/2011/02/02/super-bowl-ad-fail-by-espn-sportsnations-michelle-beadle/ | title=Super Bowl Ad FAIL by ESPN2 SportsNation's Michelle Beadle | date=February 2, 2011 | accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> Later that year, Snickers commercials featured singers [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Liza Minnelli]], and comedians [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] and [[Roseanne Barr]]. A 2011 commercial featured actors [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Don Rickles]].\n\nIn Latin America, the slogan was the same as in the UK version, except that men doing extreme sports turning into the Mexican singer [[Anah\u00ed]] as a result of hunger.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anah\u00ed se transforma en \"Carlos\" para comercial de chocolate|url=http://peopleenespanol.com/article/anahi-se-transforma-en-carlos-para-comercial-de-chocolate/|website=[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]|accessdate=20 March 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref> Brazilian versions of the ad featured actresses [[Betty Faria]] and [[Cl\u00e1udia Raia]].\n\nIn 2013, the late [[Robin Williams]] and [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] also appeared in a Snickers football commercial. In March 2014, a commercial featuring [[Godzilla]] was released to promote the [[Godzilla (2014 film)|2014 Godzilla film]]. In the commercial, Godzilla is shown hanging out with humans on the beach, riding dirt bikes, and water skiing; he only begins rampaging once he's hungry. After being fed a Snickers bar, he resumes having fun with the humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7gLi/snickers-godzilla |title=Snickers TV Spot, 'Godzilla'| publisher=ISpot.tv | date=March 13, 2015 | accessdate= March 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, Snickers' [[Super Bowl XLIX]] commercial featured a parody of a scene from an episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' entitled \"[[List of The Brady Bunch episodes#ep90|The Subject Was Noses]].\" In the commercial, [[Carol Brady|Carol]] and [[Mike Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Mike]] try to calm down a very angry [[Machete (character)|Machete]] (played by [[Danny Trejo]]). When the parents give Machete a Snickers bar, he reverts into [[Marcia Brady|Marcia]] before an irate [[Jan Brady|Jan]] (played by [[Steve Buscemi]]) rants upstairs and walks away. In a second commercial set earlier, Marcia (as Machete) angrily brushes her hair while yelling through her door.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/best-super-bowl-commercials-2015/ |title=Watch This Year's Best Super Bowl Commercials |last=Chitwood | first=Adam |publisher=Collider.com |date=February 2, 2015 |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXizLog2hms |title=Super Bowl Ad 2015: SNICKERS \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d Danny Trejo |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2020-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/88110/machete-kills-brady-bunch-snickers/|title=Machete Kills the Brady Bunch for Snickers|date=February 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, for [[Super Bowl 50]], another Snickers commercial was made, featuring [[Willem Dafoe]] (as [[Marilyn Monroe]]) and [[Eugene Levy]], where Willem Dafoe complains about filming the iconic \"subway grate\" scene in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]''. After being given a Snickers, he turns into Marilyn and goes ahead with the scene, with Levy operating the fan below, commenting that the scene won't make the movie's final cut, that nobody would want to see it.\n\nIn 2018, Brazil World Cup winner [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] is seen [[Goal celebration|celebrating a goal]] for Argentina. When he notices the confused faces around him, he eats a Snickers and returns to normal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Brazilian Ronaldo Featured In Snickers Campaign |url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Global/Issues/2018/03/30/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/Cristiano-Ronaldo-Snickers.aspx |accessdate=7 September 2018 |agency=''Sports Business Daily''}}</ref>\n\nThe UK version of the campaign usually used British celebrities and, up until 2018, retained the slogan from the Mr. T. era. In the initial advertisement, [[Joan Collins]] and [[Stephanie Beacham]] featured as locker room footballers who had turned into them due to being hungry. In 2014, [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] returned on television by appearing on several UK Snickers commercials and cinema spots, in place of a martial arts master who had turned into him as a result of hunger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/mr-bean-hopeless-ninja-most-hilarious-snickers-youre-not-you-ads-yet-160586/ |title=Snickers TV Spot, 'Godzilla'| publisher=ISpot.tv | date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> Later, in 2018, [[Elton John]] appeared in a new advertisement where he turns into the African American rapper Boogie after he eats a snickers. It is revealed that he had turned into him due to hunger (the slogan appeared on a turntable in this advertisement).\n\n===WrestleMania===\n\nSnickers has been an official sponsor of [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] events, including [[WrestleMania 2000]], [[WrestleMania 22|22]], [[WrestleMania 32|32]], [[WrestleMania 33|33]], [[WrestleMania 34|34]], and [[WrestleMania 35|35]], while its Cruncher variant sponsored [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], [[WrestleMania XIX|XIX]], [[WrestleMania XX|XX]] and [[WrestleMania 21|21]]. Since then, Snickers has sponsored superstars such as [[Enzo and Cass|Enzo Amore and Big Cass]] with their signature term, SAWFT, which is labelled at the back of the chocolate bar.\n\n===Six Flags Fright Fest===\nSince 2011, Snickers has been the official sponsor of [[Six Flags]]' annual [[Six Flags Fright Fest|Fright Fest]] event at its theme parks.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn March 2020 Snickers caused an outrage amongst the Welsh speaking people of the world by posting a message on Twitter comparing the Welsh language and placenames to someone 'sitting on a keyboard'.<ref>{{cite

Why Wait?\"\n\nOne such ad had a player for a fictional [[American football]] team showing off his new [[tattoo]] of the team's logo on his back to his teammates.

It consisted of various commercials of the gang and their adventures on the feast.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Super Bowl XLI commercial===\nOn February 4, 2007, during [[Super Bowl XLI]], Snickers commercials aired. This resulted in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, Masterfoods USA of [[Hackettstown, New Jersey]], a division of [[Mars, Incorporated]]. The commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally touching lips while sharing a Snickers bar. After quickly pulling away, one mechanic says, \"I think we just accidentally kissed.\", and another mechanic exclaims, \"Quick! Do something manly!\" and in three of the four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with a very large [[pipe wrench]], and drinking [[motor oil]] and [[windshield washer fluid]]. In the fourth version, however, a third mechanic shows up and asks \"Is there room for three in this [[The Love Boat|Love Boat]]?\"\n\nComplaints were lodged against Masterfoods that the ads were [[homophobia|homophobic]]. [[Human Rights Campaign]] president [[Joe Solmonese]] is quoted as saying<blockquote>\"This type of jeering from professional sports figures at the sight of two men kissing fuels the kind of anti-gay bullying that haunts countless gay and lesbian school children on playgrounds all across the country.\"<ref name=\"playground\">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,250575,00.html Snickers Ad of Men Accidentally Kissing Pulled After Complaints From Gay Groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208023039/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C250575%2C00.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}, FOX Business.

Another advertisement featured Mr. T launching bars at a swimmer who appeared to refuse to get in a swimming pool because of the cold temperature of the water. In 2008, a European Snickers commercial in which Mr. T uses a [[Jeep]]-mounted [[Minigun]] to fire Snickers bars at a speedwalker for being a \"disgrace to the man race\" was pulled after complaints from a US pressure group that the advertisement was homophobic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/advertising |title=Don't give us none of that jibba jabba |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 4, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2009 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}</ref> These advertisements usually ended with Mr. T saying \"Snickers: Get Some Nuts!\"\n\n===NASCAR===\nIn [[NASCAR]] racing, Snickers (and the rest of the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] affiliated brands) sponsor [[Kyle Busch]]'s #18 Toyota for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]]. Prior to that the brand served as a primary sponsor for [[Ricky Rudd]]'s #88 [[Yates Racing|Robert Yates Racing]] Ford as well as an associate sponsor for the team's #38 car driven first by [[Elliott Sadler]] and then by [[David Gilliland]], and an associate sponsor for the [[Ginn Racing|MB2 Motorsports]] #36 Pontiac driven by [[Derrike Cope]], [[Ernie Irvan]], [[Ken Schrader]], and others. In 1990, [[Bobby Hillin]] drove for [[Stavola Brothers Racing]] in the #8 Snickers Buick, marking the candy's first appearance as a sponsor; it had since been driven by [[Rick Wilson (racing driver)|Rick Wilson]] and [[Dick Trickle]].\n\n===FIFA World Cup & UEFA Euro Sponsorship===\nSnickers was the Official Sponsor of the [[FIFA World Cup]] from [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] until [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] editions and the [[UEFA European Championship]] from [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]] until [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]].\n\n===You're Not You When You're Hungry===\nIn 2010, a new advertising campaign was launched, usually based around people turning into different people (usually celebrities) as a result of hunger (taking the new campaign's name \"You're Not You When You're Hungry\" quite literally). The tagline varied depending on the commercial's location or what variety the commercial is showing.\n\nIn 2010, [[Betty White]] and [[Abe Vigoda]] appeared in the first Snickers commercial in this campaign, playing [[American football]]. The commercial was ranked by [[ADBOWL]] as the best advertisement of the year. This commercial was also briefly spoofed in an episode of ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]'' on [[ESPN2]] with [[Michelle Beadle]] playing the role instead of [[Betty White]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mankindunplugged.com/2011/02/02/super-bowl-ad-fail-by-espn-sportsnations-michelle-beadle/ | title=Super Bowl Ad FAIL by ESPN2 SportsNation's Michelle Beadle | date=February 2, 2011 | accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> Later that year, Snickers commercials featured singers [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Liza Minnelli]], and comedians [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] and [[Roseanne Barr]].

In March 2014, a commercial featuring [[Godzilla]] was released to promote the [[Godzilla (2014 film)|2014 Godzilla film]].

After being given a Snickers, he turns into Marilyn and goes ahead with the scene, with Levy operating the fan below, commenting that the scene won't make the movie's final cut, that nobody would want to see it.\n\nIn 2018, Brazil World Cup winner [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] is seen [[Goal celebration|celebrating a goal]] for Argentina.
