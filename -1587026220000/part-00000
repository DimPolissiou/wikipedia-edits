Though eventually a court secretary, M\u00e4hler was interested in music, was a good singer and did some composing. Beethoven took him to one rehearsal of ''[[Fidelio|Leonore]]'' in 1805.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=58}}\n\nWhat is known about the painting stems from [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]]'s biography. He first came across the original M\u00e4hler painting during a research visit (for his Beethoven biography) to Caroline Barbara van Beethoven (born Naske), the widow of Karl Beethoven, the composer's nephew. Because [[Thayer's copy|Thayer owned a copy]], he was particularly interested in learning about the circumstances under which it was painted. He considered this painting the most interesting and engaging of the portraits he had encountered.{{sfn|Bellofatto|Jander|2006|p=13}} He later interviewed Joseph Willibrord M\u00e4hler on May 24, 1860.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=336}}{{sfn|Bellofatto|Jander|2006|p=13}} Thayer characterized the friendship between Beethoven and M\u00e4hler as one where composer's kindness was returned by M\u00e4hler with warm affection and admiration for composer's genius.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=336}} In offering recollections of Beethoven, M\u00e4hler spoke of his 1804 portrait and wondered where it was. To his question, Thayer responded that it belonged to the widow of Karl Beethoven. M\u00e4hler then revealed that he had a copy of it.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}}\n\nM\u00e4hler painted four portraits of Beethoven.  Only the first image, dated by Thayer at 1804\u201305, contains a nearly full view of the composer.

The portrait of Beethoven\u2019s grandfather was prominently displayed in the entry hall, while the M\u00e4hler portrait was on the back wall of a storage room where visitors were never admitted.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=61}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\nIn an extended article, Owen Jander discusses the symbolism embedded within Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|fifth symphony]] and the portrait, hypothesizing that both works were a \"ritualized confrontation\" \u2013 a public yet veiled declaration of the composer's growing [[deafness]], as a means of learning to accept it.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=44}} Jander proposes that much of 18th to 19th century [[portrait painting]] can be considered self-portraits, commissioned at significant times in a person's life in which the details of the portrait were laid out by the subject.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=45}} Elements such as the subject's pose, facial expression, clothing, accompanying objects and gestures are all part of the conventions of portraiture.  Similarly, if any of these elements is depicted in such a way that diverges from typical depictions, that strengthens the message they intend to communicate by drawing in the viewer's attention.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=46}} Contrasting gestures between right and left arm are typical and serve to sensitize the viewer to summon interpretation,{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=48}} or in the words of critic Philip Conisbee, a \"narrative portrait with a didactic purpose.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=49}}\n\nJander theorizes that an inspiration for M\u00e4hler's portrait is Leopold Radoux's 1773 portrait of Beethoven's grandfather, also named Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773), which the composer had prominently displayed in his apartment.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}} Notably, one of the features of this portrait (painted the same year as the subject's death) was a cape falling off the back of the subject.  To Jander, this represents the overcoming of grief that befell Beethoven's grandfather upon the death of his wife from alcoholism while maintaining a family life (his son [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]]\u2014the younger Ludwig van Beethoven's father\u2014also suffered and eventually died from alcoholism). To understand the possible effect upon the composer, Jander cites 18th century mathematician and art theorist [[Johann Georg Sulzer]] who in his ''Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste'' provided an understanding on how an ancestor's portrait can have a healing effect on descendants.  \"The bonds of admiration and love between us and our ancestors are maintained and thus have a healing influence on the spirit, as though occasionally the deceased were still sitting among us\u2026.a portrait can make almost as powerful an impression upon us humans as can the person himself.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}}\n\n=== The plant ===\n\nJander notes that plant studies were part of the curriculum of the Dresden Art Academy where M\u00e4hler attended, so it is natural to expect plants in his graphic work. The plant at the bottom left of the portrait Jander identified as ''[[Polygonum bistorta]]'', commonly known as knotweed.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} The nature of this plant is of [[inflorescence]] (a cluster of flowers on a branch).  In the portrait there are groups of knotweed shown in various stages, from initial blossoming with pink to mature florets with the color receded. (Jander charactizes Beethoven as \"nature-loving\" and recalls the [[Heiligenstadt Testament]] where the composer wrote \"as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered\u2026,\" an allusion very similar to the one depicted in the portrait.){{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} Jander proposes that the fading color of the plant is a metaphor to the composer's loss of hearing.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=64}}\n\n=== The lyre-guitar ===\n\nThough M\u00e4hler described the instrument as a [[lyre]],{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Jander identified it specifically as a [[lyre-guitar]], an instrument popular in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=65}}  The interpretation is that, with his hand holding the instrument, Beethoven draws forth music. But lyre-guitars normally have six strings, while the one Beethoven is holding has only five.  With the pegs of the strings arranged in two rows, Jander identified the missing string as being one of the higher-pitched strings, suggesting a visual metaphor for Beethoven's inability to hear high frequencies.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The cape ===\n\nJander quotes Sulzer who described the arrangement of clothing in graphic art could depict \"a soul agitated through passion.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}  Below Beethoven's back there is a dark blue cape which has fallen from his shoulders.  Most of the cape lies in a heap in the lower right hand corner of the picture, which \"intensifies the message of divestment.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}} In part this is a reference to the painting of the composer's grandfather, whose falling cape represented the overcoming of grief.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The right hand ===\n\nSulzer (as quoted by Jander) said that gestures should never cause so much attention as to distract the viewer away from the face.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=68}} The enigmatic nature of the depiction of Beethoven's right hand appears to have puzzled both Thayer and Jander.  Thayer recalled M\u00e4hler offering a description: \"...the right hand is extended, as if, in a moment of musical enthusiasm, he was beating time...\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Thayer provided his own thoughts:{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337\u2013338}}\n\n{{quote|The extended right hand\u2014though, like the rest of the picture, not very artistically executed\u2014was evidently painted with care.

Musical instrument in hand, he projects himself as beginning to move toward the calm, sun-drenched field [and temple to Apollo] to his right.\" Just as music had rescued his grandfather from overwhelming grief, so too does music provide life's direction for Beethoven and solace from deafness.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=69}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Thayer's copy]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation|last=Bellofatto|first=Luigi|last2=Jander|first2=Owen|title=Thayer's Copy of the M\u00e4hler Portrait of Beethoven, ca. 1804|journal=Beethoven Journal|volume=21|issue=2 |year=2006|pages=13\u201315}}\n*{{citation|last=Comini|first=Alessandra|title=The Changing Image of Beethoven: a Study in Mythmaking|edition=Revised with a new foreword by the author|year=2008|location=Santa Fe, NM|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=9780865346611}}\n*{{citation|last=Jander|first=Owen|title='Let Your Deafness No Longer Be a Secret--Even in Art': Self-Portraiture and the Third Movement of the C-Minor Symphony|journal=Beethoven Forum|volume=8|issue=1|year=2008|pages=25\u201370}}\n*{{citation|last=Thayer|first=Alexander Wheelock|authorlink=Alexander Wheelock Thayer|title=Thayer's life of Beethoven|editor-last=Forbes|editor-first=Elliot|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1967|isbn=9780691027029|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thayerslifeofbee00thay}}\n*{{citation|last=von Breuning|first=Gerhard|title=Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause: Erinnerungen an L. van Beethoven aus meiner Jugendzeit|location=Wien|publisher=L.

Following withdrawals by other bidding cities during the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] bidding process that led to just two candidate cities (Los Angeles and [[Paris bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Paris]]), the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) announced that the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] would be awarded at the same time as 2024. After extended negotiations, Los Angeles agreed to bid for the 2028 Games if certain conditions were met. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 games, with [[US Dollar|$]]1.8 billion of additional funding to support local sports and the Games program.\n\nLos Angeles was chosen by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) on August 28, 2015, after the [[Los Angeles City Council]] voted unanimously to back the bid. Los Angeles was the second city submitted by the USOC for the 2024 Summer Olympics. [[Boston bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Boston]] was originally chosen to be the American bid but withdrew on July 27, 2015. Los Angeles also originally bid for the USOC's nomination in late 2014, when Boston was chosen over Los Angeles, [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[San Francisco]]. This was the third United States summer bid since hosting the [[Centennial Olympic Games]] (1996) in Atlanta, previously losing in 2012 and 2016 to London and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nLos Angeles previously hosted the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] and will become the third city \u2013 after London and Paris in 2024 \u2013 to host the Summer Games three times. Los Angeles will become the first American city to host the Olympic games since the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. It will be the fifth time a US city has hosted the Summer Olympics.\n\n==Bid history==\n\n[[File:LA2024 FinalLogo.png|thumb|left|Initial campaign logo]]\nIn 2006, [[Los Angeles bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles entered the bidding]] to become the US applicant city for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]; the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) selected [[Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Chicago]] instead that year.

Following withdrawals by other bidding cities during the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] bidding process that led to just two candidate cities (Los Angeles and [[Paris bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Paris]]), the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) announced that the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] would be awarded at the same time as 2024. After extended negotiations, Los Angeles agreed to bid for the 2028 Games if certain conditions were met. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 games, with [[US Dollar|$]]1.8 billion of additional funding to support local sports and the Games program.\n\nLos Angeles was chosen by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) on August 28, 2015, after the [[Los Angeles City Council]] voted unanimously to back the bid. Los Angeles was the second city submitted by the USOC for the 2024 Summer Olympics. [[Boston bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Boston]] was originally chosen to be the American bid but withdrew on July 27, 2015. Los Angeles also originally bid for the USOC's nomination in late 2014, when Boston was chosen over Los Angeles, [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[San Francisco]]. This was the third United States summer bid since hosting the [[Centennial Olympic Games]] (1996) in Atlanta, previously losing in 2012 and 2016 to London and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nLos Angeles previously hosted the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] and will become the third city \u2013 after London and Paris in 2024 \u2013 to host the Summer Games three times.

For his new decade debut, Wayne takes a 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks' approach, only hitting the target about half the time. Wayne is at his best when he dives into a beat and shows off his technical skill. He still has endless punchlines to punctuate his effortless flow. He still has clear vision and awareness of his place in the hip-hop game. However, Wayne is not a great editor, and thus listening to ''Funeral'' can become exhausting about halfway through. While listeners may be fatigued, however, Wayne is far from it. ''Funeral'' isn't an ending point or a period at the end of a successful career. It's an ellipsis, a thought to be continued next time Weezy graces the studio\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/02/album-review-lil-wayne-funeral/|title=Album Review: Lil Wayne's Funeral Celebrates a Life That's Far from Over|date=February 3, 2020|website=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> Jacob Carey of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' criticized the length of the album, stating: \"While ''Funeral'' isn't necessarily a flop, the album would have ranked higher in Lil Wayne's discography had he cut the tracklist in half and opted for quality over quantity.

For every exhilarating left turn ('Mama Mia' was made to open up the mosh pits), there's a soulless radio anthem such as 'Clap For Em' \u2013 and that's before we even mention the unspeakable [[Adam Levine]] duet 'Trust Nobody'. At nearly 80 minutes long, ''Funeral'' is obviously bloated and an attempt to play into streaming politics, and it's a real shame that the ambitious druggy swirl of some of the earlier material is replaced with more formulaic songwriting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/lil-wayne-funeral-review-the-big-kid-2604385|title=Lil Wayne \u2013 'Funeral' review|date=February 2, 2020|website=NME||accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> \n\nDanny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a negative review, saying \"''Funeral'' is wildly uneven, a landscape of pronounced highs and lows. In truth, it peaks early, on 'Mahogany'.\" Schwartz called \"Trust Nobody\" the worst song on the album, labeling it a \"sunk by a banal and out-of-place Adam Levine hook, while noting that \"Get Out Of My Head\" is \"soured by the great rap pedant [[XXXTentacion]]\" and called \"Sights and Silencers\" a \"surprisingly limp [[The-Dream]] ballad that he should have just given to [[Jeremih]]\". Schwartz concluded: \"''Funeral'' is pockmarked with [[Dud|duds]] [...]  Lil Wayne's previous album, ''[[Tha Carter V]]'', was also overlong, but it was at least anchored by a gentle familial undercurrent.

For his new decade debut, Wayne takes a 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks' approach, only hitting the target about half the time. Wayne is at his best when he dives into a beat and shows off his technical skill. He still has endless punchlines to punctuate his effortless flow. He still has clear vision and awareness of his place in the hip-hop game. However, Wayne is not a great editor, and thus listening to ''Funeral'' can become exhausting about halfway through. While listeners may be fatigued, however, Wayne is far from it. ''Funeral'' isn't an ending point or a period at the end of a successful career. It's an ellipsis, a thought to be continued next time Weezy graces the studio\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/02/album-review-lil-wayne-funeral/|title=Album Review: Lil Wayne's Funeral Celebrates a Life That's Far from Over|date=February 3, 2020|website=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> Jacob Carey of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' criticized the length of the album, stating: \"While ''Funeral'' isn't necessarily a flop, the album would have ranked higher in Lil Wayne's discography had he cut the tracklist in half and opted for quality over quantity. Overall, ''Funeral'' lacks replay value compared to the multiple 'best of the year' albums that Wayne has proven capable of creating.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/lil_wayne-funeral|title=Lil Wayne Funeral|website=exclaim.ca|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[NME]]'''s Thomas Hobbs found the album inconsistent, writing: \"The problem with ''Funeral'' is that there's no real thread holding the music together. For every exhilarating left turn ('Mama Mia' was made to open up the mosh pits), there's a soulless radio anthem such as 'Clap For Em' \u2013 and that's before we even mention the unspeakable [[Adam Levine]] duet 'Trust Nobody'. At nearly 80 minutes long, ''Funeral'' is obviously bloated and an attempt to play into streaming politics, and it's a real shame that the ambitious druggy swirl of some of the earlier material is replaced with more formulaic songwriting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/lil-wayne-funeral-review-the-big-kid-2604385|title=Lil Wayne \u2013 'Funeral' review|date=February 2, 2020|website=NME||accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref> \n\nDanny Schwartz of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a negative review, saying \"''Funeral'' is wildly uneven, a landscape of pronounced highs and lows. In truth, it peaks early, on 'Mahogany'.\" Schwartz called \"Trust Nobody\" the worst song on the album, labeling it a \"sunk by a banal and out-of-place Adam Levine hook, while noting that \"Get Out Of My Head\" is \"soured by the great rap pedant [[XXXTentacion]]\" and called \"Sights and Silencers\" a \"surprisingly limp [[The-Dream]] ballad that he should have just given to [[Jeremih]]\". Schwartz concluded: \"''Funeral'' is pockmarked with [[Dud|duds]] [...]  Lil Wayne's previous album, ''[[Tha Carter V]]'', was also overlong, but it was at least anchored by a gentle familial undercurrent. Aside from a few moments, like 'Bastard (Satan's Kid)' which touches on Wayne's father's neglectful parenting, ''Funeral'' is emotionally adrift. As Wayne heads into a new decade\u2014his fourth as a professional rapper\u2014it's hard to [know] where his head is at, where he's coming from, or where he's going\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/lil-wayne-funeral-946939/|title=Lil Wayne Displays Moments of Genius on the Wildly Uneven 'Funeral'|last=Schwartz|first=Danny|date=February 3, 2020|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nConversely, [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]'s Sheldon Pearce gave an overall positive review, saying \"Weezy is back in the booth and cruising, experimenting with an array of styles and a dizzying maze of wordplay\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork\" /> Furthermore, writing for [[The Guardian|''The Guardian'']], Kitty Empire gave the album a positive review, saying \"Wayne's unheralded 13th studio album proves that the 37-year-old's flow can still be fearsome, even if his edit function remains iffy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/09/lil-wayne-funeral-review|title=Lil Wayne: Funeral review \u2013 fearsome and full of life|last=Empire|first=Kitty|date=February 9, 2020|website=The Guardian|accessdate=February 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Funeral'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] dated February 15, 2020, with 139,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, of which 38,000 were pure album sales.

Luckily, Weezy made sure to revisit his project with modern sensibilities, imbuing the album with a sense of wisdom he may not possessed upon its initial conception.

Despite the revelations, the album is not without its expected bangers.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim!\"/> Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] said, \"Almost 90 minutes in length, it's pieced together with material recorded from years to weeks ahead of release, and one cut goes back to resemble an early-2000s crossover bid, from its smoothly melodic Mannie Fresh production to its Ashanti hook. A greater portion forms a sluggish, indistinct mass... For all the excess and buildup, this exhibits Wayne on an upswing, lucid and invigorated.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\nHowever, Jordan Bassett of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a more mixed review, stating that \"It could have been his emotional swansong, and much of this long-delayed album is an elegiac homage to Lil Wayne's outlier status as an elder statesman of hip-hop. Sadly, he cheapens himself on ''Tha Carter V''\", later clarifying the reason as 'misogyny'\". Jon Sorentino Caramanica from ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"Excess bravado was always a part of his proposition, but this album drags and seeps, with long stretches of shrugs in between moments of invention.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/arts/music/lil-wayne-tha-carter-v-logic-ysiv-review.html|title=Lil Wayne Becomes an Elder, While Logic Grows Up|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 3, 2018|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref> Lil Wayne can still spew bars with dizzying dexterity, but his self-editing isn't great; there are terrific beats (Uproar) and lame ones (Took His Time).

Amorosi of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a very positive review, writing, \"Musically, despite the age of some of the songs, ''V'' is fresh, flush and even frenetic at times, with the crunch of the Southern trap and ropey rap-rock sounds that Wayne pretty much started in the first place.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/reviews/album-review-lil-waynes-tha-carter-v-1202961157/|title=Album Review: Lil Wayne's 'Tha Carter V\u2019|last=Amorosi|first=A.D.|date=September 28, 2018|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}</ref> Evan Rytlewski of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' said, \"The long-delayed album captures Wayne how we want to remember him: openhearted, word-drunk, and exhilarated by the possibilities of his own versatility\", and that \"the most surprising takeaway from ''Tha Carter V'', it turns out, isn't that Wayne still has music this vital in him. It's that after all these years, there's still more to learn about him.\"<ref name=Pitchfork/> Hanif Abdurraqib of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, \"Wayne is, by nature, an exciting rapper. His breathless, consistently accelerating flow is still present here, though not varied enough to work as well as it once did back in the day.\"<ref name=EW/> Mitch Findlay of ''HotNewHipHop'' said, \"''Tha Carter V'' seemed destined for anticlimax. Luckily, Weezy made sure to revisit his project with modern sensibilities, imbuing the album with a sense of wisdom he may not possessed upon its initial conception. As a result, ''Tha Carter V'' feels insightful enough to appease those seeking something new from Wayne, while staying familiar enough for the ones who simply missed the flourishment of rap's elder statesman.\"<ref name=\"HNHH\">{{cite web|last=Findlay|first=Mitch|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lil-wayne-tha-carter-v-review-news.61117.html|title=Logic Everybody Album Review|work=HotNewHipHop|date=October 1, 2018|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}</ref> Mosi Reeves from [[Rolling Stone]] said, \"It's an album full of poignant bars, fire, and passion from an artist who doesn't have anything left to prove\", and that \"Tha Carter V can't compare to the first three point five Carter installments, or his epochal 2005\u20132007 mixtape run. But it doesn't need to.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> Thomas Hobbs from Highsnobiety said, \u201cIt might not be the best in the Carter series, but it's potentially the most important, paving the way for a new chapter in Weezy's career where more philosophical lyricism should allow him to transition into the role of a rap elder statesman, a lot like JAY-Z did with ''4:44''. ''Tha Carter V'' is a testament to the notion that when its creator is feeling up to the task, he has the look and feel of one of the greats.\u201d<ref name=\"Highsnobiety\">{{cite news|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-wayne-tha-carter-v-review/|title=Lil Wayne\u2019s ''Tha Carter V'' Is a Cathartic Return to Form|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|date=October 1, 2018|work=[[Highsnobiety]]|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref> The staff of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' magazine said, \"The album is indeed, as much for the journey that led to its release as the previously unseen layers that Weezy reveals.\"<ref name=\"XXL\"/> Erin Hannon from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' said, \"Relationships with women are at the forefront of ''Tha Carter V'', including a desperate cry for help from his mother on \"I Love You Dwayne,\" which leads into the sorrowful \"Don't Cry,\" featuring a chorus from the late XXXTENTACION. ... Despite the revelations, the album is not without its expected bangers.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim!\"/> Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] said, \"Almost 90 minutes in length, it's pieced together with material recorded from years to weeks ahead of release, and one cut goes back to resemble an early-2000s crossover bid, from its smoothly melodic Mannie Fresh production to its Ashanti hook. A greater portion forms a sluggish, indistinct mass... For all the excess and buildup, this exhibits Wayne on an upswing, lucid and invigorated.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\nHowever, Jordan Bassett of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a more mixed review, stating that \"It could have been his emotional swansong, and much of this long-delayed album is an elegiac homage to Lil Wayne's outlier status as an elder statesman of hip-hop. Sadly, he cheapens himself on ''Tha Carter V''\", later clarifying the reason as 'misogyny'\". Jon Sorentino Caramanica from ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"Excess bravado was always a part of his proposition, but this album drags and seeps, with long stretches of shrugs in between moments of invention.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/arts/music/lil-wayne-tha-carter-v-logic-ysiv-review.html|title=Lil Wayne Becomes an Elder, While Logic Grows Up|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 3, 2018|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref> Lil Wayne can still spew bars with dizzying dexterity, but his self-editing isn't great; there are terrific beats (Uproar) and lame ones (Took His Time). Mona Lisa is a piece of storytelling noir in which Wayne goes head-to-head with Kendrick Lamar, and does not come out lacking. It's not that C5 is too little, too late; more that the baton between the generations passed some time ago.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|+Year-end lists\n|-\n!

Therefore Keaton vows he will go the city and get a job, or commit suicide. He takes several jobs ([[janitor]], employee in an [[animal hospital]], [[street cleaner]], extra in a theatrical play,...) which all disastrously go wrong. In the final scenes he gets stuck inside a riverboat paddle wheel, where he has to run to get out of it. In the end he returns to his girlfriend's father, but since he failed in every way he is given a gun to shoot himself. Buster however manages to miss himself and is therefore kicked out the window by the girl's father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Buster Keaton]] as The Young Man\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e]] as The Girl \n* [[Edward F.

The face of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. \n\nThe result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of [[classical mechanics]]. A die roll is made [[Randomness|random]] by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of [[hardware random number generator]]. \n\nOne typical contemporary [[List of dice games|dice game]] is [[craps]], where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into [[board game]]s, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in [[backgammon]] and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'').\n\n==Construction==\n===Arrangement===\n[[File:Chiralit\u00e4t von W\u00fcrfeln V.2.svg|thumb|left|[[Chirality]] of dice. Faces may be placed [[clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise (top) ''or'' clockwise]].]]\nCommon dice are small [[cube]]s, most often {{convert|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} across,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dicegamedepot.com/dice-sizes/|title=Dice Sizes Explained|date=2018|website=Dice Game Depot}}</ref> whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of [[Arabic numerals]] is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)\n\nOpposite sides of a modern die traditionally add up to seven, requiring the 1, 2, and 3 faces to share a vertex.<ref>Cf. [https://archive.org/details/greekanthology05newyuoft ''Greek Anthology''] Book 14, \u00a78: \"The Opposite Pairs of Numbers on a Die. The numbers on a die run so: six one, five two, three four.\"</ref> The faces of a die may be placed [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise or counterclockwise]] about this vertex. If the 1, 2, and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called \"right-handed\". If those faces run clockwise, the die is called \"left-handed\". Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.<ref name=\"diceplay\">{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/DiceStandard.htm |title=Standard Dice |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730085649/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/dice-play/DiceStandard.htm |archivedate=30 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Die Faces.svg|thumb|upright|Typical facets showing the more compact pip arrangement of an Asian-style die (top) vs. a Western-style die (bottom)]]\n\nThe pips on dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown.

The pips or numbers on the die are a part of the mold.  Different pigments can be added to the dice to make them opaque or transparent, or multiple pigments may be added to make the dice speckled or marbled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmdice.com/blogs/dnd/how-are-dice-made|title=7 Surprising Facts About How Dice Are Made (With Pictures)|website=gmdice.com|access-date=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the die entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry. The die is then polished via a [[tumble finishing]] process similar to [[rock polishing]]. The [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasive agent]] scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also creates the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.<ref name=\"awesomedice\">[http://www.awesomedice.com/blog/64/how-dice-are-made/ How Dice Are Made] from Awesome Dice</ref>\n\nPrecision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same [[density]] as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible.

While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. \n\nThe modern tradition of using ''sets'' of polyhedral dice started around the end of the 1960s when non-cubical dice became popular among players of [[Wargaming|wargames]],<ref name=\"Peterson2012\">{{cite book |first=Jon |last=Peterson |title=Playing at the World: A History of Simulating Wars, People and Fantastic Adventures, from Chess to Role-Playing Games |date=July 2012 |publisher=Unreason Press |isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 |pages=315\u2013318 }}</ref> and since have been employed extensively in [[role-playing game]]s and [[collectible card game|trading card games]]. Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.\n\n====Standard variations====\n{{Further information|isohedral figure{{!}}isohedron}}\nDice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the [[Platonic solid]]s, whose faces are [[regular polygon]]s. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal [[trapezohedron]] die, whose faces are ten [[kite (geometry)|kites]], each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to [[normal distribution]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |title=Tumbling Dice & Birthdays: Understanding the Central Limit Theorem |publisher=Minitab |first=Michelle |last=Paret |first2=Eston |last2=Martz |year=2009 |accessdate=29 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101141751/http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2013 }}</ref> \n\nUnlike other common dice, a [[four-sided die|four-sided (tetrahedral) die]] does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it must be read in a different way. On some four-sided dice, each face features multiple numbers, with same number printed near each vertex on all sides. In this case, the number around the vertex pointing up is used. Alternatively, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middles of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are used.\n\nNormally, the faces on a die will be placed so opposite faces will add up to one more than the number of faces. (This is not possible with 4-sided dice and dice with an odd-number of faces.) Some dice, such as those with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is a less symmetric tetrahedron than the Platonic tetrahedron, but still sufficiently symmetrical to be face-transitive. Similarly, [[Pyritohedron|pyritohedra]] and [[tetartoid]]s are less symmetrical but still face-transitive dodecahedra: 12 sides.\n\n[[Long dice]] and [[teetotum]]s can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aleakybos.ch/Properties%20of%20Dice.pdf |title=Properties of Dice |first=Alea |last=Kybos |accessdate=7 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528013233/http://www.aleakybos.ch/Properties%20of%20Dice.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2012 }}</ref> Long dice are based on the infinite set of [[prism (geometry)|prisms]].

The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost.

Note the older hand-inked green 12-sided die (showing an 11), manufactured before pre-inked dice were common. Many players collect or acquire a large number of mixed and unmatching dice.]]\nPolyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like ''[[Exalted]]'' which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, [[dice notation]] is frequently used.\n\nMany board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as ''[[Axis & Allies]]'', have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In ''[[Castles of Burgundy]]'', players spend their dice to take actions based on the die's value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In ''[[Quarriors]]'' (and its descendant, Dicemasters), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/10/02/making-better-use-of-dice-in-g.html|title=Making better use of dice in games|date=2 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDice can be used for [[divination]] and using dice for such a purpose is called [[cleromancy]]. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this [[Mo (divination)|method of divination]]. It is highly likely that the [[Pythagoreans]] used the [[Platonic solids]] as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Pythagorean sourcebook and library: an anthology of ancient writings which relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy|last=Guthrie|first=Kenneth|publisher=Phanes Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-933999-50-3|location=Grand Rapids, MI|oclc=255212063}}</ref>\n\nAstrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the [[orbital node|nodes]] of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses.

A \"d\" or \"D\" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example, <code>d4</code> denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence, <code>6d8</code> means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, <code>3d6+4</code> instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Master Jean de Maul\u00e9on - Playing Dice - Walters W4492V - Full Page.jpg|thumb|Medieval People at Play, The [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore]]\n\n* [[Crown and Anchor]]\n* [[d20 System]]\n* [[Dreidel]]\n* [[Fuzzy dice]]\n* ''[[Musikalisches W\u00fcrfelspiel]]''\n* [[Quincunx]]\n* [[Senary]]\n* [[Teetotum]]\n* [[Urim and Thummim]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* [[Persi Diaconis|Diaconis, Persi]]; and Keller, Joseph B.; [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/fairdice.pdf \"Fair Dice\"], ''The American Mathematical Monthly'', 96(4):337\u2013339, 1989 (Discussion of dice that are fair \"by symmetry\" and \"by continuity\".)\n* Iverson, G.

The face of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. \n\nThe result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of [[classical mechanics]]. A die roll is made [[Randomness|random]] by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of [[hardware random number generator]]. \n\nOne typical contemporary [[List of dice games|dice game]] is [[craps]], where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into [[board game]]s, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in [[backgammon]] and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'').\n\n==Construction==\n===Arrangement===\n[[File:Chiralit\u00e4t von W\u00fcrfeln V.2.svg|thumb|left|[[Chirality]] of dice.

The die is then polished via a [[tumble finishing]] process similar to [[rock polishing]]. The [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasive agent]] scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also creates the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.<ref name=\"awesomedice\">[http://www.awesomedice.com/blog/64/how-dice-are-made/ How Dice Are Made] from Awesome Dice</ref>\n\nPrecision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same [[density]] as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. This mitigates concerns that the pips will cause a small bias.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dice-play.com/DiceCasino.htm|title=Casino Dice|website=www.dice-play.com|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref> All such dice are stamped with a [[serial number]] to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die.

While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. \n\nThe modern tradition of using ''sets'' of polyhedral dice started around the end of the 1960s when non-cubical dice became popular among players of [[Wargaming|wargames]],<ref name=\"Peterson2012\">{{cite book |first=Jon |last=Peterson |title=Playing at the World: A History of Simulating Wars, People and Fantastic Adventures, from Chess to Role-Playing Games |date=July 2012 |publisher=Unreason Press |isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 |pages=315\u2013318 }}</ref> and since have been employed extensively in [[role-playing game]]s and [[collectible card game|trading card games]]. Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.\n\n====Standard variations====\n{{Further information|isohedral figure{{!}}isohedron}}\nDice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the [[Platonic solid]]s, whose faces are [[regular polygon]]s. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal [[trapezohedron]] die, whose faces are ten [[kite (geometry)|kites]], each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to [[normal distribution]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |title=Tumbling Dice & Birthdays: Understanding the Central Limit Theorem |publisher=Minitab |first=Michelle |last=Paret |first2=Eston |last2=Martz |year=2009 |accessdate=29 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101141751/http://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Shared_Resources/Documents/Articles/CentralLimitTheorem.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2013 }}</ref> \n\nUnlike other common dice, a [[four-sided die|four-sided (tetrahedral) die]] does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it must be read in a different way. On some four-sided dice, each face features multiple numbers, with same number printed near each vertex on all sides. In this case, the number around the vertex pointing up is used. Alternatively, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middles of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are used.\n\nNormally, the faces on a die will be placed so opposite faces will add up to one more than the number of faces. (This is not possible with 4-sided dice and dice with an odd-number of faces.) Some dice, such as those with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for [[Boggle]], directions for ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'', [[Fudge (role-playing game system)#Fudge dice|Fudge dice]], playing card symbols for [[poker dice]], and instructions for sexual acts using [[sex dice]].\n\n===Alternatively numbered dice===\nDice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.<ref name=\"em4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.em4miniatures.com/acatalog/SPECIALIST_D6.html|title=Specialist D6|website=em4miniatures|access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"tmp\">{{Cite web|url=http://theminiaturespage.com/boards/msg.mv?id=184673|title=[TMP] 'What are Average Dice' Topic|date=20 November 2009|website=The Miniatures Page|language=en|access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref> These are six-sided dice with sides numbered <code>2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5</code>, which have the same [[arithmetic mean]] as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top [[wargaming|wargames]], where a narrower range of numbers is required.<ref name=\"tmp\" /> Other numbered variations include [[Sicherman dice]] and [[nontransitive dice]].\n\n===Spherical dice===\n[[File:Black and red round 6-sided die.jpg|150px|thumb|A spherical die]]\nA die can be constructed in the shape of a sphere, with the addition of an internal cavity in the shape of the [[dual polyhedron]] of the desired die shape and an internal weight. The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.\n\n==Applications==\n[[Image:Wuerfel5.jpg|thumb|180px|Typical role-playing dice, showing a variety of colors and styles. Note the older hand-inked green 12-sided die (showing an 11), manufactured before pre-inked dice were common. Many players collect or acquire a large number of mixed and unmatching dice.]]\nPolyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like ''[[Exalted]]'' which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, [[dice notation]] is frequently used.\n\nMany board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as ''[[Axis & Allies]]'', have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In ''[[Castles of Burgundy]]'', players spend their dice to take actions based on the die's value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In ''[[Quarriors]]'' (and its descendant, Dicemasters), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2014/10/02/making-better-use-of-dice-in-g.html|title=Making better use of dice in games|date=2 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDice can be used for [[divination]] and using dice for such a purpose is called [[cleromancy]]. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this [[Mo (divination)|method of divination]]. It is highly likely that the [[Pythagoreans]] used the [[Platonic solids]] as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Pythagorean sourcebook and library: an anthology of ancient writings which relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy|last=Guthrie|first=Kenneth|publisher=Phanes Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-933999-50-3|location=Grand Rapids, MI|oclc=255212063}}</ref>\n\nAstrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the [[orbital node|nodes]] of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. A specialized icosahedron die provides the answers of the [[Magic 8-Ball]], conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\nDice can be used to generate random numbers for use in [[Password|passwords]] and [[cryptography]] applications. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] describes a method by which dice can be used to generate [[Passphrase|passphrases]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/dice|title=EFF Dice-Generated Passphrases|date=2016-05-12|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}</ref> [[Diceware]] is a method recommended for generating secure but memorable passphrases, by repeatedly rolling five dice and picking the corresponding word from a pre-generated list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases|title=EFF's New Wordlists for Random Passphrases|date=19 July 2016|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Notation===\n{{Main|Dice notation}}\nIn many gaming contexts, especially tabletop role-playing games, shorthand notations representing different dice rolls are used. A \"d\" or \"D\" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example, <code>d4</code> denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence, <code>6d8</code> means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, <code>3d6+4</code> instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Master Jean de Maul\u00e9on - Playing Dice - Walters W4492V - Full Page.jpg|thumb|Medieval People at Play, The [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore]]\n\n* [[Crown and Anchor]]\n* [[d20 System]]\n* [[Dreidel]]\n* [[Fuzzy dice]]\n* ''[[Musikalisches W\u00fcrfelspiel]]''\n* [[Quincunx]]\n* [[Senary]]\n* [[Teetotum]]\n* [[Urim and Thummim]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* [[Persi Diaconis|Diaconis, Persi]]; and Keller, Joseph B.; [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/fairdice.pdf \"Fair Dice\"], ''The American Mathematical Monthly'', 96(4):337\u2013339, 1989 (Discussion of dice that are fair \"by symmetry\" and \"by continuity\".)\n* Iverson, G.
