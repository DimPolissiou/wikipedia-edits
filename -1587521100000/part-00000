Although library services were offered in Lynn as early 1815, it was not until a bequest in 1896 that the city began planning a permanent home for the growing collection.  After some controversy, library trustees chose a Renaissance Revival design by local architect George A. Moore, who happened to be related to one of the library trustees.  Controversy also attended the size and scale of the building, along with the removal of trees at its site on the [[Lynn Common Historic District|town common]].

F.

Filer, who had always been the president, proposed on behalf of the Pere Marquette Lumber Company to donate a site on Ludington Avenue.<ref name=\"hrpage88\"/> In this proposal all the lumber necessary for its construction would be provided.<ref name=\"cabot\"/> James Ludington was to donate $2500 to the city of Ludington for building the new structure and $1,000 each from D.

Filer and [[John Mason Loomis]].<ref name=\"cabot\"/><ref name=\"hrpage88\"/> The new structure was to accommodate the library on the main floor with county offices, a court room, and the city council chambers upstairs.<ref name=\"cabot\"/> This building with a library, however, was never built since James Ludington didn't come through with his donation because of financial setbacks in Milwaukee.<ref name=\"cabot\"/> Meanwhile, instead there was a [[Mason County Courthouse (Michigan)|Mason County Courthouse]] built in 1873 on Pere Marquette Street to accommodate the city and county offices only.<ref name=\"cabot\"/>\n\nNothing further was done toward plans for a new library structure and in time the matter was all but dropped.<ref name=\"hrpage88\"/> The library association subsequently moved to the second floor of the Gebhart Building at the southeast corner of Ludington Avenue and Harrison Street.<ref name=\"cabot\"/><ref name=\"justimagine3\"/><ref name=\"hrpage88\"/> Later in 1877 the library moved into the Temperance Hall after its new construction.<ref name=\"cabot\"/><ref name=\"justimagine3\"/><ref name=\"hrpage88\"/> This was at the northeast corner of Ludington Avenue and James Street.<ref name=\"cabot\"/><ref name=\"justimagine3\"/> Between 1877 and 1881 this library association hosted lectures by guests that included [[Susan B.

A Carnegie Grant of $15,000.00 and matching funds from the City of Ludington was put forth to build and support the new library that exists to this day.<ref name=\"news\"/>\n\nAndrew Carnegie distributed over 40 million dollars given in grants to United States communities to erect 1,689 libraries.<ref name=\"news\"/> The conditions for these new libraries were that Carnegie would provide the funds for the erection of the building, which was usually equal to about two dollars per local area resident. The local government had to then provide the construction site and an amount equal to 10 percent of the Carnegie grant annually from the city tax revenues to support the newly funded library.<ref name=\"news\"/> The city of Ludington provided the construction site and agreed to $1,500 annually (10% of the construction cost) for maintenance of the building.<ref name=\"news\"/> On March 1, 1906 the library opened.<ref>The Ludington Chronicle, Wednesday, February 28, 1906, article titled \"Open to the public Thursday, March 1st.\"</ref> On its opening in March 1906 the library had assembled a collection of 3,800 books.<ref name=\"justimagine3\"/><ref name =\"cabot2\"/>\n\n==Later history==\nIn 1975 a major remodeling and enlargement to the Ludington Public Library was begun.
