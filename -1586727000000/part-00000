It is produced by [[Siddharth Kumar Tewary]], Rahul Kumar Tiwary and Gayatri Gill Tiwary for [[Swastik Productions]] and is directed by Rahul Tiwari. It premiered on 1 October 2018 on [[Star Bharat]]. The show also started re-running on [[Star Plus]] from 30th March, 2020 from 7:30pm.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe series opens with [[Krishn]] devotee Sridama reaching the former's celestial home ([[Golok]]) along with Narad and getting upset at noticing that he has to recite Krishn's beloved [[Radha]]\u2019s name first for entry. The latter intellectually tries to prove that his devotion is higher than love which is nothing but illusion, but eventually realizes that true love supersedes everything. While doing so he ends up cursing Radha that she will spend 100 years outside their celestial home and will forget about Krishn. But the love between [[Radha Krishna]] is not physical but much deeper and platonic. No wonder when Krishn merely calls out her name, she hears.\nAlthough Sridama is very repentant at his action, he comes to understand that all this was part of the cosmic play as it was time for Krishn to make his entry in the mortal world. The story is about journey of Radha & Krishn's eternal love on earth and teaching the humans the true meaning of love.\n\nThe main motto of the story is ''\"Paane ko hi prem kare, jag ki hai yeh reet, prem arth samjhayegi, Radha-Krishn ki preet\"'' which means world misunderstands love as the thing we ask for or want in return of love but the true meaning of love is sacrifice, full devotion or dedication towards lover and happiness of lover, irrespective of other one's need or want, as taught by the love story of Radha-Krishna.\n\nIn this journey of teaching love to the world, with the help of curse of Radha by Sridama, Krishna lives the life of an ordinary human with extraordinary powers and takes Radha out of all humanly weaknesses like fear (''bhay''), attachment (''moh''), anger (''krodh''), hatred (''ghrina''), envy (''irshya''), ego (''ahankar'') and inferiority complex (''heenbhavna''). Radha comes more closer to Krishna after defeating each humanly weakness. In the greatest example of sacrifice (''tyaag''), the essence of true love, Radha-Krishn could not marry, even after being ardent lovers. But as Krishn says marriage is not the goal of love, it's just a stage in journey of love, which some lovers could achieve while some couldn't but that can't change and deny their true love. They sacrifice their love to tell world that the sacrifice is the essence of true love. Radha is forced to marry her childhood friend Ayan. But even that couldn't stop their love for each other, as they're lovers from time immemorial. Krishn one day makes her realise and get her supreme and eternal form of Radha of Golok for sometime, which Radha thinks to be a dream, although its reality. Finally, Radha understands the true meaning of love in the last stage of dedication and complaince (''samarpan''), which she understands after listening the story of seven [[avatar]]s of Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi from Krishn. The love of Lord Vishnu and Goddess [[Lakshmi]], how they got separated each time for betterment of the universe and to teach love to the world and how they got united after each avatar. Only after listening the stories of [[Gopal (Krishn)|Bal Krishn]] and seven avatars of Lord Vishnu, she realises her and Krishn's true love.\nIn this human life apart from his love story with Radha, Krishn along with [[Balaram]] fights the demons sent by [[Kamsa]], His maternal uncle, as he's the person who will kill Kans, like [[Putana|Putna]], Trinavart, Bakasur, [[Aghasur|Aghasur]], Vyomasur, Arishtasur, Dhumrasur, Markadikasur, [[Keshi (demon)|Keshi]], Timirasur, Shankhchur, Karkashasur, Ekdansh, Jwalantak, Sudarshan, demoness enchantress Sammohana, Dhenukasur and [[Pralamba|Pralambasur]]. In the end, he sends his eight demon brothers to defeat Radha-Krishna but they also get defeated by Radha with her [[Ashtalakshmi]] forms. Kans also pits the likes of [[Shiva|Shiv]], [[Mahakali]], [[Indra]], [[Shukracharya]], [[Yamuna]], [[K\u0101la]]{{dn|date=January 2020}}, [[Durvasa]], [[Ashtavakra]], Mahamaya and even [[Halahala|Kalakut Halahal]] poison against Krishna and at some times Radha but all in vain. Finally, he calls Krishna to [[Mathura]] by sending [[Akrur]]. He along with Balaram fights with Kans's aides like Julaha, Kuvalyapeed, Shalva, Tushan, Chanur, Kuth and Mushtik before killing Kans in a wrestling dual. Balaram kills all the eight brothers of Kans. Krishnaovercomes all the hurdles created by Kans in the way to complete Radha-Krishna's love. He also performs other miraculous activities like [[Yashoda]] Maiya witnessing Universe in Krishn's mouth, Nalkuber and Manigreeva Shaap Vimochan, [[Kaliya]] Naag Mardan and [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhan Leela]]. The story also focuses on the establishment of [[Vrindavan]], [[Radha Kund]] & Shyam Kund, Keshi Ghat, Prem Sarovar, Nidhi Van, Moti Kund, Kusum Sarovar, Adher Ghat and Yugal Ghat along with many other unheard stories about Radha-Krishna, in [[Braj]] region, where Radha-Krishn lived. Krishn performs [[Raas leela|Raas Leela]] with Radha and other [[Gopi]]s. Krishn also takes different forms in different stages of this eternal love story with Radha. [[Brahma|Brahmadev]] completes Brahma Vivaah of Radha-Krishn right before Krishn leaves Barsana after Radha's coronation as Radharani. The series also showcases the love story of [[Balaram]] and [[Revati]] and their marriage and love story \nof Krishna and [[Rukmini]]. Then story goes how Krishna married Jambavati, Satyabhama, Khalindi, Mitravinda, Nagnajiti, Lakshmana and Bhadra.

It is produced by [[Siddharth Kumar Tewary]], Rahul Kumar Tiwary and Gayatri Gill Tiwary for [[Swastik Productions]] and is directed by Rahul Tiwari. It premiered on 1 October 2018 on [[Star Bharat]]. The show also started re-running on [[Star Plus]] from 30th March, 2020 from 7:30pm.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe series opens with [[Krishn]] devotee Sridama reaching the former's celestial home ([[Golok]]) along with Narad and getting upset at noticing that he has to recite Krishn's beloved [[Radha]]\u2019s name first for entry. The latter intellectually tries to prove that his devotion is higher than love which is nothing but illusion, but eventually realizes that true love supersedes everything. While doing so he ends up cursing Radha that she will spend 100 years outside their celestial home and will forget about Krishn. But the love between [[Radha Krishna]] is not physical but much deeper and platonic. No wonder when Krishn merely calls out her name, she hears.\nAlthough Sridama is very repentant at his action, he comes to understand that all this was part of the cosmic play as it was time for Krishn to make his entry in the mortal world. The story is about journey of Radha & Krishn's eternal love on earth and teaching the humans the true meaning of love.\n\nThe main motto of the story is ''\"Paane ko hi prem kare, jag ki hai yeh reet, prem arth samjhayegi, Radha-Krishn ki preet\"'' which means world misunderstands love as the thing we ask for or want in return of love but the true meaning of love is sacrifice, full devotion or dedication towards lover and happiness of lover, irrespective of other one's need or want, as taught by the love story of Radha-Krishna.\n\nIn this journey of teaching love to the world, with the help of curse of Radha by Sridama, Krishna lives the life of an ordinary human with extraordinary powers and takes Radha out of all humanly weaknesses like fear (''bhay''), attachment (''moh''), anger (''krodh''), hatred (''ghrina''), envy (''irshya''), ego (''ahankar'') and inferiority complex (''heenbhavna''). Radha comes more closer to Krishna after defeating each humanly weakness. In the greatest example of sacrifice (''tyaag''), the essence of true love, Radha-Krishn could not marry, even after being ardent lovers. But as Krishn says marriage is not the goal of love, it's just a stage in journey of love, which some lovers could achieve while some couldn't but that can't change and deny their true love. They sacrifice their love to tell world that the sacrifice is the essence of true love. Radha is forced to marry her childhood friend Ayan. But even that couldn't stop their love for each other, as they're lovers from time immemorial. Krishn one day makes her realise and get her supreme and eternal form of Radha of Golok for sometime, which Radha thinks to be a dream, although its reality. Finally, Radha understands the true meaning of love in the last stage of dedication and complaince (''samarpan''), which she understands after listening the story of seven [[avatar]]s of Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi from Krishn. The love of Lord Vishnu and Goddess [[Lakshmi]], how they got separated each time for betterment of the universe and to teach love to the world and how they got united after each avatar. Only after listening the stories of [[Gopal (Krishn)|Bal Krishn]] and seven avatars of Lord Vishnu, she realises her and Krishn's true love.\nIn this human life apart from his love story with Radha, Krishn along with [[Balaram]] fights the demons sent by [[Kamsa]], His maternal uncle, as he's the person who will kill Kans, like [[Putana|Putna]], Trinavart, Bakasur, [[Aghasur|Aghasur]], Vyomasur, Arishtasur, Dhumrasur, Markadikasur, [[Keshi (demon)|Keshi]], Timirasur, Shankhchur, Karkashasur, Ekdansh, Jwalantak, Sudarshan, demoness enchantress Sammohana, Dhenukasur and [[Pralamba|Pralambasur]]. In the end, he sends his eight demon brothers to defeat Radha-Krishna but they also get defeated by Radha with her [[Ashtalakshmi]] forms. Kans also pits the likes of [[Shiva|Shiv]], [[Mahakali]], [[Indra]], [[Shukracharya]], [[Yamuna]], [[K\u0101la]]{{dn|date=January 2020}}, [[Durvasa]], [[Ashtavakra]], Mahamaya and even [[Halahala|Kalakut Halahal]] poison against Krishna and at some times Radha but all in vain. Finally, he calls Krishna to [[Mathura]] by sending [[Akrur]]. He along with Balaram fights with Kans's aides like Julaha, Kuvalyapeed, Shalva, Tushan, Chanur, Kuth and Mushtik before killing Kans in a wrestling dual. Balaram kills all the eight brothers of Kans. Krishnaovercomes all the hurdles created by Kans in the way to complete Radha-Krishna's love. He also performs other miraculous activities like [[Yashoda]] Maiya witnessing Universe in Krishn's mouth, Nalkuber and Manigreeva Shaap Vimochan, [[Kaliya]] Naag Mardan and [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhan Leela]].

It is about five miles (8&nbsp;km) south-east of [[High Wycombe]] and three miles (5&nbsp;km) east of [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], near the border with [[Berkshire]] and close to where the [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|River Wye]] empties into the Thames.<ref name=\"WDC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wycombe.gov.uk/uploads/documents/Community%20and%20living/Wooburn%20parish%20fact%20file.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927004406/http://www.wycombe.gov.uk/uploads/documents/Community%20and%20living/Wooburn%20parish%20fact%20file.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2006 |title=Wooburn and Bourne End parish fact file, December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2006 |format=PDF |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBourne End's original location differed from today's established village centre, and was a half-mile downstream on the River Thames. The name refers to the end of the river (''bourne'' being an obsolete term for river), and derived from the mouth of the River Wye. Then a hamlet, it appears on Morden's 1722 map of Buckinghamshire as \"Born end\".<ref name=\"Map\">{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_files/ENG/BKM/morden_bkm_1722.html |title=Buckinghamshire 1722, Robert Morden in Camden's Britannia |accessdate=17 December 2007}}</ref> It was noted in the 19th century, however, that the name had been corrupted to \"Bone End\", apparently through local mispronunciation, and thence on official maps and documents. In 1858, the vicar of [[Wooburn]] succeeded in reversing the change, and the corrected name remains in use today.<ref name=\"BBW\">{{cite book |last=Wheals |first=Brian Brenchley |year=1983 |title=Theirs Were But Human Hearts |publisher=H. S. Publishing |isbn=0-9509053-0-5}}</ref>\n\nThe length of the River Wye was the provider of water power for many [[watermill|mill]]s in the valley for hundreds of years, and Bourne End was no exception. There were four on the final stretch of the river: Princes Mill, Jacksons (or Gunpowder) Mill, Hedsor Mill and Lower Mill. These mills were historically the predominant employers in the area, along with the local farms and two [[wharf]]s on the Thames.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, the settlement known as Bourne End was a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Wooburn]] parish, along with others such as Spring Gardens, Eghams Green, [[Cores End]], Heavens Lea and Upper Bourne End. This changed with the emergence of the [[Wycombe Railway|Wycombe Railway Company]] in 1846. By 1854, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] had designed and constructed a railway linking [[Maidenhead]] to [[High Wycombe]], via Bourne End. The station at Bourne End was originally named Marlow Road; then in 1873 a branch line to [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] was built, and a year later the station was renamed [[Bourne End railway station|Bourne End station]] to avoid confusion with the new station at Marlow town.<ref name=\"MMP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mmpa.org.uk/history.html |title=Maidenhead and Marlow Passengers Association |accessdate=3 February 2005}}</ref> The railway created more travel opportunities for locals and greatly benefited the mills, and thus Bourne End expanded, on a greater scale than other similar settlements in the surrounding area. ''See [[Marlow Branch Line]] and [[Marlow Donkey]] for more information.''\n\nThe hamlets soon merged into what is now known as Bourne End, as did [[Well End, Buckinghamshire|Well End]] and [[Coldmoorholme]] in the neighbouring parish of Little Marlow. Both a church and school were built at the turn of the century for the residents' convenience. The Parade became established as the focal point of the village for shops and services.\n\nIn the 1920s Bourne End became home for two distinguished literary figures; [[Enid Blyton]], a perennially popular children's writer, moved into Old Thatch on Coldmoorholme Lane, and [[Edgar Wallace]], a prolific crime author and dramatist, bought Chalklands off Blind Lane. Another resident at this time was [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]], the French aviator and aircraft builder, who lived at New York Lodge beside the Thames.<ref>Christopher Winn: ''I Never Knew That about the Thames'' (London: Ebury Press, 2010), p. 112.</ref>\n\nThe Royalty Cinema opened in The Parade in 1934. The late 1940s saw extensive development in Bourne End, of the Chalklands estate and the [[Council Estate]] north of The Parade. The 1960s saw the building of Community Centre and Library in Wakeman Road after some years of local campaigning.\n\nThe [[Beeching Axe]] hit the village in 1969, as it was announced that the line between Bourne End and [[High Wycombe]] would be shut. The track bed was lifted soon after closure in 1970. A commercial estate was developed adjacent to the station, though most remains as a footpath between the village and [[Wooburn]].\n\n==Today==\n===Locale===\nBourne End lies between the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[M40 motorway|M40]] motorways, and retains its railway station on the [[Maidenhead railway station|Maidenhead]] to [[Marlow railway station|Marlow]] [[Marlow Branch Line|branch line]]. With rail and road accessibility to London, it has become a popular place for [[commuters]] to live.\n\nAll of the mills along the Wye Valley have now been shut down and demolished, Jacksons Mill in Furlong Road being the last (in Bourne End) in the late 1980s. These have been replaced by houses, offices or industrial estates, which has led to the continuation of the village as an employment centre.\n\nBourne End remains a distinct settlement, although the continued house-building over the past century means it is threatened by the evident [[ribbon development]], through to High Wycombe. In 1997, when the Local Plan was in preparation, the Residents Associations of Bourne End and Wooburn successfully lobbied to stop Slate Meadow (the field which separates the two settlements) being designated for housing for the time being. Other undeveloped land around the village looks likely to remain so, as it has been specified as [[Green Belt]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], or a combination of the three. In parts, Bourne End is surrounded by [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]]. Somewhat further away, [[Cliveden]] and [[Hedsor]] overlook the village from higher ground to the south east.\n\n===Community===\nBourne End sustains many businesses and services whilst still retaining a village-like atmosphere. There is a Community Centre in the centre of the village, with a large hall, function rooms and a bar, which is open for member's use. It is, for many, considered the focal point of village activity.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a Twinning Association was established, and subsequently [[Octeville-sur-Mer]], a town on the north coast of France, was chosen to be its twin town. Frequent events are held by members of the association to foster and enhance the relationship between the two settlements.\n\n===Administration and services===\nThe local government of the village is made up of three tiers. [[Wooburn and Bourne End|Wooburn and Bourne End Parish Council]] (formerly Wooburn Parish Council, until 2005), based in [[Wooburn]]; [[Wycombe District Council]], based in [[High Wycombe]]; and [[Buckinghamshire County Council]], based in [[Aylesbury]]. The local police force is [[Thames Valley Police]], who have an office in Boston Drive from which the local constables operate. Local healthcare services are commissioned by [[National Health Service|Buckinghamshire Primary Care Trust (PCT)]]; [[General Practitioner|GPs]] operate from The Hawthornden Surgery in Wharf Lane, and The Orchard Surgery in Station Road, and district nurses and health visitors are based at the Bourne End Clinic in Wakeman Road. There are two dentists, the Bourne End Dental Practice, and Advance Dental Services, both in Station Road.\n\n==Leisure==\n[[Image:Bourne End Marina.JPG|thumb|Bourne End Marina on the River Thames]]\nThe village has two recreation grounds (Furlong Road and Blind Lane), riverside open space at the [[marina]] and Spade Oak Reach, a Junior Sports Club and fitness centre and the long-established Upper Thames Sailing Club. For many residents and visitors alike, the river is the central attraction of Bourne End, and many leisure pursuits involve or revolve around it. The Sailing Club traditionally host a week-long regatta every year in June, known as ''Bourne End Week''.\n\nBourne End hosts a number of restaurants of varying cuisines. There are also a number of [[Public houses]].\n\nNear Bourne End, across the River Thames, is [[Cock Marsh]], an area of [[common land]] and [[floodplain]] owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. It is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] and has a prehistoric burial mound. Cock Marsh is accessible via the footbridge (attached to the [[Bourne End Railway Bridge|railway bridge]]) over the river, and footpaths continue to [[Cookham]], [[Cookham Dean]] and beyond.\n\nThe [[Thames Path]] National Trail follows the River Thames through Bourne End; upstream on the Buckinghamshire side, crossing the river at the footbridge, and downstream through Berkshire.\n\n==Education==\nBourne End has three schools:\n*Westfield School, on Highfield Road, a [[special school]] which was the village [[First School]] until 1995.\n*Claytons Primary School, on Wendover Road, the village [[junior school]] which was formerly a [[Middle School]] and was merged with Westfield.\n*[[Bourne End Academy]], on New Road, an [[upper school]] which has [[Specialist school|specialist]] [[Sports College]] status. Prior to amalgamation with Pembroke School, [[Flackwell Heath]] in 1985, this was known as Deyncourt School, and subsequently Wye Valley School until 2014. From late 2012 to late 2014, the school was suffering from poor results in [[OFSTED]] evaluations, and was ultimately placed into Special Measures and given the academy status.\n\nThere are also a number of pre-schools and nurseries across the village.\n\n==Religion==\nThe village currently has three active churches. The [[Anglican]] parish church, in Station Road, is dedicated to [[Saint Mark|St. Mark]], and was built in 1889 as a daughter church of St Paul's, Wooburn. The [[Roman Catholic]] church of [[Saint Dunstan|St. Dunstan]] is in the centre of the village, off Cores End Road. The most well established is the [[United Reformed Church]] in Cores End, which was founded as a [[Congregational church|Congregational Chapel]] in 1773 (as a non-conformist alternative to St. Paul's in Wooburn).\n\nBourne End had a [[Methodist Church]] in Furlong Road, which closed down in 2002. Well End also once had a Congregational mission hall, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; this is now a residential house, named The Chapel.\n\nBourned End also has the only UK branch of the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] in Bourne End, situated at the [[Vedanta]] Centre.<ref>[http://www.vedantauk.com/ Vedanta Centre UK], Accessed 23 December 2012</ref>\n\n==Shopping==\nBourne End continues to support a bustling array of shops, chiefly in The Parade. Community events focused on the village centre, such as 'Fun Night' in December, have attempted to turn residents' attention to upholding local trade and businesses. There is a small parade of shops on Furlong Road, including the main Post Office.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bourne End, Buckinghamshire|Bourne End}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Bourne End}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090130061237/http://www.bourneendbucks.com/ Bourne End, Bucks \u2014 community website]\n*[http://www.bebta.ukgo.com/ The Bourne End (Bucks) Twinning Association website]\n*[http://www.cjo.fr/ The Octeville sur Mer Twinning Association website]\n\n{{Wycombe}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Buckinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Buckinghamshire on the River Thames]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=May 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox UK place|\n|country = England\n|official_name = Bourne End\n|population = 5320\n|coordinates = {{coord|51.581737|-0.713382|display=inline,title}}\n|civil_parish = [[Wooburn and Bourne End|Wooburn]]\n|unitary_england = [[Buckinghamshire Council|Buckinghamshire]]\n|lieutenancy_england = [[Buckinghamshire]]\n|region = South East England\n|constituency_westminster = [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]]\n|post_town = BOURNE END|postcode_district = SL8\n|postcode_area = SL \n|dial_code = 01628\n|os_grid_reference = SU895875\n|static_image_name=Bourne End and the Thames - geograph.org.uk - 516767.jpg\n|static_image_caption=[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] houses, downstream from Bourne End Marina\n|static_image_2_name=New apartments at Bourne End - geograph.org.uk - 948318.jpg\n|static_image_2_caption=21st century development by the Thames\n}}\n'''Bourne End''' is a village mostly in the [[civil parishes in England|parish]] of [[Wooburn and Bourne End|Wooburn]], but partly in the parish of [[Little Marlow]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], England. It is about five miles (8&nbsp;km) south-east of [[High Wycombe]] and three miles (5&nbsp;km) east of [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], near the border with [[Berkshire]] and close to where the [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|River Wye]] empties into the Thames.<ref name=\"WDC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wycombe.gov.uk/uploads/documents/Community%20and%20living/Wooburn%20parish%20fact%20file.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927004406/http://www.wycombe.gov.uk/uploads/documents/Community%20and%20living/Wooburn%20parish%20fact%20file.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2006 |title=Wooburn and Bourne End parish fact file, December 2005 |accessdate=21 June 2006 |format=PDF |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBourne End's original location differed from today's established village centre, and was a half-mile downstream on the River Thames. The name refers to the end of the river (''bourne'' being an obsolete term for river), and derived from the mouth of the River Wye. Then a hamlet, it appears on Morden's 1722 map of Buckinghamshire as \"Born end\".<ref name=\"Map\">{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_files/ENG/BKM/morden_bkm_1722.html |title=Buckinghamshire 1722, Robert Morden in Camden's Britannia |accessdate=17 December 2007}}</ref> It was noted in the 19th century, however, that the name had been corrupted to \"Bone End\", apparently through local mispronunciation, and thence on official maps and documents. In 1858, the vicar of [[Wooburn]] succeeded in reversing the change, and the corrected name remains in use today.<ref name=\"BBW\">{{cite book |last=Wheals |first=Brian Brenchley |year=1983 |title=Theirs Were But Human Hearts |publisher=H. S. Publishing |isbn=0-9509053-0-5}}</ref>\n\nThe length of the River Wye was the provider of water power for many [[watermill|mill]]s in the valley for hundreds of years, and Bourne End was no exception. There were four on the final stretch of the river: Princes Mill, Jacksons (or Gunpowder) Mill, Hedsor Mill and Lower Mill. These mills were historically the predominant employers in the area, along with the local farms and two [[wharf]]s on the Thames.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, the settlement known as Bourne End was a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Wooburn]] parish, along with others such as Spring Gardens, Eghams Green, [[Cores End]], Heavens Lea and Upper Bourne End. This changed with the emergence of the [[Wycombe Railway|Wycombe Railway Company]] in 1846. By 1854, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] had designed and constructed a railway linking [[Maidenhead]] to [[High Wycombe]], via Bourne End. The station at Bourne End was originally named Marlow Road; then in 1873 a branch line to [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] was built, and a year later the station was renamed [[Bourne End railway station|Bourne End station]] to avoid confusion with the new station at Marlow town.<ref name=\"MMP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mmpa.org.uk/history.html |title=Maidenhead and Marlow Passengers Association |accessdate=3 February 2005}}</ref> The railway created more travel opportunities for locals and greatly benefited the mills, and thus Bourne End expanded, on a greater scale than other similar settlements in the surrounding area. ''See [[Marlow Branch Line]] and [[Marlow Donkey]] for more information.''\n\nThe hamlets soon merged into what is now known as Bourne End, as did [[Well End, Buckinghamshire|Well End]] and [[Coldmoorholme]] in the neighbouring parish of Little Marlow. Both a church and school were built at the turn of the century for the residents' convenience. The Parade became established as the focal point of the village for shops and services.\n\nIn the 1920s Bourne End became home for two distinguished literary figures; [[Enid Blyton]], a perennially popular children's writer, moved into Old Thatch on Coldmoorholme Lane, and [[Edgar Wallace]], a prolific crime author and dramatist, bought Chalklands off Blind Lane. Another resident at this time was [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]], the French aviator and aircraft builder, who lived at New York Lodge beside the Thames.<ref>Christopher Winn: ''I Never Knew That about the Thames'' (London: Ebury Press, 2010), p. 112.</ref>\n\nThe Royalty Cinema opened in The Parade in 1934. The late 1940s saw extensive development in Bourne End, of the Chalklands estate and the [[Council Estate]] north of The Parade. The 1960s saw the building of Community Centre and Library in Wakeman Road after some years of local campaigning.\n\nThe [[Beeching Axe]] hit the village in 1969, as it was announced that the line between Bourne End and [[High Wycombe]] would be shut. The track bed was lifted soon after closure in 1970. A commercial estate was developed adjacent to the station, though most remains as a footpath between the village and [[Wooburn]].\n\n==Today==\n\n===Locale===\nBourne End lies between the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[M40 motorway|M40]] motorways, and retains its railway station on the [[Maidenhead railway station|Maidenhead]] to [[Marlow railway station|Marlow]] [[Marlow Branch Line|branch line]]. With rail and road accessibility to London, it has become a popular place for [[commuters]] to live.\n\nAll of the mills along the Wye Valley have now been shut down and demolished, Jacksons Mill in Furlong Road being the last (in Bourne End) in the late 1980s. These have been replaced by houses, offices or industrial estates, which has led to the continuation of the village as an employment centre.\n\nBourne End remains a distinct settlement, although the continued house-building over the past century means it is threatened by the evident [[ribbon development]], through to High Wycombe. In 1997, when the Local Plan was in preparation, the Residents Associations of Bourne End and Wooburn successfully lobbied to stop Slate Meadow (the field which separates the two settlements) being designated for housing for the time being. Other undeveloped land around the village looks likely to remain so, as it has been specified as [[Green Belt]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], or a combination of the three. In parts, Bourne End is surrounded by [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]]. Somewhat further away, [[Cliveden]] and [[Hedsor]] overlook the village from higher ground to the south east.\n\n===Community===\n\nBourne End sustains many businesses and services whilst still retaining a village-like atmosphere. There is a Community Centre in the centre of the village, with a large hall, function rooms and a bar, which is open for member's use. It is, for many, considered the focal point of village activity.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a Twinning Association was established, and subsequently [[Octeville-sur-Mer]], a town on the north coast of France, was chosen to be its twin town. Frequent events are held by members of the association to foster and enhance the relationship between the two settlements.\n\n===Administration and services===\nThe local government of the village is made up of three tiers.
