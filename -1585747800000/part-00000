Scott's plans were criticised and the building did not go ahead.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===Gibberd's design===\nThe present Cathedral was designed by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]] (1908\u201384). Construction began in October 1962 and less than five years later, on the [[Feast of Pentecost]] 14 May 1967, the completed cathedral was [[Consecration|consecrated]].<ref name=\"history\"/> Soon after its opening, it began to exhibit architectural flaws. This led the cathedral authorities to sue Frederick Gibberd for \u00a31.3&nbsp;million on five counts, the two most serious being leaks in the [[aluminium]] roof and defects in the [[mosaic]] tiles, which had begun to come away from the concrete ribs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baillieu |first=Amanda |title=Paddy's wigwam needs repairs |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=February 1994|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-paddys-wigwam-needs-repairs-1394451.html|accessdate=16 July 2009}}</ref> The design has been described by [[Stephen Bayley]] as \"a thin and brittle take on an [[Oscar Niemeyer]] [[Cathedral of Bras\u00edlia|original in Brasilia]],\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/06/the-greatest-buildings-liverpool-never-built/|title=The greatest buildings Liverpool never built}}</ref> though Pevsner notes that the resemblance is only superficial.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=357}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Concept===\nThe competition to design the Cathedral was held in 1959.  The requirement was first, for a congregation of 3,000 (which was later reduced to 2,000) to be able to see the [[altar]], in order that they could be more involved in the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and second, for the Lutyens crypt to be incorporated in the structure.  Gibberd achieved these requirements by designing a circular building with the [[altar]] at its centre, and by transforming the roof of the crypt into an elevated platform, with the cathedral standing at one end.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=356\u2013357}}</ref> The construction contract was let to [[Taylor Woodrow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=430|title=Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|publisher=Skyscraper News|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral at dusk (reduced grain), corrected perspective.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The cathedral at dusk]]\n\n===Exterior===\n\nThe Cathedral is built in concrete with a [[Portland stone]] cladding and an aluminium covering to the roof.<ref name=images>{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1070607|desc= Roman Catholic Cathedral, Liverpool|accessdate= 20 August 2013|mode=cs2|ps=none}}</ref>  Its plan is circular, having a diameter of {{convert|195|ft|m|0}}, with 13&nbsp;chapels around its perimeter.<ref name=pp357/>  The shape of the Cathedral is conical, and it is surmounted by a tower in the shape of a [[Frustum|truncated cone]].<ref name=images/>  The building is supported by 16&nbsp;[[boomerang]]-shaped concrete [[truss]]es which are held together by two ring beams, one at the bends of the trusses and the other at their tops. [[Flying buttress]]es are attached to the trusses, giving the cathedral its tent-like appearance.  Rising from the upper ring beam is a lantern tower, containing windows of stained glass, and at its peak is a crown of [[pinnacle]]s.<ref name=pp357>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=357}}</ref>\n\nThe entrance is at the top of a wide flight of steps leading up from [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]].  Above the entrance is a large wedge-shaped structure.  This acts as a bell tower, the four bells being mounted in rectangular orifices towards the top of the tower.  Below these is a geometric [[relief]] sculpture, designed by William Mitchell, which includes three crosses.  To the sides of the entrance doors are more reliefs in [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]] by Mitchell, which represent the [[Four Evangelists#Evangelists' symbols|symbols of the Evangelists]].<ref name=images/><ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=358}}</ref> The steps which lead up to the cathedral were only completed in 2003, when a building which obstructed the stairway path was acquired and [[Demolition|demolished]] by developers.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Steps |url=http://www.neptunedevelopments.co.uk/developments/showdevelopment.asp?recordid=64 |work= |publisher=Neptune Developments Ltd |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nA much smaller version of the Cathedral, also designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd, was constructed in 1965 as a chapel for the former De La Salle College of Education, Middleton, Lancashire, a Catholic teacher-training college. The site is now occupied by [http://www.hopwood.ac.uk/about-us/how-to-find-us/ Hopwood Hall College], a further education college of the Borough of Rochdale and the chapel may still be seen.\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Interior, Liverpool, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The nave and sanctuary of the Cathedral]]\nThe focus of the interior is the altar which faces the main entrance.  It is made of white [[marble]] from [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and is {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} long.  The floor is also of marble in grey and white designed by David Atkins.  The benches, [[concentric]] with the interior, were designed by Frank Knight. Above is the tower with large areas of stained glass designed by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and [[Patrick Reyntiens]] in three colours, yellow, blue and red, representing the [[Trinity]].  The glass is {{convert|1|in|cm|0}} thick, the pieces of glass being bonded with [[epoxy|epoxy resin]], in concrete frames. Around the [[perimeter]] is a series of [[chapel]]s. Some of the chapels are open, some are closed by almost blank walls, and others consists of a low space under a balcony.  Opposite the entrance is the [[Blessed Sacrament]] Chapel, above which is the organ. Other chapels include the [[Lady chapel|Lady]] Chapel and the Chapel of [[Saint Joseph]]. To the right of the entrance is the [[Baptistry]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=358\u2013359}}</ref>\n\nOn the altar, the candlesticks are by R.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Goodden and the bronze [[crucifix]] is by [[Elisabeth Frink]]. Above the altar is a [[baldachin]]o designed by Gibberd as a crown-like structure composed of aluminium rods, which incorporates loudspeakers and lights.  Around the interior are metal [[Stations of the Cross]], designed by Sean Rice. Rice also designed the [[lectern]], which includes two entwined eagles. In the Chapel of [[Reconciliation (theology)|Reconciliation]] (formerly the Chapel of [[Saint Paul of the Cross]]), the stained glass was designed by Margaret Traherne.  Stephen Foster designed, carved and painted the panelling in the Chapel of St. Joseph. The Lady Chapel contains a statue of the [[Virgin and Child]] by Robert Brumby and stained glass by Margaret Traherne. In the Blessed Sacrament Chapel is a [[reredos]] and stained glass by [[Ceri Richards]] and a small statue of the Risen Christ by [[Arthur Dooley]]. In the Chapel of Unity (formerly the Chapel of [[Saint]] [[Thomas Aquinas]]) is a bronze [[Holy water font|stoup]] by Virginio Ciminaghi, and a mosaic of the [[Pentecost]] by Hungarian artist [[Georg Mayer-Marton]] which was moved from the Church of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Ghost]], [[Netherton, Merseyside|Netherton]], when it was demolished in 1989. The gates of the Baptistry were designed by David Atkins.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=359}}</ref>\n\n===Architectural problems===\nThe Cathedral was built quickly and economically, and this led to problems with the fabric of the building, including leaks.  A programme of repairs was carried out during the 1990s. The building had been faced with [[mosaic]] tiles, but these were impossible to repair and were replaced with glass-reinforced plastic, which gave it a thicker appearance.  The [[aluminium]] in the lantern was replaced by [[stainless steel]], and the slate paving of the platform was replaced with concrete flags.<ref name=pp357/>\n\n== Cathedral crypt ==\n[[File:The Crypt at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the Crypt seen from Brownlow Hill]]\nThe crypt under Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral is the only part that was built according to Lutyens' design before construction stopped due to [[World War II]]; in 1962 [[Frederick Gibberd]]'s design was built upon the Lutyens crypt.<ref name=\"unfinished\"/> Structurally the crypt is built of [[brick]] together with [[granite]] from quarries in [[Penryn, Cornwall]].<ref>{{cite video\n |people     =  |date      = \n |title      = L'POOL CATHEDRAL (aka CATHEDRALS OF LIVERPOOL) 1940\n |url        = http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=37381\n |format     =  |medium     = \n |publisher  = British Pathe Ltd \n |location   =  |accessdate =  |time       =  |id         =  |isbn       =  |oclc       =  |quote      = \n}}\n</ref> Each year the crypt plays host to the Liverpool Beer Festival which attracts visitors, not only from all over UK but also Europe and places such as the United States and Australia.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shennan |first=Paddy |title=30 reasons to be cheerful about the Liverpool Beer Festival |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-life/liverpool-lifestyle/2010/02/16/30-reasons-to-be-cheerful-about-the-liverpool-beer-festival-100252-25840550/ |date=16 February 2010 |work=[[Liverpool Echo]] |accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> The crypt also hosts examinations for students at the [[University of Liverpool]] during exam periods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exam Room Information |url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/student-administration/exams/exam-rooms/ |accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Refurbishment===\nA \u00a33&nbsp;million refurbishment of the crypt was completed in 2009 and was officially re-opened on 1 May that year by the [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Sharpe |first=Laura |title=First glimpse of refurbished Crypt at Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral |work=[[Liverpool Daily Post]] |date=29 April 2009 |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/04/29/exclusive-glimpse-of-the-refurbished-lutyens-crypt-at-liverpool-s-metropolian-cathedral-92534-23498179/ |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> The refurbishment included new east and west approaches, archive provision, rewiring and new lighting, catering facilities, a new [[chancel]], new toilets and revamped exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Cathedral's crypt is transformed |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=May 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/8032678.stm |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Organ ==\nBuilt by [[J.

Construction began in October 1962 and less than five years later, on the [[Feast of Pentecost]] 14 May 1967, the completed cathedral was [[Consecration|consecrated]].<ref name=\"history\"/> Soon after its opening, it began to exhibit architectural flaws. This led the cathedral authorities to sue Frederick Gibberd for \u00a31.3&nbsp;million on five counts, the two most serious being leaks in the [[aluminium]] roof and defects in the [[mosaic]] tiles, which had begun to come away from the concrete ribs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baillieu |first=Amanda |title=Paddy's wigwam needs repairs |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=February 1994|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-paddys-wigwam-needs-repairs-1394451.html|accessdate=16 July 2009}}</ref> The design has been described by [[Stephen Bayley]] as \"a thin and brittle take on an [[Oscar Niemeyer]] [[Cathedral of Bras\u00edlia|original in Brasilia]],\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/06/the-greatest-buildings-liverpool-never-built/|title=The greatest buildings Liverpool never built}}</ref> though Pevsner notes that the resemblance is only superficial.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=357}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Concept===\nThe competition to design the Cathedral was held in 1959.  The requirement was first, for a congregation of 3,000 (which was later reduced to 2,000) to be able to see the [[altar]], in order that they could be more involved in the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and second, for the Lutyens crypt to be incorporated in the structure.  Gibberd achieved these requirements by designing a circular building with the [[altar]] at its centre, and by transforming the roof of the crypt into an elevated platform, with the cathedral standing at one end.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=356\u2013357}}</ref> The construction contract was let to [[Taylor Woodrow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=430|title=Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|publisher=Skyscraper News|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral at dusk (reduced grain), corrected perspective.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The cathedral at dusk]]\n\n===Exterior===\n\nThe Cathedral is built in concrete with a [[Portland stone]] cladding and an aluminium covering to the roof.<ref name=images>{{National Heritage List for England |num= 1070607|desc= Roman Catholic Cathedral, Liverpool|accessdate= 20 August 2013|mode=cs2|ps=none}}</ref>  Its plan is circular, having a diameter of {{convert|195|ft|m|0}}, with 13&nbsp;chapels around its perimeter.<ref name=pp357/>  The shape of the Cathedral is conical, and it is surmounted by a tower in the shape of a [[Frustum|truncated cone]].<ref name=images/>  The building is supported by 16&nbsp;[[boomerang]]-shaped concrete [[truss]]es which are held together by two ring beams, one at the bends of the trusses and the other at their tops. [[Flying buttress]]es are attached to the trusses, giving the cathedral its tent-like appearance.  Rising from the upper ring beam is a lantern tower, containing windows of stained glass, and at its peak is a crown of [[pinnacle]]s.<ref name=pp357>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=357}}</ref>\n\nThe entrance is at the top of a wide flight of steps leading up from [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]].  Above the entrance is a large wedge-shaped structure.  This acts as a bell tower, the four bells being mounted in rectangular orifices towards the top of the tower.  Below these is a geometric [[relief]] sculpture, designed by William Mitchell, which includes three crosses.  To the sides of the entrance doors are more reliefs in [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]] by Mitchell, which represent the [[Four Evangelists#Evangelists' symbols|symbols of the Evangelists]].<ref name=images/><ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=358}}</ref> The steps which lead up to the cathedral were only completed in 2003, when a building which obstructed the stairway path was acquired and [[Demolition|demolished]] by developers.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Steps |url=http://www.neptunedevelopments.co.uk/developments/showdevelopment.asp?recordid=64 |work= |publisher=Neptune Developments Ltd |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nA much smaller version of the Cathedral, also designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd, was constructed in 1965 as a chapel for the former De La Salle College of Education, Middleton, Lancashire, a Catholic teacher-training college. The site is now occupied by [http://www.hopwood.ac.uk/about-us/how-to-find-us/ Hopwood Hall College], a further education college of the Borough of Rochdale and the chapel may still be seen.\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Interior, Liverpool, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The nave and sanctuary of the Cathedral]]\nThe focus of the interior is the altar which faces the main entrance.  It is made of white [[marble]] from [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and is {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} long.  The floor is also of marble in grey and white designed by David Atkins.  The benches, [[concentric]] with the interior, were designed by Frank Knight. Above is the tower with large areas of stained glass designed by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and [[Patrick Reyntiens]] in three colours, yellow, blue and red, representing the [[Trinity]].  The glass is {{convert|1|in|cm|0}} thick, the pieces of glass being bonded with [[epoxy|epoxy resin]], in concrete frames. Around the [[perimeter]] is a series of [[chapel]]s. Some of the chapels are open, some are closed by almost blank walls, and others consists of a low space under a balcony.  Opposite the entrance is the [[Blessed Sacrament]] Chapel, above which is the organ. Other chapels include the [[Lady chapel|Lady]] Chapel and the Chapel of [[Saint Joseph]]. To the right of the entrance is the [[Baptistry]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=358\u2013359}}</ref>\n\nOn the altar, the candlesticks are by R.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Goodden and the bronze [[crucifix]] is by [[Elisabeth Frink]]. Above the altar is a [[baldachin]]o designed by Gibberd as a crown-like structure composed of aluminium rods, which incorporates loudspeakers and lights.  Around the interior are metal [[Stations of the Cross]], designed by Sean Rice. Rice also designed the [[lectern]], which includes two entwined eagles. In the Chapel of [[Reconciliation (theology)|Reconciliation]] (formerly the Chapel of [[Saint Paul of the Cross]]), the stained glass was designed by Margaret Traherne.  Stephen Foster designed, carved and painted the panelling in the Chapel of St. Joseph. The Lady Chapel contains a statue of the [[Virgin and Child]] by Robert Brumby and stained glass by Margaret Traherne. In the Blessed Sacrament Chapel is a [[reredos]] and stained glass by [[Ceri Richards]] and a small statue of the Risen Christ by [[Arthur Dooley]]. In the Chapel of Unity (formerly the Chapel of [[Saint]] [[Thomas Aquinas]]) is a bronze [[Holy water font|stoup]] by Virginio Ciminaghi, and a mosaic of the [[Pentecost]] by Hungarian artist [[Georg Mayer-Marton]] which was moved from the Church of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Ghost]], [[Netherton, Merseyside|Netherton]], when it was demolished in 1989. The gates of the Baptistry were designed by David Atkins.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=359}}</ref>\n\n===Architectural problems===\nThe Cathedral was built quickly and economically, and this led to problems with the fabric of the building, including leaks.  A programme of repairs was carried out during the 1990s. The building had been faced with [[mosaic]] tiles, but these were impossible to repair and were replaced with glass-reinforced plastic, which gave it a thicker appearance.
