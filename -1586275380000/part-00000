The song was written by [[Wayne Hector]], [[Lucas Secon]], [[Jonas Jeberg]], [[Cutfather|Mich Hansen]] and produced by the latter two along with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]]. It was initially recorded for Scherzinger's planned solo project, ''Her Name Is Nicole'', but after its cancellation the song was placed in the group's second album. \"I Hate This Part\" was released on October 14, 2008 as the second international single and impacted [[contemporary hit radio]] stations on October 20, 2008 as the fourth single in the United States by [[Interscope Records]]. \"I Hate This Part\" is a [[Dance music|dance]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-influenced [[Pop music|pop]] ballad which ditches the Doll's usual sexual image in favor of introspection. Lyrically the song is about the conversation before a breakup.\n\nContemporary music critics wrote generally positive reviews, commending the song's production and Scherzinger's vocals. \"I Hate This Part\" became a moderate success and peaked at number eleven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart. It also reached the top ten in Australia, France, and New Zealand. A [[music video]] for the song directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] was filmed in late September 2008. It features the group at a desert with each member on a separate set exploring different emotional sides while choreographed routines were performed at the [[chorus (song)|chorus]]. \"I Hate This Part\" was performed on various occasions including the [[2008 American Music Awards]] and throughout their [[Doll Domination Tour]] (2009).\n\n== Background and composition ==\n\"I Hate This Part\" was written by [[Wayne Hector]], [[Lucas Secon|Lucas]], [[Jonas Jeberg]] and [[Cutfather|Mich Hansen]] and produced by the latter two along with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] who also served as the song's vocal producer.<ref name=\"Booklet\">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Doll Domination]]|others=[[The Pussycat Dolls]]|accessdate=January 24, 2014|publisher=[[Interscope Records]]}}</ref> During an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Hector discussed how \"I Hate This Part\" was written and composed within an hour.

The video starts with Scherzinger playing the piano to the beat of the song, and images of a book and flowers blowing in the wind. When the first verse begins, it shows Scherzinger singing on the piano while the girls are shown on the road with a broken-down car, waiting for a car to arrive. At the beginning of the chorus, the girls start walking to the beat of music. In the next verse Scherzinger is seen singing in the [[desert]] alone, while [[Jessica Sutta]] is shown trying to wave down a passing car with her bandanna. All the girls are then shown on top of many broken-down cars during the bridge of the song. During the second chorus, the girls are seen dancing on the sand in sync. In both pre-chorus all the girls are then shown in different elements in the desert: Scherzinger in front of the broken-down car with a wolf, Sutta in a parking lot on top of an arcade machine, [[Ashley Roberts]] walking in a parking lot with a pink stuffed elephant-doll, [[Melody Thornton]] with a flower, and [[Kimberly Wyatt]] in a broken-down pick-up truck. During the climax of the scene, Scherzinger is singing during an incoming storm at night. The girls are then shown in the same scene as before while dancing in sync, but this time, it is raining. The music videos ends with an eruption of emotions from all the girls, climaxing with a clip of Roberts comforting Thornton who is in sadness. The video closes with Scherzinger still playing with the beat of the background on the piano and a butterfly on her hand, before ending with a shot of the rain-soaked girls united in an embrace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/player/default.aspx?meid=3132&aid=455 |title=Pussycat Dolls : Video : I Hate This Part |date=2008-11-18 |access-date=2010-05-10 |work=[[Interscope Records]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819135753/http://www.interscope.com/artist/player/default.aspx?meid=3132&aid=455 |archive-date=2009-08-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\nJohn Kordosh of [[Yahoo!

The song was written by [[Wayne Hector]], [[Lucas Secon]], [[Jonas Jeberg]], [[Cutfather|Mich Hansen]] and produced by the latter two along with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]]. It was initially recorded for Scherzinger's planned solo project, ''Her Name Is Nicole'', but after its cancellation the song was placed in the group's second album. \"I Hate This Part\" was released on October 14, 2008 as the second international single and impacted [[contemporary hit radio]] stations on October 20, 2008 as the fourth single in the United States by [[Interscope Records]]. \"I Hate This Part\" is a [[Dance music|dance]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-influenced [[Pop music|pop]] ballad which ditches the Doll's usual sexual image in favor of introspection. Lyrically the song is about the conversation before a breakup.\n\nContemporary music critics wrote generally positive reviews, commending the song's production and Scherzinger's vocals. \"I Hate This Part\" became a moderate success and peaked at number eleven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and topped the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart. It also reached the top ten in Australia, France, and New Zealand. A [[music video]] for the song directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] was filmed in late September 2008. It features the group at a desert with each member on a separate set exploring different emotional sides while choreographed routines were performed at the [[chorus (song)|chorus]]. \"I Hate This Part\" was performed on various occasions including the [[2008 American Music Awards]] and throughout their [[Doll Domination Tour]] (2009).\n\n== Background and composition ==\n\"I Hate This Part\" was written by [[Wayne Hector]], [[Lucas Secon|Lucas]], [[Jonas Jeberg]] and [[Cutfather|Mich Hansen]] and produced by the latter two along with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] who also served as the song's vocal producer.<ref name=\"Booklet\">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Doll Domination]]|others=[[The Pussycat Dolls]]|accessdate=January 24, 2014|publisher=[[Interscope Records]]}}</ref> During an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Hector discussed how \"I Hate This Part\" was written and composed within an hour.

The video starts with Scherzinger playing the piano to the beat of the song, and images of a book and flowers blowing in the wind. When the first verse begins, it shows Scherzinger singing on the piano while the girls are shown on the road with a broken-down car, waiting for a car to arrive. At the beginning of the chorus, the girls start walking to the beat of music. In the next verse Scherzinger is seen singing in the [[desert]] alone, while [[Jessica Sutta]] is shown trying to wave down a passing car with her bandanna. All the girls are then shown on top of many broken-down cars during the bridge of the song. During the second chorus, the girls are seen dancing on the sand in sync. In both pre-chorus all the girls are then shown in different elements in the desert: Scherzinger in front of the broken-down car with a wolf, Sutta in a parking lot on top of an arcade machine, [[Ashley Roberts]] walking in a parking lot with a pink stuffed elephant-doll, [[Melody Thornton]] with a flower, and [[Kimberly Wyatt]] in a broken-down pick-up truck. During the climax of the scene, Scherzinger is singing during an incoming storm at night. The girls are then shown in the same scene as before while dancing in sync, but this time, it is raining. The music videos ends with an eruption of emotions from all the girls, climaxing with a clip of Roberts comforting Thornton who is in sadness.

His father originated from [[Bad Oldesloe|Oldesloe]] in the Duchy of [[Holstein]], which at that time was a part of the Danish realms in Northern Germany.\nScholars dispute both the year and country of Dieterich's birth, although most now accept that he was born in 1637 in [[Helsingborg]], [[Scania|Sk\u00e5ne]], at the time part of [[Denmark]] (but now part of [[Sweden]]).<ref name = \"DoB\">One reason why his birthdate and place of birth are uncertain is that baptismal records in the three places regarded as most likely to have been his birthplace do not go back as far as the 1630s.

Dieterich was employed as an organist, first in Helsingborg (1657\u20131658), and then at Helsing\u00f8r (1660\u20131668). St. Mary\u2019s in Helsing\u00f8r is the only church where Buxtehude was employed that still has the organ in its original location.\n\n===L\u00fcbeck: Marienkirche===\n[[File:Johann Philipp F\u00f6rtsch.jpg|thumb|Another person in the same Voorhout painting, once was thought to be Buxtehude.

Rochester: [[University of Rochester Press]], 2007), pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>]]\n\nBuxtehude's last post, from 1668, was at the [[St. Mary's Church, L\u00fcbeck|Marienkirche]], [[L\u00fcbeck]] which had two organs, a large one for big services and a small one for devotionals and funerals. There he succeeded [[Franz Tunder]] and followed in many of the footsteps of his predecessor. He married Tunder's daughter Anna Margarethe in 1668 \u2013 it was not uncommon practice that a man marry the daughter of his predecessor in his occupation. Buxtehude and Anna Margarethe had seven daughters who were baptized at the Marienkirche; however, his first daughter died as an infant. After his retirement as organist at St Olaf's Church, his father joined the family in L\u00fcbeck in 1673. Johannes died a year later, and Dieterich composed his funeral music. Dieterich's brother Peter, a barber, joined them in 1677.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nHis post in the free Imperial city of L\u00fcbeck afforded him considerable latitude in his musical career, and his autonomy was a model for the careers of later Baroque masters such as [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. In 1673 he reorganized a series of evening musical performances, initiated by Tunder, known as ''[[Abendmusik]],'' which attracted musicians from diverse places and remained a feature of the church until 1810. In 1703, Handel and Mattheson both traveled to meet Buxtehude, who was by then elderly and ready to retire. He offered his position in L\u00fcbeck to Handel and Mattheson but stipulated that the organist who ascended to it must marry his eldest daughter, Anna Margareta. Both Handel and Mattheson turned the offer down<!--was it the daughter?--> and left the day after their arrival.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> In 1705, J.S. Bach, then a young man of twenty, walked from [[Arnstadt]] to L\u00fcbeck, a distance of more than {{convert|400|km}}, and stayed nearly three months to hear the ''Abendmusik,'' meet the pre-eminent L\u00fcbeck organist, hear him play, and, as Bach explained, \"to comprehend one thing and another about his art\".<ref>Christoph Wolff, ''Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician'' (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, Inc., 2000), 96.</ref> In addition to his musical duties, Buxtehude, like his predecessor Tunder, served as church treasurer.\n\n===Influence and legacy===\nAlthough more than 100 vocal compositions by Buxtehude survive, very few of them were included in the important German manuscript collections of the period, and until the early twentieth century, Buxtehude was regarded primarily as a keyboard composer. His surviving church music is praised for its high musical qualities rather than its progressive elements<!--, which is similar to that of Bach's later church music.{{please clarify|reason=\"To what does 'which' refer?

North German Church Music in the Age of Buxtehude. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude}}\n\n===General introduction===\nThe bulk of Buxtehude's oeuvre consists of vocal music, which covers a wide variety of styles,<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> and organ works, which concentrate mostly on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms. Chamber music constitutes a minor part of the surviving output, although the only chamber works Buxtehude published during his lifetime were fourteen chamber sonatas. Unfortunately, many of Buxtehude's compositions have been lost.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The [[libretto]]s for his [[oratorio]]s, for example, survive; but none of the scores do, which is particularly unfortunate, because his German oratorios seem to be the model for later works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]. Further evidence of lost works by Buxtehude and his contemporaries can be found in the recently discovered catalogue of a 1695 music-auction in L\u00fcbeck.<ref>Stephen Rose, 'A L\u00fcbeck music auction, 1695', ''Sch\u00fctz-Jahrbuch'' 30 (2008), 171\u2013190.</ref>\n\n[[Gustaf D\u00fcben]]'s collection and the so-called L\u00fcbeck tablature A373 are the two most important sources for Buxtehude's vocal music. The former includes several autographs, both in German [[organ tablature]] and in score. Both collections were probably created during Buxtehude's lifetime and with his permission. Copies made by various composers are the only extant sources for the organ works: chorale settings are mostly transmitted in copies by [[Johann Gottfried Walther]], while Gottfried Lindemann's and others' copies concentrate on free works. [[Johann Christoph Bach]]'s manuscript is particularly important, as it includes the three known ostinato works and the famous Prelude and [[Chaconne]] in C major, [[List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude|BuxWV]] 137. Although Buxtehude himself most probably wrote in organ tablature, the majority of the copies are in standard staff notation.\n\n===Keyboard works===\n\n====Preludes and toccatas====\nThe nineteen organ ''praeludia'' (or ''preludes'') form the core of Buxtehude's work and are ultimately considered his most important contributions to the music literature of the seventeenth century. They are sectional compositions that alternate between free improvisation and strict counterpoint. They are usually either [[fugue]]s or pieces written in fugal manner; all make heavy use of pedal and are idiomatic to the organ. These preludes, together with pieces by [[Nicolaus Bruhns]], represent the highest point in the evolution of the [[German organ schools|north German organ prelude]], and the so-called ''[[stylus phantasticus]]''. They were undoubtedly among the influences of J.S. Bach, whose organ preludes, toccatas and fugues frequently employ similar techniques.<ref>While John Butt (''Cambridge Companion to Bach'', Cambridge UP, 1997, 110; books.google.com/books?id=MysXAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT110) believes the centrality of Buxtehude's on Bach's ''toccatas'', David Schulenberg emphasizes the influence of several composers. Schulenberg reserves the word \"especially\" for Johann Adam Reincken: \"Closer to a small group of north-German toccatas, especially one by Reincken [...] that resemble the early-Baroque type in being composed of distinct contrasting sections.\" Schulenberg, ''The Keyboard Music of J.S. Bach'' (NY: Routledge, 1992 [rev. ed., 2013]), 98.\n{{ISBN|9781136091544}}</ref>\n\nThe preludes are quite varied in style and structure, and are therefore hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The texture of Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia can be described as either free or fugal.<ref name=\"Archbald\">Archbald, Lawrence. Style and Structure in the Praeludia of Dietrich Buxtehude. Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1985.</ref> They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).\n\nThe introductory sections are always improvisatory. The preludes begin almost invariably with a single motif in one of the voices which is then treated imitatively for a bar or two. After this the introduction will most commonly elaborate on this motif or a part of it, or on a short melodic germ which is passed from voice to voice in three- or four-voice polyphonic writing, as seen in Example 1:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-145-intro.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 1''': This is the introduction from Prelude in F major, BuxWV 145. The motivic interaction seen here, in which a short motif is passing from one voice to another, sometimes sounding in two voices simultaneously, was frequently employed by Buxtehude in his preludes, frequently expanded to four voices with heavy use of pedal.]]\n\nOccasionally the introduction will engage in parallel 3rds, 6ths, etc. For example, BuxWV 149 begins with a single voice, proceeds to parallel counterpoint for nine bars and then segues into the kind of texture described above. The improvisatory interludes, free sections and postludes may all employ a vast array of techniques, from miscellaneous kinds of imitative writing (the technique discussed above, or \"fugues\" that dissolve into homophonic writing, etc.) to various forms of non-motivic interaction between voices (arpeggios, chordal style, figuration over [[pedal point]], etc.). [[Tempo]] marks are frequently present: ''Adagio'' sections written out in chords of whole- and half-notes, ''Vivace'' and ''Allegro'' imitative sections, and others.\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-fugue-subjects.gif|right|thumb|200px|'''Example 2''': Fugue subjects from BuxWV 137, BuxWV 140, BuxWV 142 (two) and BuxWV 153]]\n\nThe number of fugues in a prelude varies from one to three, not counting the pseudo-fugal free sections. The fugues normally employ four voices with extensive use of pedal. Most subjects are of medium length (see Example 2), frequently with some degree of repercussion (note repeating, particularly in BuxWV 148 and BuxWV 153), wide leaps or simplistic runs of 16th notes. One of the notable exceptions is a fugue in BuxWV 145, which features a six-bar subject. The answers are usually tonal, on scale degrees 1 and 5, and there is little real modulation. Stretto and parallel entries may be employed, with particular emphasis on the latter. Short and simple countersubjects appear, and may change their form slightly during the course of the fugue. In terms of structure, Buxtehude's fugues are a series of expositions, with non-thematic material appearing quite rarely, if ever. There is some variation, however, in the way they are constructed: in the first and last fugues of BuxWV 136 the second voice does not state the subject as it enters during the initial exposition; in BuxWV 153 the second exposition uses the subject in its inverted form, etc. Fugue subjects of a particular prelude may be related as in [[Froberger]]'s and [[Girolamo Frescobaldi|Frescobaldi]]'s [[ricercar]]s and [[canzona]]s (BuxWV 150, 152, etc.):\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-subjtrans.gif|center]]\n\nThe fugal procedure dissolves at the end of the fugue when it is followed by a free section, as seen in Example 4:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-140-bars39-42.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 4''': The dissolution of the fugue before a free section. The final entry of the subject (in the pedal) is joined by the highest voice engaging in a scale run.]]\n\nBuxtehude's other pieces that employ free writing or sectional structure include works titled ''toccata'', ''praeambulum'', etc.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> All are similar to the ''praeludia'' in terms of construction and techniques used, except that some of these works do not employ pedal passages or do so in a very basic way (pedal point which lasts during much of the piece, etc.). A well-known piece is BuxWV 146, in the rare key of F-sharp minor; it is believed that this prelude was written by Buxtehude especially for himself and his organ, and that he had his own way of tuning the instrument to allow for the tonality rarely used because of meantone temperament.\n\n====Chorale settings====\nThere are over 40 surviving chorale settings by Buxtehude, and they constitute the most important contributions to the genre in the 17th century.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> His settings include chorale variations, chorale ricercares, chorale fantasias and chorale preludes. Buxtehude's principal contributions to the organ chorale are his 30 short chorale preludes. The chorale preludes are usually four-part [[cantus firmus]] settings of one stanza of the chorale; the melody is presented in an elaborately ornamented version in the upper voice, the three lower parts engage in some form of counterpoint (not necessarily imitative). Most of Buxtehude's chorale settings are in this form.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Here is an example from chorale ''[[A Mighty Fortress is Our God|Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]'' BuxWV 184:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-chorale-ein-feste.png|center|thumb|810px|Opening bars of ''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'' BuxWV 184. The ornamented chorale in the upper voice is highlighted, original melody for the two lines present here is shown on separate staves. Note the basic imitative lines in bars 6\u20138 and 13\u201315.]]\n\nThe ornamented cantus firmus in these pieces represents a significant difference between the [[German organ schools|north German and the south German schools]]; [[Johann Pachelbel]] and his pupils would almost always leave the chorale melody unornamented.\n\nThe chorale fantasias (a modern term) are large-scale virtuosic sectional compositions that cover a whole strophe of the text and are somewhat similar to chorale concertos in their treatment of the text: each verse is developed separately, allowing for technically and emotionally contrasting sections within one composition.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The presence of contrasting textures makes these pieces reminiscent of Buxtehude's ''praeludia''. Buxtehude was careful with correct word setting, paying particular attention to emphasis and interpretation.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Each section is also closely related to the text of the corresponding lines (chromatic sections to express sadness, gigue fugues to express joy, etc.). Examples include fantasias on the [hymn]s ''Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ'' BuxWV 188, ''{{lang|de|[[Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein]]}}'' BuxWV 210, ''Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren'' BuxWV 213 and ''[[Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern]]'', BuxWV 223.\n\nBuxtehude's chorale variations are usually in two or three voices. They consist of around 3\u20134 variations of which only one may use the pedal. These pieces are not as important for the development of the form and not as advanced as Pachelbel's or [[Georg B\u00f6hm|B\u00f6hm]]'s contributions to the genre. There are only a few chorale variations, and there are no distinctive qualities that characterize them.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nThe pieces that do not fall into any of the three types are ''Auf meinen lieben Gott'' BuxWV 179, which is, quite unusually for the time, a dance suite based on the chorale, and the ones based on the chant ([[Magnificat]]s BuxWV 203\u20135 and ''Te Deum laudamus'', BuxWV 218), which are structurally similar to chorale fantasias.\n\n====Ostinato works====\nThe three [[ostinato]] bass works Buxtehude composed\u2014two [[chaconne]]s (BuxWV 159\u2013160) and a [[passacaglia]] ([[Passacaglia in D minor, BuxWV 161|BuxWV 161]])\u2014not only represent, along with Pachelbel's six organ chaconnes, a shift from the traditional chaconne style, but are also the first truly developed north German contributions to the development of the genre.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> They are among Buxtehude's best-known works and have influenced numerous composers after him, most notably Bach (whose organ passacaglia is modeled after Buxtehude's) and [[Johannes Brahms]]. The pieces feature numerous connected sections, with many suspensions, changing meters, and even real modulation (in which the ostinato pattern is transposed into another key).\n\nSome of the [[Prelude (music)|praeludia]] also make use of ostinato models. The praeludium in C major, BuxWV 137, begins with a lengthy pedal solo and concludes not with a postlude of arpeggios and scale runs, but with a comparatively short chaconne built over a three-bar ostinato pattern in the pedal:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-137-ciacona.gif|center|720px]]\n\nThe praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 148, in which the ostinato pattern is derived from the subject of one of the fugal sections, also ends in a chaconne. In addition, another praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 149, employs a repeating bass pattern in the beginning.\n\n====Other keyboard works====\nThe rest of Buxtehude's keyboard music does not employ pedals. Of the organ works, a few keyboard canzonas are the only strictly contrapuntal pieces in Buxtehude's oeuvre and were probably composed with teaching purposes in mind.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> There are also three pieces labelled ''fugues'': only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 is more of a canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 is more like a typical Buxtehude prelude, only beginning with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.\n\nThere are also 19 [[harpsichord]] suites and several variation sets. The suites follow the standard model (Allemande \u2013 Sarabande \u2013 Courante \u2013 Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande or a couple of doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French [[lute]] [[style bris\u00e9]], sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never go as far as the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, [[Johann Mattheson]] mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.\n\nThe several sets of arias with variations are, surprisingly, much more developed than the organ chorale variations. BuxWV 250 ''La Capricciosa'' may have inspired Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'' BWV 988: both have 32 variations (including the two arias of the Goldberg Variations); there are a number of similarities in the structure of individual movements; both include variations in forms of various dances; both are in G major; and Bach was familiar with Buxtehude's work and admired him, as has been related above.\n\n==Recordings==\n\n===Available media===\n{{listen\n | filename = BuxWV_104_-_Was_frag_ich_nach_der_Welt.ogg\n | title = ''Was frag ich nach der Welt'' (BuxWV 104)\n | description = Live recording (excerpt)\n | format = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2 = Buxtehude -- Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis).mid\n | title2 = ''Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis)''\n | description2 = Played with organ ([[MIDI]] file).\n | format2 = [[MIDI]]\n | filename3 = Wo ist doch.ogg\n | title3 = \"Dialogus inter Christum et fidelem animam\" \u2013 Wo ist doch mein freund geblieben?\n | description3 = A sacred cantata for soprano and bass.\n | format3 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename4 = Buxtehude - Toccata in F-Dur BuxWV 161.ogg\n | title4 = ''Toccata in F'' (BuxWV 161)\n | description4 = A toccata for organ.\n | format4 = [[Ogg]] \n | filename5 = BuxWV 12 - Cantate Domino.ogg\n | title5 = ''Cantate Domino'' (BuxWV 12)\n | description5 = Performed in 2005 by Bangkok Baroque Ensemble and Musica Ficta Bangkok\n | format5 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename6 = BuxWV160.ogg\n | title6 = Ciaconna in E-moll (BuxWV 160) \n | description6 = Performed on organ\n | format6 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\n*Organ works\n**[[Lionel Rogg]] (EMI - 2-CD set; now only available as an mp3 download)\n**[[Simone Stella]] (Complete Organ Music \u2013 6-CD set), [[OnClassical]] (OC61-66B) 2012 also licensed for [[Brilliant Classics]] (BC 94422), 2012\n**[[Ulrik Spang-Hanssen]] (complete \u2013 recorded 1990/93)\n**[[Ren\u00e9 Saorgin]] (complete)\n**[[Michel Chapuis (organist)|Michel Chapuis]] (complete)\n**[[Peter Hurford]]\n**David Kinsela\n**[[Harald Vogel]] (complete - 7 CDs on the MD&G label)\n**[[Jean-Charles Ablitzer]] (complete - 5 CDs on the Harmonic Records label - recorded 1987-1989)\n**[[Ernst-Erich Stender]]\n**[[Bine Katrine Bryndorf]] (complete \u2013 6 CDs on the Da Capo label)\n**[[Walter Kraft]] (Complete \u2013 six CDs on the VoxBox label cd6x 3613 \u2013 recorded 1957, remastered 1999 \u2013 Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck)\n**[[Hans Davidsson]] (complete organ works \u2013 ''Volume 1: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/product_p/lrcd-1090-91.htm Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ], Loft Recordings</ref> ''Volume 2: The Bach Perspective'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_organ_works_Bach_Perspective_Davidsson_p/lrcd-1092-93.htm Dieterich Buxtehude: the Bach perspective], Loft Recordings</ref> and ''Volume 3: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ''<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_3_The_Schnitger_Organ_Davidsson_3_CDs_p/lrcd-1094-96.htm Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ], Loft Recordings</ref>)\n**[[Christopher Herrick]] (to be recorded from 2007)\n** [[Helga Schauerte-Maubouet]] : (Complete Organ Works), ''Syrius (SYR 141.347/348/359/366/371), 2000\u20132002'',\n**[[Ton Koopman]] (complete) \u2013 [[Dieterich Buxtehude \u2013 Opera Omnia]] series; Vol III, Organ works 1 (BuxWV 139, 141, 146, 156, 160, 162, 169, 178, 197, 210, 213, 220), Coci/Klapmeyer organ Altenbruch, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72242 \u2013 Vol IV, Organ works 2 (BuxWV 157, 161, 163, 164, 170, 173\u2013175, 177, 180\u2013182, 184, 188, 211, 217, 223), Wilde/Schnitger organ Ludingworth, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72243 \u2013 Vol VIII, Organ works 3 (BuxWV 149, 179, 225, 140, 185, 159, 148, 187, 176, 145, 183, 213\u20135, 137, 193, 200), Schnitger organ Hamburg, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72247 \u2013 Vol IX, Organ works 4 (BuxWV 138, 199, 172, 202, 224, 147, 196, 171, 219, 203, 144, 212, 201, 167, 186, 198, 190, 207, 189), Gerke/Herbst organ Basedow, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72248 \u2013 Vol X, Organ works 5 (BuxWV 142, 209, 218, 136, 222, 155, 221, 151, 152, 191, 158, 204, 205, 150, 153, 194, 192, 143, 206, 208 plus preludes in e (2) and G and a chorale prelude on \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" by Nicolaus Bruhns), Bielefeld organ Stade, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72249 (complete)\n**[[Bernard Foccroulle]] (complete) Ricercar RIC250.

Dieterich was employed as an organist, first in Helsingborg (1657\u20131658), and then at Helsing\u00f8r (1660\u20131668). St. Mary\u2019s in Helsing\u00f8r is the only church where Buxtehude was employed that still has the organ in its original location.\n\n===L\u00fcbeck: Marienkirche===\n[[File:Johann Philipp F\u00f6rtsch.jpg|thumb|Another person in the same Voorhout painting, once was thought to be Buxtehude.

There he succeeded [[Franz Tunder]] and followed in many of the footsteps of his predecessor. He married Tunder's daughter Anna Margarethe in 1668 \u2013 it was not uncommon practice that a man marry the daughter of his predecessor in his occupation. Buxtehude and Anna Margarethe had seven daughters who were baptized at the Marienkirche; however, his first daughter died as an infant. After his retirement as organist at St Olaf's Church, his father joined the family in L\u00fcbeck in 1673. Johannes died a year later, and Dieterich composed his funeral music. Dieterich's brother Peter, a barber, joined them in 1677.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nHis post in the free Imperial city of L\u00fcbeck afforded him considerable latitude in his musical career, and his autonomy was a model for the careers of later Baroque masters such as [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. In 1673 he reorganized a series of evening musical performances, initiated by Tunder, known as ''[[Abendmusik]],'' which attracted musicians from diverse places and remained a feature of the church until 1810. In 1703, Handel and Mattheson both traveled to meet Buxtehude, who was by then elderly and ready to retire. He offered his position in L\u00fcbeck to Handel and Mattheson but stipulated that the organist who ascended to it must marry his eldest daughter, Anna Margareta. Both Handel and Mattheson turned the offer down<!--was it the daughter?--> and left the day after their arrival.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> In 1705, J.S. Bach, then a young man of twenty, walked from [[Arnstadt]] to L\u00fcbeck, a distance of more than {{convert|400|km}}, and stayed nearly three months to hear the ''Abendmusik,'' meet the pre-eminent L\u00fcbeck organist, hear him play, and, as Bach explained, \"to comprehend one thing and another about his art\".<ref>Christoph Wolff, ''Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician'' (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, Inc., 2000), 96.</ref> In addition to his musical duties, Buxtehude, like his predecessor Tunder, served as church treasurer.\n\n===Influence and legacy===\nAlthough more than 100 vocal compositions by Buxtehude survive, very few of them were included in the important German manuscript collections of the period, and until the early twentieth century, Buxtehude was regarded primarily as a keyboard composer. His surviving church music is praised for its high musical qualities rather than its progressive elements<!--, which is similar to that of Bach's later church music.{{please clarify|reason=\"To what does 'which' refer?

North German Church Music in the Age of Buxtehude. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude}}\n\n===General introduction===\nThe bulk of Buxtehude's oeuvre consists of vocal music, which covers a wide variety of styles,<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> and organ works, which concentrate mostly on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms. Chamber music constitutes a minor part of the surviving output, although the only chamber works Buxtehude published during his lifetime were fourteen chamber sonatas. Unfortunately, many of Buxtehude's compositions have been lost.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The [[libretto]]s for his [[oratorio]]s, for example, survive; but none of the scores do, which is particularly unfortunate, because his German oratorios seem to be the model for later works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]. Further evidence of lost works by Buxtehude and his contemporaries can be found in the recently discovered catalogue of a 1695 music-auction in L\u00fcbeck.<ref>Stephen Rose, 'A L\u00fcbeck music auction, 1695', ''Sch\u00fctz-Jahrbuch'' 30 (2008), 171\u2013190.</ref>\n\n[[Gustaf D\u00fcben]]'s collection and the so-called L\u00fcbeck tablature A373 are the two most important sources for Buxtehude's vocal music. The former includes several autographs, both in German [[organ tablature]] and in score. Both collections were probably created during Buxtehude's lifetime and with his permission. Copies made by various composers are the only extant sources for the organ works: chorale settings are mostly transmitted in copies by [[Johann Gottfried Walther]], while Gottfried Lindemann's and others' copies concentrate on free works. [[Johann Christoph Bach]]'s manuscript is particularly important, as it includes the three known ostinato works and the famous Prelude and [[Chaconne]] in C major, [[List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude|BuxWV]] 137. Although Buxtehude himself most probably wrote in organ tablature, the majority of the copies are in standard staff notation.\n\n===Keyboard works===\n\n====Preludes and toccatas====\nThe nineteen organ ''praeludia'' (or ''preludes'') form the core of Buxtehude's work and are ultimately considered his most important contributions to the music literature of the seventeenth century. They are sectional compositions that alternate between free improvisation and strict counterpoint. They are usually either [[fugue]]s or pieces written in fugal manner; all make heavy use of pedal and are idiomatic to the organ. These preludes, together with pieces by [[Nicolaus Bruhns]], represent the highest point in the evolution of the [[German organ schools|north German organ prelude]], and the so-called ''[[stylus phantasticus]]''. They were undoubtedly among the influences of J.S. Bach, whose organ preludes, toccatas and fugues frequently employ similar techniques.<ref>While John Butt (''Cambridge Companion to Bach'', Cambridge UP, 1997, 110; books.google.com/books?id=MysXAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT110) believes the centrality of Buxtehude's on Bach's ''toccatas'', David Schulenberg emphasizes the influence of several composers. Schulenberg reserves the word \"especially\" for Johann Adam Reincken: \"Closer to a small group of north-German toccatas, especially one by Reincken [...] that resemble the early-Baroque type in being composed of distinct contrasting sections.\" Schulenberg, ''The Keyboard Music of J.S. Bach'' (NY: Routledge, 1992 [rev. ed., 2013]), 98.\n{{ISBN|9781136091544}}</ref>\n\nThe preludes are quite varied in style and structure, and are therefore hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The texture of Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia can be described as either free or fugal.<ref name=\"Archbald\">Archbald, Lawrence. Style and Structure in the Praeludia of Dietrich Buxtehude. Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1985.</ref> They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).\n\nThe introductory sections are always improvisatory. The preludes begin almost invariably with a single motif in one of the voices which is then treated imitatively for a bar or two. After this the introduction will most commonly elaborate on this motif or a part of it, or on a short melodic germ which is passed from voice to voice in three- or four-voice polyphonic writing, as seen in Example 1:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-145-intro.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 1''': This is the introduction from Prelude in F major, BuxWV 145. The motivic interaction seen here, in which a short motif is passing from one voice to another, sometimes sounding in two voices simultaneously, was frequently employed by Buxtehude in his preludes, frequently expanded to four voices with heavy use of pedal.]]\n\nOccasionally the introduction will engage in parallel 3rds, 6ths, etc. For example, BuxWV 149 begins with a single voice, proceeds to parallel counterpoint for nine bars and then segues into the kind of texture described above. The improvisatory interludes, free sections and postludes may all employ a vast array of techniques, from miscellaneous kinds of imitative writing (the technique discussed above, or \"fugues\" that dissolve into homophonic writing, etc.) to various forms of non-motivic interaction between voices (arpeggios, chordal style, figuration over [[pedal point]], etc.). [[Tempo]] marks are frequently present: ''Adagio'' sections written out in chords of whole- and half-notes, ''Vivace'' and ''Allegro'' imitative sections, and others.\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-fugue-subjects.gif|right|thumb|200px|'''Example 2''': Fugue subjects from BuxWV 137, BuxWV 140, BuxWV 142 (two) and BuxWV 153]]\n\nThe number of fugues in a prelude varies from one to three, not counting the pseudo-fugal free sections. The fugues normally employ four voices with extensive use of pedal. Most subjects are of medium length (see Example 2), frequently with some degree of repercussion (note repeating, particularly in BuxWV 148 and BuxWV 153), wide leaps or simplistic runs of 16th notes. One of the notable exceptions is a fugue in BuxWV 145, which features a six-bar subject. The answers are usually tonal, on scale degrees 1 and 5, and there is little real modulation. Stretto and parallel entries may be employed, with particular emphasis on the latter. Short and simple countersubjects appear, and may change their form slightly during the course of the fugue. In terms of structure, Buxtehude's fugues are a series of expositions, with non-thematic material appearing quite rarely, if ever. There is some variation, however, in the way they are constructed: in the first and last fugues of BuxWV 136 the second voice does not state the subject as it enters during the initial exposition; in BuxWV 153 the second exposition uses the subject in its inverted form, etc. Fugue subjects of a particular prelude may be related as in [[Froberger]]'s and [[Girolamo Frescobaldi|Frescobaldi]]'s [[ricercar]]s and [[canzona]]s (BuxWV 150, 152, etc.):\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-subjtrans.gif|center]]\n\nThe fugal procedure dissolves at the end of the fugue when it is followed by a free section, as seen in Example 4:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-140-bars39-42.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 4''': The dissolution of the fugue before a free section. The final entry of the subject (in the pedal) is joined by the highest voice engaging in a scale run.]]\n\nBuxtehude's other pieces that employ free writing or sectional structure include works titled ''toccata'', ''praeambulum'', etc.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> All are similar to the ''praeludia'' in terms of construction and techniques used, except that some of these works do not employ pedal passages or do so in a very basic way (pedal point which lasts during much of the piece, etc.). A well-known piece is BuxWV 146, in the rare key of F-sharp minor; it is believed that this prelude was written by Buxtehude especially for himself and his organ, and that he had his own way of tuning the instrument to allow for the tonality rarely used because of meantone temperament.\n\n====Chorale settings====\nThere are over 40 surviving chorale settings by Buxtehude, and they constitute the most important contributions to the genre in the 17th century.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> His settings include chorale variations, chorale ricercares, chorale fantasias and chorale preludes. Buxtehude's principal contributions to the organ chorale are his 30 short chorale preludes. The chorale preludes are usually four-part [[cantus firmus]] settings of one stanza of the chorale; the melody is presented in an elaborately ornamented version in the upper voice, the three lower parts engage in some form of counterpoint (not necessarily imitative). Most of Buxtehude's chorale settings are in this form.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Here is an example from chorale ''[[A Mighty Fortress is Our God|Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]'' BuxWV 184:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-chorale-ein-feste.png|center|thumb|810px|Opening bars of ''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'' BuxWV 184. The ornamented chorale in the upper voice is highlighted, original melody for the two lines present here is shown on separate staves. Note the basic imitative lines in bars 6\u20138 and 13\u201315.]]\n\nThe ornamented cantus firmus in these pieces represents a significant difference between the [[German organ schools|north German and the south German schools]]; [[Johann Pachelbel]] and his pupils would almost always leave the chorale melody unornamented.\n\nThe chorale fantasias (a modern term) are large-scale virtuosic sectional compositions that cover a whole strophe of the text and are somewhat similar to chorale concertos in their treatment of the text: each verse is developed separately, allowing for technically and emotionally contrasting sections within one composition.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The presence of contrasting textures makes these pieces reminiscent of Buxtehude's ''praeludia''. Buxtehude was careful with correct word setting, paying particular attention to emphasis and interpretation.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Each section is also closely related to the text of the corresponding lines (chromatic sections to express sadness, gigue fugues to express joy, etc.). Examples include fantasias on the [hymn]s ''Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ'' BuxWV 188, ''{{lang|de|[[Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein]]}}'' BuxWV 210, ''Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren'' BuxWV 213 and ''[[Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern]]'', BuxWV 223.\n\nBuxtehude's chorale variations are usually in two or three voices. They consist of around 3\u20134 variations of which only one may use the pedal. These pieces are not as important for the development of the form and not as advanced as Pachelbel's or [[Georg B\u00f6hm|B\u00f6hm]]'s contributions to the genre. There are only a few chorale variations, and there are no distinctive qualities that characterize them.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nThe pieces that do not fall into any of the three types are ''Auf meinen lieben Gott'' BuxWV 179, which is, quite unusually for the time, a dance suite based on the chorale, and the ones based on the chant ([[Magnificat]]s BuxWV 203\u20135 and ''Te Deum laudamus'', BuxWV 218), which are structurally similar to chorale fantasias.\n\n====Ostinato works====\nThe three [[ostinato]] bass works Buxtehude composed\u2014two [[chaconne]]s (BuxWV 159\u2013160) and a [[passacaglia]] ([[Passacaglia in D minor, BuxWV 161|BuxWV 161]])\u2014not only represent, along with Pachelbel's six organ chaconnes, a shift from the traditional chaconne style, but are also the first truly developed north German contributions to the development of the genre.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> They are among Buxtehude's best-known works and have influenced numerous composers after him, most notably Bach (whose organ passacaglia is modeled after Buxtehude's) and [[Johannes Brahms]]. The pieces feature numerous connected sections, with many suspensions, changing meters, and even real modulation (in which the ostinato pattern is transposed into another key).\n\nSome of the [[Prelude (music)|praeludia]] also make use of ostinato models. The praeludium in C major, BuxWV 137, begins with a lengthy pedal solo and concludes not with a postlude of arpeggios and scale runs, but with a comparatively short chaconne built over a three-bar ostinato pattern in the pedal:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-137-ciacona.gif|center|720px]]\n\nThe praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 148, in which the ostinato pattern is derived from the subject of one of the fugal sections, also ends in a chaconne. In addition, another praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 149, employs a repeating bass pattern in the beginning.\n\n====Other keyboard works====\nThe rest of Buxtehude's keyboard music does not employ pedals. Of the organ works, a few keyboard canzonas are the only strictly contrapuntal pieces in Buxtehude's oeuvre and were probably composed with teaching purposes in mind.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> There are also three pieces labelled ''fugues'': only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 is more of a canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 is more like a typical Buxtehude prelude, only beginning with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.\n\nThere are also 19 [[harpsichord]] suites and several variation sets. The suites follow the standard model (Allemande \u2013 Sarabande \u2013 Courante \u2013 Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande or a couple of doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French [[lute]] [[style bris\u00e9]], sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never go as far as the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, [[Johann Mattheson]] mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.\n\nThe several sets of arias with variations are, surprisingly, much more developed than the organ chorale variations. BuxWV 250 ''La Capricciosa'' may have inspired Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'' BWV 988: both have 32 variations (including the two arias of the Goldberg Variations); there are a number of similarities in the structure of individual movements; both include variations in forms of various dances; both are in G major; and Bach was familiar with Buxtehude's work and admired him, as has been related above.\n\n==Recordings==\n\n===Available media===\n{{listen\n | filename = BuxWV_104_-_Was_frag_ich_nach_der_Welt.ogg\n | title = ''Was frag ich nach der Welt'' (BuxWV 104)\n | description = Live recording (excerpt)\n | format = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2 = Buxtehude -- Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis).mid\n | title2 = ''Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis)''\n | description2 = Played with organ ([[MIDI]] file).\n | format2 = [[MIDI]]\n | filename3 = Wo ist doch.ogg\n | title3 = \"Dialogus inter Christum et fidelem animam\" \u2013 Wo ist doch mein freund geblieben?\n | description3 = A sacred cantata for soprano and bass.\n | format3 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename4 = Buxtehude - Toccata in F-Dur BuxWV 161.ogg\n | title4 = ''Toccata in F'' (BuxWV 161)\n | description4 = A toccata for organ.\n | format4 = [[Ogg]] \n | filename5 = BuxWV 12 - Cantate Domino.ogg\n | title5 = ''Cantate Domino'' (BuxWV 12)\n | description5 = Performed in 2005 by Bangkok Baroque Ensemble and Musica Ficta Bangkok\n | format5 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename6 = BuxWV160.ogg\n | title6 = Ciaconna in E-moll (BuxWV 160) \n | description6 = Performed on organ\n | format6 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\n*Organ works\n**[[Lionel Rogg]] (EMI - 2-CD set; now only available as an mp3 download)\n**[[Simone Stella]] (Complete Organ Music \u2013 6-CD set), [[OnClassical]] (OC61-66B) 2012 also licensed for [[Brilliant Classics]] (BC 94422), 2012\n**[[Ulrik Spang-Hanssen]] (complete \u2013 recorded 1990/93)\n**[[Ren\u00e9 Saorgin]] (complete)\n**[[Michel Chapuis (organist)|Michel Chapuis]] (complete)\n**[[Peter Hurford]]\n**David Kinsela\n**[[Harald Vogel]] (complete - 7 CDs on the MD&G label)\n**[[Jean-Charles Ablitzer]] (complete - 5 CDs on the Harmonic Records label - recorded 1987-1989)\n**[[Ernst-Erich Stender]]\n**[[Bine Katrine Bryndorf]] (complete \u2013 6 CDs on the Da Capo label)\n**[[Walter Kraft]] (Complete \u2013 six CDs on the VoxBox label cd6x 3613 \u2013 recorded 1957, remastered 1999 \u2013 Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck)\n**[[Hans Davidsson]] (complete organ works \u2013 ''Volume 1: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/product_p/lrcd-1090-91.htm Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ], Loft Recordings</ref> ''Volume 2: The Bach Perspective'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_organ_works_Bach_Perspective_Davidsson_p/lrcd-1092-93.htm Dieterich Buxtehude: the Bach perspective], Loft Recordings</ref> and ''Volume 3: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ''<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_3_The_Schnitger_Organ_Davidsson_3_CDs_p/lrcd-1094-96.htm Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ], Loft Recordings</ref>)\n**[[Christopher Herrick]] (to be recorded from 2007)\n** [[Helga Schauerte-Maubouet]] : (Complete Organ Works), ''Syrius (SYR 141.347/348/359/366/371), 2000\u20132002'',\n**[[Ton Koopman]] (complete) \u2013 [[Dieterich Buxtehude \u2013 Opera Omnia]] series; Vol III, Organ works 1 (BuxWV 139, 141, 146, 156, 160, 162, 169, 178, 197, 210, 213, 220), Coci/Klapmeyer organ Altenbruch, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72242 \u2013 Vol IV, Organ works 2 (BuxWV 157, 161, 163, 164, 170, 173\u2013175, 177, 180\u2013182, 184, 188, 211, 217, 223), Wilde/Schnitger organ Ludingworth, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72243 \u2013 Vol VIII, Organ works 3 (BuxWV 149, 179, 225, 140, 185, 159, 148, 187, 176, 145, 183, 213\u20135, 137, 193, 200), Schnitger organ Hamburg, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72247 \u2013 Vol IX, Organ works 4 (BuxWV 138, 199, 172, 202, 224, 147, 196, 171, 219, 203, 144, 212, 201, 167, 186, 198, 190, 207, 189), Gerke/Herbst organ Basedow, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72248 \u2013 Vol X, Organ works 5 (BuxWV 142, 209, 218, 136, 222, 155, 221, 151, 152, 191, 158, 204, 205, 150, 153, 194, 192, 143, 206, 208 plus preludes in e (2) and G and a chorale prelude on \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" by Nicolaus Bruhns), Bielefeld organ Stade, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72249 (complete)\n**[[Bernard Foccroulle]] (complete) Ricercar RIC250.

It features various chefs competing against [[Iron Chef]] [[Bobby Flay]]. This show is taped in front of a live audience.\n\n== Format ==\nIn the first round, two guests, often a celebrity chef and a friend of Flay, introduce two contestants who cook for 20 minutes against each other using an ingredient chosen by Flay. The guests then determine who cooked the better dish and will face Flay in the second round.  The winning contestant then chooses a dish for both the contestant and Flay to cook in the second round which lasts for 45 minutes.  The winner of the second round is determined by three judges in a blind taste test. Through 293 competitions Bobby Flay's win-loss record is 185\u2013108 (a 63.1% win percentage).\n\nThe presentation of ''Beat Bobby Flay'' borrows from [[boxing]] matches, with a [[bell]] rung to indicate the start of rounds and mild or humorous [[trash talking]] by Flay, competing chefs and guest judges. During both rounds, the celebrity judges will periodically walk into cooking area to talk to each chef about their strategy; in the second round, they will also make light-hearted attempts to distract Flay.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | No.\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Original airdate\n! colspan=\"3\" | First round\n! colspan=\"3\" | Second round\n|-\n!

It features various chefs competing against [[Iron Chef]] [[Bobby Flay]]. This show is taped in front of a live audience.\n\n== Format ==\nIn the first round, two guests, often a celebrity chef and a friend of Flay, introduce two contestants who cook for 20 minutes against each other using an ingredient chosen by Flay. The guests then determine who cooked the better dish and will face Flay in the second round.  The winning contestant then chooses a dish for both the contestant and Flay to cook in the second round which lasts for 45 minutes.  The winner of the second round is determined by three judges in a blind taste test. Through 293 competitions Bobby Flay's win-loss record is 185\u2013108 (a 63.1% win percentage).\n\nThe presentation of ''Beat Bobby Flay'' borrows from [[boxing]] matches, with a [[bell]] rung to indicate the start of rounds and mild or humorous [[trash talking]] by Flay, competing chefs and guest judges.

Following the Fluxus Movement's way of thinking, she created ''Imbunches'', which was a collection of mixed media artworks on a display board. This piece of art represented [[censorship]] and the government's use of terror as a method of control. Chile, her native country, was under a dictatorship at this time, and this influenced her way of thinking as well. Parra's move back to Chile under this dictatorship was extremely significant as well; her artwork combines her concern for Chile's political history with the Fluxus Movement's ideals.<ref name = \"POST\" /> Her return to Chile found her joining with the popular artists' guild at the time, ''avanzada'', who popularized the use of mixed media featuring articles about current events based on their feelings/morals concerning the Chilean government.<ref name = \"Coco\" />\n\nWhile she lived in New York City, Parra taught high school to those who didn't have access to art in the [[New Museum]]\u2014illiterate people, pregnant teenagers, and other people who didn't have many privileges.

(2002). Catalina Parra: Jersey City Museum. ''Art Nexus'', (43), 118-119.</ref> ''No Moaning. No Complaining. No Rehab. Just Laughs.'' is a work that encompasses her personal expression of the Chilean government through her newspaper clipping showing General Augusto Pinochet and [[Hugo Banzer]] of [[Bolivia]] hugging. This work addresses the possibility of strong relationships between and or within countries. The current event at the time (shown by the newspaper clipping) was the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet, former dictator of Chile, for a request issued by the [[government of Spain]] for the murder of Spanish citizens during his dictatorship. His role in the [[Caravan of Death]] was also prominent, as the event occurred while he was ruling. So although it does have deeper meaning, it also displays the fact that she was rebelling against his ideas and beliefs through the desecration of his figure in her work. Her collection ''Run Away, Run Away'' also examines the switch from dictatorship to [[democracy]] because of the actions of Pinochet and gives voice to many Chilean citizens. Through ads and titles created by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Parra's collage collection attempts to show the emotions of the general's supporters and opponents. This work features Pinochet's face torn in half and \"sewn\" back together in the set of nine mixed media collages. ''Run Away, Run Away'' was a response to the legal attempts at Pinochet's past deeds and provided her views on this passionate issue. Her indirect views and art, as she had intended, gives the subliminal message to its viewers about the multiple topics she covers because she actually was at risk of being imprisoned upon proper interpretation of her [[Political dissent|antigovernment]] propaganda.<ref name = \"It's Indisputible\" />\n\n''Imbunches'' was definitely her most popular work and contains an encompassing meaning that helps define the path for her continuous works for decades.<ref name = \"Conversation\" /> This work of art represented a Chilean folklore about Chilote del [[Imbunche]], a baby who was sold to a [[Warlock of Chilo\u00e9]].<ref name = \"Gallery\" /> This warlock de-baptizes the baby and thanks to this process, the baby becomes a deformed monster used to guard the cave the sorcerer performs in. The Brujo sorcerer sews up each and every hole in the Chilote del Imbunche's body in order to keep the evil from leaving the accursed body and in his service for as long as he lives. This myth is how Parra gets her love for the sewing style she uses in many of her works, as she uses sewing as a main part of her collage as a tribute to the sewing performed in the Imbunche myth. Although in ''Imbunches'', the suturing is a part of the myth she recreated, Parra says the use of [[surgical suture|suture]]-looking thread appearing in the rest of her works represents disappearance, wounds, and being shut-out. They connect each part of the collage like lines in a drawing. ''Imbunches'' was also used to represent the evil in government\u2014as it had been presented during her time in Chile under the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, she indirectly symbolized his evil ways through her art.<ref name = \"Conversation\" />\n\nIn an interview with [[Alejandro Anreus]], Parra admits a lot about her art style. She says her collage is a combination of [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]], and primarily [[Dadaism]]\u2014she wants to use art as Dadaism does as a way of waking the viewers up to current/past events and allow them to see the truth of social responsibility. Parra uses her influences from Dadaism and her own experiences to create the collages that she does: she will often take long walks and ponder nature around her to set herself in the correct mood for working. She mentions in this interview that she would like to work with video and all of its components in the future.<ref name = \"It's Indisputible\" />\n\nCatalina Parra was also interviewed by artist educator Zoya Kocur, who is interested in the connection in Parra's works between the [[aesthetics]] and [[pedagogics]]. Parra says in the interview that she makes art in order to communicate herself to others\u2014yet, the person that she creates art for is herself, and each project is rewarding in its own way. In this interview, Parra says that her art is not just about awareness but also about what she feels is injustice and how she deals with these feelings.<ref name = \"It's Indisputible\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ \n!

In these works, Parra critically examines [[military intervention]]s as well as the empty promises of [[financial institution]]s and capitalist [[Consumer culture|consumer society]]. She is most well known for her visual work ''USA, Where Liberty is a Statue'' (1987), a thirty-second video that was played on the [[Spectacolor]] billboard in [[Times Square]] as part of the Public Art Fund project titled ''Messages to the Public'' (1982\u20131990).

Following the Fluxus Movement's way of thinking, she created ''Imbunches'', which was a collection of mixed media artworks on a display board. This piece of art represented [[censorship]] and the government's use of terror as a method of control. Chile, her native country, was under a dictatorship at this time, and this influenced her way of thinking as well. Parra's move back to Chile under this dictatorship was extremely significant as well; her artwork combines her concern for Chile's political history with the Fluxus Movement's ideals.<ref name = \"POST\" /> Her return to Chile found her joining with the popular artists' guild at the time, ''avanzada'', who popularized the use of mixed media featuring articles about current events based on their feelings/morals concerning the Chilean government.<ref name = \"Coco\" />\n\nWhile she lived in New York City, Parra taught high school to those who didn't have access to art in the [[New Museum]]\u2014illiterate people, pregnant teenagers, and other people who didn't have many privileges.

(2002). Catalina Parra: Jersey City Museum. ''Art Nexus'', (43), 118-119.</ref> ''No Moaning. No Complaining. No Rehab. Just Laughs.'' is a work that encompasses her personal expression of the Chilean government through her newspaper clipping showing General Augusto Pinochet and [[Hugo Banzer]] of [[Bolivia]] hugging. This work addresses the possibility of strong relationships between and or within countries. The current event at the time (shown by the newspaper clipping) was the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet, former dictator of Chile, for a request issued by the [[government of Spain]] for the murder of Spanish citizens during his dictatorship. His role in the [[Caravan of Death]] was also prominent, as the event occurred while he was ruling. So although it does have deeper meaning, it also displays the fact that she was rebelling against his ideas and beliefs through the desecration of his figure in her work. Her collection ''Run Away, Run Away'' also examines the switch from dictatorship to [[democracy]] because of the actions of Pinochet and gives voice to many Chilean citizens. Through ads and titles created by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Parra's collage collection attempts to show the emotions of the general's supporters and opponents. This work features Pinochet's face torn in half and \"sewn\" back together in the set of nine mixed media collages. ''Run Away, Run Away'' was a response to the legal attempts at Pinochet's past deeds and provided her views on this passionate issue. Her indirect views and art, as she had intended, gives the subliminal message to its viewers about the multiple topics she covers because she actually was at risk of being imprisoned upon proper interpretation of her [[Political dissent|antigovernment]] propaganda.<ref name = \"It's Indisputible\" />\n\n''Imbunches'' was definitely her most popular work and contains an encompassing meaning that helps define the path for her continuous works for decades.<ref name = \"Conversation\" /> This work of art represented a Chilean folklore about Chilote del [[Imbunche]], a baby who was sold to a [[Warlock of Chilo\u00e9]].<ref name = \"Gallery\" /> This warlock de-baptizes the baby and thanks to this process, the baby becomes a deformed monster used to guard the cave the sorcerer performs in. The Brujo sorcerer sews up each and every hole in the Chilote del Imbunche's body in order to keep the evil from leaving the accursed body and in his service for as long as he lives. This myth is how Parra gets her love for the sewing style she uses in many of her works, as she uses sewing as a main part of her collage as a tribute to the sewing performed in the Imbunche myth. Although in ''Imbunches'', the suturing is a part of the myth she recreated, Parra says the use of [[surgical suture|suture]]-looking thread appearing in the rest of her works represents disappearance, wounds, and being shut-out. They connect each part of the collage like lines in a drawing. ''Imbunches'' was also used to represent the evil in government\u2014as it had been presented during her time in Chile under the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, she indirectly symbolized his evil ways through her art.<ref name = \"Conversation\" />\n\nIn an interview with [[Alejandro Anreus]], Parra admits a lot about her art style. She says her collage is a combination of [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]], and primarily [[Dadaism]]\u2014she wants to use art as Dadaism does as a way of waking the viewers up to current/past events and allow them to see the truth of social responsibility. Parra uses her influences from Dadaism and her own experiences to create the collages that she does: she will often take long walks and ponder nature around her to set herself in the correct mood for working. She mentions in this interview that she would like to work with video and all of its components in the future.<ref name = \"It's Indisputible\" />\n\nCatalina Parra was also interviewed by artist educator Zoya Kocur, who is interested in the connection in Parra's works between the [[aesthetics]] and [[pedagogics]]. Parra says in the interview that she makes art in order to communicate herself to others\u2014yet, the person that she creates art for is herself, and each project is rewarding in its own way. In this interview, Parra says that her art is not just about awareness but also about what she feels is injustice and how she deals with these feelings.<ref name = \"It's Indisputible\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ \n!

In presidential elections, it supervises the national convention and, both independently and in coordination with the presidential candidate, raises funds, commissions polls, and coordinates campaign strategy.

When the president is a Democrat, the party generally works closely with the president. In presidential elections, it supervises the national convention and, both independently and in coordination with the presidential candidate, raises funds, commissions polls, and coordinates campaign strategy. Following the selection of a party nominee, the public funding laws permit the national party to coordinate certain expenditures with the nominee, but additional funds are spent on general, party-building activities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Public Funding of Presidential Elections |publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] |date=February 2005 |url= http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml#General |accessdate=October 29, 2006}}</ref> There are state committees in every state, as well as local committees in most cities, wards, and towns (and, in most states, counties).\n\nThe chairperson of the DNC is elected by vote of members of the Democratic National Committee.<ref name=charter>[https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DNC-Charter-Bylaws-8.25.18-with-Amendments.pdf DNC 2018 Charter]</ref>{{rp|5}} The DNC is composed of the chairs and vice-chairs of each state Democratic Party's central committee, two hundred members apportioned among the states based on population and generally elected either on the ballot by primary voters or by the state Democratic Party committee, a number of elected officials serving in an [[ex officio member|ex officio]] capacity, and a variety of representatives of major Democratic Party constituencies.\n\n[[File:Chicago delegation to the January 8, 1912 meeting of the Democratic National Committee.jpg|thumb|[[Chicago]] delegation to the January 8, 1912 Democratic National Committee]]\nThe DNC establishes rules for the [[Caucus|caucuses]] and [[United States presidential primary|primaries]] which choose delegates to the [[Democratic National Convention]], but the caucuses and primaries themselves are most often run not by the DNC but instead by each individual state. Primary elections, in particular, are invariably conducted by state governments according to their own laws. Political parties may choose to participate or not participate in a state's primary election, but no political party executives have any jurisdiction over the dates of primary elections, or how they are conducted.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOutside of the process of nominating a presidential candidate, the DNC's role in actually selecting candidates to run on the party ticket is minimal.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAll DNC members are [[Superdelegate|superdelegates]] to the Democratic National Convention, whose role can take precedence over a close primary race. However, the methodology for this has been called into dispute in both the 2016 and 2020 primary races and concerns the question of candidates achieving a voter majority vs plurality. By virtue of remaining on the ballot, candidates may then likely impede party voters to realize a majority for any single candidate. This is how superdelegates currently function. These delegates, officially described as \"unpledged party leader and elected official delegates,\" fall into three categories based on other positions they hold:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demrulz.org/wp-content/files/12.15.14_2016_Delegate_Selection_Documents_Mailing_-_Rules_Call_Regs_Model_Plan_Checklist_12.15.14.pdf|title=Delegate Selection Materials For the 2016 Democratic National Convention|date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n* elected members of the Democratic National Committee,\n* sitting Democratic governors and members of Congress, and\n* distinguished party leaders, consisting of current and former presidents, vice presidents, congressional leaders, and DNC chairs, are all superdelegates for life.\n\n==DNC fundraising==\nIn the 2002 election cycle, the DNC and its affiliated committees (which include numerous local committees and committees formed to coordinate expenditures for specific districts or races) raised a total of US$162,062,084, 42% of which was [[campaign finance in the United States|hard money]].

(Similarly, the 1990s series casts doubt on both The Creeper and Proteus\u2019 origins.) Shortly after his last solo issue, the Creeper teamed with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #80 (November 1968), then guested in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #70 (March 1969), where it was asked whether the Creeper was an outlaw. He also appeared with Batman in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #418 (December 1971). After the origin was reprinted in ''Detective Comics'' #443 (November 1974), one of the \"[[DC 100 Page Super Spectacular]]\" series, the Creeper's alter ego Jack Ryder was shown working as a news anchor on Gotham City television in issue #445 (March 1975), and in ''Detective Comics'' #447\u2013448 (May\u2013June 1975) he became the Creeper again to help Batman escape a frame-up for murder.\n\nDC kept the character active with sporadic solo runs and guest shots over the next few years. He turned up almost immediately in issue #3 (October 1975) of the [[Joker (character)|Joker's]] short-lived, [[Joker (comic book)|self-titled series]], in a story written by O'Neil, where the similarity in green hair and maniacal laughter caused confusion between the two. This was followed with a one-off solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #7 (October 1975), [[penciler|penciled]] by Ditko.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Jack|title=''1st Issue Special'': It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant to Be)|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=44|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Other appearances in this period included team-ups with [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] in ''[[Super-Team Family]]'' #2 (January 1976), again written by O'Neil; with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #143 (October 1978) and #178 (September 1981); and with many fellow alumni (and a few non-graduates) of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in that comic's 100th issue (May 1978). A story intended for the never-published ''Showcase'' #106 in 1978 (written and drawn by Ditko and which would be included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #2) was included in ''The Creeper by Steve Ditko'' hardcover collection published by DC in 2010.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Ditko|first1= Steve|authorlink1= Steve Ditko |title= The Creeper by Steve Ditko |year= 2010 |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |isbn= 1-4012-2591-8}}</ref> Among further solos were backup series in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #445\u2013447 (1976), ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #249\u201355 (1978\u20131979, written and fully drawn by Ditko), and ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #318\u2013323 (1983).\n\nBeginning in a team-up with [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #88 (December 1985), written by [[Steve Englehart]]) during the\n''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' company-wide story arc, the Creeper's depiction changed under different writers, which included a revised origin that was referenced but never wholly revealed. His deranged behavior, initially an act to frighten criminals, transformed into genuine, narcotics-induced psychotic behavior. In addition, Ryder could access his enhanced physical abilities only in his costumed form, and could no longer control his transformations. The new version came into focus when the Creeper teamed with the [[Justice League International]] in 1987. A decade later, DC gave the Creeper another chance in a solo comic, ''The Creeper''. It lasted 12 issues (December 1997&nbsp;\u2013 November 1998), including the 1998 [[DC One Million]] special numbering.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/5733/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 1997 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> Writer [[Len Kaminski]] focused on the breakdown of Ryder's sanity under the influence of the Creeper and made many references to previous continuity: the character is initially in an asylum and is formally diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]];<ref>''The Creeper'' (Volume 1) #3, p.&nbsp;3</ref> his two personas frequently battle for control of their shared body.\n\nThe Creeper starred in a six-issue mini-series, ''The Creeper'' volume 2 (October 2006&nbsp;\u2013 March 2007), written by [[Steve Niles]] and drawn by [[Justiniano]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/19429/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 2006 series)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Jack Ryder''' is a former [[Gotham City]] television [[talk show]] [[talk show host|host]] who was fired due to his outspoken nature.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=98-99}}</ref> In ''[[Bruce Wayne: The Road Home#Outsiders|Bruce Wayne: The Road Home: Outsiders]]'', it is revealed that he once dated [[Vicki Vale]]. Finding employment in security headed by [[Bill Brane]], he attempts to rescue a scientist named [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz]] whom mobsters headed by gangster [[Angel Devlin]] have kidnapped in order to obtain his newest discoveries. The chief mobster hosts a masquerade party at his mansion. To gain entry, Ryder improvises a costume from yellow tights and facial make-up designed to look like skin, a green wig and trunks, and red gloves, boots, and furry cloak. Ryder locates Yatz inside, but the mobsters discover him and first shoot at him, but then finally stabs him, wounding Ryder. Yatz injects Ryder with a serum and implants a device in his wound. The serum confers the power to almost instantly heal any wound and grants Ryder enhanced strength and agility. The device, used with its activator, causes the costume to disappear, leaving Ryder naked (he can later change into his formal clothes on command). Yatz inadvertently leaves the activator out of the wound, but does not realize this until after the wound had healed. At this point, the mobsters find their victims again, this time killing Yatz. Ryder discovers that with the activator, he can regain the wild costume whenever he wishes. With it, a crazy laugh and his enhanced physical abilities, he has no trouble routing the crooks.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAs the Creeper, Ryder has a series of adventures dealing with supervillains, while hiding his secret identity from his friends and cohorts and dealing with weather girl personality [[Vera Sweet]] who also acts as his love interest.\n\nThe eventual revision of the Creeper's origin eliminated the serum and claims that the scientist surgically implanted two devices (some accounts claim a single device with two effects) that enhance Ryder's physical abilities and can recreate an object whose \"imprint\" is stored in its circuitry. The scientist performs this surgery to save Ryder's life after criminals he was investigating attacked and drugged him. Because the scientist is unaware of the drugs in Ryder's system he inadvertently recorded their \"imprint\" at the same time he recorded the \"imprint\" of the costume, thus the device that recreates Ryder's costume when he becomes the Creeper also recreates the drugs in his system, explaining the Creeper's odd personality. These drugs so overwhelm Ryder's system that their effect becomes cumulative and the Creeper gradually becomes more irrational. When the Creeper changes back to Jack Ryder, the drugs disappear and with them, the psychosis. Eventually, Ryder comes to believe that he and the Creeper are two entirely different people instead of two roles played by the same man; he also holds this belief in his Creeper persona, which becomes increasingly disdainful of \"Jack Ryder\". The Creeper once regained his rationality while bound by [[Wonder Woman]]'s magic lasso, but the implications of this have never been explored.\n\n===Fighting Eclipso===\nThe Creeper appeared in the ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within]]'' annuals in 1992, tricked into taking up one of [[Eclipso]]'s dark crystals, putting him under Eclipso's control. He is later freed by Bruce Gordon, a longtime adversary of Eclipso. In the self-titled ''Eclipso'' comic book series, the Creeper, Gordon and his wife Mona make an initial foray into the South American territory that Eclipso has conquered. This leads to an Eclipso-possessed peasant throwing the Creeper (and himself) off a cliff. The peasant is mentally abandoned and both are left to plunge to their deaths. The intervention of a stunt squad saves the lives of both men. Several other heroes join in the fight against Eclipso, including [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]], the original [[Commander Steel|Steel]], [[Amanda Waller]], and [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Wildcat]] II. They form a team called the [[Shadow Fighters]]. In issue #13 of ''Eclipso'', a portion of the Fighters, including the Creeper, make another trip into Eclipso's territory. Several hyenas, possessed by Eclipso, track down the Creeper and tear him to shreds. Most of the infiltration team is slain; only small parts of the Creeper are actually recovered. The remains, along with the other dead heroes, are stolen out from under Eclipso's control by surviving Shadow Fighters.\n\nDespite this death, a Creeper series was launched in 1997. There are indications in this comic that the Dr. Yatz origin as detailed in previous appearances is somehow false and that the Creeper's actual origins are in some way related to his longtime villain, Proteus. Before this was fully explored, however, the series ceased publication.\n\n===Rebooted origin===\nIn 2006, a new version of the Creeper appears in the ''Brave New World'' one shot, published following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In the one shot, Jack Ryder is now the host of a controversial TV show, ''You Are Wrong!'', promising $1,000,000 to the person who catches the Creeper.\nFollowing this, a six-issue Creeper miniseries revealed the new origin, seemingly taking place during Batman's early years.\n\nRyder is said to support Dr. Vincent Yatz, who has been combining [[stem cell]] therapy and medical [[nanotechnology]] to create a revolutionary \"nanocell\" therapy called \"smart-skin\", which would enhance the body's regeneration to the point of giving new skin to burn victims and those who have suffered severe scarring. Ryder visits Yatz's lab just as the scientist is being threatened by mobsters attempting to steal the latest test batch of his newly discovered technology. Unable to escape, Yatz injects the last sample of smart-skin, still somewhat unstable, into Ryder's body in an attempt to keep it safe from the mobsters. When the criminals shoot Ryder in his head, the smart-skin activates, resurrecting Ryder moments later as the Creeper, a yellow-skinned man with superhuman physicality, green hair, and a mane of red hair growing on his back (as opposed to wearing fake red fur, like previous incarnations). The Creeper is a separate personality from Ryder and dispatches the criminals. Ryder discovers he and the Creeper can trade places, after which each acts as a witness to the other's activities and can mentally communicate with their alter ego.\n\nInitially wanting nothing to do with the Creeper, Ryder lets him out when the yellow-skinned creature convinces him to seek revenge on their would-be killers. During their pursuit of the criminals, the Creeper and Ryder learn that Yatz has secretly intended the smart-skin to be a weapon. Side effects of its use on human subjects seem to be a loss of mental control, along with the test subjects all getting yellow skin and a mixture of red and green hair. Yatz credits these side effects on the mind and body as resulting from a nerve agent (provided by his silent partner) he had added to the nanocells. This partner is revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], who had hoped to combine his Joker venom (which causes temporary madness and usually death by laughter) and Yatz's technology to create an army of maniacal, superstrong, near-immortal soldiers. Batman and Ryder defeat the Joker, who later attacks Yatz in revenge. Batman discovers Ryder's double identity and creates a chemical agent that can cure him of the Creeper, but Ryder refuses and forms a truce with his alter ego, agreeing to let the Creeper out from time to time to fight criminals while hiding his identity from everyone including news rival and love interest [[Vera Sweet]].\n\n===''Countdown''===\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Secondary titles|Countdown to Mystery]]'' #2, Jack Ryder is approached by [[Eclipso]], who hopes to seduce him as she did [[Plastic Man]]. She succeeds, but the Creeper is later freed from the corruption by Bruce Gordon. In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #24 (2007), the Creeper is seen, along with other heroes, fighting members of the [[Sinestro Corps]] in the streets of [[New York City|New York]].\n\n===''Reign in Hell''===\nDuring the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' miniseries, the Creeper was presented as a demon that co-inhabited the body of Jack Ryder rather than an identity he assumed due to scientific experimentation. The story shows the Creeper demon separating from Jack Ryder, having been recalled to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] by [[Lilith]], the mother of all Earthborn atrocities. It is later revealed that the Creeper demon is just one of a similar-looking species of demon. The ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries had many internal continuity errors that made its place in DC Comics canon questionable and the idea that the Creeper was a demonic entity was not repeated afterward.\n\n===Outsiders===\nThe Creeper has joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>''The Outsiders'' #15 (April 2009)</ref> Later, the Creeper is one of the many heroes recruited to keep the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] from exploiting his resemblance to Bruce Wayne.

It revealed that Katana's sword was used to kill the Creeper. In the following issue, the Creeper is seen bonding to Jack Ryder's dead body. The Creeper notes that he had used Ryder's body previously, calling him \"old friend\". He later confronts Katana and then retreats.<ref>''Katana'' #4 (July 2013)</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the rebooted continuity of the 2017 initiative [[DC Rebirth]], Jack Ryder appears to be back to his original pre-New 52 version from before. While investigating a series of murdered criminals down in Chicago, Ryder ends up transforming into the Creeper again and battling against a [[Deathstroke]] copycat; while running into the real Deathstroke at the same time. In ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' he is a member recruited by Bizarro.\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Creeper is shown to have been captured by [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra]]'s cult until he is \"saved\" by [[Black Adam]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics.</ref> He and Black Adam later attack Israel.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #7 (September 2018).

A man in squalor disposes of a dead body, but is met with a surprise.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Original===\nThe Creeper's powers are physical in nature and a result of [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz's]] inventions. He displays virtually superhuman agility and stamina, combined with strength. This enables him to perform amazing feats of acrobatics and leaping. He also seems to be able to climb sheer walls with little or no difficulty. His strength is enough to enable him to throw grown men several feet or jump several feet in the air. His speed and reflexes have also been enhanced greatly. These combined abilities make the Creeper a formidable fighter, incorporating brawling techniques with his physical prowess. A signature move of his is jumping onto the backs of his opponents and throwing them off balance. The Creeper also possesses a superhuman healing factor, which enables him to heal from virtually any wound; gunshots and stab wounds healing within a matter of minutes. It even allowed him to return from death when his body regenerated after being torn apart by Eclipsed hyenas. Also, his laugh is depicted as being physically painful to the ears of his victims, causing a psychotic comatose state.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Current===\nAccording to the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, the Creeper form of Jack Ryder is actually a member of a unique demonic species who all share similar physical characteristics. This idea was dismissed by other writers and in the retcon origin by Steve Niles, the Creeper was the result of Yatz's experiments and had the same powers as his original incarnation, along with a laugh that seemed to disorient opponents.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Beware the Creeper''===\nThe 2003 series ''[[Beware the Creeper]]'', which is set in 1920s [[Paris]], features a female Creeper.\n\n===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===\nThe Creeper makes a cameo appearance in the 2001\u20132002 miniseries ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', wherein he has already been struck fatally.

DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===DC One Million===\nIn the year 85,271 depicted in the 1998 \"[[DC One Million]]\" storyline, on the planet IAI, an entity known as RYDR senses a disturbance that may unravel all that is and transforms into its other, the sum total of collective unreason, shamanic avatar and raw distillate of madness known as The Creeper. The trail leads to present day Jack Ryder, who was tired of being a superhero. Jack and The Creeper became separate parts of each other, actual living beings. After The Creeper side kept splitting into bizarre and dangerous alternate Creepers each representing a different part of The Creeper's personality, Jack realized that whether he liked it or not, the Creeper was a part of him. The future Creeper ingested all the alternate Creepers, but realizing the truth of the event, he returned them to the original Creeper and told him and Jack Ryder to remerge, and The Creeper was reborn. The future Creeper returns to IAI with the last remaining alternate Creeper, the one representing self-loathing, which he disposes of before transforming back into RYDR to catalogue the event.<ref>''The Creeper'' Volume 1 #1,000,000</ref>\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn the [[Tangent Comics]] universe, the Earth-9 version of the Creeper is a powerful warlock and member of occult organization known as the Black Circle.

In the episode \"Beware the Creeper\", he [[news anchor|anchors]] a live TV special on [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s career from Ace Chemicals, where the Joker douses Ryder with his laughing gas and then pushes Ryder into a vat of chemicals. The gas and the chemicals transform him into the Creeper. The Creeper then goes on a crusade against the Joker to avenge himself (he's the first person that the Joker ever describes as a '[[lunatic]]'), while frequently being sidetracked by an infatuation with [[Harley Quinn]] and his own stream-of-consciousness rambling. Batman manages to use a skin patch to suppress the Creeper, and informs Ryder he can still salvage his career. After Batman and Robin leave, Ryder thinks the situation over and removes the patch. Ryder begins chuckling, which soon becomes the Creeper's signature laughter.\n** The Creeper made frequent non-speaking appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as one of the sixty members of the extended [[Justice League]] international.\n* The Creeper appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Brian Bloom]].

He also appeared in television shows like ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', as well as the ''[[Batman Arkham]]'' video game series.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Showcase73.jpg|left|thumb|200px|alt=The Creeper leaping|''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #73 (April 1968), the Creeper's first appearance, with art and script by [[Steve Ditko]] & dialogue by [[Don Segall]].]] \nThe character [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #73 (April 1968).<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = The Creeper | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 89 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 129 |quote = Writer/artist Steve Ditko and co-scripter Don Segall gave [character Jack Ryder] more than the last laugh as the garishly garbed Creeper, one of DC's quirkiest protagonists.}}</ref> Following his debut in ''Showcase'', the Creeper was given his own series ''[[Beware the Creeper]]'', written by [[Dennis O'Neil]]; Steve Ditko plotted the first issue.

(Similarly, the 1990s series casts doubt on both The Creeper and Proteus\u2019 origins.) Shortly after his last solo issue, the Creeper teamed with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #80 (November 1968), then guested in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #70 (March 1969), where it was asked whether the Creeper was an outlaw. He also appeared with Batman in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #418 (December 1971). After the origin was reprinted in ''Detective Comics'' #443 (November 1974), one of the \"[[DC 100 Page Super Spectacular]]\" series, the Creeper's alter ego Jack Ryder was shown working as a news anchor on Gotham City television in issue #445 (March 1975), and in ''Detective Comics'' #447\u2013448 (May\u2013June 1975) he became the Creeper again to help Batman escape a frame-up for murder.\n\nDC kept the character active with sporadic solo runs and guest shots over the next few years. He turned up almost immediately in issue #3 (October 1975) of the [[Joker (character)|Joker's]] short-lived, [[Joker (comic book)|self-titled series]], in a story written by O'Neil, where the similarity in green hair and maniacal laughter caused confusion between the two. This was followed with a one-off solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #7 (October 1975), [[penciler|penciled]] by Ditko.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Jack|title=''1st Issue Special'': It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant to Be)|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=44|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Other appearances in this period included team-ups with [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] in ''[[Super-Team Family]]'' #2 (January 1976), again written by O'Neil; with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #143 (October 1978) and #178 (September 1981); and with many fellow alumni (and a few non-graduates) of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in that comic's 100th issue (May 1978). A story intended for the never-published ''Showcase'' #106 in 1978 (written and drawn by Ditko and which would be included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #2) was included in ''The Creeper by Steve Ditko'' hardcover collection published by DC in 2010.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Ditko|first1= Steve|authorlink1= Steve Ditko |title= The Creeper by Steve Ditko |year= 2010 |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |isbn= 1-4012-2591-8}}</ref> Among further solos were backup series in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #445\u2013447 (1976), ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #249\u201355 (1978\u20131979, written and fully drawn by Ditko), and ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #318\u2013323 (1983).\n\nBeginning in a team-up with [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #88 (December 1985), written by [[Steve Englehart]]) during the\n''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' company-wide story arc, the Creeper's depiction changed under different writers, which included a revised origin that was referenced but never wholly revealed. His deranged behavior, initially an act to frighten criminals, transformed into genuine, narcotics-induced psychotic behavior. In addition, Ryder could access his enhanced physical abilities only in his costumed form, and could no longer control his transformations. The new version came into focus when the Creeper teamed with the [[Justice League International]] in 1987. A decade later, DC gave the Creeper another chance in a solo comic, ''The Creeper''. It lasted 12 issues (December 1997&nbsp;\u2013 November 1998), including the 1998 [[DC One Million]] special numbering.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/5733/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 1997 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> Writer [[Len Kaminski]] focused on the breakdown of Ryder's sanity under the influence of the Creeper and made many references to previous continuity: the character is initially in an asylum and is formally diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]];<ref>''The Creeper'' (Volume 1) #3, p.&nbsp;3</ref> his two personas frequently battle for control of their shared body.\n\nThe Creeper starred in a six-issue mini-series, ''The Creeper'' volume 2 (October 2006&nbsp;\u2013 March 2007), written by [[Steve Niles]] and drawn by [[Justiniano]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/19429/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 2006 series)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Jack Ryder''' is a former [[Gotham City]] television [[talk show]] [[talk show host|host]] who was fired due to his outspoken nature.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=98-99}}</ref> In ''[[Bruce Wayne: The Road Home#Outsiders|Bruce Wayne: The Road Home: Outsiders]]'', it is revealed that he once dated [[Vicki Vale]]. Finding employment in security headed by [[Bill Brane]], he attempts to rescue a scientist named [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz]] whom mobsters headed by gangster [[Angel Devlin]] have kidnapped in order to obtain his newest discoveries. The chief mobster hosts a masquerade party at his mansion. To gain entry, Ryder improvises a costume from yellow tights and facial make-up designed to look like skin, a green wig and trunks, and red gloves, boots, and furry cloak. Ryder locates Yatz inside, but the mobsters discover him and first shoot at him, but then finally stabs him, wounding Ryder. Yatz injects Ryder with a serum and implants a device in his wound. The serum confers the power to almost instantly heal any wound and grants Ryder enhanced strength and agility. The device, used with its activator, causes the costume to disappear, leaving Ryder naked (he can later change into his formal clothes on command). Yatz inadvertently leaves the activator out of the wound, but does not realize this until after the wound had healed. At this point, the mobsters find their victims again, this time killing Yatz. Ryder discovers that with the activator, he can regain the wild costume whenever he wishes. With it, a crazy laugh and his enhanced physical abilities, he has no trouble routing the crooks.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAs the Creeper, Ryder has a series of adventures dealing with supervillains, while hiding his secret identity from his friends and cohorts and dealing with weather girl personality [[Vera Sweet]] who also acts as his love interest.\n\nThe eventual revision of the Creeper's origin eliminated the serum and claims that the scientist surgically implanted two devices (some accounts claim a single device with two effects) that enhance Ryder's physical abilities and can recreate an object whose \"imprint\" is stored in its circuitry. The scientist performs this surgery to save Ryder's life after criminals he was investigating attacked and drugged him. Because the scientist is unaware of the drugs in Ryder's system he inadvertently recorded their \"imprint\" at the same time he recorded the \"imprint\" of the costume, thus the device that recreates Ryder's costume when he becomes the Creeper also recreates the drugs in his system, explaining the Creeper's odd personality. These drugs so overwhelm Ryder's system that their effect becomes cumulative and the Creeper gradually becomes more irrational. When the Creeper changes back to Jack Ryder, the drugs disappear and with them, the psychosis. Eventually, Ryder comes to believe that he and the Creeper are two entirely different people instead of two roles played by the same man; he also holds this belief in his Creeper persona, which becomes increasingly disdainful of \"Jack Ryder\". The Creeper once regained his rationality while bound by [[Wonder Woman]]'s magic lasso, but the implications of this have never been explored.\n\n===Fighting Eclipso===\nThe Creeper appeared in the ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within]]'' annuals in 1992, tricked into taking up one of [[Eclipso]]'s dark crystals, putting him under Eclipso's control. He is later freed by Bruce Gordon, a longtime adversary of Eclipso. In the self-titled ''Eclipso'' comic book series, the Creeper, Gordon and his wife Mona make an initial foray into the South American territory that Eclipso has conquered. This leads to an Eclipso-possessed peasant throwing the Creeper (and himself) off a cliff. The peasant is mentally abandoned and both are left to plunge to their deaths. The intervention of a stunt squad saves the lives of both men. Several other heroes join in the fight against Eclipso, including [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]], the original [[Commander Steel|Steel]], [[Amanda Waller]], and [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Wildcat]] II. They form a team called the [[Shadow Fighters]]. In issue #13 of ''Eclipso'', a portion of the Fighters, including the Creeper, make another trip into Eclipso's territory. Several hyenas, possessed by Eclipso, track down the Creeper and tear him to shreds. Most of the infiltration team is slain; only small parts of the Creeper are actually recovered. The remains, along with the other dead heroes, are stolen out from under Eclipso's control by surviving Shadow Fighters.\n\nDespite this death, a Creeper series was launched in 1997. There are indications in this comic that the Dr. Yatz origin as detailed in previous appearances is somehow false and that the Creeper's actual origins are in some way related to his longtime villain, Proteus. Before this was fully explored, however, the series ceased publication.\n\n===Rebooted origin===\nIn 2006, a new version of the Creeper appears in the ''Brave New World'' one shot, published following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In the one shot, Jack Ryder is now the host of a controversial TV show, ''You Are Wrong!'', promising $1,000,000 to the person who catches the Creeper.\nFollowing this, a six-issue Creeper miniseries revealed the new origin, seemingly taking place during Batman's early years.\n\nRyder is said to support Dr. Vincent Yatz, who has been combining [[stem cell]] therapy and medical [[nanotechnology]] to create a revolutionary \"nanocell\" therapy called \"smart-skin\", which would enhance the body's regeneration to the point of giving new skin to burn victims and those who have suffered severe scarring. Ryder visits Yatz's lab just as the scientist is being threatened by mobsters attempting to steal the latest test batch of his newly discovered technology. Unable to escape, Yatz injects the last sample of smart-skin, still somewhat unstable, into Ryder's body in an attempt to keep it safe from the mobsters. When the criminals shoot Ryder in his head, the smart-skin activates, resurrecting Ryder moments later as the Creeper, a yellow-skinned man with superhuman physicality, green hair, and a mane of red hair growing on his back (as opposed to wearing fake red fur, like previous incarnations). The Creeper is a separate personality from Ryder and dispatches the criminals. Ryder discovers he and the Creeper can trade places, after which each acts as a witness to the other's activities and can mentally communicate with their alter ego.\n\nInitially wanting nothing to do with the Creeper, Ryder lets him out when the yellow-skinned creature convinces him to seek revenge on their would-be killers. During their pursuit of the criminals, the Creeper and Ryder learn that Yatz has secretly intended the smart-skin to be a weapon. Side effects of its use on human subjects seem to be a loss of mental control, along with the test subjects all getting yellow skin and a mixture of red and green hair. Yatz credits these side effects on the mind and body as resulting from a nerve agent (provided by his silent partner) he had added to the nanocells. This partner is revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], who had hoped to combine his Joker venom (which causes temporary madness and usually death by laughter) and Yatz's technology to create an army of maniacal, superstrong, near-immortal soldiers. Batman and Ryder defeat the Joker, who later attacks Yatz in revenge. Batman discovers Ryder's double identity and creates a chemical agent that can cure him of the Creeper, but Ryder refuses and forms a truce with his alter ego, agreeing to let the Creeper out from time to time to fight criminals while hiding his identity from everyone including news rival and love interest [[Vera Sweet]].\n\n===''Countdown''===\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Secondary titles|Countdown to Mystery]]'' #2, Jack Ryder is approached by [[Eclipso]], who hopes to seduce him as she did [[Plastic Man]]. She succeeds, but the Creeper is later freed from the corruption by Bruce Gordon. In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #24 (2007), the Creeper is seen, along with other heroes, fighting members of the [[Sinestro Corps]] in the streets of [[New York City|New York]].\n\n===''Reign in Hell''===\nDuring the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' miniseries, the Creeper was presented as a demon that co-inhabited the body of Jack Ryder rather than an identity he assumed due to scientific experimentation. The story shows the Creeper demon separating from Jack Ryder, having been recalled to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] by [[Lilith]], the mother of all Earthborn atrocities. It is later revealed that the Creeper demon is just one of a similar-looking species of demon. The ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries had many internal continuity errors that made its place in DC Comics canon questionable and the idea that the Creeper was a demonic entity was not repeated afterward.\n\n===Outsiders===\nThe Creeper has joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>''The Outsiders'' #15 (April 2009)</ref> Later, the Creeper is one of the many heroes recruited to keep the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] from exploiting his resemblance to Bruce Wayne.

It revealed that Katana's sword was used to kill the Creeper. In the following issue, the Creeper is seen bonding to Jack Ryder's dead body. The Creeper notes that he had used Ryder's body previously, calling him \"old friend\". He later confronts Katana and then retreats.<ref>''Katana'' #4 (July 2013)</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the rebooted continuity of the 2017 initiative [[DC Rebirth]], Jack Ryder appears to be back to his original pre-New 52 version from before. While investigating a series of murdered criminals down in Chicago, Ryder ends up transforming into the Creeper again and battling against a [[Deathstroke]] copycat; while running into the real Deathstroke at the same time. In ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' he is a member recruited by Bizarro.\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Creeper is shown to have been captured by [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra]]'s cult until he is \"saved\" by [[Black Adam]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics.</ref> He and Black Adam later attack Israel.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #7 (September 2018).

A man in squalor disposes of a dead body, but is met with a surprise.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===Original===\nThe Creeper's powers are physical in nature and a result of [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz's]] inventions. He displays virtually superhuman agility and stamina, combined with strength. This enables him to perform amazing feats of acrobatics and leaping. He also seems to be able to climb sheer walls with little or no difficulty. His strength is enough to enable him to throw grown men several feet or jump several feet in the air. His speed and reflexes have also been enhanced greatly. These combined abilities make the Creeper a formidable fighter, incorporating brawling techniques with his physical prowess. A signature move of his is jumping onto the backs of his opponents and throwing them off balance. The Creeper also possesses a superhuman healing factor, which enables him to heal from virtually any wound; gunshots and stab wounds healing within a matter of minutes. It even allowed him to return from death when his body regenerated after being torn apart by Eclipsed hyenas. Also, his laugh is depicted as being physically painful to the ears of his victims, causing a psychotic comatose state.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Current===\nAccording to the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, the Creeper form of Jack Ryder is actually a member of a unique demonic species who all share similar physical characteristics. This idea was dismissed by other writers and in the retcon origin by Steve Niles, the Creeper was the result of Yatz's experiments and had the same powers as his original incarnation, along with a laugh that seemed to disorient opponents.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Beware the Creeper''===\nThe 2003 series ''[[Beware the Creeper]]'', which is set in 1920s [[Paris]], features a female Creeper.\n\n===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===\nThe Creeper makes a cameo appearance in the 2001\u20132002 miniseries ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', wherein he has already been struck fatally.

The trail leads to present day Jack Ryder, who was tired of being a superhero. Jack and The Creeper became separate parts of each other, actual living beings. After The Creeper side kept splitting into bizarre and dangerous alternate Creepers each representing a different part of The Creeper's personality, Jack realized that whether he liked it or not, the Creeper was a part of him. The future Creeper ingested all the alternate Creepers, but realizing the truth of the event, he returned them to the original Creeper and told him and Jack Ryder to remerge, and The Creeper was reborn. The future Creeper returns to IAI with the last remaining alternate Creeper, the one representing self-loathing, which he disposes of before transforming back into RYDR to catalogue the event.<ref>''The Creeper'' Volume 1 #1,000,000</ref>\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn the [[Tangent Comics]] universe, the Earth-9 version of the Creeper is a powerful warlock and member of occult organization known as the Black Circle.

In the episode \"Beware the Creeper\", he [[news anchor|anchors]] a live TV special on [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s career from Ace Chemicals, where the Joker douses Ryder with his laughing gas and then pushes Ryder into a vat of chemicals. The gas and the chemicals transform him into the Creeper. The Creeper then goes on a crusade against the Joker to avenge himself (he's the first person that the Joker ever describes as a '[[lunatic]]'), while frequently being sidetracked by an infatuation with [[Harley Quinn]] and his own stream-of-consciousness rambling. Batman manages to use a skin patch to suppress the Creeper, and informs Ryder he can still salvage his career. After Batman and Robin leave, Ryder thinks the situation over and removes the patch. Ryder begins chuckling, which soon becomes the Creeper\u2019s signature laughter.\n** The Creeper made frequent non-speaking appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as one of the sixty members of the extended [[Justice League]] international.\n* The Creeper appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Brian Bloom]]. In \"Shadow of the Bat\", [[Booster Gold]] states that he has to cancel an appearance on Jack Ryder's talk show due to an emergency meeting of the [[Justice League International]]. The Creeper teams up with Batman in the teaser for \"Time Out For Vengeance!!!\", in which he cheers on and eventually helps Batman fight [[Hellgrammite (comics)|Hellgrammite]]. While initially annoyed at Ryder's antics, Batman eventually admits that Creeper is indeed a valuable ally. After Hellgrammite was defeated, Creeper left when the police arrived.\n\n===Video games===\n====''Batman Arkham''====\nThe Creeper's alter ego Jack Ryder is featured as a supporting character in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' franchise where he is voiced by [[James Horan (actor)|James Horan]]:<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1282022/fullcredits#cast Full Cast & Crew of ''Batman: Arkham Asylum'' (2009 Video Game)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', he can be heard reporting about the Arkham breakout with a banner beneath the headline reads \"The Jack Ryder Show\". In the same game, he is also an unlockable bio when the player scans a radio broadcasting Ryder's show. Ryder's bio also makes mention of the fact that he is the vigilante \"Creeper\".\n* He later plays a bigger role in the sequel ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.gamesradar.com/f/must-watch-batman-arkham-city-video-has-12-minutes-of-gameplay-to-drool-over/a-2011070112275546007 |title= Must Watch: Batman: Arkham City Video Has 12 Minutes of Gameplay to Drool Over |publisher= GamesRadar.com}}</ref> After the game begins, one of the early missions features Bruce Wayne rescuing Ryder from some thugs in Arkham City, Ryder revealing that he wound up in Arkham City after he began to investigate Hugo Strange's actions and motivations in creating Arkham City. He reveals information about Strange to Batman after he is saved. He is also on [[Deadshot]]'s hit list and Batman must save him before he is killed. Additionally, an interview between [[Vicki Vale]] and Mayor Quincy Sharp can be heard that reveals vigilantes operating in Gotham, including the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] and the Creeper.\n* In the end credits of ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', he is featured as heard interviewing several well known figures of Gotham City about the events that transpired during Christmas Eve involving Batman, the 8 assassins that were hired to hunt him down, and other villains involved. This led to Quincy Sharp issuing a statement, blaming the problem on the incompetence of Blackgate Prison, as well as vowing to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the supervillains that now reside in Gotham.\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', a \"Gotham's Most Wanted Mission\" involves Batman rescuing Jack Ryder from [[Deacon Blackfire]]'s cult. After the revelation of Batman really being Bruce Wayne, Jack apologized about all the things he said to Batman about Bruce Wayne and all the things he said to Bruce Wayne about Batman. He also mentions how he \"wishes [he] had super powers\", a reference to his Creeper alter ego.\n\n====Other games====\n* Jack Ryder appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Leif Anders]]. His voice is in TV/Radio segments called \"You Are Wrong\" found throughout Gotham and Metropolis. When found, Ryder proceeds to tell the truth about certain characters and plots (such as outing Lex Luthor as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains) presumably using his alter-ego Creeper to gather this information.\n* Jack Ryder appears in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by [[Robert Clotworthy]].
