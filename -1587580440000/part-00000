It is based on [[Stephen King]] and [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]]'s [[In the Tall Grass|2012 novella of the same name]]. It stars [[Harrison Gilbertson]], [[Laysla De Oliveira]], Avery Whitted, Will Buie Jr., [[Rachel Wilson]], and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]].\n\nThe project was in initial development in early 2015 but failed to start. Then, in May 2018, the video streaming site [[Netflix]] announced that it had purchased the film rights with Natali as director, who also wrote the adapted screenplay. [[Principal photography]] was expected to begin on July 30, 2018, and last until Sept. 14, 2018, in [[Toronto, Ontario]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at [[Fantastic Fest]] on Sept. 20, 2019, and was later released on Oct. 4, 2019, by [[Netflix]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, atmosphere and faithfulness to the novel, but criticizing its inconsistent tone and dialogue.\n\n==Plot==\nSiblings Becky, 6 months pregnant, and Cal DeMuth travel to San Diego so Becky can live with her aunt. While stopped outside an old church, the pair hears a young boy named Tobin call for help from a nearby field of tall grass. They later hear his mother, Natalie, begging him not to call for anyone. Concerned, the pair enters but quickly gets separated and finds that their distance from one another changes unnaturally. Increasingly panicked, the pair decides to leave but is unable to locate the road. Night falls, and Cal stumbles across a bruised and dirty Tobin holding a dead crow. Tobin claims the grass won't move dead things and buries the bird in the path. Becky encounters Tobin's father, Ross, but they get separated in the grass. Tobin leads Cal to an ancient rock in the field and encourages him to touch it, but they are interrupted by Becky's scream as she is attacked by an unseen figure.\n\nMeanwhile, the father of Becky's child, Travis, arrives looking for her and Cal. He finds their car parked outside the church and investigates the field of grass, eventually stumbling across Tobin, who implies that they already know each other, leads him to Becky's rotting corpse. As Travis grieves, he loses sight of Tobin. The next morning, he takes a necklace out of the corpse's pocket. At the same time, a seemingly earlier version of Tobin arrives at the church with Natalie and Ross. Hearing Travis, who is now calling out to Tobin, their dog Freddy runs into the grass, and the family runs in after him, where Travis hears Tobin and looks for him. The family panics and scatters, with Ross stumbling across the rock and touching it as night falls. Morning comes and shows Becky and Cal re-entering the grass as they investigate Tobin's cries. Tobin states that Freddy was killed. Knowing that the grass does not move dead things, Travis instructs Becky and Cal to move toward Tobin, and all four find each other. Travis tells Becky and Cal that they had been missing for two months.\n\nThe group spots a building in the distance and walks to it. On the way, Becky receives a phone call from someone sounding very distressed, warning them not to keep making the same mistake. As they walk, the grass seemingly enters Becky's uterus, and she passes out, only to be revived by Ross, who then reunites with Tobin and says he'll show them out. Ross leads them to the rock where they are confronted by a startled Natalie who claims she saw Becky's corpse earlier. She then warns them not to touch the rock. Ross gets more agitated, Natalie warns he's dangerous, and the others decide they want to leave. Ross wounds Travis and kills Natalie before pursuing the others, claiming the rock showed him the truth and the way out, but that he doesn't want to leave.\n\nBecky, Cal, Travis, and Tobin reach the abandoned building, and while scouting, Travis and Cal discover that Freddy has managed to escape the field via a \"hole\" that leads to the road. A jealous Cal, who is implied to have incestuous feelings for Becky, lets go of Travis as he slips, causing him to fall off the roof. Tobin witnesses this flees into the field when Ross follows them to the roof. The two follow Tobin, but Becky refuses to leave Travis and goes back as Cal flees, Cal is strangled to death by Ross, and it is revealed they are in a [[time loop]], with Cal permanently being hunted by an insane Ross in the grass. Travis has survived the fall and goes searching for Becky. They can hear each other on opposite sides of the field, and Becky admits she was going to give up the baby for adoption.\n\nBecky is attacked by Ross but escapes after stabbing him in the eye, and a thunderstorm begins. Becky is confronted by Grass Creatures, who carry her to the rock, which has prophetic markings relating to Becky's pregnancy. Becky frantically makes a phone call, pleading for her past self to prevent Cal from hurting Travis. After seeing a horrific vision underneath the rock, she passes out. She awakens to find Cal caring for her and feeding her with what is revealed to be her baby. Becky slowly realizes that she was hallucinating \"Cal,\" who is revealed to be Ross. Moments later, Travis stumbles across Becky's unconscious body. Tobin finds him, and they are confronted by Ross, who mortally wounds Travis. As Ross tries to make Tobin touch the rock, Becky attacks Ross and scratches out his other eye with her necklace, before dying from her wounds. Travis kills Ross and then realizes the only way to understand the grass is to touch the rock. Travis touches the rock and sees a series of strange visions. He then grabs Tobin's hand and guides him through the grass to an exit, instructing him to stop Becky and Cal from entering the grass.\n\nTobin emerges in the church across the road just as Becky and Cal are about to enter the grass and convinces them to stay out by showing them Becky's necklace that Travis gave him, hence closing the loop. Becky decides to keep her baby as they drive back home. Travis listens to them leave and dies peacefully in the grass.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harrison Gilbertson]] as Travis McKean\n* Arpit Thapliyal as Grass\n* Davendu Das as Keechad\n* [[Laysla De Oliveira]] as Becky DeMuth\n* Avery Whitted as Cal DeMuth\n* Will Buie Jr. as Tobin Humboldt\n*[[Rachel Wilson]] as Natalie Humboldt\n*[[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Ross Humboldt\n*[[Tiffany Helm]] as Gas Station Attendant\n* William Frater as Grass Man\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDirector [[Vincenzo Natali]] wanted to do a film adaptation of ''[[In the Tall Grass]]'' as early as 2015 when he announced:\n\n{{bquote|Who would think that grass could be frightening?

He then grabs Tobin's hand and guides him through the grass to an exit, instructing him to stop Becky and Cal from entering the grass.\n\nTobin emerges in the church across the road just as Becky and Cal are about to enter the grass and convinces them to stay out by showing them Becky's necklace that Travis gave him, hence closing the loop. Becky decides to keep her baby as they drive back home. Travis listens to them leave and dies peacefully in the grass.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harrison Gilbertson]] as Travis McKean\n* Arpit Thapliyal as Grass\n* Davendu Das as Keechad\n* [[Laysla De Oliveira]] as Becky DeMuth\n* Avery Whitted as Cal DeMuth\n* Will Buie Jr. as Tobin Humboldt\n*[[Rachel Wilson]] as Natalie Humboldt\n*[[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Ross Humboldt\n*[[Tiffany Helm]] as Gas Station Attendant\n* William Frater as Grass Man\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDirector [[Vincenzo Natali]] wanted to do a film adaptation of ''[[In the Tall Grass]]'' as early as 2015 when he announced:\n\n{{bquote|Who would think that grass could be frightening?

The half-dozen largest candidates have at least one known moon, allowing determination of their masses. The interest of dwarf planets to [[planetary geology|planetary geologists]] is that, being differentiated and perhaps geologically active bodies, they are likely to display planetary geology, an expectation born out by the 2015 ''[[New Horizons]]'' mission to Pluto and ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'' mission to Ceres.\n\nThe term ''dwarf planet'' was coined by planetary scientist [[Alan Stern]] as part of a three-way categorization of planetary-mass objects in the Solar System: classical planets (the big eight), dwarf planets and [[satellite planet]]s. Dwarf planets were thus originally conceived of as a kind of planet, as the name suggests. However, in 2006 the term was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as a category of ''sub''-planetary objects, part of a [[IAU definition of planet|three-way recategorization]] of bodies orbiting the Sun<ref name=\"finalresolution\"/> precipitated by the discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], an [[trans-Neptunian object|object farther away from the Sun than Neptune]] that was more massive than Pluto but still much smaller than the classical planets, after discoveries of a number of other objects that rivaled Pluto in size had forced a reconsideration of what Pluto was.<ref name=\"Brown Schaller 2007\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1139415 |last1=Brown |first1=Michael E. |authorlink=Michael E.

Bodies smaller than a few kilometers are dominated by non-gravitational forces and tend to have an irregular shape and may be rubble piles. Larger objects, where gravitation is significant but not dominant, are \"potato\" shaped; the more massive the body is, the higher its internal pressure, the more solid it is and the more rounded its shape, until the pressure is sufficient to overcome its internal [[compressive strength]] and it achieves [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. At this point a body is as round as it is possible to be, given its rotation and tidal effects, and is an [[ellipsoid]] in shape. This is the defining limit of a dwarf planet.<ref>Lineweaver & Marc Norman, 2010, \"The Potato Radius: a Lower Minimum Size for Dwarf Planets\"</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 350\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Masses of the dwarf planets.png\n| caption1  = Comparative masses of the likeliest dwarf planets, per Grundy et al., plus [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] for comparison.

If the body does not rotate, it will be a sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] or even [[scalene ellipsoid|scalene]] it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a body that may be scalene due to rapid rotation is {{dp|Haumea}}, which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces cause its rotation to gradually slow until it is tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto\u2013Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Tidally locked bodies are also scalene, though sometimes only slightly so. Earth's [[Moon]] is also tidally locked, as are all rounded satellites of the gas giants.\n\nThe upper and lower size and mass limits of dwarf planets have not been specified by the IAU. There is no defined upper limit, and an object larger or more massive than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] that has not \"cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit\" would be classified as a dwarf planet.<ref>Indeed, Mike Brown has set out to find such an object.

The three objects under consideration during the debates leading up to the 2006 IAU acceptance of the category of dwarf planet \u2013 Ceres, Pluto and Eris \u2013 are universally accepted as dwarf planets, including by those astronomers who continue to classify dwarf planets as planets. In 2015, Ceres and Pluto were determined to have shapes consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium (and thus with being dwarf planets) by the ''Dawn'' and ''New Horizons'' missions, respectively. Eris is assumed to be a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto.\n\nIn order of discovery, these three bodies are:\n\n# {{dp|Ceres}} [[File:Ceres symbol.svg|15px]] \u2013 discovered January 1, 1801 and announced January 24, 45&nbsp;years before [[Neptune]].

Bodies smaller than a few kilometers are dominated by non-gravitational forces and tend to have an irregular shape and may be rubble piles. Larger objects, where gravitation is significant but not dominant, are \"potato\" shaped; the more massive the body is, the higher its internal pressure, the more solid it is and the more rounded its shape, until the pressure is sufficient to overcome its internal [[compressive strength]] and it achieves [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. At this point a body is as round as it is possible to be, given its rotation and tidal effects, and is an [[ellipsoid]] in shape. This is the defining limit of a dwarf planet.<ref>Lineweaver & Marc Norman, 2010, \"The Potato Radius: a Lower Minimum Size for Dwarf Planets\"</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 350\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Masses of the dwarf planets.png\n| caption1  = Comparative masses of the likeliest dwarf planets, per Grundy et al., plus [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] for comparison.

If the body does not rotate, it will be a sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] or even [[scalene ellipsoid|scalene]] it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a body that may be scalene due to rapid rotation is {{dp|Haumea}}, which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces cause its rotation to gradually slow until it is tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto\u2013Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Tidally locked bodies are also scalene, though sometimes only slightly so. Earth's [[Moon]] is also tidally locked, as are all rounded satellites of the gas giants.\n\nThe upper and lower size and mass limits of dwarf planets have not been specified by the IAU. There is no defined upper limit, and an object larger or more massive than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] that has not \"cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit\" would be classified as a dwarf planet.<ref>Indeed, Mike Brown has set out to find such an object.

It is at the heart of [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] culture and heritage in Louisiana.\n\n==History==\n\n===French and Spanish Territory===\nThe land that became St. Landry Parish was inhabited since at least 10,500 B.C., as deduced from excavations of three prehistoric dwelling sites. By the 15th century, the [[Appalousa|Opelousa]] Indians settled in the area situated between [[Atchafalaya River]] and [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]] (at the border of Texas-Louisiana). The Opelousa were war-like and preyed on neighbors to defend their own territory.\n\nThe first European recorded in the Opelousa territory was a French trader named Michel de Birotte. He came in 1690 and negotiated with the Opelousa nation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Citation needed|last=Lastowka, Conor.|date=2011|publisher=[publisher not identified]|isbn=9781466346987|location=|pages=|oclc=767587112}}</ref> Nine years later, France named  [[Louisiana]] as a colony and defined the land occupied by the Opelousa as the Opelousas Territory. The area south of the Opelousas Territory between the Atchafalaya River, the Gulf of Mexico and [[Bayou Nezpique]], occupied by the Attakapas Indians (Eastern [[Atakapa]]), was named Attakapas Territory.\n\nIn 1764 [[France]] established the Opelousas [[Trading post|Post]] slightly north of the contemporary city of Opelousas.<ref name=\"genwebhistory\"/> It was a major trading organization for the developing area.  In addition France established the Attakapas Post (near the present [[St Martinville]]) in the Attakapas Territory.  France gave land grants to soldiers and settlers to encourage development. Most settlers were French immigrants. Tradition says that Jean Joseph LeKintrek and Joseph Blainpain, who had formed a partnership to trade with the Opelousa Indians, came in the early 1740s. They brought three enslaved Africans, the first to live in the area.\n\nSome Indians sold land to the newcomers. When the Eastern Attakapas Chief [[Kinemo]] sold all the land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] to Frenchman [[Gabriel Fuselier de la Claire]] in 1760, however, the angry [[Appalousa|Opelousa]] tribe exterminated the Attakapas (Eastern Atakapa).\n\nFrance ceded Louisiana and its territories to [[Spain]] in 1762. Under Spanish rule, Opelousas Post became the center of government for Southwest [[Louisiana]]. By 1769 about 100 families were living in Opelousas Post. Between 1780 and 1820, the first settlers were joined by others coming from the Attakapas Territory, from the [[Pointe Coup\u00e9e]] Territory, and east from the Atchafalaya River area.  They were joined by immigrants from the [[French West Indies]], who left after Haiti/St. Domingue became independent in a slave revolution. Most of the new settlers were French, Spaniards, [[French Creoles]], [[Spanish Creoles]], [[Africans]] and [[African Americans|African-Americans]].\n\nThe group from Attakapas Post included many [[Acadians]]. These were French who migrated from [[Nova Scotia]] in 1763, after their expulsion by the English in the aftermath of France's defeat in the Seven Years' War (known in North America as the French and Indian War). They were led by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]]. D'Abbadie was Governor of the territory from 1763 to 1765. The French community built [[St. Landry Catholic Church]] in 1767, dedicated to [[Landry of Paris|St. Landry (Landericus) of Paris]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Bishop of Paris]] in the 7th century.<ref>[http://www.lsue.edu/acadgate/opelous.htm Central Acadiana Gateway: Opelousas and St. Landry Parish, Louisiana State University-Eunice Office of Public Relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401160243/http://www.lsue.edu/acadgate/opelous.htm |date=2007-04-01 }}, accessed 27 April 2008</ref>\n\nOn April 10, 1805, after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the post was named the town of Opelousas and became the seat of the County of Opelousas, part of the [[Territory of Orleans]].

It is at the heart of [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] culture and heritage in Louisiana.\n\n==History==\n\n===French and Spanish Territory===\nThe land that became St. Landry Parish was inhabited since at least 10,500 B.C., as deduced from excavations of three prehistoric dwelling sites. By the 15th century, the [[Appalousa|Opelousa]] Indians settled in the area situated between [[Atchafalaya River]] and [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]] (at the border of Texas-Louisiana). The Opelousa were war-like and preyed on neighbors to defend their own territory.\n\nThe first European recorded in the Opelousa territory was a French trader named Michel de Birotte. He came in 1690 and negotiated with the Opelousa nation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Citation needed|last=Lastowka, Conor.|date=2011|publisher=[publisher not identified]|isbn=9781466346987|location=|pages=|oclc=767587112}}</ref> Nine years later, France named  [[Louisiana]] as a colony and defined the land occupied by the Opelousa as the Opelousas Territory. The area south of the Opelousas Territory between the Atchafalaya River, the Gulf of Mexico and [[Bayou Nezpique]], occupied by the Attakapas Indians (Eastern [[Atakapa]]), was named Attakapas Territory.\n\nIn 1764 [[France]] established the Opelousas [[Trading post|Post]] slightly north of the contemporary city of Opelousas.<ref name=\"genwebhistory\"/> It was a major trading organization for the developing area.  In addition France established the Attakapas Post (near the present [[St Martinville]]) in the Attakapas Territory.  France gave land grants to soldiers and settlers to encourage development. Most settlers were French immigrants. Tradition says that Jean Joseph LeKintrek and Joseph Blainpain, who had formed a partnership to trade with the Opelousa Indians, came in the early 1740s. They brought three enslaved Africans, the first to live in the area.\n\nSome Indians sold land to the newcomers. When the Eastern Attakapas Chief [[Kinemo]] sold all the land between [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion River]] and [[Bayou Teche]] to Frenchman [[Gabriel Fuselier de la Claire]] in 1760, however, the angry [[Appalousa|Opelousa]] tribe exterminated the Attakapas (Eastern Atakapa).\n\nFrance ceded Louisiana and its territories to [[Spain]] in 1762. Under Spanish rule, Opelousas Post became the center of government for Southwest [[Louisiana]]. By 1769 about 100 families were living in Opelousas Post. Between 1780 and 1820, the first settlers were joined by others coming from the Attakapas Territory, from the [[Pointe Coup\u00e9e]] Territory, and east from the Atchafalaya River area.  They were joined by immigrants from the [[French West Indies]], who left after Haiti/St. Domingue became independent in a slave revolution. Most of the new settlers were French, Spaniards, [[French Creoles]], [[Spanish Creoles]], [[Africans]] and [[African Americans|African-Americans]].\n\nThe group from Attakapas Post included many [[Acadians]]. These were French who migrated from [[Nova Scotia]] in 1763, after their expulsion by the English in the aftermath of France's defeat in the Seven Years' War (known in North America as the French and Indian War). They were led by [[Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie]]. D'Abbadie was Governor of the territory from 1763 to 1765. The French community built [[St. Landry Catholic Church]] in 1767, dedicated to [[Landry of Paris|St. Landry (Landericus) of Paris]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Bishop of Paris]] in the 7th century.<ref>[http://www.lsue.edu/acadgate/opelous.htm Central Acadiana Gateway: Opelousas and St. Landry Parish, Louisiana State University-Eunice Office of Public Relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401160243/http://www.lsue.edu/acadgate/opelous.htm |date=2007-04-01 }}, accessed 27 April 2008</ref>\n\nOn April 10, 1805, after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the post was named the town of Opelousas and became the seat of the County of Opelousas, part of the [[Territory of Orleans]].

In 1586 he was Keeper of [[Blackness Castle]], and on 22 November 1587 was appointed Keeper of [[Linlithgow]] Castle. On 24 December 1587 he was appointed (with Patrick Bellenden of Evie) Clerk of the Coquet of Edinburgh.\n\nHe was not averse to the conspiracies of the period and was one of the conspirators involved in the notorious [[Raid of Ruthven]], and [[David Hume of Godscroft|Godscroft]] represents him as extremely violent on the occasion. Sir Lewis does not seem, however, to have shared in the ruin which attended his co-conspirators, joining the College of Justice in 1584.\n\nHe bore a principal part in the downfall of the [[Duke of Hamilton#Lords Hamilton and Earls of Arran|Earl of Arran]], and the return of the banished Lords, although he was despatched by the former, then ignorant of his intentions, to accuse the latter at the court of Queen [[Elizabeth I]] of England. He was in [[Stirling]] in November 1585 when the banished Lords surprised [[James VI]] and Arran there. The latter intended to have slain Bellenden, the [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Master of Gray]], and the Secretary, \"but they drew to their armes and stude on their awn defence,\" and Arran had too much on his hands with his enemies without the walls to attack them.\n\nSir Lewis Bellenden seems to have been useful in procuring the consent of the clergy to the Act whereby the temporalities of the prelacies were annexed to the Crown in 1587, and was the same year named one of the Commissioners \"for satisfying the clergy of the lyferents.\"\n\nIn 1589 he accompanied King [[James VI]] in his matrimonial excursion to [[Norway]]. James VI wrote from [[Oslo]] on 1 December 1589 to [[John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Hamilton|John, Lord Hamilton]] asking him to conclude a law suit with Bellenden, who the king described as \"a man here that I am so much beholden to at this time\".<ref>''HMC 11th Report Part VI: Duke of Hamilton'' (London, 1887), p. 66.</ref>\n\nHe was sent the following spring as Ambassador to the court of Elizabeth, probably to notify the nuptials.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 252, 277.</ref>\n\nLewis Bellenden died on 27 August 1591 after eight days of deadly fever, and was buried at [[Holyrood Abbey]] on 8 September.<ref>[[Robert Vans Agnew]], ''Correspondence of Sir Patrick Waus of Barnbarroch'', vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1887), p. 476.</ref>\n\nThe English ambassador in Edinburgh, [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]], wrote that his office of Justice Clerk would probably be given to the young laird of [[Whittingehame Tower|Whittingehame]], his place in the Court of Session to Richard Cockburn, and the role of Master of Ceremonies at court to [[William Schaw]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 567.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nSir Lewis Bellenden married, by contract dated 4 July 1581, [[Margaret Livingstone, Countess of Orkney|Margaret Livingstone]] daughter of [[William Livingstone, 6th Lord Livingston]] and Agnes Fleming.
