The season started on August 15, 1993, and its final round (40th) was played on July 3, 1994. In the last round [[MFK Mykolaiv|Evis Mykolaiv]] (Shipbuilders) snatched the ticket to the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] from under the nose of [[PFC Olexandria|Polihraftekhnika Oleksandriya]] (a point ahead of the Shipbuilders) by beating [[FC Naftovyk Okhtyrka|Naftovyk Okhtyrka]] 2:1 after allowing the first goal.\n\nIt is also worth of noting that the newly promoted club from [[Cherkasy]] was leading the league during the winter break and along with the [[Oleksandria]] club was the main contender for promotion. The second half of the season for Dnipro was terrible and they placed in the mid-table after the final round.\n\n==Promotion and relegation==\n\n===Promoted teams===\nTwo clubs promoted from the

The dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies to the east of the village of [[Wormhill]]. The head of the valley leads into Peter Dale to the north. [[Millers Dale|Miller's Dale]] is at the foot of the valley to the sorth.<ref name=\"OS\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThe dale is named after monks of [[Lenton Priory]] (a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] monastery in [[Nottingham]]). During the 12th-century the priory was granted the income from a large area of north Derbyshire by [[William Peverel]]. 14th-century carved stones (of the low septum, or stone screen, dividing the chancel from the nave) are all that remains of the monks' [[Monastic grange|grange]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Douglas|first=Ed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/country-diary-awkward-land-monks-dale-derbyshire|title=Country diary: felled by a faery sheep?|date=2018-10-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Godfrey|first=John Thomas|title=The history of the parish and priory of Lenton|publisher=Oxford University|year=1884|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]] which runs into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]] at Miller's Dale.\n\nMonk's Dale is part of the [[Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve]]. [[Natural England]] manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the [[White Peak]] ([[Lathkill Dale]], [[Cressbrook Dale]], Hay Dale, Long Dale and Monk\u2019s Dale). The reserve contains [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[elm]] woodland and shrubs including [[Paris quadrifolia|herb Paris]], [[bird cherry]] and [[Cornus|dogwood]]. Uncommon flowers in the shady dale include [[Epipactis atrorubens|dark red helleborine]].

Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who also works at Amaya (in encryption), worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator.

Lily and Jamie argue the morning after she stays the night at Jamie's apartment over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where the homeless man who lives there treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. The psychiatrist reports back to Kenton that Lily is most likely faking her schizophrenia, but as they drive away, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, and arrest Lily for causing the crash and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting at work and admitting their love for each other for the first time, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stuart's [[Winnebago]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project.

They find him there with along with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms for Lily that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system - a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them.

Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who also works at Amaya (in encryption), worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

Katie admonishes the Devs team for using the projection system for their own amusement. Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, who suggest she tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes to her rescue, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive \u2014 Lily, with Jen's help, had pretended to have the breakdown episode to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death.

Lily and Jamie argue the morning after she stays the night at Jamie's apartment over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where the homeless man who lives there treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. The psychiatrist reports back to Kenton that Lily is most likely faking her schizophrenia, but as they drive away, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, and arrest Lily for causing the crash and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting at work and admitting their love for each other for the first time, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stuart's [[Winnebago]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project.

They find him there with along with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms for Lily that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system - a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watched them since they arrived, follows them.

His place of birth is unknown.\n\nJudah spent his youth in the city of [[Usha (city)|Usha]]. His father presumably gave him the same education that he himself had received, including the [[Greek language]].<ref>[[Nashim|Sotah]] 49b</ref> This knowledge of Greek enabled him to become the Jews' intermediary with the Roman authorities. He favored Greek as the language of the country over [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]].<ref>Sotah 49b</ref> In Judah's house, only the [[Hebrew language]] was spoken, and the maids of the house became known for their use of obscure Hebrew terminology.<ref>Megillah 18a; Rosh Hashana 26b; Nazir 3a; Eruvin 53a</ref>\n\nJudah devoted himself chiefly to the study of the traditional and of the written law. In his youth he had close relations with most of the great students of Akiba; and as their student and in converse with other prominent men who gathered about his father at Usha and later at Shefar'am, he laid the foundations of that wide scholarship which enabled him to undertake his life-work, the redaction of the Mishnah.\n\n===His teachers===\nHis teacher at Usha was R' [[Judah bar Ilai]], who was officially employed in the house of the patriarch as judge in religious and legal questions.<ref>Menachot 104a; Shevuot 13a</ref> In later years, Judah described how in his childhood he read the [[Book of Esther]] at Usha in the presence of Judah bar Ilai.<ref>Megillah 20a; Tosefta Megillah 2:8</ref>\n\nJudah felt especial reverence for R' [[Jose ben Halafta]], the student of Akiva's who had the closest relations with Simon ben Gamaliel. When, in later years, Judah raised objections to Jose's opinions, he would say: \"We poor ones undertake to attack Jose, though our time compares with his as the profane with the holy!\"<ref>Yerushalmi Gittin 48b</ref> Judah hands down a halakhah by Jose in Menachot 14a.\n\nJudah studied from R' [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in \"Tekoa\",<ref>\"when we studied the Torah with Shimon bar Yochai at Tekoa'\"; Tosefta Eruvin 8:6; Shabbat 147b; compare Yerushalmi Shabbat 12c</ref> a place some have identified with [[Meron, Israel|Meron]].<ref>See Bacher, l.c. ii. 76</ref> He also studied with [[Eleazar ben Shammua]].<ref>Eruvin 53a; Yevamot 84a; compare Menachot 18a</ref> Judah did not study with [[Rabbi Meir]], evidently in consequence of the conflicts which distanced Meir from the house of the patriarch. However, he considered himself lucky even to have seen Meir from behind.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eruvin.13b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Eruvin 13b]; Yerushalmi Beitzah 63a, where an anachronistic anecdote is connected with this saying of Judah's</ref>\n\nAnother of Judah's teachers was [[Nathan the Babylonian]], who also took a part in the conflict between Meir and the patriarch; Judah confessed that once, in a fit of youthful ardor, he had failed to treat Nathan with due reverence.<ref>Bava Batra 131a; in different version Yerushalmi Ketuvot 29a; Bava Batra 16a</ref> In both halakhic and aggadic tradition, Judah's opinion is often opposed to Nathan's.\n\nIn the Palestinian tradition, Judah ben Korshai (the halakhic specialist mentioned as assistant to Simon ben Gamaliel<ref>Horayot 13b</ref>) is designated as Judah's real teacher.<ref>Yerushalmi Shabbat 12c; Yerushalmi Pesachim 37b</ref> Jacob ben Hanina (possibly the R. Jacob whose patronymic is not given and in whose name Judah quotes halakhic sentences<ref>Gittin 14b; compare Tosefta Avodah Zarah 5:4</ref>) is also mentioned as one of Judah's teachers, and is said to have asked him to repeat halakhic sentences.<ref>[[Sifre]] Deuteronomy 306</ref>\n\nJudah was also taught by his father (Simon ben Gamaliel);<ref>Bava Metziah 85b</ref> when the two differed on a halakhic matter, the father was generally stricter.<ref>See Frankel, l.c. p. 184</ref> Judah himself says: \"My opinion seems to me more correct than that of my father\"; and he then proceeds to give his reasons.<ref>Eruvin 32a</ref> Humility was a virtue ascribed to Judah, and he admired it greatly in his father, who openly recognized Shimon bar Yochai's superiority, thus displaying the same modesty as the [[Bnei Bathyra]] when they gave way to [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], and as [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]] when he voluntarily gave precedence to his friend [[David]].<ref>Bava Metziah 84b, 85a</ref>\n\n===Leadership===\nNothing is known regarding the time when Judah succeeded his father as leader of the Palestinian Jews. According to [[Rashi]], Judah's father, Rabbi [[Simeon ben Gamaliel II|Simon ben Gamliel]], had served as the ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]'' of the [[Sanhedrin]] in [[Usha (city)|Usha]], before it transferred to [[Shefar'am]].<ref name= \"BT-RoshHash\">[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''[[Rosh Hashana (Talmud)|Rosh Hashana]]'' 31b, [[Rashi]] s.v. \u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05d1\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0</ref> According to a tradition,<ref>Mishnah So\u1e6dah, end</ref> the country at the time of Simon ben Gamaliel's death not only was devastated by a plague of locusts, but suffered many other hardships. From Shefar'am, the Sanhedrin transferred to [[Beit Shearim]], where the Sanhedrin was headed by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi.<ref name= \"BT-RoshHash\" /> Here he officiated for a long time. Eventually, Judah moved with the court from Beit Shearim to [[Sepphoris]], where he spent at least 17 years of his life. He had chosen Sepphoris chiefly because of his ill-health, and being induced to go there because of the place's high altitude and pure air.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Kilaim'' 32b; [[Genesis Rabbah]] 96; Ketubot 103b</ref> However, Judah's memorial as a leader is principally associated with Bet She'arim: \"To Bet She'arim must one go in order to obtain Rabbi's decision in legal matters.\"<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Sanhedrin'' 32b</ref>\n\nAmong Judah's contemporaries in the early years of his activity were [[Eleazar ben Simeon]], [[Ishmael ben Jose]], [[Jose ben Judah]], and [[Simeon ben Eleazar]]. His better-known contemporaries and students include Simon b. Manasseh, [[Phinehas ben Jair]], [[Eleazar ha-Kappar]] and his son [[Bar Kappara]], [[Hiyya the Great]], [[Shimon ben Halafta]], and [[Levi ben Sisi]]. Among his students who taught as the first generation of Amoraim after his death are: [[Hanina bar Hama]] and [[Hoshaiah Rabbah|Hoshaiah]] in Palestine, [[Abba Aricha|Rav]] and [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]] in Babylon.\n\nOnly scattered records of Judah's official activity exist. These include: the ordination of his students;<ref>Sanhedrin 5a,b</ref> the recommendation of students for communal offices;<ref>Yevamot 105a; Yerushalmi Yevamot 13a</ref> orders relating to the announcement of the new moon;<ref>Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 58a, above</ref> amelioration of the law relating to the Sabbatical year;<ref>Shevuot 6:4; Yerushalmi Shevuot 37a; compare Hullin 7a,b</ref> and to decrees relating to tithes in the frontier districts of Palestine.<ref>Yerushalmi Demai 22c</ref><ref name=\"hullin6\">Hullin 6b</ref> The last-named he was obliged to defend against the opposition of the members of the patriarchal family.<ref name=\"hullin6\"/> The ameliorations he intended for [[Tisha B'av]] were prevented by the college.<ref>Megillah 5b; Yerushalmi Megillah 70c</ref> Many religious and legal decisions are recorded as having been rendered by Judah together with his court, the college of scholars.<ref>Gittin 5:6; Ohalot 18:9; Tosefta Shabbat 4:16; see also Yevamot 79b, above; Kiddushin 71a</ref>\n\nAccording to the Talmud,<ref>Avodah Zarah 10a-b</ref> Rabbi Judah HaNasi was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with \"Antoninus\", possibly the [[Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]],<ref>A. Mischcon, Avodah Zara, p.10a Soncino, 1988. Mischcon cites various sources, \"SJ Rappaport... is of the opinion that our Antoninus is Antoninus Pius.\" Other opinions cited suggest \"Antoninus\" was [[Caracalla]], [[Lucius Verus]] or [[Alexander Severus]].</ref> though it is more likely his famous friendship was with either Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] Antoninus<ref name=\"Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146\">''''Codex Judaica'''' Kantor, second edition, NY 2006, page 146</ref><ref>[[Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport]], ''Erekh Millin'', Warsaw 1914, p. 219</ref> or Antoninus who is also called [[Caracalla]] and who would consult Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters.<ref>Modern scholarship has difficulty fitting these accounts into the historical framework of the period of the Antonines, especially since Rabbi Judah the Prince thrived mainly at the end of the second century CE. [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], in his treatise ''[[On Weights and Measures (Epiphanius)|On Weights and Measures]]'', mentions a fifth line of Caesar after Antoninus Pius, one named Antoninus who is also called [[Caracalla]], the son of [[Septimius Severus|Severus]], who was also contemporary with Rabbi Judah the Prince, and whom the historian [[Heinrich Graetz]] believes may refer to the Roman Emperor who befriended Rabbi Judah the Prince. Antoninus the son of Severus (Heb. '''\u05d0\u05e0\u05d8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1''') is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, ''Avodah Zarah'' 10b and in the ''Midrash Otiyoth'' of [[Rabbi Akiva]] (MS. version ''aleph'').</ref> Jewish sources tell of various discussions between Judah and Antoninus. These include the parable of the blind and the lame (illustrating the judgment of the body and the soul after death),<ref>Mekhilta Beshallah Shirah 2; Sanhedrin 91a,b; see a similar parable by him in [[Ecclesiastes Rabbah]] 5:10</ref> and a discussion of the impulse to sin.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 34; Sanhedrin 91b</ref>\n\nThe authority of Judah's office was enhanced by his wealth, which is referred to in various traditions. In Babylon, the hyperbolic statement was later made that even his stable-master was wealthier than [[Shapur (name)|King Shapur]].<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.85a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Bava Metziah 85a]</ref> His household was compared to that of the emperor.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.43a.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Berachot 43a], 57b</ref> [[Simeon ben Menasya]] praised Judah by saying that he and his sons united in themselves beauty, power, wealth, wisdom, age, honor, and the blessings of children.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Sanhedrin.11.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Tosefta Sanhedrin 11:4]; Baraita Ab. 6:8</ref> During a famine, Judah opened his granaries and distributed corn among the needy.<ref>Bava Batra 8a</ref> But he denied himself the pleasures procurable by wealth, saying: \"Whoever chooses the delights of this world will be deprived of the delights of the next world; whoever renounces the former will receive the latter\".<ref name=\"Avot of Rabbi Natan 28\">[[Avot of Rabbi Natan]] 28</ref>\n\n===Death===\nThe year of Judah's death is deduced from the statement that his student [[Abba Aricha|Rav]] left Palestine for good not long before Judah's death, in year 530 of the [[Seleucid era]] (219 CE).<ref>See \"R. E. J.\" 44:45-61</ref> He assumed the office of patriarch during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]] (c. 165). Hence Judah, having been born about 135, became patriarch at the age of 30, and died at the age of about 85. The [[Talmud]] notes that Rabbi Judah the Prince lived for at least 17 years in [[Sepphoris]], and that he applied unto himself the biblical verse, \"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years\" <small>(Genesis 47:28)</small>.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Kelaim'' 9:3, 32a-b.</ref>\n\nAccording to a different calculation, he died on 15 [[Kislev]], AM 3978 (around December 1, 217 CE),<ref>{{cite book |first=Judah |last=Goldin |chapter=The Period of the Talmud |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Finkelstein |title=The Jews: Their History |publisher=Schocken |location=New York |year=1970 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jewstheirhistory00fink/page/172 172] |isbn=0-8052-0271-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/jewstheirhistory00fink/page/172 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=L. |last=Margolis |first2=A. |last2=Marx |title=A History of the Jewish People |publisher=Atheneum |location=New York |year=1980 |isbn=0-689-70134-9 |page=225 |url= }}</ref> in Sepphoris, and his body was interred in the [[necropolis]] of [[Beit Shearim]], {{convert|15.2|km}} distant from Sepphoris,<ref>Cf.

He said to it: \"Go; for you were created for this purpose!\" Due to this unkind attitude toward the suffering animal, he was punished with years of illness. Later, when his daughter was about to kill a small animal which was in her way, he said to her: \"Let it live, for it is written: '[God's] tender mercies are over all his works'.\"<ref>Psalms 145:9</ref> After this demonstration of compassion, his illness ceased.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.85a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Bava Metzia 85a]; [[Genesis Rabbah]] 33</ref> Judah also once said, \"One who is ignorant of the Torah should not eat meat.\"<ref>Pesachim 49b</ref> The prayer he prescribed upon eating meat or eggs also indicates an appreciation of animal life: \"Blessed be the Lord who has created many souls, in order to support by them the soul of every living being.\"<ref>Yerushalmi Berachot 10b</ref>\n\nJudah was easily moved to tears. He exclaimed, sobbing, in reference to three different stories of martyrs whose deaths made them worthy of future life: \"One man earns his world in an hour, while another requires many years\".<ref>Avodah Zarah 10b, 17a, 18a; for a sentence by Judah on the ranking of the pious in the future world see Sifre, Deut. 47</ref> He began to weep when [[Elisha ben Abuyah]]'s daughters, who were soliciting alms, reminded him of their father's learning.<ref>Yerushalmi Hagigah 77c; compare Hagigah 15b</ref> In a legend relating to his meeting with [[Pinchas ben Yair]], he is described as tearfully admiring the pious Pinchas' unswerving steadfastness, protected by a higher power.<ref>Hullin 7b</ref> He was frequently interrupted by tears when explaining [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:2 and illustrating the passage by stories of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Temple.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 2:2; compare Yerushalmi Ta'anit 68d</ref> While explaining certain passages of Scripture,<ref>I Samuel 28:15; Amos 4:13, 5:15; Zephaniah 2:3; Lamentations 3:29; Ecclesiastes 12:14</ref> he was reminded of divine judgment and of the uncertainty of acquittal, and began to cry.<ref>Yerushalmi Hagigah 77a; Leviticus Rabbah 26; Midrash Shmuel 24</ref> [[Hiyya the Great|Hiyya]] found him weeping during his last illness because death was about to deprive him of the opportunity of studying the Torah and of fulfilling the commandments.<ref>Ketuvot 103b</ref>\n\nOnce, when at a meal his students expressed their preference for soft tongue, he made this an opportunity to say, \"May your tongues be soft in your mutual intercourse\" (i.e., \"Speak gently without disputing\").<ref>[[Leviticus Rabbah]] 33, beginning</ref>\n\nBefore he died, Judah said: \"I need my sons! ... Let the lamp continue to burn in its usual place; let the table be set in its usual place; let the bed be made in its usual place.\"<ref>Ketubot 103a</ref>\n\n====His prayers====\nWhile teaching Torah, Judah would often interrupt the lesson to recite the [[Shema Yisrael]]. He passed his hand over his eyes as he said it.<ref>Berachot 13b</ref>\n\nWhen 70-year-old wine cured him of a protracted illness, he prayed: \"Blessed be the Lord, who has given His world into the hands of guardians\".<ref>Avodah Zarah 40b</ref>\n\nHe privately recited daily the following supplication on finishing the obligatory prayers: \"May it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, to protect me against the impudent and against impudence, from bad men and bad companions, from severe sentences and severe plaintiffs, whether a son of the covenant or not.\"<ref>(Berachot 6b; compare Shabbat 30b</ref>\n\n=== Post-Talmudic narratives ===\nRabbi [[Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg]] relates that the spirit of Rebbi Judah used to visit his home, wearing [[Shabbat]] clothes, every Friday evening at dusk. He would recite [[Kiddush]], and others would thereby discharge their obligation to hear Kiddush. One Friday night there was a knock at the door. \"Sorry,\" said the maid, \"I can't let you in just now because Rabbeinu HaKadosh is in the middle of Kiddush.\" From then on Judah stopped coming, since he did not want his coming to become public knowledge.<ref>[[Sefer Hasidim]] \u00a71129 (Cf. [[Nashim|Ketubot]] 103a)</ref>\n\n==Teachings==\n\n=== Compilation of the Mishnah ===\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\n{{Main|Mishna}}\nAccording to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the [[Torah]]) and the [[Oral law]] to Moses on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages ([[rabbi]]nic leaders) of each subsequent generation.\n\nFor centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral traditions might be forgotten, Judah undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the ''Mishnah''. This completed a project which had been mostly clarified and organized by his father and [[Nathan the Babylonian]].<ref name=\"Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146\"/>\n\nThe Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the ''Talmud.'' According to [[Abraham ben David]], the ''Mishnah'' was compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince in [[anno mundi]] 3949, or the year 500 of the [[Seleucid era]], which corresponds to 189 CE.<ref>Abraham ben David, ''Seder Ha-Kabbalah Leharavad'', Jerusalem 1971, p.16 (Hebrew)</ref><ref>[[Heinrich Graetz]], ''History of the Jews'', vol. 6, Philadelphia 1898, p. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021930634;view=1up;seq=131 105]</ref>\n\nThe Mishnah contains many of Judah's own sentences, which are introduced by the words, \"Rabbi says.\"\n\nThe Mishna was Judah's work, though it includes a few sentences by his son and successor, [[Gamaliel III]],<ref>[[Pirkei Avot]] 2:2-4</ref> perhaps written after Judah's death. Both the Talmuds assume as a matter of course that Judah is the originator of the Mishnah\u2014\"our Mishnah,\" as it was called in Babylon\u2014and the author of the explanations and discussions relating to its sentences. However, Judah is more  correctly consider redactor of the Mishna, rather than its author. The Mishna is based on the systematic division of the halakhic material as formulated by [[Rabbi Akiva]]; Judah following in his work the arrangement of the halakot as taught by [[Rabbi Meir]] (Akiva's foremost student).<ref>Sanhedrin 86a</ref> Judah's work in the Mishnah appears both in what he included and in what he rejected. The volume of tannaitic statements not included in the Mishna (but recorded in the [[Tosefta]] and in the baraitot of both Talmuds) shows that Judah had no small task in selecting the material that he included in his work. Also, the formulating of halakic maxims on controverted points required both his unusual technical knowledge and his undisputed authority; and the fact that he did not invariably lay down the rule, but always admitted divergent opinions and traditions both of the pre-Hadrianic time and, more especially, of Akiba's eminent students, demonstrates his circumspection and his consciousness of the limits imposed upon his authority by tradition and by its recognized representatives.\n\n===Halacha===\nUsing the precedent of [[Rabbi Meir]]'s reported actions, Judah ruled the [[Beit Shean]] region to be exempt from the requirements of [[Tithes in Judaism|tithing]] and [[shmita]] regarding produce grown there.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chullin.6b.5-6?lang=bi Hullin 6b]; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] ''Demai'' 2:1. The region of Beit Shean was typically seen as not settled by Jews returning from the [[Babylonian captivity]], and therefore had not the same consecrated status as other areas of the country. As for Rabbi Judah HaNasi's enactment, the release from shmita obligations and the release from tithing all home-grown produce throughout the remaining six years of the seven-year cycle were one and the same (cf. Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hilchot Terumoth'' 1:5); Jerusalem Talmud ''Shevi'it'' 6:4; p. 51a in the ''Oz veHadar'' edition.</ref> He also did the same for the cities of Kefar Tzemach, [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] and [[Beit Jibrin|Beit Gubrin]].<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Demai 2:1</ref>\n\nHe forbade his students to study in the marketplace, basing his prohibition on his interpretation of [[Song of Songs]] 7:2, and censured one of his students who violated this restriction.<ref>Moed Kattan 16a, b</ref>\n\n===Biblical interpretation===\n\nHis exegesis includes many attempts to harmonize conflicting Biblical statements. Thus he harmonizes the contradictions between Genesis 15:13 (\"400 years\") and 15:16 (\"the fourth generation\");<ref>[[Mekhilta]] Bo 14</ref> Exodus 20:16 and Deuteronomy 5:18;<ref>Mekhilta Yitro, Bahodesh, 8</ref> Numbers 9:23, 10:35 and ib.,<ref>Sifre Numbers 84</ref> Deuteronomy 14:13 and Leviticus 11:14.<ref>Hullin 63b</ref> The contradiction between Genesis 1:25 (which lists 3 categories of created beings) and 1:24 (which adds a fourth category, the \"living souls\") Judah explains by saying that this expression designates the demons, for whom God did not create bodies because the Sabbath had come.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 7, end</ref>\n\nNoteworthy among the other numerous Scriptural interpretations which have been handed down in Judah's name are his clever etymological explanations, for example: Exodus 19:8-9;<ref name=\"Shabbat 87a\">Shabbat 87a</ref> Leviticus 23:40;<ref>Sukkah 35a</ref> Numbers 15:38;<ref>[[Sifre]] Numbers 115</ref> [[II Samuel]] 17:27;<ref>[[Midrash Tehillim]] to Psalms 3:1</ref> [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 1:17;<ref>Yerushalmi Peah 20b</ref> Psalms 68:7.<ref>Mekhilta Bo 16</ref>\n\nHe interpreted the words \"to do the evil\" in [[II Samuel]] 12:9 to mean that [[David]] did not really sin with [[Bathsheba]], but only intended to do so. [[Abba Aricha|Rav]], Judah's student, ascribes this apology for King David to Judah's desire to justify his ancestor.<ref>Shabbat 56a</ref> A sentence praising King Hezekiah<ref name=\"hullin6\"/> and an extenuating opinion of King Ahaz<ref>Leviticus Rabbah 36</ref> have also been handed down in Judah's name. Characteristic of Judah's appreciation of aggadah is his interpretation of the word \"vayagged\" (Exodus 19:9) to the effect that the words of Moses attracted the hearts of his hearers, like the aggadah does.<ref name=\"Shabbat 87a\"/> Once when the audience was falling asleep in his lecture, he made a ludicrous statement in order to revive their interest, and then explained the statement to be accurate in a metaphorical sense.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.1.15.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:15]; compare Mekhilta Beshallach Shirah 9</ref>\n\nJudah was especially fond of the [[Book of Psalms]].<ref>See Avodah Zarah 19a; [[Midrash Tehillim]] to Psalms 3:1</ref> He paraphrased the David's wish \"Let the words of my mouth ... be acceptable in thy sight,\"<ref>Psalms 19:14</ref> thus: \"May the Psalms have been composed for the coming generations; may they be written down for them; and may those that read them be rewarded like those that study halakhic sentences\".<ref>Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 1:1</ref> He said that the [[Book of Job]] was important if only because it presented the sin and punishment of the generations of the Flood.<ref>[[Genesis Rabbah]] 26, end</ref> He proves from Exodus 16:35 that [[there is no chronological order in the Torah]].<ref>[[Sifre]] Numbers 64</ref> Referring to the prophetic books, he says: \"All the Prophets begin with denunciations and end with comfortings\".<ref>Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 4:8</ref> Even the genealogical portions of the Book of Chronicles must be interpreted.<ref>[[Ruth Rabbah]] 2, beginning</ref>\n\nIt appears that there was an aggadic collection containing Judah's answers to exegetical questions.<ref>[[Pesikta Rabbati]] 46 (ed. Friedmann, p. 187a)</ref> Among these questions may have been the one which Judah's son Simeon addressed to him.<ref>According to Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 117:1</ref>\n\n=== Other quotes ===\n* What is the right way for man to choose?

His place of birth is unknown.\n\nJudah spent his youth in the city of [[Usha (city)|Usha]]. His father presumably gave him the same education that he himself had received, including the [[Greek language]].<ref>[[Nashim|Sotah]] 49b</ref> This knowledge of Greek enabled him to become the Jews' intermediary with the Roman authorities. He favored Greek as the language of the country over [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]].<ref>Sotah 49b</ref> In Judah's house, only the [[Hebrew language]] was spoken, and the maids of the house became known for their use of obscure Hebrew terminology.<ref>Megillah 18a; Rosh Hashana 26b; Nazir 3a; Eruvin 53a</ref>\n\nJudah devoted himself chiefly to the study of the traditional and of the written law. In his youth he had close relations with most of the great students of Akiba; and as their student and in converse with other prominent men who gathered about his father at Usha and later at Shefar'am, he laid the foundations of that wide scholarship which enabled him to undertake his life-work, the redaction of the Mishnah.\n\n===His teachers===\nHis teacher at Usha was R' [[Judah bar Ilai]], who was officially employed in the house of the patriarch as judge in religious and legal questions.<ref>Menachot 104a; Shevuot 13a</ref> In later years, Judah described how in his childhood he read the [[Book of Esther]] at Usha in the presence of Judah bar Ilai.<ref>Megillah 20a; Tosefta Megillah 2:8</ref>\n\nJudah felt especial reverence for R' [[Jose ben Halafta]], the student of Akiva's who had the closest relations with Simon ben Gamaliel. When, in later years, Judah raised objections to Jose's opinions, he would say: \"We poor ones undertake to attack Jose, though our time compares with his as the profane with the holy!\"<ref>Yerushalmi Gittin 48b</ref> Judah hands down a halakhah by Jose in Menachot 14a.\n\nJudah studied from R' [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in \"Tekoa\",<ref>\"when we studied the Torah with Shimon bar Yochai at Tekoa'\"; Tosefta Eruvin 8:6; Shabbat 147b; compare Yerushalmi Shabbat 12c</ref> a place some have identified with [[Meron, Israel|Meron]].<ref>See Bacher, l.c. ii. 76</ref> He also studied with [[Eleazar ben Shammua]].<ref>Eruvin 53a; Yevamot 84a; compare Menachot 18a</ref> Judah did not study with [[Rabbi Meir]], evidently in consequence of the conflicts which distanced Meir from the house of the patriarch. However, he considered himself lucky even to have seen Meir from behind.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eruvin.13b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Eruvin 13b]; Yerushalmi Beitzah 63a, where an anachronistic anecdote is connected with this saying of Judah's</ref>\n\nAnother of Judah's teachers was [[Nathan the Babylonian]], who also took a part in the conflict between Meir and the patriarch; Judah confessed that once, in a fit of youthful ardor, he had failed to treat Nathan with due reverence.<ref>Bava Batra 131a; in different version Yerushalmi Ketuvot 29a; Bava Batra 16a</ref> In both halakhic and aggadic tradition, Judah's opinion is often opposed to Nathan's.\n\nIn the Palestinian tradition, Judah ben Korshai (the halakhic specialist mentioned as assistant to Simon ben Gamaliel<ref>Horayot 13b</ref>) is designated as Judah's real teacher.<ref>Yerushalmi Shabbat 12c; Yerushalmi Pesachim 37b</ref> Jacob ben Hanina (possibly the R. Jacob whose patronymic is not given and in whose name Judah quotes halakhic sentences<ref>Gittin 14b; compare Tosefta Avodah Zarah 5:4</ref>) is also mentioned as one of Judah's teachers, and is said to have asked him to repeat halakhic sentences.<ref>[[Sifre]] Deuteronomy 306</ref>\n\nJudah was also taught by his father (Simon ben Gamaliel);<ref>Bava Metziah 85b</ref> when the two differed on a halakhic matter, the father was generally stricter.<ref>See Frankel, l.c. p. 184</ref> Judah himself says: \"My opinion seems to me more correct than that of my father\"; and he then proceeds to give his reasons.<ref>Eruvin 32a</ref> Humility was a virtue ascribed to Judah, and he admired it greatly in his father, who openly recognized Shimon bar Yochai's superiority, thus displaying the same modesty as the [[Bnei Bathyra]] when they gave way to [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], and as [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]] when he voluntarily gave precedence to his friend [[David]].<ref>Bava Metziah 84b, 85a</ref>\n\n===Leadership===\nNothing is known regarding the time when Judah succeeded his father as leader of the Palestinian Jews. According to [[Rashi]], Judah's father, Rabbi [[Simeon ben Gamaliel II|Simon ben Gamliel]], had served as the ''[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]'' of the [[Sanhedrin]] in [[Usha (city)|Usha]], before it transferred to [[Shefar'am]].<ref name= \"BT-RoshHash\">[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''[[Rosh Hashana (Talmud)|Rosh Hashana]]'' 31b, [[Rashi]] s.v. \u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05d1\u05e0\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0</ref> According to a tradition,<ref>Mishnah So\u1e6dah, end</ref> the country at the time of Simon ben Gamaliel's death not only was devastated by a plague of locusts, but suffered many other hardships. From Shefar'am, the Sanhedrin transferred to [[Beit Shearim]], where the Sanhedrin was headed by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi.<ref name= \"BT-RoshHash\" /> Here he officiated for a long time. Eventually, Judah moved with the court from Beit Shearim to [[Sepphoris]], where he spent at least 17 years of his life. He had chosen Sepphoris chiefly because of his ill-health, and being induced to go there because of the place's high altitude and pure air.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Kilaim'' 32b; [[Genesis Rabbah]] 96; Ketubot 103b</ref> However, Judah's memorial as a leader is principally associated with Bet She'arim: \"To Bet She'arim must one go in order to obtain Rabbi's decision in legal matters.\"<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Sanhedrin'' 32b</ref>\n\nAmong Judah's contemporaries in the early years of his activity were [[Eleazar ben Simeon]], [[Ishmael ben Jose]], [[Jose ben Judah]], and [[Simeon ben Eleazar]]. His better-known contemporaries and students include Simon b. Manasseh, [[Phinehas ben Jair]], [[Eleazar ha-Kappar]] and his son [[Bar Kappara]], [[Hiyya the Great]], [[Shimon ben Halafta]], and [[Levi ben Sisi]]. Among his students who taught as the first generation of Amoraim after his death are: [[Hanina bar Hama]] and [[Hoshaiah Rabbah|Hoshaiah]] in Palestine, [[Abba Aricha|Rav]] and [[Samuel of Nehardea|Samuel]] in Babylon.\n\nOnly scattered records of Judah's official activity exist. These include: the ordination of his students;<ref>Sanhedrin 5a,b</ref> the recommendation of students for communal offices;<ref>Yevamot 105a; Yerushalmi Yevamot 13a</ref> orders relating to the announcement of the new moon;<ref>Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 58a, above</ref> amelioration of the law relating to the Sabbatical year;<ref>Shevuot 6:4; Yerushalmi Shevuot 37a; compare Hullin 7a,b</ref> and to decrees relating to tithes in the frontier districts of Palestine.<ref>Yerushalmi Demai 22c</ref><ref name=\"hullin6\">Hullin 6b</ref> The last-named he was obliged to defend against the opposition of the members of the patriarchal family.<ref name=\"hullin6\"/> The ameliorations he intended for [[Tisha B'av]] were prevented by the college.<ref>Megillah 5b; Yerushalmi Megillah 70c</ref> Many religious and legal decisions are recorded as having been rendered by Judah together with his court, the college of scholars.<ref>Gittin 5:6; Ohalot 18:9; Tosefta Shabbat 4:16; see also Yevamot 79b, above; Kiddushin 71a</ref>\n\nAccording to the Talmud,<ref>Avodah Zarah 10a-b</ref> Rabbi Judah HaNasi was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with \"Antoninus\", possibly the [[Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]],<ref>A. Mischcon, Avodah Zara, p.10a Soncino, 1988. Mischcon cites various sources, \"SJ Rappaport... is of the opinion that our Antoninus is Antoninus Pius.\" Other opinions cited suggest \"Antoninus\" was [[Caracalla]], [[Lucius Verus]] or [[Alexander Severus]].</ref> though it is more likely his famous friendship was with either Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] Antoninus<ref name=\"Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146\">''''Codex Judaica'''' Kantor, second edition, NY 2006, page 146</ref><ref>[[Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport]], ''Erekh Millin'', Warsaw 1914, p. 219</ref> or Antoninus who is also called [[Caracalla]] and who would consult Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters.<ref>Modern scholarship has difficulty fitting these accounts into the historical framework of the period of the Antonines, especially since Rabbi Judah the Prince thrived mainly at the end of the second century CE. [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], in his treatise ''[[On Weights and Measures (Epiphanius)|On Weights and Measures]]'', mentions a fifth line of Caesar after Antoninus Pius, one named Antoninus who is also called [[Caracalla]], the son of [[Septimius Severus|Severus]], who was also contemporary with Rabbi Judah the Prince, and whom the historian [[Heinrich Graetz]] believes may refer to the Roman Emperor who befriended Rabbi Judah the Prince. Antoninus the son of Severus (Heb. '''\u05d0\u05e0\u05d8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1''') is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, ''Avodah Zarah'' 10b and in the ''Midrash Otiyoth'' of [[Rabbi Akiva]] (MS. version ''aleph'').</ref> Jewish sources tell of various discussions between Judah and Antoninus. These include the parable of the blind and the lame (illustrating the judgment of the body and the soul after death),<ref>Mekhilta Beshallah Shirah 2; Sanhedrin 91a,b; see a similar parable by him in [[Ecclesiastes Rabbah]] 5:10</ref> and a discussion of the impulse to sin.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 34; Sanhedrin 91b</ref>\n\nThe authority of Judah's office was enhanced by his wealth, which is referred to in various traditions. In Babylon, the hyperbolic statement was later made that even his stable-master was wealthier than [[Shapur (name)|King Shapur]].<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.85a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Bava Metziah 85a]</ref> His household was compared to that of the emperor.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.43a.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Berachot 43a], 57b</ref> [[Simeon ben Menasya]] praised Judah by saying that he and his sons united in themselves beauty, power, wealth, wisdom, age, honor, and the blessings of children.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Sanhedrin.11.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Tosefta Sanhedrin 11:4]; Baraita Ab. 6:8</ref> During a famine, Judah opened his granaries and distributed corn among the needy.<ref>Bava Batra 8a</ref> But he denied himself the pleasures procurable by wealth, saying: \"Whoever chooses the delights of this world will be deprived of the delights of the next world; whoever renounces the former will receive the latter\".<ref name=\"Avot of Rabbi Natan 28\">[[Avot of Rabbi Natan]] 28</ref>\n\n===Death===\nThe year of Judah's death is deduced from the statement that his student [[Abba Aricha|Rav]] left Palestine for good not long before Judah's death, in year 530 of the [[Seleucid era]] (219 CE).<ref>See \"R. E. J.\" 44:45-61</ref> He assumed the office of patriarch during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]] (c. 165). Hence Judah, having been born about 135, became patriarch at the age of 30, and died at the age of about 85. The [[Talmud]] notes that Rabbi Judah the Prince lived for at least 17 years in [[Sepphoris]], and that he applied unto himself the biblical verse, \"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years\" <small>(Genesis 47:28)</small>.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Kelaim'' 9:3, 32a-b.</ref>\n\nAccording to a different calculation, he died on 15 [[Kislev]], AM 3978 (around December 1, 217 CE),<ref>{{cite book |first=Judah |last=Goldin |chapter=The Period of the Talmud |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Finkelstein |title=The Jews: Their History |publisher=Schocken |location=New York |year=1970 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jewstheirhistory00fink/page/172 172] |isbn=0-8052-0271-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/jewstheirhistory00fink/page/172 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=L. |last=Margolis |first2=A. |last2=Marx |title=A History of the Jewish People |publisher=Atheneum |location=New York |year=1980 |isbn=0-689-70134-9 |page=225 |url= }}</ref> in Sepphoris, and his body was interred in the [[necropolis]] of [[Beit Shearim]], {{convert|15.2|km}} distant from Sepphoris,<ref>Cf.

He said to it: \"Go; for you were created for this purpose!\" Due to this unkind attitude toward the suffering animal, he was punished with years of illness. Later, when his daughter was about to kill a small animal which was in her way, he said to her: \"Let it live, for it is written: '[God's] tender mercies are over all his works'.\"<ref>Psalms 145:9</ref> After this demonstration of compassion, his illness ceased.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.85a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Bava Metzia 85a]; [[Genesis Rabbah]] 33</ref> Judah also once said, \"One who is ignorant of the Torah should not eat meat.\"<ref>Pesachim 49b</ref> The prayer he prescribed upon eating meat or eggs also indicates an appreciation of animal life: \"Blessed be the Lord who has created many souls, in order to support by them the soul of every living being.\"<ref>Yerushalmi Berachot 10b</ref>\n\nJudah was easily moved to tears. He exclaimed, sobbing, in reference to three different stories of martyrs whose deaths made them worthy of future life: \"One man earns his world in an hour, while another requires many years\".<ref>Avodah Zarah 10b, 17a, 18a; for a sentence by Judah on the ranking of the pious in the future world see Sifre, Deut. 47</ref> He began to weep when [[Elisha ben Abuyah]]'s daughters, who were soliciting alms, reminded him of their father's learning.<ref>Yerushalmi Hagigah 77c; compare Hagigah 15b</ref> In a legend relating to his meeting with [[Pinchas ben Yair]], he is described as tearfully admiring the pious Pinchas' unswerving steadfastness, protected by a higher power.<ref>Hullin 7b</ref> He was frequently interrupted by tears when explaining [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:2 and illustrating the passage by stories of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Temple.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 2:2; compare Yerushalmi Ta'anit 68d</ref> While explaining certain passages of Scripture,<ref>I Samuel 28:15; Amos 4:13, 5:15; Zephaniah 2:3; Lamentations 3:29; Ecclesiastes 12:14</ref> he was reminded of divine judgment and of the uncertainty of acquittal, and began to cry.<ref>Yerushalmi Hagigah 77a; Leviticus Rabbah 26; Midrash Shmuel 24</ref> [[Hiyya the Great|Hiyya]] found him weeping during his last illness because death was about to deprive him of the opportunity of studying the Torah and of fulfilling the commandments.<ref>Ketuvot 103b</ref>\n\nOnce, when at a meal his students expressed their preference for soft tongue, he made this an opportunity to say, \"May your tongues be soft in your mutual intercourse\" (i.e., \"Speak gently without disputing\").<ref>[[Leviticus Rabbah]] 33, beginning</ref>\n\nBefore he died, Judah said: \"I need my sons! ... Let the lamp continue to burn in its usual place; let the table be set in its usual place; let the bed be made in its usual place.\"<ref>Ketubot 103a</ref>\n\n====His prayers====\nWhile teaching Torah, Judah would often interrupt the lesson to recite the [[Shema Yisrael]]. He passed his hand over his eyes as he said it.<ref>Berachot 13b</ref>\n\nWhen 70-year-old wine cured him of a protracted illness, he prayed: \"Blessed be the Lord, who has given His world into the hands of guardians\".<ref>Avodah Zarah 40b</ref>\n\nHe privately recited daily the following supplication on finishing the obligatory prayers: \"May it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, to protect me against the impudent and against impudence, from bad men and bad companions, from severe sentences and severe plaintiffs, whether a son of the covenant or not.\"<ref>(Berachot 6b; compare Shabbat 30b</ref>\n\n=== Post-Talmudic narratives ===\nRabbi [[Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg]] relates that the spirit of Rebbi Judah used to visit his home, wearing [[Shabbat]] clothes, every Friday evening at dusk. He would recite [[Kiddush]], and others would thereby discharge their obligation to hear Kiddush. One Friday night there was a knock at the door. \"Sorry,\" said the maid, \"I can't let you in just now because Rabbeinu HaKadosh is in the middle of Kiddush.\" From then on Judah stopped coming, since he did not want his coming to become public knowledge.<ref>[[Sefer Hasidim]] \u00a71129 (Cf. [[Nashim|Ketubot]] 103a)</ref>\n\n==Teachings==\n\n=== Compilation of the Mishnah ===\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\n{{Main|Mishna}}\nAccording to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the [[Torah]]) and the [[Oral law]] to Moses on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages ([[rabbi]]nic leaders) of each subsequent generation.\n\nFor centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral traditions might be forgotten, Judah undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the ''Mishnah''. This completed a project which had been mostly clarified and organized by his father and [[Nathan the Babylonian]].<ref name=\"Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146\"/>\n\nThe Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the ''Talmud.'' According to [[Abraham ben David]], the ''Mishnah'' was compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince in [[anno mundi]] 3949, or the year 500 of the [[Seleucid era]], which corresponds to 189 CE.<ref>Abraham ben David, ''Seder Ha-Kabbalah Leharavad'', Jerusalem 1971, p.16 (Hebrew)</ref><ref>[[Heinrich Graetz]], ''History of the Jews'', vol. 6, Philadelphia 1898, p. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021930634;view=1up;seq=131 105]</ref>\n\nThe Mishnah contains many of Judah's own sentences, which are introduced by the words, \"Rabbi says.\"\n\nThe Mishna was Judah's work, though it includes a few sentences by his son and successor, [[Gamaliel III]],<ref>[[Pirkei Avot]] 2:2-4</ref> perhaps written after Judah's death. Both the Talmuds assume as a matter of course that Judah is the originator of the Mishnah\u2014\"our Mishnah,\" as it was called in Babylon\u2014and the author of the explanations and discussions relating to its sentences. However, Judah is more  correctly consider redactor of the Mishna, rather than its author. The Mishna is based on the systematic division of the halakhic material as formulated by [[Rabbi Akiva]]; Judah following in his work the arrangement of the halakot as taught by [[Rabbi Meir]] (Akiva's foremost student).<ref>Sanhedrin 86a</ref> Judah's work in the Mishnah appears both in what he included and in what he rejected. The volume of tannaitic statements not included in the Mishna (but recorded in the [[Tosefta]] and in the baraitot of both Talmuds) shows that Judah had no small task in selecting the material that he included in his work. Also, the formulating of halakic maxims on controverted points required both his unusual technical knowledge and his undisputed authority; and the fact that he did not invariably lay down the rule, but always admitted divergent opinions and traditions both of the pre-Hadrianic time and, more especially, of Akiba's eminent students, demonstrates his circumspection and his consciousness of the limits imposed upon his authority by tradition and by its recognized representatives.\n\n===Halacha===\nUsing the precedent of [[Rabbi Meir]]'s reported actions, Judah ruled the [[Beit Shean]] region to be exempt from the requirements of [[Tithes in Judaism|tithing]] and [[shmita]] regarding produce grown there.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chullin.6b.5-6?lang=bi Hullin 6b]; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] ''Demai'' 2:1. The region of Beit Shean was typically seen as not settled by Jews returning from the [[Babylonian captivity]], and therefore had not the same consecrated status as other areas of the country. As for Rabbi Judah HaNasi's enactment, the release from shmita obligations and the release from tithing all home-grown produce throughout the remaining six years of the seven-year cycle were one and the same (cf. Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hilchot Terumoth'' 1:5); Jerusalem Talmud ''Shevi'it'' 6:4; p. 51a in the ''Oz veHadar'' edition.</ref> He also did the same for the cities of Kefar Tzemach, [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] and [[Beit Jibrin|Beit Gubrin]].<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Demai 2:1</ref>\n\nHe forbade his students to study in the marketplace, basing his prohibition on his interpretation of [[Song of Songs]] 7:2, and censured one of his students who violated this restriction.<ref>Moed Kattan 16a, b</ref>\n\n===Biblical interpretation===\n\nHis exegesis includes many attempts to harmonize conflicting Biblical statements. Thus he harmonizes the contradictions between Genesis 15:13 (\"400 years\") and 15:16 (\"the fourth generation\");<ref>[[Mekhilta]] Bo 14</ref> Exodus 20:16 and Deuteronomy 5:18;<ref>Mekhilta Yitro, Bahodesh, 8</ref> Numbers 9:23, 10:35 and ib.,<ref>Sifre Numbers 84</ref> Deuteronomy 14:13 and Leviticus 11:14.<ref>Hullin 63b</ref> The contradiction between Genesis 1:25 (which lists 3 categories of created beings) and 1:24 (which adds a fourth category, the \"living souls\") Judah explains by saying that this expression designates the demons, for whom God did not create bodies because the Sabbath had come.<ref>Genesis Rabbah 7, end</ref>\n\nNoteworthy among the other numerous Scriptural interpretations which have been handed down in Judah's name are his clever etymological explanations, for example: Exodus 19:8-9;<ref name=\"Shabbat 87a\">Shabbat 87a</ref> Leviticus 23:40;<ref>Sukkah 35a</ref> Numbers 15:38;<ref>[[Sifre]] Numbers 115</ref> [[II Samuel]] 17:27;<ref>[[Midrash Tehillim]] to Psalms 3:1</ref> [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 1:17;<ref>Yerushalmi Peah 20b</ref> Psalms 68:7.<ref>Mekhilta Bo 16</ref>\n\nHe interpreted the words \"to do the evil\" in [[II Samuel]] 12:9 to mean that [[David]] did not really sin with [[Bathsheba]], but only intended to do so. [[Abba Aricha|Rav]], Judah's student, ascribes this apology for King David to Judah's desire to justify his ancestor.<ref>Shabbat 56a</ref> A sentence praising King Hezekiah<ref name=\"hullin6\"/> and an extenuating opinion of King Ahaz<ref>Leviticus Rabbah 36</ref> have also been handed down in Judah's name. Characteristic of Judah's appreciation of aggadah is his interpretation of the word \"vayagged\" (Exodus 19:9) to the effect that the words of Moses attracted the hearts of his hearers, like the aggadah does.<ref name=\"Shabbat 87a\"/> Once when the audience was falling asleep in his lecture, he made a ludicrous statement in order to revive their interest, and then explained the statement to be accurate in a metaphorical sense.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.1.15.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:15]; compare Mekhilta Beshallach Shirah 9</ref>\n\nJudah was especially fond of the [[Book of Psalms]].<ref>See Avodah Zarah 19a; [[Midrash Tehillim]] to Psalms 3:1</ref> He paraphrased the David's wish \"Let the words of my mouth ... be acceptable in thy sight,\"<ref>Psalms 19:14</ref> thus: \"May the Psalms have been composed for the coming generations; may they be written down for them; and may those that read them be rewarded like those that study halakhic sentences\".<ref>Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 1:1</ref> He said that the [[Book of Job]] was important if only because it presented the sin and punishment of the generations of the Flood.<ref>[[Genesis Rabbah]] 26, end</ref> He proves from Exodus 16:35 that [[there is no chronological order in the Torah]].<ref>[[Sifre]] Numbers 64</ref> Referring to the prophetic books, he says: \"All the Prophets begin with denunciations and end with comfortings\".<ref>Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 4:8</ref> Even the genealogical portions of the Book of Chronicles must be interpreted.<ref>[[Ruth Rabbah]] 2, beginning</ref>\n\nIt appears that there was an aggadic collection containing Judah's answers to exegetical questions.<ref>[[Pesikta Rabbati]] 46 (ed. Friedmann, p. 187a)</ref> Among these questions may have been the one which Judah's son Simeon addressed to him.<ref>According to Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 117:1</ref>\n\n=== Other quotes ===\n* What is the right way for man to choose?
