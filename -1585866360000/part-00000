Arguably, his most notable painting was ''[[Work (painting)|Work]]'' (1852\u20131865). Brown spent the latter years of his life painting the twelve works known as ''[[The Manchester Murals]]'', depicting [[History of Manchester|Mancunian history]], for [[Manchester Town Hall]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Rossetti-10.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brown, at left, with [[William Holman Hunt]]. [[Caricature]] by [[Max Beerbohm]] from ''[[Rossetti and His Circle]]''.]]\nBrown was the grandson of the medical theorist [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]], founder of the [[Brunonian system of medicine]]. His great grandfather was a Scottish labourer.  His father Ford Brown served as a purser in the [[Royal Navy]], including a period serving under [[Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet|Sir Isaac Coffin]] and a period on [[HMS Arethusa (1781)|HMS ''Arethusa'']].  He left the Navy after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn 1818, Ford Brown married Caroline Madox, of an old Kentish family, from which his middle name was taken.<ref>\"Ford Madox Brown\", ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref>  Brown's parents had limited financial resources, and they moved to [[Calais]] to seek cheaper lodgings, where their daughter Elizabeth Coffin was born in 1819 and their son Ford Madox Brown in 1821.\n\nBrown's education was limited, as the family frequently moved between lodgings in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] and relatives in [[Kent]], but he showed artistic talent in copying of old master prints.  His father initially sought a naval career for his son, writing to his former captain Sir Isaac Coffin.  The family moved to [[Bruges]] in 1835 so Brown could study at the academy under [[Albert Gregorius]].  Brown moved to [[Ghent]] in 1836 to continue his studies under [[Pieter van Hanselaere]].  He moved to [[Antwerp]] in 1837 to study under [[Gustaf Wappers]].  He continued to study in Antwerp after his mother's death in 1839.  His sister died in 1840, and then his father in 1842.\n\n==Works==\n{{see also|List of paintings by Ford Madox Brown}}\n[[File:Brown last of england.jpg|thumb|''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'' depicting an emigrating couple,  1855]]\nThe Tate Gallery holds an early example of Brown's work, a portrait of his father.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/brown-study-for-the-dean-in-the-execution-of-mary-queen-of-scots-n04280 Tate.org]</ref>  He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840, a work inspired by [[Lord Byron]]'s poem ''[[The Giaour]]'' (now lost) and then completed a version of ''The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots'', with his cousin and future wife Elisabeth Bromley as one of his models.  He lived in Montmartre with his new wife and aging father in 1841.  He painted ''[[Manfred on the Jungfrau (1842)|Manfred on the Jungfrau]]'', inspired by Lord Byron's poem ''[[Manfred]]'' while he was in Paris.\n\nIn 1843 he submitted work to the Westminster Cartoon Competition, for compositions to decorate the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. His entry, ''The Body of Harold Brought before William'', was not successful. His early works were, however, greatly admired by the young [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], who asked him to become his tutor. Through Rossetti, Brown came into contact with the artists who went on to form the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. Though closely linked to them, he was never actually a member of the brotherhood itself, but adopted the bright colours and realistic style of [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  He was also influenced by the works of Holbein that he saw in Basel in 1845, and by [[Friedrich Overbeck]] and [[Peter Cornelius]], whom he met in Rome in 1845\u201346.\n\nBrown struggled to make his mark in the 1850s, with his paintings failing to find buyers, and he considered emigrating to India.  In 1852 he started work on two of his most significant works.\n\nOne of his most famous images is ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', painted from 1852 to 1855, which was sold in March 1859 for 325 [[Guinea (British coin)|Guineas]]<ref>''Sale of Valuable Pictures'', ''[[The Times]]'', 28 March 1859</ref> (''2010: \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|341.25|1859|2010|r=-2}}}}''). It depicts a pair of stricken emigrants as they sail away on the ship that will take them from England forever. It was inspired by the departure of the Pre-Raphaelite sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], who had left for Australia. In an unusual [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] format, the painting is structured with Brown's characteristic linear energy, and emphasis on apparently grotesque and banal details, such as the cabbages hanging from the ship's side.  The husband and wife are portraits of Brown and his second wife Emma.\n\n[[File:Ford Madox Brown - The Coat of Many Colours - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Brown's ''Jacob and Joseph's Coat'' at [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]]]\nBrown's most important painting was ''[[Work (painting)|Work]]'' (1852\u20131865), begun in Hampstead in 1852 and which he showed at his retrospective exhibition in 1865. [[Thomas Plint]] advanced funds to enable Brown to complete the work, in anticipation of obtaining the finished painting, but died in 1861 before the painting had been completed.<ref name=ODNB>Dianne Sachko Macleod, \u2018[[Thomas Plint|Plint, Thomas Edward]] (1823\u20131861)\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004</ref> In this painting, Brown attempted to depict the totality of the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] social experience in a single image, depicting 'navvies' digging up a road (Heath Street in [[Hampstead]], north London) and disrupting the old social hierarchies as they did so. The image erupts into proliferating details from the dynamic centre of the action, as the workers tear a hole in the road&nbsp;\u2013 and, symbolically, in the social fabric. Each character represents a particular social class and role in the modern urban environment. \n\nBrown wrote a catalogue to accompany the special exhibition of ''Work''. This publication included an extensive explanation of ''Work'' that nevertheless leaves many questions unanswered. Brown's concern with the social issues addressed in ''Work'' prompted him to open a [[soup kitchen]] for Manchester's hungry, and to attempt to aid the city's unemployed to find work by founding a labour exchange.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/31/pre-raphaelites-ybas?intcmp=239 |title=Why the pre-Raphaelites were the YBAs of their day |date=31 August 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |author=Fiona MacCarthy |accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/ford-madox-brown/background-to-the-painting/biography-of-ford-madox-brown/social-concience/ |title=Biography of Ford Madox Brown-Social conscience |year=2009 |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |accessdate=11 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBrown found patrons in the north of England, including Plint, [[George Rae (art collector)|George Rae]] from Birkenhead,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/people/biog/?bid=Rae_G&initial=R |website=[[University of Glasgow]] |title=George Rae, 1817-1902 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> [[John Miller (art collector)|John Miller]] from Liverpool, and [[James Leathart]] from Newcastle.  By the late 1850s he had lost patience with the poor reception he received at the Royal Academy and ceased to show his works there, rejecting an offer from Millais to support his becoming an associate member. He founded the [[Hogarth Club]] in 1858, with [[William Morris]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and his former pupil Rossetti. After a successful period of a few years, the club reached over 80 members, including several prominent members of the Royal Academy, but Brown resigned in 1860, and the club collapsed in 1861.\n\nFrom the 1860s, Brown also designed furniture and stained glass. He was a founder partner of [[William Morris]]'s design company, [[Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.]], in 1861, which dissolved in 1874 with Morris continuing on his own. He was a close friend of the landscape artist [[Henry Mark Anthony]].\n\nBrown's major achievement after ''Work'' was ''[[The Manchester Murals]]'', a cycle of twelve paintings in the Great Hall of [[Manchester Town Hall]] depicting the history of the city. Brown would be 72 by the time he finished the murals. In total, he took six years perfecting the murals, which were his last major work.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Ford Madox Brown: pre-Raphaelite pioneer and working-class hero |last=Hughes |first=Kathryn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/16/ford-madox-brown-pre-raphaelite-exhibition |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 September 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:The Bromley Family.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|''The Bromley Family''. Brown's first wife Elizabeth, lower right, 1844]]\n\nFord Madox Brown was married twice. His first wife Elizabeth Bromley was his first cousin, the daughter of his mother's sister Mary.  They were married in [[Meopham]] in Kent in April 1841, shortly before his 20th birthday and less than a year after the sudden death of his sister Elizabeth.  They lived in [[Montmartre]] in 1841 with Brown's invalid father who died the following summer.\n\nTheir first child died young as an infant in November 1842.  Their daughter [[Lucy Madox Brown|Emma Lucy]] was born in 1843 and the family moved back to England in 1844.  They travelled to Rome in 1845 to alleviate the illness of his wife, who was suffering from consumption (pulmonary [[tuberculosis]]).  She died in Paris in June 1846, aged 27, on the journey back to England from Rome.\n\nEmma Hill became a frequent model for Brown from 1848; for example, she is the wife in ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]''. She became his mistress, and they shared a house in London, but social convention discouraged him from marrying an illiterate daughter of a bricklayer. Their daughter [[Catherine Madox Brown|Catherine Emily]] was born in 1850, and eventually they were married at [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]] in April 1853.\n\nTheir son, '''Oliver Madox Brown''' (1855\u20131874) (known as Nolly) showed promise both as an artist and poet, but died of [[blood poisoning]] before his maturity.  The death of Nolly was a crushing blow for Brown, and he kept a room for his son's belongings as a shrine.  Another son Arthur was born in September 1856.  Brown used Arthur as the model for the baby held by a ragged girl in the foreground of ''Work'', but he died aged only ten months old in July 1857.\n[[File:Ford Madox Brown - Pretty Baa-Lambs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[The Pretty Baa-Lambs]]''. Brown's mistress and later wife Emma and second daughter Cathy in 1851]]\nHis daughters Lucy and Catherine were also competent artists.  Lucy married [[William Michael Rossetti]] in 1874.  Catherine, married [[Francis Hueffer]]; through Catherine, Brown was the grandfather of novelist [[Ford Madox Ford]] and great-grandfather of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Home Secretary]] [[Frank Soskice]].\n\n==Death==\nBrown's second wife died in October 1890, and he died in Primrose Hill, north London, in 1893.

His father Ford Brown served as a purser in the [[Royal Navy]], including a period serving under [[Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet|Sir Isaac Coffin]] and a period on [[HMS Arethusa (1781)|HMS ''Arethusa'']].  He left the Navy after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn 1818, Ford Brown married Caroline Madox, of an old Kentish family, from which his middle name was taken.<ref>\"Ford Madox Brown\", ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref>  Brown's parents had limited financial resources, and they moved to [[Calais]] to seek cheaper lodgings, where their daughter Elizabeth Coffin was born in 1819 and their son Ford Madox Brown in 1821.\n\nBrown's education was limited, as the family frequently moved between lodgings in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] and relatives in [[Kent]], but he showed artistic talent in copying of old master prints.  His father initially sought a naval career for his son, writing to his former captain Sir Isaac Coffin.  The family moved to [[Bruges]] in 1835 so Brown could study at the academy under [[Albert Gregorius]].  Brown moved to [[Ghent]] in 1836 to continue his studies under [[Pieter van Hanselaere]].  He moved to [[Antwerp]] in 1837 to study under [[Gustaf Wappers]].  He continued to study in Antwerp after his mother's death in 1839.  His sister died in 1840, and then his father in 1842.\n\n==Works==\n{{see also|List of paintings by Ford Madox Brown}}\n[[File:Brown last of england.jpg|thumb|''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'' depicting an emigrating couple,  1855]]\nThe Tate Gallery holds an early example of Brown's work, a portrait of his father.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/brown-study-for-the-dean-in-the-execution-of-mary-queen-of-scots-n04280 Tate.org]</ref>  He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840, a work inspired by [[Lord Byron]]'s poem ''[[The Giaour]]'' (now lost) and then completed a version of ''The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots'', with his cousin and future wife Elisabeth Bromley as one of his models.  He lived in Montmartre with his new wife and aging father in 1841.  He painted ''[[Manfred on the Jungfrau (1842)|Manfred on the Jungfrau]]'', inspired by Lord Byron's poem ''[[Manfred]]'' while he was in Paris.\n\nIn 1843 he submitted work to the Westminster Cartoon Competition, for compositions to decorate the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. His entry, ''The Body of Harold Brought before William'', was not successful. His early works were, however, greatly admired by the young [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], who asked him to become his tutor. Through Rossetti, Brown came into contact with the artists who went on to form the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. Though closely linked to them, he was never actually a member of the brotherhood itself, but adopted the bright colours and realistic style of [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  He was also influenced by the works of Holbein that he saw in Basel in 1845, and by [[Friedrich Overbeck]] and [[Peter Cornelius]], whom he met in Rome in 1845-46.\n\nBrown struggled to make his mark in the 1850s, with his paintings failing to find buyers, and he considered emigrating to India.  In 1852 he started work on two of his most significant works.\n\nOne of his most famous images is ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', painted from 1852 to 1855, which was sold in March 1859 for 325 [[Guinea (British coin)|Guineas]]<ref>''Sale of Valuable Pictures'', ''[[The Times]]'', 28 March 1859</ref> (''2010: \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|341.25|1859|2010|r=-2}}}}''). It depicts a pair of stricken emigrants as they sail away on the ship that will take them from England forever. It was inspired by the departure of the Pre-Raphaelite sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], who had left for Australia. In an unusual [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] format, the painting is structured with Brown's characteristic linear energy, and emphasis on apparently grotesque and banal details, such as the cabbages hanging from the ship's side.  The husband and wife are portraits of Brown and his second wife Emma.\n\n[[File:Ford Madox Brown - The Coat of Many Colours - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Brown's ''Jacob and Joseph's Coat'' at [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]]]\nBrown's most important painting was ''[[Work (painting)|Work]]'' (1852\u20131865), begun in Hampstead in 1852 and which he showed at his retrospective exhibition in 1865. [[Thomas Plint]] advanced funds to enable Brown to complete the work, in anticipation of obtaining the finished painting, but died in 1861 before the painting had been completed.<ref name=ODNB>Dianne Sachko Macleod, \u2018[[Thomas Plint|Plint, Thomas Edward]] (1823\u20131861)\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004</ref> In this painting, Brown attempted to depict the totality of the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] social experience in a single image, depicting 'navvies' digging up a road (Heath Street in [[Hampstead]], north London) and disrupting the old social hierarchies as they did so. The image erupts into proliferating details from the dynamic centre of the action, as the workers tear a hole in the road&nbsp;\u2013 and, symbolically, in the social fabric. Each character represents a particular social class and role in the modern urban environment. \n\nBrown wrote a catalogue to accompany the special exhibition of ''Work''. This publication included an extensive explanation of ''Work'' that nevertheless leaves many questions unanswered. Brown's concern with the social issues addressed in ''Work'' prompted him to open a [[soup kitchen]] for Manchester's hungry, and to attempt to aid the city's unemployed to find work by founding a labour exchange.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/31/pre-raphaelites-ybas?intcmp=239 |title=Why the pre-Raphaelites were the YBAs of their day |date=31 August 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |author=Fiona MacCarthy |accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/ford-madox-brown/background-to-the-painting/biography-of-ford-madox-brown/social-concience/ |title=Biography of Ford Madox Brown-Social conscience |year=2009 |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |accessdate=11 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBrown found patrons in the north of England, including Plint, [[George Rae (art collector)|George Rae]] from Birkenhead,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/people/biog/?bid=Rae_G&initial=R |website=[[University of Glasgow]] |title=George Rae, 1817-1902 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> [[John Miller (art collector)|John Miller]] from Liverpool, and [[James Leathart]] from Newcastle.  By the late 1850s he had lost patience with the poor reception he received at the Royal Academy and ceased to show his works there, rejecting an offer from Millais to support his becoming an associate member. He founded the [[Hogarth Club]] in 1858, with [[William Morris]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and his former pupil Rossetti. After a successful period of a few years, the club reached over 80 members, including several prominent members of the Royal Academy, but Brown resigned in 1860, and the club collapsed in 1861.\n\nFrom the 1860s, Brown also designed furniture and stained glass. He was a founder partner of [[William Morris]]'s design company, [[Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.]], in 1861, which dissolved in 1874 with Morris continuing on his own. He was a close friend of the landscape artist [[Henry Mark Anthony]].\n\nBrown's major achievement after ''Work'' was ''[[The Manchester Murals]]'', a cycle of twelve paintings in the Great Hall of [[Manchester Town Hall]] depicting the history of the city. Brown would be 72 by the time he finished the murals. In total, he took six years perfecting the murals, which were his last major work.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Ford Madox Brown: pre-Raphaelite pioneer and working-class hero |last=Hughes |first=Kathryn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/16/ford-madox-brown-pre-raphaelite-exhibition |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 September 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:The Bromley Family.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|''The Bromley Family''. Brown's first wife Elizabeth, lower right, 1844]]\n\nFord Madox Brown was married twice. His first wife Elizabeth Bromley was his first cousin, the daughter of his mother's sister Mary.  They were married in [[Meopham]] in Kent in April 1841, shortly before his 20th birthday and less than a year after the sudden death of his sister Elizabeth.  They lived in [[Montmartre]] in 1841 with Brown's invalid father who died the following summer.\n\nTheir first child died young as an infant in November 1842.  Their daughter [[Lucy Madox Brown|Emma Lucy]] was born in 1843 and the family moved back to England in 1844.  They travelled to Rome in 1845 to alleviate the illness of his wife, who was suffering from consumption (pulmonary [[tuberculosis]]).  She died in Paris in June 1846, aged 27, on the journey back to England from Rome.\n\nEmma Hill became a frequent model for Brown from 1848; for example, she is the wife in ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]''. She became his mistress, and they shared a house in London, but social convention discouraged him from marrying an illiterate daughter of a bricklayer. Their daughter [[Catherine Madox Brown|Catherine Emily]] was born in 1850, and eventually they were married at [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]] in April 1853.\n\nTheir son, '''Oliver Madox Brown''' (1855\u20131874) (known as Nolly) showed promise both as an artist and poet, but died of [[blood poisoning]] before his maturity.  The death of Nolly was a crushing blow for Brown, and he kept a room for his son's belongings as a shrine.  Another son Arthur was born in September 1856.  Brown used Arthur as the model for the baby held by a ragged girl in the foreground of ''Work'', but he died aged only ten months old in July 1857.\n[[File:Ford Madox Brown - Pretty Baa-Lambs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[The Pretty Baa-Lambs]]''. Brown's mistress and later wife Emma and second daughter Cathy in 1851]]\nHis daughters Lucy and Catherine were also competent artists.  Lucy married [[William Michael Rossetti]] in 1874.  Catherine, married [[Francis Hueffer]]; through Catherine, Brown was the grandfather of novelist [[Ford Madox Ford]] and great-grandfather of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Home Secretary]] [[Frank Soskice]].\n\n==Death==\nBrown's second wife died in October 1890, and he died in Primrose Hill, north London, in 1893.

Around the turn of the century he became a strong opponent of the riksm\u00e5l  supporter [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]].\n\nIn the 1870s, he was a friend and acquaintance of Moltke Moe, and through him met [[Arne Garborg]]. In 1877 when Garborg started the magazine \"Fedraheimen\"  Mortensson became an employee. It was also Ivar who helped [[Hulda Garborg|Hulda]] and Arne Garborg locate & rent a small cabin on the small farm \"Kolbotnen\", near the lake [[Savalen]] in [[Alvdal]] in 1887. When Garborg moved there, Mortensson followed. At this time these friends had little money and Garborg styled Mortenssonn as \u201cIvar Matlaus\u201d (Ivar Foodless).\n\nMortensson-Egnund was also a poet, and in 1889 he published \"Paa ymse gjerdom\", followed by \"Or duldo\" in 1895.

After Aukrust had finished his three years of teacher\u2019s education in [[Elverum]] in 1906 and moved to [[Folldal]] as a teacher, where he lived at Einabu the two years he was there. [[Helge Groth]] wrote \"Of all the Norwegian poets and authors, none more directly influenced Olav Aukrust than Ivar Mortensson-Egnund.\"\n\nMortensson-Egnund had built a poet\u2019s retreat on the top of the ridge in the direction of Egnund chapel, sitting on the ridge of an [[esker]]&mdash;a trace from the last ice age. Mortensson-Egnund worked there in the daytime during the summer, but used his farm Einabu for meals and lodging.\n\nHe lived at the Einabu farm with the poet\u2019s retreat up along Norwegian Highway 29, near the Einunna river bridge, for much of his life. The main building from the 1870s stands still as it did in his time. Along the road there is a bust of Ivar Mortensson-Egnund carved by Trygve Dammen bust; it was unveiled on the 100-anniversary of his birth in 1957.

The following year he held a 17 May independence celebration in [[Tynset]], where he argued against cowardliness of the [[List of members of the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly|members of the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly]], but praised the [[French Revolution]]. He concluded by singing [[La Marseillaise]] for shocked farmers. He and Garborg resigned from the Liberals and formed a workers party for [[Tynset]] and [[R\u00f8ros]].\n\n''Fedraheimen'' ceased publication in 1891, two years after Mortensson-Egnund resigned as editor; his successor was Rasmus Steinsvik.\n\nMortensson-Egnund published the anarchist magazine ''Fridom'' (freedom) from 1896 to 1899,<ref name=A/> and corresponded with the well-known Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin|Pjotr Kropotkin]], whose concept of voluntary cooperation influenced him greatly. At this time Mortensson-Egnund developed a theory that the Norwegian farmers in prehistoric times had lived in anarchic groups that he called ''samn\u00f8yter''.\n\n==Priest==\nIn 1909 Mortensson-Egnund was diocese curate in Hamar, and he was ordained as a priest in Norway the following year. Beginning in 1919 he was involved in translating the Bible into [[landsm\u00e5l]]. He received a Government stipend from 1929 forward.\n\nMortensson-Egnund\u2019s friend Garborg had an interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and another of his closest friends, [[Marta Steinsvik]], joined [[Rudolf Steiner]]\u2019s [[Anthroposophy]] movement. After Steiner in 1913, broke out of the [[Theosophical Society]] and founded the [[Goetheanum|Anthroposophical Society]], Mortensson-Egnund and his wife Karen were among Steiner's followers in Norwegian ''Vidar'' group.

He completed the [[examen artium]] at ''Aars og Voss`'' school in [[Oslo|Christiania]] in 1875 and the cand. theol. in 1883.<ref name=SNL/>\n\n==Poet and supporter for Nynorsk==\n[[File:Einabu-2010-06-06.jpg|thumb|upright|Ivar Mortensson-Egnund's home ''Einabu''.]]\nMortensson-Egnund dedicated his life to the reconstruction of the Norwegian written language, working to free it from the Danish chancery language. Around the turn of the century he became a strong opponent of the riksm\u00e5l  supporter [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]].\n\nIn the 1870s, he was a friend and acquaintance of Moltke Moe, and through him met [[Arne Garborg]]. In 1877 when Garborg started the magazine \"Fedraheimen\"  Mortensson became an employee. It was also Ivar who helped [[Hulda Garborg|Hulda]] and Arne Garborg locate & rent a small cabin on the small farm \"Kolbotnen\", near the lake [[Savalen]] in [[Alvdal]] in 1887. When Garborg moved there, Mortensson followed. At this time these friends had little money and Garborg styled Mortenssonn as \u201cIvar Matlaus\u201d (Ivar Foodless).\n\nMortensson-Egnund was also a poet, and in 1889 he published \"Paa ymse gjerdom\", followed by \"Or duldo\" in 1895. Later, he was best known for his setting the [[Draumkvedet]] (1905) and the [[Poetic Edda]] (1908) into modern Norwegian.<ref name=V>{{cite web|title= Den eldre Edda i Ivar Mortensson-Egnund si gjendikting|publisher= |location= |last=  |first=   |year= |url= http://www.heimskringla.no/norsk/edda/index.php|language=Norwegian |accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nIvar Mortensson-Egnund is often mentioned as a sponsor of and influence on [[Olav Aukrust]]. After Aukrust had finished his three years of teacher\u2019s education in [[Elverum]] in 1906 and moved to [[Folldal]] as a teacher, where he lived at Einabu the two years he was there. [[Helge Groth]] wrote \"Of all the Norwegian poets and authors, none more directly influenced Olav Aukrust than Ivar Mortensson-Egnund.\"\n\nMortensson-Egnund had built a poet\u2019s retreat on the top of the ridge in the direction of Egnund chapel, sitting on the ridge of an [[esker]]&mdash;a trace from the last ice age. Mortensson-Egnund worked there in the daytime during the summer, but used his farm Einabu for meals and lodging.\n\nHe lived at the Einabu farm with the poet\u2019s retreat up along Norwegian Highway 29, near the Einunna river bridge, for much of his life. The main building from the 1870s stands still as it did in his time. Along the road there is a bust of Ivar Mortensson-Egnund carved by Trygve Dammen bust; it was unveiled on the 100-anniversary of his birth in 1957. The North \u00d8sterdal museum includes a display covering his history.\n\n==Revolutionary==\n[[File:Fedraheimen.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[Fedraheimen]]'', June 28. 1884.]]\n[[File:Fedraheimstua-2010-07-14.jpg|thumb|upright|From 1888 on Fedraheimen was edited from this [[log cabin]], now in [[Tynset]] Bygdemuseum.]]\n\nMortensson-Egnund was a powerful and intense revolutionary. He was arrested in 1881 when he led a rebellion in [[Skien]] in support of [[Johan Sverdrup]],<ref>Sverdrup tried from his earliest days in the Storting to form a radical party consisting of the large group of peasants and the radical elements among the representatives from the cities</ref> parliamentary reform and Nynorsk.

Under Mortensson leadership the newspaper embraced the war against \"the moneyed, ministers of state and imperialism\". Mortensson called the magazine a \"communist-anarchist organ for the country\" and published extensive material from the international anarchist movement.<ref name=X>{{cite web|title= Artiklar fr\u00e5 Fedraheimen av Ivar Mortensson-Egnund lagde ut p\u00e5|publisher= |location= |last=  |first=   |year=2007 |url= http://www.fedraheimen.no |language=Norwegian |accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888 Mortensson supported Garborg as Storting representative for [[Hedmark]]; the campaign was unsuccessful. The following year he held a 17 May independence celebration in [[Tynset]], where he argued against cowardliness of the [[List of members of the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly|members of the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly]], but praised the [[French Revolution]]. He concluded by singing [[La Marseillaise]] for shocked farmers. He and Garborg resigned from the Liberals and formed a workers party for [[Tynset]] and [[R\u00f8ros]].\n\n''Fedraheimen'' ceased publication in 1891, two years after Mortensson-Egnund resigned as editor; his successor was Rasmus Steinsvik.\n\nMortensson-Egnund published the anarchist magazine ''Fridom'' (freedom) from 1896 to 1899,<ref name=A/> and corresponded with the well-known Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin|Pjotr Kropotkin]], whose concept of voluntary cooperation influenced him greatly. At this time Mortensson-Egnund developed a theory that the Norwegian farmers in prehistoric times had lived in anarchic groups that he called ''samn\u00f8yter''.\n\n==Priest==\nIn 1909 Mortensson-Egnund was diocese curate in Hamar, and he was ordained as a priest in Norway the following year. Beginning in 1919 he was involved in translating the Bible into [[landsm\u00e5l]]. He received a Government stipend from 1929 forward.\n\nMortensson-Egnund\u2019s friend Garborg had an interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and another of his closest friends, [[Marta Steinsvik]], joined [[Rudolf Steiner]]\u2019s [[Anthroposophy]] movement. After Steiner in 1913, broke out of the [[Theosophical Society]] and founded the [[Goetheanum|Anthroposophical Society]], Mortensson-Egnund and his wife Karen were among Steiner's followers in Norwegian ''Vidar'' group. In 1915, when ''Vidar'' was the first magazine for Anthroposophy published in Norway, it opened with an article by Mortensson-Egnund that drew relationships with the mythological ''[[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]]''.<ref name=Z>{{cite web|title= Biographien Ivar Mortensson-Egnund|publisher= |location= |last=  |first=   |year=2007 |url= http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&id=|language=German\n|accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n[[File:\"Varg i Veum\" p\u00e5 Det norske teater, 1915 (23540245359).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|1915 performance of the play ''Varg i Veum'' (1901) in Oslo]]\n*''Lesebok i det Norske folkemaalet'' together with A.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]].

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.
