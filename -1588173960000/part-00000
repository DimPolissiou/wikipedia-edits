Many languages also provide [[short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit]] control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.\n\nLogical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where <code>0</code> corresponds to false and <code>1</code> to true:\n\n* <code>0 AND 0</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0</code>,\n* <code>0 AND 1</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0</code>,\n* <code>1 AND 0</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0</code>,\n* <code>1 AND 1</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>1</code>.\n\nThe operation can also be applied to two binary [[words]] viewed as [[bitstring]]s of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:\n\n* <code>11000110 AND 10100011</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>10000010</code>.\n\nThis can be used to select part of a bitstring using a [[Mask (computing)|bit mask]].  For example, <code>1001'''1'''101 AND 0000'''1'''000</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0000'''1'''000</code> extracts the fifth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.\n\nIn [[computer networking]], bit masks are used to derive the network address of a [[subnetwork|subnet]] within an existing network from a given [[IP address]], by ANDing the IP address and the [[subnetwork#Binary subnet masks|subnet mask]].\n\nLogical conjunction \"<code>AND</code>\" is also used in [[SQL]] operations to form [[database]] queries.\n\nThe [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]] relates logical conjunction to [[product type]]s.\n\n==Set-theoretic correspondence==\nThe  membership of an element of an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection set]] in [[set theory]] is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: ''x'' \u2208 ''A'' \u2229 ''B'' if and only if (''x'' \u2208 ''A'') \u2227 (''x'' \u2208 ''B''). Through this correspondence, set-theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction, such as [[associativity]], [[commutativity]], and [[idempotence]].\n\n==Natural language==\nAs with other notions formalized in [[mathematical logic]], the logical conjunction ''and'' is related to, but not the same as, the [[grammatical conjunction]] ''and'' in natural languages.\n\nEnglish \"and\" has properties not captured by logical conjunction.  For example, \"and\" sometimes implies order having the sense of \"then\".  For example, \"They got married and had a child\" in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.\n\nThe word \"and\" can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as \"The American flag is red, white, and blue.\"   Here it is not meant that the flag is ''at once'' red, white, and blue, but rather that it has a part of each color.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[And-inverter graph]]\n* [[AND gate]]\n* [[Bitwise AND]]\n* [[Boolean algebra (logic)]]\n* [[Boolean algebra topics]]\n* [[Boolean conjunctive query]]\n* [[Boolean domain]]\n* [[Boolean function]]\n* [[Boolean-valued function]]\n* [[Conjunction elimination]]\n* [[De Morgan's laws]]\n* [[First-order logic]]\n* [[Fr\u00e9chet inequalities]]\n* [[Grammatical conjunction]]\n* [[Logical disjunction]]\n* [[Logical negation]]\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Operation (mathematics)|Operation]]\n* [[Peano\u2013Russell notation]]\n* [[Propositional calculus]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{springer|title=Conjunction|id=p/c025080}}\n*[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Conjunction.html Wolfram MathWorld: Conjunction]\n*{{cite web|url= http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Logic/And.html|title= \nProperty and truth table of AND propositions|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170506173821/http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Logic/And.html|archive-date= May 6, 2000}}\n\n{{Logical connectives}}\n\n[[Category:Logical connectives|Conjunction]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Caret {{!}} Circumflex Agent (^)|Lambda {{!}} Capital Lambda (\u039b)|Turned V {{!}} Turned V (\u039b)}}\n{{Infobox logical connective\n| title        = Logical conjunction\n| other titles = AND\n| Venn diagram = Venn0001.svg\n| definition   = <math>xy</math>\n| truth table  = <math>(0001)</math>\n| logic gate   = AND_ANSI.svg\n| DNF          = <math>xy</math>\n| CNF          = <math>xy</math>\n| Zhegalkin    = <math>xy</math>\n| 0-preserving = yes\n| 1-preserving = yes\n| monotone     = no\n| affine       = no\n| self-dual    = yes\n}}\n\n[[File:Venn 0000 0001.svg|220px|thumb|Venn diagram of <math>A \\land B \\land C</math>]]\n\nIn [[logic]], [[mathematics]] and [[linguistics]], And (\u2227) is the [[truth function|truth-functional]] operator of '''logical conjunction'''; the ''and'' of a set of operands is true if and only if ''all'' of its operands are true.

Many languages also provide [[short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit]] control structures corresponding to logical conjunction.\n\nLogical conjunction is often used for bitwise operations, where <code>0</code> corresponds to false and <code>1</code> to true:\n\n* <code>0 AND 0</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0</code>,\n* <code>0 AND 1</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0</code>,\n* <code>1 AND 0</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0</code>,\n* <code>1 AND 1</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>1</code>.\n\nThe operation can also be applied to two binary [[words]] viewed as [[bitstring]]s of equal length, by taking the bitwise AND of each pair of bits at corresponding positions. For example:\n\n* <code>11000110 AND 10100011</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>10000010</code>.\n\nThis can be used to select part of a bitstring using a [[Mask (computing)|bit mask]].  For example, <code>1001'''1'''101 AND 0000'''1'''000</code> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <code>0000'''1'''000</code> extracts the fifth bit of an 8-bit bitstring.\n\nIn [[computer networking]], bit masks are used to derive the network address of a [[subnetwork|subnet]] within an existing network from a given [[IP address]], by ANDing the IP address and the [[subnetwork#Binary subnet masks|subnet mask]].\n\nLogical conjunction \"<code>AND</code>\" is also used in [[SQL]] operations to form [[database]] queries.\n\nThe [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]] relates logical conjunction to [[product type]]s.\n\n==Set-theoretic correspondence==\nThe  membership of an element of an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection set]] in [[set theory]] is defined in terms of a logical conjunction: ''x'' \u2208 ''A'' \u2229 ''B'' if and only if (''x'' \u2208 ''A'') \u2227 (''x'' \u2208 ''B''). Through this correspondence, set-theoretic intersection shares several properties with logical conjunction, such as [[associativity]], [[commutativity]], and [[idempotence]].\n\n==Natural language==\nAs with other notions formalized in [[mathematical logic]], the logical conjunction ''and'' is related to, but not the same as, the [[grammatical conjunction]] ''and'' in natural languages.\n\nEnglish \"and\" has properties not captured by logical conjunction.  For example, \"and\" sometimes implies order having the sense of \"then\".  For example, \"They got married and had a child\" in common discourse means that the marriage came before the child.\n\nThe word \"and\" can also imply a partition of a thing into parts, as \"The American flag is red, white, and blue.\"   Here it is not meant that the flag is ''at once'' red, white, and blue, but rather that it has a part of each color.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[And-inverter graph]]\n* [[AND gate]]\n* [[Bitwise AND]]\n* [[Boolean algebra (logic)]]\n* [[Boolean algebra topics]]\n* [[Boolean conjunctive query]]\n* [[Boolean domain]]\n* [[Boolean function]]\n* [[Boolean-valued function]]\n* [[Conjunction elimination]]\n* [[De Morgan's laws]]\n* [[First-order logic]]\n* [[Fr\u00e9chet inequalities]]\n* [[Grammatical conjunction]]\n* [[Logical disjunction]]\n* [[Logical negation]]\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Operation (mathematics)|Operation]]\n* [[Peano\u2013Russell notation]]\n* [[Propositional calculus]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{springer|title=Conjunction|id=p/c025080}}\n*[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Conjunction.html Wolfram MathWorld: Conjunction]\n*{{cite web|url= http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Logic/And.html|title= \nProperty and truth table of AND propositions|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170506173821/http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Logic/And.html|archive-date= May 6, 2000}}\n\n{{Logical connectives}}\n\n[[Category:Logical connectives|Conjunction]]\n", "name_user": "DenisMoskowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add Exterior Product to distinguish block", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction"}

He was born and raised until the age of 10 in Israel, (BASTARD JEW) where his experiences with entertainment would later influence his storytelling techniques. He studied computer science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], before searching for work in the video game industry.\n\nCuckmanns's first video game work was as an intern at Naughty Dog. In 2004, he became a programmer on ''[[Jak 3]]'' and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'', before becoming game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' and ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''. He was later chosen to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on ''The Last of Us'' as creative director, a role he continued during the development of ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''. In addition, Cuckmann has also written comic books. He worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', prior to the creation of his own graphic novel ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]''. He later co-wrote ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'' with artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]], and is currently working on a sequel to ''The Last of Us'', subtitled ''[[The Last of Us Part II|Part II]]'', and a television adaptation.\n\nann has received high praise for his work on ''The Last of Us'', receiving several awards and nominations for his contributions, including two [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Awards]], two [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Awards]], and three [[Writers Guild of America Awards]]. His work on ''Uncharted 4'' was also praised and awarded.\n\n== Early life ==\nNeil Druckmann was born in [[Israel]] on December 5, 1978,<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"ETC\"/><ref name=\"Creative\"/> to Yehudit \"Judy\" and Jerry Ilan Druckmann.<ref name=\"Israel\"/><ref name=\"Ynet parents\"/> At a young age, Druckmann's older brother Emanuel showed him comic books, video games, and movies.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> These forms of entertainment, particularly video games by [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> helped Druckmann learn English.<ref name=\"ETC\"/> Druckmann became particularly interested in storytelling, and wrote his own comic books.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> He moved to the United States with his family in 1989.<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> He attended middle school and high school in [[Miami, Florida]], then studied criminology at the [[University of Florida]].<ref name=\"Creative\"/> His brother sneaked him into the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Brother E3\"/> Druckmann worked as a clerk at [[My Favorite Muffin]] and as a sales person at [[PacSun]].<ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/>\n\nDruckmann soon became a graphics research assistant at [[Florida State University]], while living in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/> He spent a year at the university working at the Visualization Lab<ref name=\"CMU work\"/> within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game ''Pink-Bullet'', for [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], with some friends.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> At one point, he wanted to be an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so.<ref name=\"Newsarama\"/> After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized that it was his preference,<ref name=\"Creative\"/> and began a [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] in December 2002, which he completed the following year.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> Druckmann moved to [[Pittsburgh]], where he attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]];<ref name=\"Creative\"/> in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology,<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> which he earned in 2005<ref name=\"Creative\"/> from the [[Entertainment Technology Center]].<ref name=\"Edge\"/> In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] as a student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/><ref name=\"Dikki Painguin 2\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAt the [[Game Developers Conference]], Druckmann met [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. After Druckmann \"bugged\" Rubin, the latter gave him his business card.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> In 2004, Druckmann joined Naughty Dog as a programming intern, before being promoted to a full-time position as a gameplay programmer a few months later.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> During the development of ''[[Jak 3]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' (2005), Druckmann continued to ask co-president Evan Wells about joining the design team. Wells restrained from moving him to the design team, as he was originally employed as a programmer, but agreed to review Druckmann's design work if he completed them after working hours. Following the development of ''Jak X'', Wells concluded that Druckmann was skilled in the field of design, and gave him the role of game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> In this position, he worked closely with [[Amy Hennig]] to construct the story of ''Uncharted'', before working on ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' (2009) as a lead game designer, becoming more involved with the core writing of the game.<ref name=\"Creative\"/><ref name=\"Edge\"/> Druckmann also worked on the original design and story of ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' (2009), prior to Naughty Dog's abandonment of the game; [[High Impact Games]] completed development.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Druckmann worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', as writer and director. A prequel to ''Drake's Fortune'', ''Eye of Indra'' tells the story of [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] prior to the events of the first game.<ref name=\"Indra\"/> Druckmann's first [[graphic novel]], ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]'', was published by Ape Entertainment in February 2010.<ref name=\"ASCAS2\"/> With illustrations by artist Joysuke Wong, the novel relates Druckmann's interest in traveling back in time to meet his wife at a younger age. \"There's something cute and poetic about that idea,\" Druckmann explained.<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> He felt that he shares many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that \"a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [his] own shortcomings\".<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> The comic was originally released on February 24, 2010;<ref name=\"ASCAS3\"/> critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.<ref name=\"ASCAS4\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of ''Uncharted 2'', Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently. With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one. He tries to ignore character [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in an attempt to write \"honestly\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself \"What is this scene really about? What's the least we have to say or do to convey that and no more?\"<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/>\n\nBefore writing a game, Druckmann and Straley create an entire outline of the story, before exploring the narrative more intricately, discussing the \"moment-to-moment beats\" of each level that lead to a bigger event. They generally begin with the middle of the story, as it is the core of the gameplay and narrative, before exploring the game's climax and character development.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> ''The Frame'' host John Horn identified a repeating theme in Druckmann's stories, including ''A Second Chance at Sarah'' and ''The Last of Us'', is the concept of characters attempting or hoping to alter their past in some way; Druckmann admitted he had not noticed this trend, though agreed with it and recognized its recurrence in an upcoming story of his.<ref name=\"DoG Time\"/><ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Influences ==\nDruckmann cites game writer [[Sam Lake]] as a large inspiration, naming himself a \"longtime fan\".<ref name=\"Sam Lake\"/> Druckmann's favorite video games include ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'' (1991), ''Ico'', and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005),<ref name=\"Reddit games\"/> and he is often inspired by character-focused comics such as ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' (1995\u20132000), and ''[[Y: The Last Man]]'' (2002\u20132008).<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann was also influenced by the character-driven storytelling in the [[adventure game]] ''[[King's Quest]]'' by [[Roberta Williams]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ken and Roberta Williams (Sierra) - The Game Awards 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JQkRp-VFXQ |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=Gamerview |accessdate=12 May 2019 |date=6 December 2014}}</ref> While writing ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann was inspired by several films, including: ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), for its ability to make audiences support the protagonist despite his immorality; ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007), due to its subtle and sparse execution, forcing audience engagement;<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013), in regards to simplicity and intensity.<ref name=\"Best Film\"/>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=\"While working on ''The Last of Us'' ...

He was born and raised until the age of 10 in Israel, where his experiences with entertainment would later influence his storytelling techniques. He studied computer science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], before searching for work in the video game industry.\n\nDruckmann's first video game work was as an intern at Naughty Dog. In 2004, he became a programmer on ''[[Jak 3]]'' and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'', before becoming game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' and ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''. He was later chosen to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on ''The Last of Us'' as creative director, a role he continued during the development of ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''. In addition, Druckmann has also written comic books. He worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', prior to the creation of his own graphic novel ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]''. He later co-wrote ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'' with artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]], and is currently working on a sequel to ''The Last of Us'', subtitled ''[[The Last of Us Part II|Part II]]'', and a television adaptation.\n\nDruckmann has received high praise for his work on ''The Last of Us'', receiving several awards and nominations for his contributions, including two [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Awards]], two [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Awards]], and three [[Writers Guild of America Awards]]. His work on ''Uncharted 4'' was also praised and awarded.\n\n== Early life ==\nNeil Druckmann was born in [[Israel]] on December 5, 1978,<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"ETC\"/><ref name=\"Creative\"/> to Yehudit \"Judy\" and Jerry Ilan Druckmann.<ref name=\"Israel\"/><ref name=\"Ynet parents\"/> At a young age, Druckmann's older brother Emanuel showed him comic books, video games, and movies.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> These forms of entertainment, particularly video games by [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> helped Druckmann learn English.<ref name=\"ETC\"/> Druckmann became particularly interested in storytelling, and wrote his own comic books.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> He moved to the United States with his family in 1989.<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> He attended middle school and high school in [[Miami, Florida]], then studied criminology at the [[University of Florida]].<ref name=\"Creative\"/> His brother sneaked him into the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Brother E3\"/> Druckmann worked as a clerk at [[My Favorite Muffin]] and as a sales person at [[PacSun]].<ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/>\n\nDruckmann soon became a graphics research assistant at [[Florida State University]], while living in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/> He spent a year at the university working at the Visualization Lab<ref name=\"CMU work\"/> within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game ''Pink-Bullet'', for [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], with some friends.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> At one point, he wanted to be an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so.<ref name=\"Newsarama\"/> After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized that it was his preference,<ref name=\"Creative\"/> and began a [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] in December 2002, which he completed the following year.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> Druckmann moved to [[Pittsburgh]], where he attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]];<ref name=\"Creative\"/> in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology,<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> which he earned in 2005<ref name=\"Creative\"/> from the [[Entertainment Technology Center]].<ref name=\"Edge\"/> In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] as a student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/><ref name=\"Dikki Painguin 2\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAt the [[Game Developers Conference]], Druckmann met [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. After Druckmann \"bugged\" Rubin, the latter gave him his business card.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> In 2004, Druckmann joined Naughty Dog as a programming intern, before being promoted to a full-time position as a gameplay programmer a few months later.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> During the development of ''[[Jak 3]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' (2005), Druckmann continued to ask co-president Evan Wells about joining the design team. Wells restrained from moving him to the design team, as he was originally employed as a programmer, but agreed to review Druckmann's design work if he completed them after working hours. Following the development of ''Jak X'', Wells concluded that Druckmann was skilled in the field of design, and gave him the role of game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> In this position, he worked closely with [[Amy Hennig]] to construct the story of ''Uncharted'', before working on ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' (2009) as a lead game designer, becoming more involved with the core writing of the game.<ref name=\"Creative\"/><ref name=\"Edge\"/> Druckmann also worked on the original design and story of ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' (2009), prior to Naughty Dog's abandonment of the game; [[High Impact Games]] completed development.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Druckmann worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', as writer and director. A prequel to ''Drake's Fortune'', ''Eye of Indra'' tells the story of [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] prior to the events of the first game.<ref name=\"Indra\"/> Druckmann's first [[graphic novel]], ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]'', was published by Ape Entertainment in February 2010.<ref name=\"ASCAS2\"/> With illustrations by artist Joysuke Wong, the novel relates Druckmann's interest in traveling back in time to meet his wife at a younger age. \"There's something cute and poetic about that idea,\" Druckmann explained.<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> He felt that he shares many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that \"a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [his] own shortcomings\".<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> The comic was originally released on February 24, 2010;<ref name=\"ASCAS3\"/> critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.<ref name=\"ASCAS4\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of ''Uncharted 2'', Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently. With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one.

The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first \"network\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.\n\nAbout this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.\n\nIn 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s surprising victory over New York governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The television audience was small, but NBC's share in New York was double that of any other outlet.<ref>[http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ \"New York City Hooper Ratings for Election Night 1948\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302083754/http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ |date=March 2, 2009 }} TVObscurities.com.</ref> The following year, the ''[[Camel News Caravan]]'', anchored by [[John Cameron Swayze]], debuted on NBC.

The loss of Huntley, along with a reluctance by RCA to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS was funding its news division, left NBC News in the doldrums.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012.

The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first \"network\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.\n\nAbout this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.\n\nIn 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012. NBC News share facilities and crew in the UK with [[ITN]], who is the news provider for ITV.\n\n==Theme music==\nMost of NBC's news television programs use \"[[The Mission (theme song)|The Mission]]\" by [[John Williams]] as their theme. The composition was first used by NBC in 1985 and was updated in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|author=Submitted by NBC Universal|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|title=SoundtrackNet: News: Legendary Composer John Williams Composes New \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" Theme|publisher=[[Soundtrack.net]]|date=August 30, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021032305/http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|archivedate=October 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{White House James S.
