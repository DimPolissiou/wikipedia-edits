Around five km to the east is the small village of [[Ngawha Springs]], where hot water springs rise to the surface from the [[Ngawha geothermal field]], and where the [[Northland Region Corrections Facility]] is situated.\n\nThere are several volcanic [[scoria cones]] in the area, which are part of the [[Kaikohe-Bay of Islands volcanic field]].\n\n==History and culture==\n\n===Early history===\nOriginally a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] village called ''Opango'', Kaikohe is recognised as being the very heart of the culture of the great [[Ng\u0101puhi]] [[iwi]]. In the early 19th century a rival M\u0101ori tribe raided the village and fugitives subsisted among the [[Kohekohe]] (a native tree) groves on Tokareireia (Kaikohe Hill). After the incident, the village became known as ''Kaikohekohe'' ([[M\u0101ori cuisine|kai]] meaning food) but was later shortened to Kaikohe.\n\nBattles during the [[Flagstaff War]] (also known as 'H\u014dne Heke's Rebellion') were fought around Kaikohe:  at [[H\u014dne Heke]]'s P\u0101 at Puketutu on the shores of [[Lake Omapere]];   followed by a battle at [[Te Ahuahu]]; with the warriors of [[Te Ruki Kawiti]]  fighting the  [[Battle of Ohaeawai]].  St. Michael's Anglican Church in nearby [[Ngawha Springs]] was built on the site of the p\u0101 at which the battle took place. The warrior chief [[H\u014dne Heke]] settled in Kaikohe after fighting ceased, and died there in 1850.<ref name=\"June1851\">{{cite web |first   =| last = |title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, June 1851|work= Heke|accessdate=18 October 2015 |url= http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Gleaner_1850-1851_15/1| publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> His grand-nephew Hone Heke Ngapua, [[New Zealand Parliament|MP]] for [[Northern Maori]], also lived in Kaikohe. In April 1911, a monument to him was unveiled on Kaikohe Hill by Sir [[James Carroll (New Zealand politician)|James Carroll]], acting [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]]. A park in the town is dedicated to [[Rawiri Taiwhanga]] who has a very strong claim to being New Zealand's first commercial [[Dairy farming|dairy farmer]]. He milked a herd of cows and sold [[butter]]  in 1834. \n\n[[File:Aperahama Church Kaikohe.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Aperahama Church named after Aperahama Te Awa who is buried in the churchyard]]\nTo the west of the town is the Aperahama Anglican Church, named after Aperahama Te Awa. It was opened in 1885, a year after his death, and he is buried in the churchyard. It is on the site of an earlier church, built in 1837, and the existing memorial gates were erected and dedicated for that earlier church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaikohe.co.nz/The_Early_Church.cfm|title=Early Church History in Kaikohe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://don-donovan.blogspot.com/2009/07/country-churches-of-nz-10-aperahama.html|title= Aperahama, Kaikohe, Northland|publisher=Don Donovan}}</ref> The building is registered as a place ''\".... of special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value....\"'' by [[Heritage New Zealand]].\n\nAlso in the town is a Pioneer Village, a 19th-century Northland community recreated with all its colourful atmosphere, history and detail.\n\n===Railway links===\nKaikohe was linked to the [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]] with the arrival of a [[branch line]] [[railway]] being built from [[Otiria]] on the [[North Auckland Line]] to [[Kaitaia]], which opened to Kaikohe on 1 May 1914. The line continued north to [[\u014ckaihau]], opening on 29 October 1923 and eventually reached [[Rangiahua]], although the section between Okaihau and Rangiahua was never handed over to the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] for operation and the line never reached Kaitaia. The line between Okaihau and Rangiahua was operated for a short time by the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]] before being closed and dismantled during World War II.  The railway through Kaikohe thus became known as the [[Okaihau Branch]].\n\nAlthough Kaikohe became the service centre of the Far North, it failed to generate much rail traffic in the early years of the line.  During the first ten months of existence, just 1,500 tons of inbound freight was carried, with roughly half that carried outbound, and the decline continued to the point where in 1918 Kaikohe lost its stationmaster.  Minimal services were offered, and although losses increased up to 1930, fortunes had somewhat improved by 1940, and by 1950 there was sufficient traffic to justify six trains each way a week.  Two carried only freight, while four were [[mixed train|mixed goods/passenger trains]].  At that time, a full complement of staff was again employed at Kaikohe.\n\nWhen [[railcar]]s were introduced on services north of [[Auckland]] in November 1956, they ran through Kaikohe all the way to Okaihau.  Previously, a carriage train known as the [[Northland Express]] had run from Auckland to Opua with connections to Kaikohe and Okaihau via the mixed trains, but with the change of the northern terminus to Okaihau, the branch increased in importance.  This proved to be short-lived; in July 1967 the very popular railcar service was withdrawn due to mechanical problems plaguing the railcars.  Passengers had to use the mixed trains, with significantly older rolling stock on a slower schedule. Demand decreased and the branch closed to passengers on 21 June 1976.\n\nIn 1977, a relaxation of road transport laws led to a decline in freight traffic on the line and forestry proposals that would have required a railway service failed to eventuate.

Around five km to the east is the small village of [[Ngawha Springs]], where hot water springs rise to the surface from the [[Ngawha geothermal field]], and where the [[Northland Region Corrections Facility]] is situated.\n\nThere are several volcanic [[scoria cones]] in the area, which are part of the [[Kaikohe-Bay of Islands volcanic field]].\n\n==History and culture==\n\n===Early history===\nOriginally a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] village called ''Opango'', Kaikohe is recognised as being the very heart of the culture of the great [[Ng\u0101puhi]] [[iwi]]. In the early 19th century a rival M\u0101ori tribe raided the village and fugitives subsisted among the [[Kohekohe]] (a native tree) groves on Tokareireia (Kaikohe Hill). After the incident, the village became known as ''Kaikohekohe'' ([[M\u0101ori cuisine|kai]] meaning food) but was later shortened to Kaikohe.\n\nBattles during the [[Flagstaff War]] (also known as 'H\u014dne Heke's Rebellion') were fought around Kaikohe:  at [[H\u014dne Heke]]'s P\u0101 at Puketutu on the shores of [[Lake Omapere]];   followed by a battle at [[Te Ahuahu]]; with the warriors of [[Te Ruki Kawiti]]  fighting the  [[Battle of Ohaeawai]].  St. Michael's Anglican Church in nearby [[Ngawha Springs]] was built on the site of the p\u0101 at which the battle took place. The warrior chief [[H\u014dne Heke]] settled in Kaikohe after fighting ceased, and died there in 1850.<ref name=\"June1851\">{{cite web |first   =| last = |title= The Church Missionary Gleaner, June 1851|work= Heke|accessdate=18 October 2015 |url= http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Gleaner_1850-1851_15/1| publisher = [[Adam Matthew Digital]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> His grand-nephew Hone Heke Ngapua, [[New Zealand Parliament|MP]] for [[Northern Maori]], also lived in Kaikohe. In April 1911, a monument to him was unveiled on Kaikohe Hill by Sir [[James Carroll (New Zealand politician)|James Carroll]], acting [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]]. A park in the town is dedicated to [[Rawiri Taiwhanga]] who has a very strong claim to being New Zealand's first commercial [[Dairy farming|dairy farmer]]. He milked a herd of cows and sold [[butter]]  in 1834. \n\n[[File:Aperahama Church Kaikohe.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Aperahama Church named after Aperahama Te Awa who is buried in the churchyard]]\nTo the west of the town is the Aperahama Anglican Church, named after Aperahama Te Awa. It was opened in 1885, a year after his death, and he is buried in the churchyard. It is on the site of an earlier church, built in 1837, and the existing memorial gates were erected and dedicated for that earlier church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaikohe.co.nz/The_Early_Church.cfm|title=Early Church History in Kaikohe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://don-donovan.blogspot.com/2009/07/country-churches-of-nz-10-aperahama.html|title= Aperahama, Kaikohe, Northland|publisher=Don Donovan}}</ref> The building is registered as a place ''\".... of special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value....\"'' by [[Heritage New Zealand]].\n\nAlso in the town is a Pioneer Village, a 19th-century Northland community recreated with all its colourful atmosphere, history and detail.\n\n===Railway links===\nKaikohe was linked to the [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]] with the arrival of a [[branch line]] [[railway]] being built from [[Otiria]] on the [[North Auckland Line]] to [[Kaitaia]], which opened to Kaikohe on 1 May 1914. The line continued north to [[\u014ckaihau]], opening on 29 October 1923 and eventually reached [[Rangiahua]], although the section between Okaihau and Rangiahua was never handed over to the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] for operation and the line never reached Kaitaia. The line between Okaihau and Rangiahua was operated for a short time by the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]] before being closed and dismantled during World War II.  The railway through Kaikohe thus became known as the [[Okaihau Branch]].\n\nAlthough Kaikohe became the service centre of the Far North, it failed to generate much rail traffic in the early years of the line.  During the first ten months of existence, just 1,500 tons of inbound freight was carried, with roughly half that carried outbound, and the decline continued to the point where in 1918 Kaikohe lost its stationmaster.  Minimal services were offered, and although losses increased up to 1930, fortunes had somewhat improved by 1940, and by 1950 there was sufficient traffic to justify six trains each way a week.  Two carried only freight, while four were [[mixed train|mixed goods/passenger trains]].  At that time, a full complement of staff was again employed at Kaikohe.\n\nWhen [[railcar]]s were introduced on services north of [[Auckland]] in November 1956, they ran through Kaikohe all the way to Okaihau.  Previously, a carriage train known as the [[Northland Express]] had run from Auckland to Opua with connections to Kaikohe and Okaihau via the mixed trains, but with the change of the northern terminus to Okaihau, the branch increased in importance.  This proved to be short-lived; in July 1967 the very popular railcar service was withdrawn due to mechanical problems plaguing the railcars.  Passengers had to use the mixed trains, with significantly older rolling stock on a slower schedule. Demand decreased and the branch closed to passengers on 21 June 1976.\n\nIn 1977, a relaxation of road transport laws led to a decline in freight traffic on the line and forestry proposals that would have required a railway service failed to eventuate.  Scheduled trains were cancelled beyond Kaikohe on 12 August 1983, and for a little over four years the line was shunted when required.  The branch closed on 1 November 1987 and the track has been lifted. The rail corridor through Kaikohe is still owned by the [[New Zealand Railways Corporation]], being retained in case any forestry proposals come to fruition and the railway is again required, although it now forms part of the Twin Coast Cycle Trail.\n\n===Marae===\n\nThe Kaikohe area has three [[Ng\u0101puhi]] [[marae]]:\n\n* [[Te Kiore Marae]] and [[Te Kiore]] meeting house are affiliated with [[Ng\u0101ti Whakaminenga]].\n* [[Te Iringa Marae|Te Iringa or Parihaka Marae]] and its [[Parihaka (whare)|Parihaka]] meeting house are affiliated with [[Ng\u0101ti Hinemutu]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Tautahi]].\n* [[\u014ckorihi|\u014ckorihi Marae]] is affiliated with [[Ng\u0101ti Hinemutu]], [[Ng\u0101ti Tautahi]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Ueoneone]]; its meeting house burned down in 2003.<ref name=\"tkmentry\">{{cite web|title=Te K\u0101hui M\u0101ngai directory|url= http://www.tkm.govt.nz/ |website=tkm.govt.nz|publisher=[[Te Puni K\u014dkiri]]}}</ref><ref name=\"maorimaps\">{{cite web |title=M\u0101ori Maps |url=https://maorimaps.com/map |website=maorimaps.com |publisher=Te Potiki National Trust}}</ref><ref name=\"tkmentry\" /><ref name=\"maorimaps\" />\n\n==Attractions==\nKaikohe is the geographical centre of the Far North.

It was renamed Kagera after the Uganda-Tanzania War, when Idi Amin attempted to annexe it in 1978. The region takes its name from the Kagera River, which flows from Rwanda through northern Tanzania before it enters Lake Victoria, to emerge as the [[Nile]], the longest river in the world.\n\n==Cultural history==\n\nFor a period of about five centuries, Kagera was home to nine different kingdoms with highly [[hierarchical]] societies. Before European colonialism, coffee was a traditional crop in the area, used for its stimulant properties and in local cultural rituals. During colonial times, coffee was transformed into a cash crop. Bananas were a [[staple food]] in the region. Although there was a gender-based division of labour in the traditional Bahaya society, women of the time were not thought to be inferior to men. In fact women commanded special respect in all traditional rituals. For example, upon the death of a head of a family (Nyin'enju), during the following inheritance rituals the \"Main Inheritor\" (Omusika) had to have a female counterpart selected from among his sisters to share his authority. Similarly, upon the death of a reigning king, during the crowning of the next king, there had to be a \"sister to the nation\" (''Kinyany'engoma'') who was also selected from among his sisters.\n\nThe kings lived in elaborate palaces and were respected as the direct link to gods of their kingdoms. The authority of the nine kingdoms (Kihanja, Karagwe, Kiziba, Misenye, Bugabo, Kyamtwara, Ihangiro, Bukara and Biharamulo) was diminished when [[Germany|Germans]] [[German East Africa|colonised Tanzania]] in 1885 and supported the [[Haya people|Haya]], the ethnic group of Bukoba and Muleba Districts over the other districts. However the local kings held on to power. The demise of these kingdoms came after Tanzania gained its independence and [[President of Tanzania|president]] [[Julius Nyerere|Nyerere]] considered them detrimental to national unity.\n\nThere was a chief called Omukama (the word meant a king or chief) who could be born with that authority. Some prominent chiefs in Kagera include Kyamukuma, who is a last{{clarify|date=December 2019}} chief in Misenye (currently [[Missenyi District]]).<ref>Seth, Niyikiza [The new Haya Transformation, The legacy of Babumbilo (2014)]</ref> Other chiefs include Rumanyika of Karagwe, Ruhinda, Kahigi and other inferior chiefs. Kahigi is among the chiefs who waived their territories by colloborating with German colonialists.\n\nCultural tours are available for tourists visiting Kagera and can be accessed from the region's capital of [[Bukoba]]. These tours include visits to the region's national parks/nature reserves etc.\n\nDuring German rule Dr. M. Zupitza, then serving as the local medical officer, encountered the plague outbreak in Kiziba (1897\u20131898). In cooperation with Dr. [[Robert Koch]], he confirmed that the cause was the same bacteria as the outbreak in [[Bombay]].\n\nWhen authority was transferred to the British who supplanted the Germans, Kagera was open to [[Lutheran]] [[missionary]] activity. Other Christian denominations including the [[Roman Catholic]] church later arrived. Their legacy is seen in the many churches in the region.\n\n==Wildlife and national parks==\n\nThe Kagera region has abundant wildlife, including baboons and other types of monkeys.\n\nKagera is home to [[Biharamulo Game Reserve|Biharamulo]], [[Burigi Game Reserve|Burigi]], [[Ibanda Game Reserve|Ibanda]] and [[Rumanyika]] and [[Orugundu]] [[Game reserve]]s, a [[National Park]] situated on [[Rubondo Island]] and a wildlife sanctuary based on Saa Nane Island. [[Akagera National Park]] is located near the region, in Rwanda.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links | wikt=no | b=no | n=no | q=no | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no | mw=no | display=Kagera}}\n\n* [http://www.tanzania.go.tz/regions/kagera/index.html United Republic of Tanzania: Kagera Region]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031215151044/http://www.tanzania.go.tz/census/census/kagera.htm Kagera Region Homepage for the 2002 Tanzania National Census]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061003123910/http://www.tanzania.go.tz/govdirf.html Tanzanian Government Directory Database]\n\n{{Regions of Tanzania}}\n{{Districts of Kagera}}\n\n[[Category:Kagera Region| ]]\n[[Category:Regions of Tanzania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Kagera\n| native_name             = {{small|{{native phrase|sw|Mkoa wa Kagera}}}}\n| settlement_type         = [[Regions of Tanzania|Region]]\n| image_skyline           = Bugene Bananen.jpg\n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = Karagwe District  \n| image_map               = Tanzania Kagera location map.svg \n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = Location in Tanzania\n| coordinates             = {{coord|1|55|S|31|18|E|display=inline, title}}\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = [[Tanzania]]\n| subdivision_type1       = Zone\n| subdivision_name1       = Lake\n| established_title       =  \n| established_date        =  \n| seat_type               = Capital\n| seat                    = [[Bukoba]]\n| leader_party            = \n| leader_title            = Regional Commissioner\n| leader_name             = F.

Remains of [[architrave]]s, carved stones and door frames littered the hill.<ref name=\"Taylor1967\"/>\n\nThe lower temple had only one section of upright door frame, again with blocks of pediment, architrave and [[cornice]] lying scattered about the landscape of the [[Anti-Lebanon]]. There is a relief carved into a rock approximately {{convert|100|m|ft}} east of the temple with the figure of a Roman [[goddess]] (probably Venus). The figure is barely recognisable and had been mostly destroyed with only the lower half remaining distinguishable<ref name=\"Taylor1967\"/>: indeed to the northeast of the lower temple there it is a rock-cut relief of Venus, called \"Bint El Malik\" or the king's daughter by the local people. \n\nThere it is also a Roman sanctuary probably dedicated to the god Mercury; the area also has ancient quarries and shaft tombs from the Roman period<ref>[https://books.openedition.org/ifpo/1456#tocfrom1n14 Roman temples in the Bekaa Valley: Kafr Zabad]</ref>. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Lebanon|History|Asia}}\n* [[Temples of the Beqaa Valley]]\n* [[Temnin el-Foka]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.localiban.org/article3974.html Kfar Zabad], Localiban\n\n{{coord|33.7855|N|35.9932|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n{{Zahle District}}\n{{Archaeological sites in Lebanon}}\n{{Roman Archaeological sites in Beirut & Lebanon}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Zahl\u00e9 District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Ancient Roman temples]]\n[[Category:Roman sites in Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Lebanon]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Zabad"}
