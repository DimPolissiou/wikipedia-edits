{"title_page": "Homeric Question", "text_new": "{{short description|doubts and debate about the identity of Homer and the authorship of the Iliad and Odyssey}}\n<!--this article has used the BC/AD convention since its inception, 15 December 2005-->\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 061.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''Homer'' (1663)]]\n\nThe '''Homeric Question''' concerns the doubts and consequent debate over the identity of [[Homer]], the authorship of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', and their [[Historicity of the Iliad|historicity (especially concerning the ''Iliad'')]]. The subject has its roots in [[classical antiquity]] and the [[scholarship]] of the [[Hellenistic period]], but has flourished among [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholars]] of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe main subtopics of the Homeric Question are:\n\n*\"Who is Homer?\"<ref>Kahane, p. 1.</ref>\n*\"Are the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' of multiple or single authorship?\"<ref>Jensen, p. 10. This question has attracted luminaries from all walks of life, including [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who amused himself in spare time by inditing a tome in dilation of the view that Homer was one man, solely and individually responsible for both the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey''.</ref>\n*\"By whom, when, where, and under what circumstances were the poems composed?\"<ref>Fowler, p. 23.</ref>\n\nTo these questions the possibilities of modern [[textual criticism]] and archaeological answers have added a few more:\n\n*\"How reliable is the tradition embodied in the Homeric poems?\"<ref>Luce, p. 15.</ref>\n*\"How old are the oldest elements in Homeric poetry which can be dated with certainty?\"<ref>Nilsson, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==Oral tradition==\n{{Trojan War}}\nFollowing the seminal work of [[Milman Parry]], most classicists agree that, whether or not there was ever such a composer as Homer, the poems attributed to him are to some degree dependent on oral tradition, a generations-old technique that was the collective inheritance of many singer-poets (or {{lang|grc|[[Aoidos|\u1f00\u03bf\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03af]]}}, ''aoidoi''). An analysis of the structure and vocabulary of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' shows that the poems contain many regular and repeated phrases; indeed, even entire verses are repeated. Thus according to the theory, the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' may have been products of [[oral-formulaic composition]], composed on the spot by the poet using a collection of memorized traditional verses and phrases. [[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have pointed out that such elaborate oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of [[epic poetry]] in an exclusively [[orality|oral culture]]. The crucial words here are \"oral\" and \"traditional\". Parry starts with the former: the repetitive chunks of language, he says, were inherited by the singer-poet from his predecessors, and were useful to him in composition. Parry calls these chunks of repetitive language \"formulas\".<ref>Gibson: ''Milman Parry''.</ref>\n\nMany scholars agree that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' underwent a process of standardization and refinement out of older material, beginning in the 8th century BC.<ref name=EB1911/> This process, often referred to as the \"million little pieces\" design, seems to acknowledge the spirit of oral tradition. As [[Albert Lord]] notes in his book ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', poets within an oral tradition, as was Homer, tend to create and modify their tales as they perform them. Although this suggests that Homer may simply have \"borrowed\" from other bards, he almost certainly made the piece his own when he performed it.<ref>Lord: ''The Singer of Tales''.</ref>\n\nThe 1960 publication of Lord's book, which focused on the problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''Iliad'', the ''Odyssey'' and even ''[[Beowulf]]'' influenced nearly all subsequent work on Homer and oral-formulaic composition. In response to his landmark effort, [[Geoffrey Kirk]] published a book entitled ''The Songs of Homer'', in which he questions Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of [[Serbian epic poetry]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. He holds that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their \"metrical strictness\", \"formular system[s]\" and [[creativity]]. Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to achieve the same end than the Serbian poet, who was merely \"reproductive\".<ref>Kirk, pp. 88-91.</ref><ref>Foley, p. 35.</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards, [[Eric A. Havelock]]'s 1963 book ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition but that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.<ref>Foley, p. 36.</ref> In his 1966 work ''Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?'', Adam Parry theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet up to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually form nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story; in fact, Parry altogether discounted the Serbian tradition to an \"unfortunate\" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.<ref>Foley, pp. 36, 505.</ref><ref>Parry, pp. 177-216.</ref> Lord reacted to Kirk and Parry's respective contentions with ''Homer as Oral Poet'', published in 1968, which reaffirmed his belief in the relevance of Serbian epic poetry and its similarities to Homer, and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.<ref>Foley, pp. 40, 406.</ref>\n\nIn further support of the theory that Homer is really the name of a series of oral-formulas, or equivalent to \"the Bard\" as applied to Shakespeare, the Greek name ''Hom\u0113ros'' is etymologically noteworthy. It is identical to the Greek word for \"hostage\". It has been hypothesized that his name was back-extracted from the name of a society of poets called the [[Homeridae]], which literally means \"sons of hostages\", i.e., descendants of [[prisoners of war]]. As these men were not sent to war because their loyalty on the battlefield was suspect, they would not be killed in conflicts, so they were entrusted with remembering the area's stock of epic poetry, to remember past events, from the time before literacy came to the area.<ref>Harris: ''Homer the Hostage''.</ref>\n\nIn a similar vein, the word \"Homer\" may simply be a carryover from the Mediterranean seafarers' vocabulary adoption of the Semitic word base \u2019MR, which means \"say\" or \"tell\". \"Homer\" may simply be the Mediterranean version of \"saga\". It has also been suggested by [[Pseudo-Plutarch]] that the name comes from a word meaning \"to follow\" and another meaning \"blind\". Other sources connect Homer's name with [[Smyrna]] for several etymological reasons.<ref>Graziosi, pp. 79\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Time frame==\nExactly when these poems would have taken on a fixed written form is subject to debate. The traditional solution is the \"transcription hypothesis\", wherein a non-literate singer dictates the poem to a literate scribe in the 6th century BC or earlier. Sources from antiquity are unanimous in declaring that [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the tyrant of [[Athens]], first committed the poems of Homer to writing and placed them in the order in which we now read them.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Homer |volume=13 |first1=David Binning |last1=Monro |first2=Thomas William |last2=Allen |inline=1}}</ref> More radical Homerists, such as [[Gregory Nagy]], contend that a canonical text of the Homeric poems did not exist until established by [[Alexandria]]n editors in the Hellenistic period (3rd to 1st century BC).\n\nThe modern debate began with the ''Prolegomena'' of [[Friedrich August Wolf]] (1795). According to Wolf, the date of writing is among the first questions in the [[textual criticism]] of Homer. Having satisfied himself that writing was unknown to Homer, Wolf considers the real mode of transmission, which he purports to find in the [[Rhapsodists]], of whom the Homeridae were an hereditary school. Wolf reached the conclusion that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' could not have been composed in the form in which we know them without the aid of writing. They must therefore have been, as Bentley has said, a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, loose songs not collected together in the form of an epic poem until about 500 years after their original composition. This conclusion Wolf supports by the character attributed to the Cyclic poems (whose want of unity showed that the structure of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' must be the work of a later time), by one or two indications of imperfect connection, and by the doubts of ancient critics as to the authenticity of certain parts.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis view is extended by the complicating factor of the period of time now referred to as the \"[[Greek Dark Ages]]\". This period, which ranged from approximately 1250 to 750 BC, is estimated to have been immediately preceded by the historical counterpart to Homer's [[Trojan War]]. The composition of the ''Iliad'', on the other hand, is placed immediately following the Greek Dark Age period.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFurther controversy surrounds the difference in composition dates between the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey''. It seems that the latter was composed at a later date than the former because the works' differing characterizations of the Phoenicians align with differing Greek popular opinion of the Phoenicians between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, when their skills began to hurt Greek commerce. Whereas Homer's description of [[Achilles]]'s shield in the ''Iliad'' exhibits minutely detailed metalwork that characterized Phoenician crafts, they are characterized in the ''Odyssey'' as \"manifold scurvy tricksters\".<ref>Homer - Books and Biography. [[Martin Litchfield West]] in his 2010 commentary on the ''Iliad'' uses comparative evidence and the literary Shield of Achilles as one of many data that for him establish a composition date of 680-650.</ref>\n\n==Identity of Homer==\nWolf's speculations were in harmony with the ideas and sentiment of the time, and his historical arguments, especially his long array of testimonies to the work of Peisistratus, were hardly challenged. The effect of Wolf's ''Prolegomena'' was so overwhelming, and its determination so decisive, that, although a few protests were made at the time, the true Homeric controversy did not begin until after his death in 1824.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe first considerable antagonist of the Wolfian school was [[Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch]], whose writings cover the years between 1828 and 1862 and deal with every side of the controversy. In the earlier part of his ''Metetemata'' (1830), Nitzsch took up the question of written or unwritten literature, on which Wolf's entire argument turned, and showed that the art of writing must be anterior to Peisistratus. In the later part of the same series of discussions (1837), and in his chief work (''Die Sagenpoesie der Griechen'', 1852), he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems, and their relation to the other epics of the Trojan cycle.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThese epics had in the meantime been made the subject of a work which, for exhaustive learning and delicacy of artistic perception, has few rivals in the history of [[philology]]: the Epic cycle of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker]]. The confusion which previous scholars had made between the ancient post-Homeric poets (such as [[Arctinus of Miletus]] and [[Lesches]]) and the learned mythological writers (like the ''scriptor cyclicus'' of [[Horace]]) was first cleared up by Welcker. Wolf had argued that, had the cyclic writers known the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' which we possess, they would have imitated the unity of structure which distinguishes these two poems. The aim of Welcker's work was to show that the Homeric poems had influenced both the form and the substance of epic poetry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThus arose a conservative school which admitted more or less freely the absorption of preexisting lays in the formation of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'', and also the existence of considerable interpolations, but assigned the main work of formation to prehistoric times and the genius of a great poet.<ref>Caldecott, p. 1.</ref> Whether the two epics were by the same author remained an open question; the tendency of this group of scholars was towards separation. Regarding the use of writing, too, they were not unanimous. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]], for instance, maintained the view of Wolf on this point, while strenuously combating the inference which Wolf drew from it.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe ''Prolegomena'' bore on the title-page the words \"Volumen I\", but no second volume ever appeared; nor was any attempt made by Wolf himself to compose it or carry his theory further. The first important steps in that direction were taken by [[Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann]], chiefly in two dissertations, ''De interpolationibus Homeri'' ([[Leipzig]], 1832), and ''De iteratis apud Homerum'' (Leipzig, 1840), called forth by the writings of Nitzsch. As the word \"interpolation\" implies, Hermann did not maintain the hypothesis of a conflation of independent lays. Feeling the difficulty of supposing that all ancient minstrels sang of the wrath of Achilles or the return of Odysseus (leaving out even the capture of Troy itself), he was led to assume that two poems of no great compass, dealing with these two themes, became so famous at an early period as to throw other parts of the Trojan story into the background and were then enlarged by successive generations of rhapsodists. Some parts of the ''Iliad'', moreover, seemed to him to be older than the poem on the wrath of Achilles; and thus, in addition to the Homeric and post-Homeric matter, he distinguished a pre-Homeric element.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe conjectures of Hermann, in which the Wolfian theory found a modified and tentative application, were presently thrown into the shade by the inure trenchant method of [[Karl Lachmann]], who (in two papers read to the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841) sought to show that the ''Iliad'' was made up of sixteen independent lays, with various enlargements and interpolations, all finally reduced to order by Peisistratus. The first book, for instance, consists of a lay on the anger of Achilles (1\u2013347), and two continuations, the return of [[Chryseis]] (430\u2013492) and the scenes in Olympus (348\u2013429, 493\u2013611). The second book forms a second lay, but several passages, among them the speech of [[Odysseus]] (278\u2013332), are interpolated. In the third book, the scenes in which [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Priam]] take part (including the making of the truce) are pronounced to be interpolations; and so on.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nNew methods try also to elucidate the question. Combining information technologies and statistics, the [[stylometry]] allows to scan various linguistic units: words, parts of speech, and sounds. Based on the frequencies of Greek letters, a first study of Dietmar Najock<ref>Najock Dietmar, 1995, [http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/RISSHpdf/Annee1995/Articles/DNajock.pdf \"Letter Distribution and Authorship in Early Greek Epics\"], ''Revue informatique et Statistique dans les Sciences Humaines'', XXXI, 1 \u00e0 4, p. 129\u2013154.</ref> particularly shows the internal cohesion of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Taking into account the repetition of the letters, a recent study of Stephan Vonfelt<ref>Vonfelt Stephan, 2010, [http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Arch.pdf \"Arch\u00e9ologie num\u00e9rique de la po\u00e9sie grecque\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217002555/http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Arch.pdf |date=2013-12-17 }}, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse. </ref> highlights the unity of the works of Homer compared to [[Hesiod]]. The thesis of modern analysts being questioned, the debate remains open.\n\n==Current status of the Homeric Question==\nMost scholars, although disagreeing on other questions about the genesis of the poems, agree that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were not produced by the same author, based on \"the many differences of narrative manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and geographical perspective, and by the apparently imitative character of certain passages of the ''Odyssey'' in relation to the ''Iliad''.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = M.L. | year = 1999 | title = The Invention of Homer | jstor = 639863| journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 364\u2013382 | doi=10.1093/cq/49.2.364}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Homeric Question|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0605|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Latacz|first1=Joachim|last2=Bierl|first2=Anton|last3=Olson|first3=S.

An analysis of the structure and vocabulary of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' shows that the poems contain many regular and repeated phrases; indeed, even entire verses are repeated. Thus according to the theory, the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' may have been products of [[oral-formulaic composition]], composed on the spot by the poet using a collection of memorized traditional verses and phrases. [[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have pointed out that such elaborate oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of [[epic poetry]] in an exclusively [[orality|oral culture]]. The crucial words here are \"oral\" and \"traditional\". Parry starts with the former: the repetitive chunks of language, he says, were inherited by the singer-poet from his predecessors, and were useful to him in composition. Parry calls these chunks of repetitive language \"formulas\".<ref>Gibson: ''Milman Parry''.</ref>\n\nMany scholars agree that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' underwent a process of standardization and refinement out of older material, beginning in the 8th century BC.<ref name=EB1911/> This process, often referred to as the \"million little pieces\" design, seems to acknowledge the spirit of oral tradition. As [[Albert Lord]] notes in his book ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', poets within an oral tradition, as was Homer, tend to create and modify their tales as they perform them. Although this suggests that Homer may simply have \"borrowed\" from other bards, he almost certainly made the piece his own when he performed it.<ref>Lord: ''The Singer of Tales''.</ref>\n\nThe 1960 publication of Lord's book, which focused on the problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''Iliad'', the ''Odyssey'' and even ''[[Beowulf]]'' influenced nearly all subsequent work on Homer and oral-formulaic composition. In response to his landmark effort, [[Geoffrey Kirk]] published a book entitled ''The Songs of Homer'', in which he questions Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of [[Serbian epic poetry]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. He holds that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their \"metrical strictness\", \"formular system[s]\" and [[creativity]]. Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to achieve the same end than the Serbian poet, who was merely \"reproductive\".<ref>Kirk, pp. 88-91.</ref><ref>Foley, p. 35.</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards, [[Eric A. Havelock]]'s 1963 book ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition but that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.<ref>Foley, p. 36.</ref> In his 1966 work ''Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?'', Adam Parry theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet up to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually form nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story; in fact, Parry altogether discounted the Serbian tradition to an \"unfortunate\" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.<ref>Foley, pp. 36, 505.</ref><ref>Parry, pp. 177-216.</ref> Lord reacted to Kirk and Parry's respective contentions with ''Homer as Oral Poet'', published in 1968, which reaffirmed his belief in the relevance of Serbian epic poetry and its similarities to Homer, and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.<ref>Foley, pp. 40, 406.</ref>\n\nIn further support of the theory that Homer is really the name of a series of oral-formulas, or equivalent to \"the Bard\" as applied to Shakespeare, the Greek name ''Hom\u0113ros'' is etymologically noteworthy. It is identical to the Greek word for \"hostage\". It has been hypothesized that his name was back-extracted from the name of a society of poets called the [[Homeridae]], which literally means \"sons of hostages\", i.e., descendants of [[prisoners of war]]. As these men were not sent to war because their loyalty on the battlefield was suspect, they would not be killed in conflicts, so they were entrusted with remembering the area's stock of epic poetry, to remember past events, from the time before literacy came to the area.<ref>Harris: ''Homer the Hostage''.</ref>\n\nIn a similar vein, the word \"Homer\" may simply be a carryover from the Mediterranean seafarers' vocabulary adoption of the Semitic word base \u2019MR, which means \"say\" or \"tell\". \"Homer\" may simply be the Mediterranean version of \"saga\". It has also been suggested by [[Pseudo-Plutarch]] that the name comes from a word meaning \"to follow\" and another meaning \"blind\". Other sources connect Homer's name with [[Smyrna]] for several etymological reasons.<ref>Graziosi, pp. 79\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Time frame==\nExactly when these poems would have taken on a fixed written form is subject to debate. The traditional solution is the \"transcription hypothesis\", wherein a non-literate singer dictates the poem to a literate scribe in the 6th century BC or earlier. Sources from antiquity are unanimous in declaring that [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]], the tyrant of [[Athens]], first committed the poems of Homer to writing and placed them in the order in which we now read them.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Homer |volume=13 |first1=David Binning |last1=Monro |first2=Thomas William |last2=Allen |inline=1}}</ref> More radical Homerists, such as [[Gregory Nagy]], contend that a canonical text of the Homeric poems did not exist until established by [[Alexandria]]n editors in the Hellenistic period (3rd to 1st century BC).\n\nThe modern debate began with the ''Prolegomena'' of [[Friedrich August Wolf]] (1795). According to Wolf, the date of writing is among the first questions in the [[textual criticism]] of Homer. Having satisfied himself that writing was unknown to Homer, Wolf considers the real mode of transmission, which he purports to find in the [[Rhapsodists]], of whom the Homeridae were an hereditary school. Wolf reached the conclusion that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' could not have been composed in the form in which we know them without the aid of writing. They must therefore have been, as Bentley has said, a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, loose songs not collected together in the form of an epic poem until about 500 years after their original composition. This conclusion Wolf supports by the character attributed to the Cyclic poems (whose want of unity showed that the structure of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' must be the work of a later time), by one or two indications of imperfect connection, and by the doubts of ancient critics as to the authenticity of certain parts.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis view is extended by the complicating factor of the period of time now referred to as the \"[[Greek Dark Ages]]\". This period, which ranged from approximately 1250 to 750 BC, is estimated to have been immediately preceded by the historical counterpart to Homer's [[Trojan War]]. The composition of the ''Iliad'', on the other hand, is placed immediately following the Greek Dark Age period.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFurther controversy surrounds the difference in composition dates between the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey''. It seems that the latter was composed at a later date than the former because the works' differing characterizations of the Phoenicians align with differing Greek popular opinion of the Phoenicians between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, when their skills began to hurt Greek commerce. Whereas Homer's description of [[Achilles]]'s shield in the ''Iliad'' exhibits minutely detailed metalwork that characterized Phoenician crafts, they are characterized in the ''Odyssey'' as \"manifold scurvy tricksters\".<ref>Homer - Books and Biography. [[Martin Litchfield West]] in his 2010 commentary on the ''Iliad'' uses comparative evidence and the literary Shield of Achilles as one of many data that for him establish a composition date of 680-650.</ref>\n\n==Identity of Homer==\nWolf's speculations were in harmony with the ideas and sentiment of the time, and his historical arguments, especially his long array of testimonies to the work of Peisistratus, were hardly challenged. The effect of Wolf's ''Prolegomena'' was so overwhelming, and its determination so decisive, that, although a few protests were made at the time, the true Homeric controversy did not begin until after his death in 1824.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe first considerable antagonist of the Wolfian school was [[Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch]], whose writings cover the years between 1828 and 1862 and deal with every side of the controversy. In the earlier part of his ''Metetemata'' (1830), Nitzsch took up the question of written or unwritten literature, on which Wolf's entire argument turned, and showed that the art of writing must be anterior to Peisistratus. In the later part of the same series of discussions (1837), and in his chief work (''Die Sagenpoesie der Griechen'', 1852), he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems, and their relation to the other epics of the Trojan cycle.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThese epics had in the meantime been made the subject of a work which, for exhaustive learning and delicacy of artistic perception, has few rivals in the history of [[philology]]: the Epic cycle of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker]]. The confusion which previous scholars had made between the ancient post-Homeric poets (such as [[Arctinus of Miletus]] and [[Lesches]]) and the learned mythological writers (like the ''scriptor cyclicus'' of [[Horace]]) was first cleared up by Welcker. Wolf had argued that, had the cyclic writers known the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' which we possess, they would have imitated the unity of structure which distinguishes these two poems. The aim of Welcker's work was to show that the Homeric poems had influenced both the form and the substance of epic poetry.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThus arose a conservative school which admitted more or less freely the absorption of preexisting lays in the formation of the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'', and also the existence of considerable interpolations, but assigned the main work of formation to prehistoric times and the genius of a great poet.<ref>Caldecott, p. 1.</ref> Whether the two epics were by the same author remained an open question; the tendency of this group of scholars was towards separation. Regarding the use of writing, too, they were not unanimous. [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]], for instance, maintained the view of Wolf on this point, while strenuously combating the inference which Wolf drew from it.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe ''Prolegomena'' bore on the title-page the words \"Volumen I\", but no second volume ever appeared; nor was any attempt made by Wolf himself to compose it or carry his theory further. The first important steps in that direction were taken by [[Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann]], chiefly in two dissertations, ''De interpolationibus Homeri'' ([[Leipzig]], 1832), and ''De iteratis apud Homerum'' (Leipzig, 1840), called forth by the writings of Nitzsch. As the word \"interpolation\" implies, Hermann did not maintain the hypothesis of a conflation of independent lays. Feeling the difficulty of supposing that all ancient minstrels sang of the wrath of Achilles or the return of Odysseus (leaving out even the capture of Troy itself), he was led to assume that two poems of no great compass, dealing with these two themes, became so famous at an early period as to throw other parts of the Trojan story into the background and were then enlarged by successive generations of rhapsodists. Some parts of the ''Iliad'', moreover, seemed to him to be older than the poem on the wrath of Achilles; and thus, in addition to the Homeric and post-Homeric matter, he distinguished a pre-Homeric element.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe conjectures of Hermann, in which the Wolfian theory found a modified and tentative application, were presently thrown into the shade by the inure trenchant method of [[Karl Lachmann]], who (in two papers read to the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841) sought to show that the ''Iliad'' was made up of sixteen independent lays, with various enlargements and interpolations, all finally reduced to order by Peisistratus. The first book, for instance, consists of a lay on the anger of Achilles (1\u2013347), and two continuations, the return of [[Chryseis]] (430\u2013492) and the scenes in Olympus (348\u2013429, 493\u2013611). The second book forms a second lay, but several passages, among them the speech of [[Odysseus]] (278\u2013332), are interpolated. In the third book, the scenes in which [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Priam]] take part (including the making of the truce) are pronounced to be interpolations; and so on.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nNew methods try also to elucidate the question. Combining information technologies and statistics, the [[stylometry]] allows to scan various linguistic units: words, parts of speech, and sounds. Based on the frequencies of Greek letters, a first study of Dietmar Najock<ref>Najock Dietmar, 1995, [http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/RISSHpdf/Annee1995/Articles/DNajock.pdf \"Letter Distribution and Authorship in Early Greek Epics\"], ''Revue informatique et Statistique dans les Sciences Humaines'', XXXI, 1 \u00e0 4, p. 129\u2013154.</ref> particularly shows the internal cohesion of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Taking into account the repetition of the letters, a recent study of Stephan Vonfelt<ref>Vonfelt Stephan, 2010, [http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Arch.pdf \"Arch\u00e9ologie num\u00e9rique de la po\u00e9sie grecque\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217002555/http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Arch.pdf |date=2013-12-17 }}, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse. </ref> highlights the unity of the works of Homer compared to [[Hesiod]]. The thesis of modern analysts being questioned, the debate remains open.\n\n==Current status of the Homeric Question==\nMost scholars, although disagreeing on other questions about the genesis of the poems, agree that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were not produced by the same author, based on \"the many differences of narrative manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and geographical perspective, and by the apparently imitative character of certain passages of the ''Odyssey'' in relation to the ''Iliad''.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = M.L. | year = 1999 | title = The Invention of Homer | jstor = 639863| journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 364\u2013382 | doi=10.1093/cq/49.2.364}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Homeric Question|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0605|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Latacz|first1=Joachim|last2=Bierl|first2=Anton|last3=Olson|first3=S.

At the time, Warfaze was mostly a cover band, covering bands such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Dokken]] or [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"In Conversation with Warfaze\">{{cite news |title=In conversation with Warfaze |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |newspaper=The Daily Star |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616230929/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |archivedate=16 June 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Rashed had left the band for some personal reason and his place was filled by Sunjoy. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] had made arrangements for further education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former vocalist of [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], the band performed their own Bangla songs at a concert arranged by BAMBA at the [[University of Dhaka]] on 26 April 1992. The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo album. The band went to release their self-titled album, ''Warfaze'', in 1991. The album featured the songs \"Boshe Achi Eka\" and \"Ekti Chele\". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or patriotism were rare. It took several weeks for the album to gain popularity but later succeeded.\n\nThe album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa Club. By this time, [[Russel Ali]] had joined them on keyboards. The next album, ''Obak Bhalobasha'', was released by Sargam in 1994. ''Obak Bhalobasha'' featured songs with heavier sounds. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s guitar skills got developed on this album. ''Obak Bhalobasha'', the titled song from the album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also the longest track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n=== \"\u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be (Living System)\" and \"\u0985\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u0995 (Antisocial)\" (1994\u20131998) ===\n\nThe band released the album ''Jibondhara'' in 1997, the last time the line-up of Sunjoy, Babna Karim, Russel Ali, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]; Tipu and guest keyboardist Fuad would play together on the same album.\n\n[[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] joined as a guitarist and vocalist from another heavy metal band, Legend.

[[Bangladeshi heavy metal]] band formed in 1984 in [[Dhaka]] by guitarist [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]. They are considered to be one of the pioneering [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in Bangladesh along with [[Rockstrata]]. Multiple changes have taken place in membership since its founding since 1984. Since their inception, the band has released eight albums, including seven studio albums and one compilation album. In addition, they have released several singles in band mixed albums.\n\nThe band has experimented with different subgenres of hard rock and heavy metal over the years like progressive metal. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s adapting the styles of fast [[arpeggios]], [[sweep picking]], [[tapping]] led the band's sound into [[neoclassical metal]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ferdous |first=Fahim |date=23 December 2017 |title='It's not worth dying on stage' |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/music/its-not-worth-dying-stage-1508878 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== First decade and breakthrough \u2013 \"Warfaze\" and \"\u0985\u09ac\u09be\u0995 \u09ad\u09be\u09b2\u09cb\u09ac\u09be\u09b8\u09be (Astonishing Love)\" (1984\u201394) ===\n\nThe first lineup of Warfaze in 1984 consisted Bappi on vocals, Mir and Naimul on guitars, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] on bass, Helal on drums.

This second line up had to be discontinued when Naimul emigrated to the US. At that time, there were three other Dhaka-based metal bands: [[Rockstrata]], In Dhaka, and Aces. Mashuk Rahman and Fuad of In Dhaka volunteered to help Warfaze as guest members. At the time, Warfaze was mostly a cover band, covering bands such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Dokken]] or [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name=\"In Conversation with Warfaze\">{{cite news |title=In conversation with Warfaze |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |newspaper=The Daily Star |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616230929/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |archivedate=16 June 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Rashed had left the band for some personal reason and his place was filled by Sunjoy. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]] had made arrangements for further education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former vocalist of [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], the band performed their own Bangla songs at a concert arranged by BAMBA at the [[University of Dhaka]] on 26 April 1992. The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo album. The band went to release their self-titled album, ''Warfaze'', in 1991. The album featured the songs \"Boshe Achi Eka\" and \"Ekti Chele\". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or patriotism were rare. It took several weeks for the album to gain popularity but later succeeded.\n\nThe album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa Club. By this time, [[Russel Ali]] had joined them on keyboards. The next album, ''Obak Bhalobasha'', was released by Sargam in 1994. ''Obak Bhalobasha'' featured songs with heavier sounds. [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal]]'s guitar skills got developed on this album. ''Obak Bhalobasha'', the titled song from the album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also the longest track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\n=== \"\u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09be (Living System)\" and \"\u0985\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u0995 (Antisocial)\" (1994\u20131998) ===\n\nThe band released the album ''Jibondhara'' in 1997, the last time the line-up of Sunjoy, Babna Karim, Russel Ali, [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal]]; Tipu and guest keyboardist Fuad would play together on the same album.\n\n[[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] joined as a guitarist and vocalist from another heavy metal band, Legend.

Kamal joined Sumon's band Aurthohin in 2006. Balam, who already sang three notable songs in the album 'Alo' took up vocal duties and Sazzadwas recruited from ''Metal Maze'' as the lead guitarist. All the while, Tipu held the band together and recruited the services of C\u00e9zanne, bassist of the emerging progressive metal band [[Artcell]].

The periodicity of the bulge corresponded to Pluto's rotation period, which was previously known from Pluto's [[light curve]]. This indicated a [[synchronous orbit]], which strongly suggested that the bulge effect was real and not spurious. This resulted in reassessments of Pluto's size, mass, and other physical characteristics because the calculated mass and [[albedo]] of the Pluto\u2013Charon system had previously been attributed to Pluto alone.\n\nDoubts about Charon's existence were erased when it and Pluto entered a [[Solar eclipses on Pluto|five-year period of mutual eclipses and transits]] between 1985 and 1990.

It is now thought that Pluto and Charon might have been two bodies that collided before going into orbit about each other. The collision would have been violent enough to boil off volatile ices like [[methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) but not violent enough to have destroyed either body. The very similar density of Pluto and Charon implies that the parent bodies were not fully differentiated when the impact occurred.<ref name=\"Stern_2015\"/>\n\n==Orbit==\n[[File:Pluto-Charon system-new.gif|thumb|left|A simulated view of the Pluto\u2013Charon system showing that Pluto orbits a point outside itself.

The two objects are [[tidal locking|gravitationally locked]] to one another, so each keeps the same face towards the other.

The average distance between Charon and Pluto is {{convert|19570|km}}. The discovery of Charon allowed astronomers to calculate accurately the mass of the Plutonian system, and mutual [[occultation]]s revealed their sizes. However, neither indicated the two bodies' individual masses, which could only be estimated, until the discovery of Pluto's outer moons in late 2005. Details in the orbits of the outer moons revealed that Charon has approximately 12% of the mass of Pluto.<ref name=\"Buie_2006\" />{{Clear}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n{{main|Geology of Charon}}\n{{see also|List of geological features on Charon}}\n\n[[File:Charon, Earth & Moon size comparison.jpg|thumbnail|right|Size comparisons: [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and Charon]]\nCharon's diameter is {{convert|1212|km}}, just over half that of Pluto.<ref name=\"Stern_2015\" /><ref name=\"Stern_2017\" /> Larger than the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], it is the twelfth largest [[natural satellite]] in the [[Solar System]].

This is in contrast to [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], a Saturnian moon of a similar size to Charon but a pronounced fossil oblateness from early in its history.

The fact that the ice was still in crystalline form suggested it had been deposited recently, because solar radiation would have degraded it to an [[Amorphous ice|amorphous]] state after roughly thirty thousand years.<ref name=\"ice\" />\n\n=== Surface ===\n[[File:Charon-Neutral-Bright-Release.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charon in enhanced color to bring out differences in surface composition, showing the so-called [[Mordor Macula]] at the top.]]\n[[File:PIA20036-Charon-YoungestCrater-20150714.jpg|thumb|[[Organa (crater)|Organa]], the youngest crater of Charon.]]\n[[File:NH-Charon-Day1-TenImages-20150714-20151120.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of best-resolution images of Charon from different angles]]\nUnlike Pluto's surface, which is composed of [[nitrogen]] and [[methane]] ices, Charon's surface appears to be dominated by the less [[volatiles|volatile]] water ice.

The periodicity of the bulge corresponded to Pluto's rotation period, which was previously known from Pluto's [[light curve]]. This indicated a [[synchronous orbit]], which strongly suggested that the bulge effect was real and not spurious. This resulted in reassessments of Pluto's size, mass, and other physical characteristics because the calculated mass and [[albedo]] of the Pluto\u2013Charon system had previously been attributed to Pluto alone.\n\nDoubts about Charon's existence were erased when it and Pluto entered a [[Solar eclipses on Pluto|five-year period of mutual eclipses and transits]] between 1985 and 1990.

It is now thought that Pluto and Charon might have been two bodies that collided before going into orbit about each other. The collision would have been violent enough to boil off volatile ices like [[methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) but not violent enough to have destroyed either body.

The two objects are [[tidal locking|gravitationally locked]] to one another, so each keeps the same face towards the other.

The average distance between Charon and Pluto is {{convert|19570|km}}. The discovery of Charon allowed astronomers to calculate accurately the mass of the Plutonian system, and mutual [[occultation]]s revealed their sizes. However, neither indicated the two bodies' individual masses, which could only be estimated, until the discovery of Pluto's outer moons in late 2005. Details in the orbits of the outer moons revealed that Charon has approximately 12% of the mass of Pluto.<ref name=\"Buie_2006\" />{{Clear}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n{{main|Geology of Charon}}\n{{see also|List of geological features on Charon}}\n\n[[File:Charon, Earth & Moon size comparison.jpg|thumbnail|right|Size comparisons: [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and Charon]]\nCharon's diameter is {{convert|1212|km}}, just over half that of Pluto.<ref name=\"Stern_2015\" /><ref name=\"Stern_2017\" /> Larger than the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], it is the twelfth largest [[natural satellite]] in the [[Solar System]].

Because neither object truly orbits the other, and Charon has 12.2% the mass of Pluto, it has been argued that Charon should be considered to be part of a [[binary system]] with Pluto. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) states that Charon is considered to be just a satellite of Pluto, but the idea that Charon might be classified a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date.<ref name=\"IAU_DP\">{{cite web |title=Pluto and the Developing Landscape of Our Solar System |url=http://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/ |publisher=IAU |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\nIn a draft proposal for the [[IAU definition of planet|2006 redefinition]] of the term, the IAU proposed that a planet be defined as a body that orbits the Sun that is large enough for gravitational forces to render the object (nearly) spherical.

In the final definition, Pluto was reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]], but the formal definition of a planetary satellite was not decided upon.

He also formed the band [[Moving Hearts]] with Lunny and five other musicians in 1980. In 1987 he appeared on [[Gay Byrne]]'s ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' performing with [[The Dubliners]] for their 25th anniversary. In 2000, he published his autobiography, ''One Voice''.<ref name=moo />\n\nMoore's earlier lifestyle resulted in a decline in health and several operations. Moore's battle with alcohol, and subsequent heart operations, have taken their toll. At the end of the 1990s, Moore reduced his workload for medical reasons.<ref name=moo />\n\nSome of Moore's songs are heavily influenced by drink and the effects of drink, his song \"Delirium Tremens\" being a good example.

He was originally a bank employee who wanted to express himself using traditional music. During a bank strike in 1966, which lasted twelve weeks, he went to England, as many striking officials did, but didn't return when the strike was settled. \"I had a wild and wonderful time in England, with no bank manager looking over my shoulder,\" he said. Doing general labouring work, he frequented the folk clubs and the Irish music pubs where he met [[Seamus Ennis]], [[Margaret Barry]], [[Luke Kelly]], Martin Byrnes and many other traditional musicians.<ref name=moo>{{cite book\n| last      = Moore\n| first     = Christy\n| year      = 2000\n| title     = One Voice\n| location  = London\n| publisher = Lir/Hodder and Stoughton\n| isbn      = 0-340-76839-8\n}}</ref> When Irish singing trio [[The Grehan Sisters]], with whom Moore was previously acquainted, moved to the north of England from Dublin in 1967, they assisted Moore to get a higher profile by giving him contacts and support slots on their concerts.\n\n== Musical career ==\n1973 brought his first major release, ''[[Prosperous (album)|Prosperous]]'', which brought together the four musicians who shortly thereafter formed [[Planxty]]: [[Liam O'Flynn]], [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] and [[D\u00f3nal Lunny]]. For a time they called themselves \"CLAD\", an acronym of their names, but soon decided on [[Planxty]].<ref name=moo />\n\nAfter leaving Planxty in 1975, Moore continued on his solo career, reforming his old band on occasion (which he has been doing ever since). He also formed the band [[Moving Hearts]] with Lunny and five other musicians in 1980. In 1987 he appeared on [[Gay Byrne]]'s ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' performing with [[The Dubliners]] for their 25th anniversary. In 2000, he published his autobiography, ''One Voice''.<ref name=moo />\n\nMoore's earlier lifestyle resulted in a decline in health and several operations. Moore's battle with alcohol, and subsequent heart operations, have taken their toll. At the end of the 1990s, Moore reduced his workload for medical reasons.<ref name=moo />\n\nSome of Moore's songs are heavily influenced by drink and the effects of drink, his song \"Delirium Tremens\" being a good example. Listening to Johnny Mulhern's song \"Hard Cases\" caused Moore to recall the Galway drinking scene with local musicians [[Mickey Finn (Irish fiddler)|Mickey Finn]], Pete Galligan, Corky and Terry Smith.\n\nOn 17 April 2009, Moore released his first new studio album in four years, entitled ''Listen'', and promoted it through a series of live gigs.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.irishmusicmagazine.com/2009/03/30/listen-its-christy-moore/\n| title      = Listen Its Christy Moore\n| publisher  = Irish Music Magazine\n| date       = 30 March 2009\n| accessdate = 18 April 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, Moore released the album ''Folk Tale''.

After a series of wars between [[Greeks]] and [[Etruscans]], the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], with [[Rome]] as their capital, gained the ascendancy by 272 BC, and completed the conquest of the Italian peninsula by 218 BC.\n\nThis period of unification was followed by one of conquest in the Mediterranean, beginning with the [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]]. In the course of the century-long struggle against Carthage, the Romans conquered Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. Finally, in 146 BC, at the conclusion of the [[Third Punic War]], with Carthage completely destroyed and its inhabitants enslaved, Rome became the dominant power in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe process of Italian unification, and the associated [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], culminated in 88 BC, when, in the aftermath of the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]], Rome granted [[socii|its Italian allies]] full rights in [[Roman society]], extending [[Roman citizenship]] to all [[Italic peoples]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Keaveney |first=Arthur |year=1987 |title=Rome and the Unification of Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojoOAAAAQAAJ |location=London |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=9781904675372 }}</ref>\n\nFrom its inception, Rome was a republican city-state, but four famous civil conflicts destroyed the [[Roman Republic]]: [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] against [[Gaius Marius]] and his son (88\u201382 BC), [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]] (49\u201345 BC), [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] against [[Mark Antony]] and Octavian (43 BC), and Mark Antony against [[Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nOctavian, the final victor (31 BC), was accorded the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and thereby became the first Roman Emperor. Augustus created for the first time an administrative region called ''Italia'' with inhabitants called \"Italicus populus\", stretching from the [[Alps]] to Sicily: for this reason historians like [[Emilio Gentile]] called him ''Father of Italians''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/lagrandebiblioteca.com|title=LaGrandeBiblioteca.com is available at DomainMarket.com|website=LaGrandeBiblioteca.com is available at DomainMarket.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st century BC, ''Italia'' was still a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called ''[[municipium|municipia]]'', had some independence from Rome, while others, the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|coloniae]]'', were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, [[Augustus]] divided Italy into eleven ''regiones''.\n\nDuring the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the [[Roman Empire]] nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor [[Diocletian]] restored political stability. The importance of Rome declined, because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. The seats of the Caesars became [[Augusta Treverorum]] (on the River [[Rhine]] frontier) for [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Sirmium]] (on the River [[Danube]] frontier) for [[Galerius]], who also resided at [[Thessaloniki]]. Under Diocletian, Italy became the ''Dioecesis Italiciana'', subdivided into thirteen provinces, now including [[Raetia]].\n\nUnder [[Constantine the Great]], Italy became the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]] (''praefectura praetoria Italiae''), and was subdivided into two dioceses. ''Diocesis Italia annonaria'' (Italy of the [[Cura Annonae|annona]], governed from Milan) and ''Diocesis Italia Suburbicaria'' (Italy \"under the government of the ''[[wikt:urbs|urbs]]''\", i.e. governed from Rome). [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity]] became the Roman state religion in AD 380, under emperor [[Theodosius I]].\n\nThe last Western emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was deposed in 476 by a Germanic foederati general in Italy, [[Odoacer]]. His defeat marked the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and the end of the political unification of Italy until the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Augustus Bevilacqua Glyptothek Munich 317.jpg|[[Augustus]], first [[Roman Emperor]].

Then he was attacked and defeated by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], the king of another Germanic tribe, the [[Ostrogoths]]. Theodoric and Odoacer ruled jointly until 493, when Theodoric murdered Odoacer. Theodoric continued to rule Italy with an army of Ostrogoths and a government that was mostly Italian. After the death of Theodoric in 526, the kingdom began to grow weak. By 553, emperor [[Justinian I]] expelled the Ostrogoths, and Italy was included into the [[Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty]].\n\nByzantine rule in Italy collapsed by 572 as a result of invasions by another Germanic tribe, the [[Lombards]]. The peninsula was now dominated by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], with minor remnants of Byzantine control, especially in the south.\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries, the popes increased their influence in both religious and political matters in Italy. It was usually the popes who led attempts to protect Italy from invasion or to soften foreign rule. For about 200 years the popes opposed attempts by the Lombards, who had captured most of Italy, to take over Rome as well. The [[pope]]s finally defeated the Lombards with the aid of two Frankish kings, [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Charlemagne]]. Using land won for them by Pepin in 756, the popes established political rule in what were called the [[Papal States]] in central Italy.\n\nThe Lombards remained a threat to papal power, however, until they were crushed by Charlemagne in 774. Charlemagne added the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] to his vast realm. In recognition of Charlemagne's power, and to cement the church's alliance with him, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title      = The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume II\n  | last       = McKitterick\n  | first      = Rosamond\n  | authorlink = Rosamond McKitterick\n  | year       = 1995\n  | publisher  = Cambridge University Press\n  | location   = Cambridge\n  | isbn       = 0-521-36292-X\n  | page       = 105\n  | url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEaSdNBL0sgC&pg=PA105\n  }}</ref> After Charlemagne's death in 814, his son [[Louis the Pious]] succeeded him. Louis divided the empire among his sons, and Frankish Italy became part of [[Middle Francia]], extending as far south as [[Rome]] and [[Spoleto]]. This [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 10th century,  while southern Italy was under the rule of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Principality of Benevento]] or of the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the 12th century absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].\n\n===Rise of the city-states and the Renaissance===\n{{see|Italian city-states|Italian language#Origins}}\nFrom the 11th century on, Italian cities began to grow rapidly in independence and importance. They became centres of political life, [[banking]], and foreign trade. Some became wealthy, and many, including [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Venice]], grew into nearly independent city-states. Each had its own foreign policy and political life. They all resisted the efforts of noblemen and emperors to control them.\n\nThe emergence of identifiable [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italian dialects]] from [[Vulgar Latin]], and as such the possibility of a specifically \"Italian\" ethnic identity, has no clear-cut date, but began in roughly the 12th century. Modern standard Italian derives from the written vernacular of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] writers of the 12th century. The recognition of Italian vernaculars as literary languages in their own right began with ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', an essay written by [[Dante Alighieri]] at the beginning of the 14th century.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, some Italian city-states ranked among the most important powers of Europe. Venice, in particular, had become a major maritime power, and the city-states as a group acted as a conduit for goods from the Byzantine and Islamic empires. In this capacity, they provided great impetus to the developing [[Renaissance]], began in Florence in the 14th century,<ref name=\"Burke1998\">{{cite book|author=Peter Burke|title=The European Renaissance: Centers and Peripheries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWKnnbajUUQC|year=1998|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-19845-1}}</ref> and led to an unparalleled flourishing of the arts, literature, music, and science.\n\nHowever, the city-states were often troubled by violent disagreements among their citizens. The most famous division was between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. The Guelphs supported supreme rule by the pope, and the Ghibellines favoured the emperor. City-states often took sides and waged war against each other. During the Renaissance, Italy became an even more attractive prize to foreign conquerors. After some city-states asked for outside help in settling disputes with their neighbours, King [[Charles VIII of France]] marched into Italy in 1494; he soon withdrew, showing that the Italian peninsula's delicate equilibrium could be taken advantage of. After the [[Italian Wars]], Spain emerged as the dominant force in the region. Venice, Milan, and other city-states retained at least some of their former greatness during this period, as did [[Savoy]]-Piedmont, protected by the Alps and well defended by its vigorous rulers.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Marco Polo Mosaic from Palazzo Tursi.jpg|[[Marco Polo]], Italian merchant traveler who introduced Europeans to Central Asia and China\nFile:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|[[Christopher Columbus]], early European explorer of the [[New World]].\nFile:Domenico ghirlandaio, amerigo vespucci, ognissanti, Firenze.jpg|[[Amerigo Vespucci]], geographer and traveler from whose name the word [[Americas|America]] is derived.\n</gallery>\n\n===The French Revolution and Napoleon===\n{{Main|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy}}\n[[File:Laura bassi1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laura Bassi]], the first chairwoman of a university in a scientific field of studies]]\nThe French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The [[French Revolution]] began in 1789 and immediately found supporters among the Italian people. The local Italian rulers, sensing danger in their own country, drew closer to the European kings who opposed France. After the French king was overthrown and France became a republic, secret clubs favouring an Italian republic were formed throughout Italy. The armies of the French Republic began to move across Europe. In 1796, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] led a French army into northern Italy and drove out the Austrian rulers. Once again, Italy was the scene of battle between the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] and the French. Wherever France conquered, Italian republics were set up, with constitutions and legal reforms. Napoleon made himself emperor in 1804, and part of northern and central Italy was unified under the name of the Kingdom of Italy, with Napoleon as king. The rest of northern and central Italy was annexed by France. Only Sicily and the island of Sardinia, which had been ceded to the Alpine [[House of Savoy]] in 1720 and had been under their rule ever since, remained free of French control.\n\nFrench domination lasted less than 20 years, and it differed from previous foreign control of the Italian peninsula. In spite of heavy taxation and frequent harshness, the French introduced representative assemblies and new laws that were the same for all parts of the country. For the first time since the days of ancient Rome, Italians of different regions used the same money and served in the same army. Many Italians began to see the possibility of a united Italy free of foreign control.\n\n===The Kingdom of Italy===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Italy}}\n[[File:Partenza da Quarto.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Expedition of the Thousand]].]]\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the reaction set in with the [[Congress of Vienna]] allowed the restoration of many of the old rulers and systems under Austrian domination. The concept of nationalism continued strong, however, and sporadic outbreaks led by such inveterate reformers as [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] occurred in several parts of the peninsula down to 1848\u201349. This ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' movement was brought to a successful conclusion under the guidance of [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], prime minister of Piedmont.\n\nCavour managed to unite most of Italy under the headship of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] of the house of Savoy, and on 17 March 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the popular republican hero of Italy, contributed much to this achievement and to the subsequent incorporation of the Papal States under the Italian monarch. Italian troops occupied Rome in 1870, and in July 1871, this formally became the capital of the kingdom. [[Pope Pius IX]], a longtime rival of Italian kings, stated he had been made a \"prisoner\" inside the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] walls and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. Only in 1929 did the Roman Pope accept the unified Italy with [[Rome]] as capital.\n\n[[World War I]] has been interpreted as completing the process of Italian unification, with the annexation of Trieste, [[Istria]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] and [[Zadar|Zara]]. After World War I, Italy emerged as one of the [[Big Four (World War I)|four great powers]] after the victory of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].\n\nIn the decades following unification, Italy began creating colonies in [[Africa]], and under [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|fascist regime]] conquered [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], founding the [[Italian Empire]] in 1936. The population of Italy grew to 45 millions in 1940 and the economy, which had been based upon agriculture until that time, started its industrial development, mainly in northern Italy. But [[World War II]] soon destroyed Italy and its colonial power.\n\n===The Italian Republic===\n{{Main|History of the Italian Republic}}\n\nBetween 1945 and 1948, the outlines of a new Italy began to appear. [[Victor Emmanuel III]] gave up the throne on 9 May 1946, and his son, [[Umberto II]], became king. On 2 June Italy held its first free election after 20 years of Fascist rule (the so-called ''Ventennio''). Italians chose a republic to replace the monarchy, which had been closely associated with [[Fascism]]. They elected a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] to prepare a new democratic constitution. The Assembly approved the constitution in 1947, which came into force on 1 January 1948.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Italy}}\n[[File:The Pantheon.jpg|thumb|The Pantheon and the [[Fontana del Pantheon]].

Italy continued its leading cultural role through the [[Baroque]] period and into the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished but the Italians re-established a strong presence in music.\n\nItalian explorers and navigators in the 15th and 16th centuries left a perennial mark on human history with the modern \"discovery of America\", due to [[Christopher Columbus]]. In addition, the name of the [[Americas|American continents]] derives from the geographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first name. Also noted, is explorer [[Marco Polo]] who travelled extensively throughout the [[eastern world]] recording his travels.\n\nDue to comparatively late national unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula, many traditions and customs of the Italians can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of the Western world remain immense. Famous elements of Italian culture are its [[opera]] and music, its iconic gastronomy and food, which are commonly regarded as amongst the most popular in the world,<ref>{{cite book\n  | title     = How Italian Food Conquered the World\n  | last      = Mariani\n  | first     = John F.\n  | year      = 2011\n  | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan\n  | location  = New York\n  | isbn      = 978-0-230-10439-6\n  | page      = [https://archive.org/details/howitalianfoodco0000mari/page/15 15]\n  | url       = https://archive.org/details/howitalianfoodco0000mari\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}</ref> its [[Italian film|cinema]] (with filmmakers such as [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Mario Monicelli]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Alberto Sordi]], etc.), its collections of priceless works of art and its fashion (Milan and Florence are regarded as some of the few [[fashion capital]]s of the world).\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Main|Italian philosophy}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|[[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], the founder of modern political science and ethics.|alt=]]Over the ages, [[Italian literature]] had a vast influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and going onto Renaissance, [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] and modern philosophy.\nItalian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included several important philosophers and theologians such as St [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas was the student of [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a brilliant [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] experimentalist, much like the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] of [[Oxford]] in the 13th century. Aquinas reintroduced [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] to Christianity. He believed that there was no contradiction between faith and secular reason. He believed that Aristotle had achieved the pinnacle in the human striving for truth and thus adopted Aristotle's philosophy as a framework in constructing his theological and philosophical outlook. He was a professor at the prestigious [[University of Paris]].\n\nItaly was also affected by the Enlightenment, a movement which was a consequence of the [[Renaissance]] and changed the road of Italian philosophy.<ref name=\"history-world.org\">{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm|title=The Enlightenment throughout Europe|website=history-world.org|accessdate=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082708/http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm|archive-date=23 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Followers of the group often met to discuss in private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of [[Milan]], Rome and [[Venice]].

Both futurism and fascism (in its original form, now often distinguished as [[Italian fascism]]) were developed in Italy at this time. From the 1920s to the 1940s, Italian Fascism was the official philosophy and ideology of the Italian government led by Benito Mussolini. [[Giovanni Gentile]] was one of the most significant 20th-century Idealist/Fascist philosophers. Meanwhile, anarchism, communism, and socialism, though not originating in Italy, took significant hold in Italy during the early 20th century, with the country producing numerous significant [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]], socialists, and communists. In addition, [[anarcho-communism]] first fully formed into its modern strain within the Italian section of the [[First International]].<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111-113\">Nunzio Pernicone, ''Italian Anarchism 1864\u20131892'', pp. 111\u2013113, AK Press 2009.</ref> [[Antonio Gramsci]] remains an important philosopher within [[Marxist]] and communist theory, credited with creating the theory of [[cultural hegemony]].\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Italian literature}}\n\nItalian literature may be unearthed back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most significant poets of the period being [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. During the [[Renaissance]], humanists such as [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Coluccio Salutati]] and [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] were great collectors of antique manuscripts. Many worked for the organized Church and were in holy orders (like Petrarch), while others were lawyers and chancellors of Italian cities, like Petrarch's disciple, Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, and thus had access to book copying workshops.\n\nOne of the most remarkable poets of the early 19th and 20th century writers was [[Giacomo Leopardi]], who is widely acknowledged to be one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century.<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/115276/giacomo-leopardis-zibaldone-reviewed-adam-kirsch The Least Known Masterpiece of European Literature], New Republic</ref><ref>[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/leopardi/projects/index.aspx The Zibaldone project], University of Birmingham</ref> [[Italo Svevo]], the author of ''La coscienza di Zeno'' (1923), and [[Luigi Pirandello]] (winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature), who explored the shifting nature of reality in his prose fiction and such plays as ''Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore'' (''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', 1921).

At one point, Sardinia grew increasingly autonomous from the Byzantine rule to the point of organizing itself into [[Sardinian medieval kingdoms|four sovereign Kingdoms]], known as \"Judicates\", that would last until the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] conquest in the 15th century. Corsica came under the influence of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] and later under the maritime Republics of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. In 687, Sicily became the Byzantine [[Sicily (theme)|Theme of Sicily]]; during the course of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]], Sicily gradually became the [[Emirate of Sicily]] (831\u20131072). Later, a series of conflicts with the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Normans]] would bring about the establishment of the [[County of Sicily]], and eventually the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. The [[Lombards of Sicily]] (not to be confused with the ''Longobards''), coming from [[Northern Italy]], settled in the central and eastern part of Sicily. After the marriage between the Norman [[Roger I of Sicily]] and [[Adelaide del Vasto]], descendant of the [[Aleramici]] family, many Northern Italian colonisers (known collectively as ''Lombards'') left their homeland, in the Aleramici's possessions in [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]] (then known as ''Lombardy''), to settle on the island of Sicily.<ref name=\"books.google.it\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IBspuVRwnUC&pg=PA323 |title=\"Following the marriage to his third wife, Adelaide, from the Aleramici clan in Piedmont, many northern Italians (the sources refer to them as lombardi, as opposed to the longobardi from southern Italy) settled on the island of Sicily from the late Eleventh century onwards.\"|author1=G.

The mass industrialization and urbanization globally resulted in higher labor mobility and the need for Italians to stay anchored to the land for economic support declined.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMoreover, better opportunities for work were not the only incentive to move; family played a major role and the dispersion of Italians globally.

Nevertheless, by his time the larger concept of [[Oenotria]] and \"Italy\" had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', before the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]], the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the [[strait of Messina]] and the line connecting the [[gulf of Salerno]] and [[gulf of Taranto]], corresponding roughly to the current region of [[Calabria]].

After a series of wars between [[Greeks]] and [[Etruscans]], the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], with [[Rome]] as their capital, gained the ascendancy by 272 BC, and completed the conquest of the Italian peninsula by 218 BC.\n\nThis period of unification was followed by one of conquest in the Mediterranean, beginning with the [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]]. In the course of the century-long struggle against Carthage, the Romans conquered Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. Finally, in 146 BC, at the conclusion of the [[Third Punic War]], with Carthage completely destroyed and its inhabitants enslaved, Rome became the dominant power in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe process of Italian unification, and the associated [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], culminated in 88 BC, when, in the aftermath of the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]], Rome granted [[socii|its Italian allies]] full rights in [[Roman society]], extending [[Roman citizenship]] to all [[Italic peoples]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Keaveney |first=Arthur |year=1987 |title=Rome and the Unification of Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojoOAAAAQAAJ |location=London |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=9781904675372 }}</ref>\n\nFrom its inception, Rome was a republican city-state, but four famous civil conflicts destroyed the [[Roman Republic]]: [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] against [[Gaius Marius]] and his son (88\u201382 BC), [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]] (49\u201345 BC), [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] against [[Mark Antony]] and Octavian (43 BC), and Mark Antony against [[Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nOctavian, the final victor (31 BC), was accorded the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and thereby became the first Roman Emperor. Augustus created for the first time an administrative region called ''Italia'' with inhabitants called \"Italicus populus\", stretching from the [[Alps]] to Sicily: for this reason historians like [[Emilio Gentile]] called him ''Father of Italians''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/lagrandebiblioteca.com|title=LaGrandeBiblioteca.com is available at DomainMarket.com|website=LaGrandeBiblioteca.com is available at DomainMarket.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st century BC, ''Italia'' was still a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called ''[[municipium|municipia]]'', had some independence from Rome, while others, the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|coloniae]]'', were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, [[Augustus]] divided Italy into eleven ''regiones''.\n\nDuring the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the [[Roman Empire]] nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor [[Diocletian]] restored political stability. The importance of Rome declined, because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. The seats of the Caesars became [[Augusta Treverorum]] (on the River [[Rhine]] frontier) for [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Sirmium]] (on the River [[Danube]] frontier) for [[Galerius]], who also resided at [[Thessaloniki]]. Under Diocletian, Italy became the ''Dioecesis Italiciana'', subdivided into thirteen provinces, now including [[Raetia]].\n\nUnder [[Constantine the Great]], Italy became the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]] (''praefectura praetoria Italiae''), and was subdivided into two dioceses. ''Diocesis Italia annonaria'' (Italy of the [[Cura Annonae|annona]], governed from Milan) and ''Diocesis Italia Suburbicaria'' (Italy \"under the government of the ''[[wikt:urbs|urbs]]''\", i.e. governed from Rome). [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity]] became the Roman state religion in AD 380, under emperor [[Theodosius I]].\n\nThe last Western emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus]], was deposed in 476 by a Germanic foederati general in Italy, [[Odoacer]]. His defeat marked the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and the end of the political unification of Italy until the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Augustus Bevilacqua Glyptothek Munich 317.jpg|[[Augustus]], first [[Roman Emperor]].

Then he was attacked and defeated by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], the king of another Germanic tribe, the [[Ostrogoths]]. Theodoric and Odoacer ruled jointly until 493, when Theodoric murdered Odoacer. Theodoric continued to rule Italy with an army of Ostrogoths and a government that was mostly Italian. After the death of Theodoric in 526, the kingdom began to grow weak. By 553, emperor [[Justinian I]] expelled the Ostrogoths, and Italy was included into the [[Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty]].\n\nByzantine rule in Italy collapsed by 572 as a result of invasions by another Germanic tribe, the [[Lombards]]. The peninsula was now dominated by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], with minor remnants of Byzantine control, especially in the south.\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries, the popes increased their influence in both religious and political matters in Italy. It was usually the popes who led attempts to protect Italy from invasion or to soften foreign rule. For about 200 years the popes opposed attempts by the Lombards, who had captured most of Italy, to take over Rome as well. The [[pope]]s finally defeated the Lombards with the aid of two Frankish kings, [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Charlemagne]]. Using land won for them by Pepin in 756, the popes established political rule in what were called the [[Papal States]] in central Italy.\n\nThe Lombards remained a threat to papal power, however, until they were crushed by Charlemagne in 774. Charlemagne added the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] to his vast realm. In recognition of Charlemagne's power, and to cement the church's alliance with him, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title      = The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume II\n  | last       = McKitterick\n  | first      = Rosamond\n  | authorlink = Rosamond McKitterick\n  | year       = 1995\n  | publisher  = Cambridge University Press\n  | location   = Cambridge\n  | isbn       = 0-521-36292-X\n  | page       = 105\n  | url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEaSdNBL0sgC&pg=PA105\n  }}</ref> After Charlemagne's death in 814, his son [[Louis the Pious]] succeeded him. Louis divided the empire among his sons, and Frankish Italy became part of [[Middle Francia]], extending as far south as [[Rome]] and [[Spoleto]]. This [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 10th century,  while southern Italy was under the rule of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Principality of Benevento]] or of the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the 12th century absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].\n\n===Rise of the city-states and the Renaissance===\n{{see|Italian city-states|Italian language#Origins}}\nFrom the 11th century on, Italian cities began to grow rapidly in independence and importance. They became centres of political life, [[banking]], and foreign trade. Some became wealthy, and many, including [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Venice]], grew into nearly independent city-states. Each had its own foreign policy and political life. They all resisted the efforts of noblemen and emperors to control them.\n\nThe emergence of identifiable [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italian dialects]] from [[Vulgar Latin]], and as such the possibility of a specifically \"Italian\" ethnic identity, has no clear-cut date, but began in roughly the 12th century. Modern standard Italian derives from the written vernacular of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] writers of the 12th century. The recognition of Italian vernaculars as literary languages in their own right began with ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', an essay written by [[Dante Alighieri]] at the beginning of the 14th century.\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, some Italian city-states ranked among the most important powers of Europe. Venice, in particular, had become a major maritime power, and the city-states as a group acted as a conduit for goods from the Byzantine and Islamic empires. In this capacity, they provided great impetus to the developing [[Renaissance]], began in Florence in the 14th century,<ref name=\"Burke1998\">{{cite book|author=Peter Burke|title=The European Renaissance: Centers and Peripheries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWKnnbajUUQC|year=1998|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-19845-1}}</ref> and led to an unparalleled flourishing of the arts, literature, music, and science.\n\nHowever, the city-states were often troubled by violent disagreements among their citizens. The most famous division was between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. The Guelphs supported supreme rule by the pope, and the Ghibellines favoured the emperor. City-states often took sides and waged war against each other. During the Renaissance, Italy became an even more attractive prize to foreign conquerors. After some city-states asked for outside help in settling disputes with their neighbours, King [[Charles VIII of France]] marched into Italy in 1494; he soon withdrew, showing that the Italian peninsula's delicate equilibrium could be taken advantage of. After the [[Italian Wars]], Spain emerged as the dominant force in the region. Venice, Milan, and other city-states retained at least some of their former greatness during this period, as did [[Savoy]]-Piedmont, protected by the Alps and well defended by its vigorous rulers.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Marco Polo Mosaic from Palazzo Tursi.jpg|[[Marco Polo]], Italian merchant traveler who introduced Europeans to Central Asia and China\nFile:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|[[Christopher Columbus]], early European explorer of the [[New World]].\nFile:Domenico ghirlandaio, amerigo vespucci, ognissanti, Firenze.jpg|[[Amerigo Vespucci]], geographer and traveler from whose name the word [[Americas|America]] is derived.\n</gallery>\n\n===The French Revolution and Napoleon===\n{{Main|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy}}\n[[File:Laura bassi1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laura Bassi]], the first chairwoman of a university in a scientific field of studies]]\nThe French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The [[French Revolution]] began in 1789 and immediately found supporters among the Italian people. The local Italian rulers, sensing danger in their own country, drew closer to the European kings who opposed France. After the French king was overthrown and France became a republic, secret clubs favouring an Italian republic were formed throughout Italy. The armies of the French Republic began to move across Europe. In 1796, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] led a French army into northern Italy and drove out the Austrian rulers. Once again, Italy was the scene of battle between the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] and the French. Wherever France conquered, Italian republics were set up, with constitutions and legal reforms. Napoleon made himself emperor in 1804, and part of northern and central Italy was unified under the name of the Kingdom of Italy, with Napoleon as king. The rest of northern and central Italy was annexed by France. Only Sicily and the island of Sardinia, which had been ceded to the Alpine [[House of Savoy]] in 1720 and had been under their rule ever since, remained free of French control.\n\nFrench domination lasted less than 20 years, and it differed from previous foreign control of the Italian peninsula. In spite of heavy taxation and frequent harshness, the French introduced representative assemblies and new laws that were the same for all parts of the country. For the first time since the days of ancient Rome, Italians of different regions used the same money and served in the same army. Many Italians began to see the possibility of a united Italy free of foreign control.\n\n===The Kingdom of Italy===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Italy}}\n[[File:Partenza da Quarto.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The [[Expedition of the Thousand]].]]\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the reaction set in with the [[Congress of Vienna]] allowed the restoration of many of the old rulers and systems under Austrian domination. The concept of nationalism continued strong, however, and sporadic outbreaks led by such inveterate reformers as [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] occurred in several parts of the peninsula down to 1848\u201349. This ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' movement was brought to a successful conclusion under the guidance of [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], prime minister of Piedmont.\n\nCavour managed to unite most of Italy under the headship of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] of the house of Savoy, and on 17 March 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed with Victor Emmanuel II as king. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], the popular republican hero of Italy, contributed much to this achievement and to the subsequent incorporation of the Papal States under the Italian monarch. Italian troops occupied Rome in 1870, and in July 1871, this formally became the capital of the kingdom. [[Pope Pius IX]], a longtime rival of Italian kings, stated he had been made a \"prisoner\" inside the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] walls and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. Only in 1929 did the Roman Pope accept the unified Italy with [[Rome]] as capital.\n\n[[World War I]] has been interpreted as completing the process of Italian unification, with the annexation of Trieste, [[Istria]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] and [[Zadar|Zara]]. After World War I, Italy emerged as one of the [[Big Four (World War I)|four great powers]] after the victory of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].\n\nIn the decades following unification, Italy began creating colonies in [[Africa]], and under [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|fascist regime]] conquered [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], founding the [[Italian Empire]] in 1936. The population of Italy grew to 45 millions in 1940 and the economy, which had been based upon agriculture until that time, started its industrial development, mainly in northern Italy. But [[World War II]] soon destroyed Italy and its colonial power.\n\n===The Italian Republic===\n{{Main|History of the Italian Republic}}\n\nBetween 1945 and 1948, the outlines of a new Italy began to appear. [[Victor Emmanuel III]] gave up the throne on 9 May 1946, and his son, [[Umberto II]], became king. On 2 June Italy held its first free election after 20 years of Fascist rule (the so-called ''Ventennio''). Italians chose a republic to replace the monarchy, which had been closely associated with [[Fascism]]. They elected a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] to prepare a new democratic constitution. The Assembly approved the constitution in 1947, which came into force on 1 January 1948.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Italy}}\n[[File:The Pantheon.jpg|thumb|The Pantheon and the [[Fontana del Pantheon]].

Italy continued its leading cultural role through the [[Baroque]] period and into the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished but the Italians re-established a strong presence in music.\n\nItalian explorers and navigators in the 15th and 16th centuries left a perennial mark on human history with the modern \"discovery of America\", due to [[Christopher Columbus]]. In addition, the name of the [[Americas|American continents]] derives from the geographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first name. Also noted, is explorer [[Marco Polo]] who travelled extensively throughout the [[eastern world]] recording his travels.\n\nDue to comparatively late national unification, and the historical autonomy of the regions that comprise the Italian peninsula, many traditions and customs of the Italians can be identified by their regions of origin. Despite the political and social isolation of these regions, Italy's contributions to the cultural and historical heritage of the Western world remain immense. Famous elements of Italian culture are its [[opera]] and music, its iconic gastronomy and food, which are commonly regarded as amongst the most popular in the world,<ref>{{cite book\n  | title     = How Italian Food Conquered the World\n  | last      = Mariani\n  | first     = John F.\n  | year      = 2011\n  | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan\n  | location  = New York\n  | isbn      = 978-0-230-10439-6\n  | page      = [https://archive.org/details/howitalianfoodco0000mari/page/15 15]\n  | url       = https://archive.org/details/howitalianfoodco0000mari\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}</ref> its [[Italian film|cinema]] (with filmmakers such as [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Mario Monicelli]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Alberto Sordi]], etc.), its collections of priceless works of art and its fashion (Milan and Florence are regarded as some of the few [[fashion capital]]s of the world).\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Main|Italian philosophy}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|[[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], the founder of modern political science and ethics.|alt=]]Over the ages, [[Italian literature]] had a vast influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and going onto Renaissance, [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] and modern philosophy.\nItalian Medieval philosophy was mainly Christian, and included several important philosophers and theologians such as St [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas was the student of [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a brilliant [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] experimentalist, much like the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] of [[Oxford]] in the 13th century. Aquinas reintroduced [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] to Christianity. He believed that there was no contradiction between faith and secular reason. He believed that Aristotle had achieved the pinnacle in the human striving for truth and thus adopted Aristotle's philosophy as a framework in constructing his theological and philosophical outlook. He was a professor at the prestigious [[University of Paris]].\n\nItaly was also affected by the Enlightenment, a movement which was a consequence of the [[Renaissance]] and changed the road of Italian philosophy.<ref name=\"history-world.org\">{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm|title=The Enlightenment throughout Europe|website=history-world.org|accessdate=12 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082708/http://history-world.org/enlightenment_throughout_europe.htm|archive-date=23 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Followers of the group often met to discuss in private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of [[Milan]], Rome and [[Venice]]. Cities with important universities such as [[Padua]], [[Bologna]] and [[Naples]], however, also remained great centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668\u20131744) (who is widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy)<ref name=\"maritain.nd.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hop70.htm|title=History of Philosophy 70|website=maritain.nd.edu|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> and [[Antonio Genovesi]].<ref name=\"history-world.org\" /> Italian society also dramatically changed during the Enlightenment, with rulers such as [[Leopold II of Tuscany]] abolishing the death penalty.

Both futurism and fascism (in its original form, now often distinguished as [[Italian fascism]]) were developed in Italy at this time. From the 1920s to the 1940s, Italian Fascism was the official philosophy and ideology of the Italian government led by Benito Mussolini. [[Giovanni Gentile]] was one of the most significant 20th-century Idealist/Fascist philosophers. Meanwhile, anarchism, communism, and socialism, though not originating in Italy, took significant hold in Italy during the early 20th century, with the country producing numerous significant [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]], socialists, and communists. In addition, [[anarcho-communism]] first fully formed into its modern strain within the Italian section of the [[First International]].<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111-113\">Nunzio Pernicone, ''Italian Anarchism 1864\u20131892'', pp. 111\u2013113, AK Press 2009.</ref> [[Antonio Gramsci]] remains an important philosopher within [[Marxist]] and communist theory, credited with creating the theory of [[cultural hegemony]].\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Italian literature}}\n\nItalian literature may be unearthed back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most significant poets of the period being [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. During the [[Renaissance]], humanists such as [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Coluccio Salutati]] and [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] were great collectors of antique manuscripts. Many worked for the organized Church and were in holy orders (like Petrarch), while others were lawyers and chancellors of Italian cities, like Petrarch's disciple, Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, and thus had access to book copying workshops.\n\nOne of the most remarkable poets of the early 19th and 20th century writers was [[Giacomo Leopardi]], who is widely acknowledged to be one of the most radical and challenging thinkers of the 19th century.<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/115276/giacomo-leopardis-zibaldone-reviewed-adam-kirsch The Least Known Masterpiece of European Literature], New Republic</ref><ref>[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/leopardi/projects/index.aspx The Zibaldone project], University of Birmingham</ref> [[Italo Svevo]], the author of ''La coscienza di Zeno'' (1923), and [[Luigi Pirandello]] (winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature), who explored the shifting nature of reality in his prose fiction and such plays as ''Sei personaggi in cerca d'autore'' (''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', 1921).

[[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include the invention of the thermometer and key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]]. Other astronomers such as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]].\n\nPhysicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u201354), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that built the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].

The global economic expansion, ranging from Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 18th and through mid 19th century, to the use of slave labor in the Americas did not hit Italy until much later (with the exception of the \"industrial triangle\" between [[Milan]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]])<ref name=\":0\" />  This lag resulted in a deficit of work available in Italy and the need to look for work elsewhere. The mass industrialization and urbanization globally resulted in higher labor mobility and the need for Italians to stay anchored to the land for economic support declined.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMoreover, better opportunities for work were not the only incentive to move; family played a major role and the dispersion of Italians globally.  Italians were more likely to migrate to countries where they had family established beforehand.<ref name=\":1\" /> These ties are shown to be stronger in many cases than the monetary incentive for migration, taking into account a familial base and possibly an Italian migrant community, greater connections to find opportunities for work, housing etc.<ref name=\":1\" /> Thus, thousands of Italian men and women left Italy and dispersed around the world and this trend only increased as the First World War approached.\n\nNotably, it was not as if Italians had never migrated before; internal migration between North and Southern Italy before unification was common. Northern Italy caught on to industrialization sooner than Southern Italy, therefore it was considered more modern technologically, and tended to be inhabited by the bourgeoisie.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The View from Vesuvius Italian Culture and the Southern Question How did Southern Italy Become \"The South\"?|last=Moe|first=Nelson|publisher=University of California Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u20139}}</ref> Alternatively, rural and agro-intensive Southern Italy was seen as economically backward and was mainly populated by lower class peasantry.<ref name=\":2\" /> Given these disparities, prior to unification (and arguably after) the two sections of Italy, North and South were essentially seen by Italians and other nations as separate countries. So, migrating from one part of Italy to next could be seen as though they were indeed migrating to another country or even continent.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFurthermore, large-scale migrations phenomena did not recede until the late 1920s, well into the Fascist regime, and a subsequent wave can be observed after the end of the [[Second World War]].

Others live in other parts of Europe (primarily the [[Italians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Italians in Germany|Germany]], [[Italians in France|France]] and [[Italians in Switzerland|Switzerland]]). Most Italian citizens living abroad live in other nations of the European Union.

The university name officially changed to the \"University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign\" around 1982.

The university name officially changed to the \"University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign\" around 1982. While this was a reversal of the commonly used designation for the metropolitan area, \"[[Champaign-Urbana]],\" most of the campus is located in Urbana.

Two years after the university opened in 1868, John Milton Gregory and a group of students created a constitution for a student government. Their governance expanded to the entire university in 1873, having a legislative, executive, and judicial branch. For a period of time, this government had the ability to discipline students. In 1883, however, due to a combination of events from Gregory's resignation to student-faculty infighting, the government formally dissolved itself via [[plebiscite]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Solberg|first=Winton|title=The University of Illinois and the Reform of Discipline in the Modern University, 1868-1891|journal=AAUP Bulletin|date=September 1966|volume=52|issue=3|pages=305\u2013314 |jstor=40224166|doi=10.2307/40224166}}</ref>\n\nIt wasn't until 1934, when the Student Senate, the next university-wide student government, was created.
