His father, Dr. Henry Keeney Webster (1800-1857), died when he was eight years old. His mother, Sarah Haviland (1811-1885), was left with little money and three children to raise. By age 12, Webster had a full-time job and never achieved more than a grade school education. When he turned 18, he traveled alone to [[Chicago]] and began work at a dry goods store. Within a year or two, his mother and two older sisters followed. All settled in [[Evanston, Illinois]].  Webster\u2019s first business, a drug and grocery store on Davis Street in Evanston, was a success. He sold his interest in the grocery to his partner, so he could start and clothing store.  The clothing stored failed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Webster |first1=Henry K. |title=Towner Keeney Webster |date=1930 |publisher=Walter A.

He sold his interest in that to start and clothing store which failed. He then became intrigued with an invention called the \u201cCommon-sense\" elevator bucket.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.websterchain.com/company/history/ |publisher=Webster Industries |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> These buckets were easily manufactured, and when attached to a continuous belt could carry large amounts of grain to the tops of grain elevators.  Thanks to developments like [[Cyrus McCormick]]\u2019s reaper, elevators were springing up all over the Midwest. In 1876, he began making common-sense buckets in a small shop on Kinzie Street in Chicago. His company grew quickly as he developed machinery for handling grain. He acquired partners and built his first factory in 1882. It doubled and then redoubled in size, and in 1889 Webster moved to a new plant on Western Avenue and Fifteenth Street. His partners dropped out, the firm became the Webster Manufacturing Company.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marquis |first1=Albert |title=The Book of Chicagoans: A Biographical Dictionary of Leading Living Men of the City of Chicago |date=1911}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1890s a group of investors, one of whom was [[Mark Twain]], gave Webster Manufacturing the contract to make the [[Paige Compositor]]. The device, which set type, was a complicated mechanical marvel with 18,000 parts. Webster built a new five story building at the Western Avenue plant to deliver 3000 compositors under the contract.  Unfortunately, the compositor was expensive to manufacture and when it broke down only the inventor\u2019s chief engineer, Charles Davis, could fix it. The rival linotype machine soon came to dominate the typesetting market. What had seemed like a profitable business venture, cost Mark Twain a fortune and almost bankrupt Webster Manufacturing. Fewer than half-a-dozen machines were actually built. The sole remaining Paige compositor is housed at the [[Mark Twain House and Museum]] in Hartford, Connecticut. \n\nIn 1897, Webster, having returned to his core business, build a two-million-bushel grain elevator on the newly opened [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in England. In 1907, Webster moved his firm to [[Tiffin, Ohio]] where it exists today as Webster Industries.  To finance the move to Tiffin, Webster took on outside investors. Dissatisfied with company profits and Webster\u2019s management style, they assumed control of the company.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Webster |first1=Henry K. |title=A Memoir of Towner Keeney Webster |date=1930 |publisher=Walter Strong |location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\n==Webster Electric==\n\nDuring his tenure in Tiffin, Webster became interested in a new invention, the Milton magneto. The [[magneto]] could start gasoline engines without cranking. After refining the device into what he thought to be a workable ignition system, Webster signed a contract with the [[Cadillac]] Automobile company which intended to make it standard on their cars. But the magneto proved to be unreliable and the contract was canceled. Webster\u2019s son, Towner K. Webster Jr., was an engineer who eventually perfected the magneto as an ignition system for farm engines. In 1914, Webster Sr. opened a new company in [[Racine, Wisconsin]] named Webster Electric.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunolt |first1=Greg |title=Webster Electric of Racine |journal=WARI News |date=September 2014 |url=http://warci.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sept14.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>  \n\nThe magneto was a profitable product, but it was gradually supplanted by other ignition systems.

The Institute was first known as the '''Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts'''. In 1832 the name was shortened to the '''Liverpool Mechanics' Institution'''. The facade of the [[listed building]], the entrance hall and modified school hall remain after substantial internal reconstruction was completed in the early 1990s.\n\n==School history in brief==\nIts initial primary purpose as a [[Mechanics' Institute]] (one of many established about this time throughout the country) was to provide educational opportunities, mainly through evening classes, for working men. Lectures for the general public were also provided of wide interest covering topics ranging from [[Arctic]] exploration to [[Shakespeare]] and philosophy. Luminaries like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] delivered talks and readings in the main lecture hall (now the architecturally restructured Sir [[Paul McCartney]] Auditorium of [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts|LIPA]]).\n\nBy 1840 the Institution offered evening classes, lectures, a library and a boys' lower and upper school. By the 1850s a formal art school was evolving from the evening classes and in 1856 this diversity was recognised by another name change \u2013 The Liverpool Institute and School of Arts.\n\nA girls' school was founded and opened in 1844 under the name [[Liverpool Institute High School for Girls]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} It was housed in a merchant's mansion across the street from the boys' school in [[Blackburne House]] provided by the generosity of [[George Holt (cotton-broker)|George Holt]]<ref>{{cite web|title=About Blackburne House|url=http://www.blackburnehouse.co.uk/about-blackburne-house/|publisher=Blackburne House|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> and which was later (1872) donated to the school by his family in his memory. The school was one of the first which was open to the public in the country established exclusively for the [[education of girls]].\n\nIn 1905 the [[Liverpool City Council]] took over the management of the secondary schools when the LI Board of Governors presented the school and assets to the City. From then until its closure in 1985, the school was formally known as ''The Liverpool Institute High School for Boys'' or more familiarly as ''The Institute'' or ''The Inny'' to its pupils.\n\nIt was an English [[grammar school]] for boys ages 11 to 18 with an excellent academic reputation built up over more than a century. Its list of scholarships and places at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] runs to some 300 names \u2013 in addition to distinctions gained at [[the University of Liverpool]] and many other prominent British universities. The school was a true measure of Liverpool's intellectual capital, and its old boys could and can be found in later life in many fields of professional distinction including the law, the Church, armed forces, politics, academia, government and colonial administration as well as in trade and commerce.<ref name=Tiffen>A History of the Liverpool Institute Schools, Herbert J Tiffen, 1825\u20131935.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, future Beatles [[Paul MacCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] were educated at the school.<ref>Vincent Perez Benitez, ''The Words and Music of Paul McCartney: The Solo Years'' (Praeger, 2010, ISBN 978-0-313-34969-0), pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\n==Closure of the school==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe school was closed by the city council in 1985. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] nationally opposed grammar schools \u2013 see [[Anthony Crosland]]'s Circular of September 1965 required that Local Authorities bring forward schemes for comprehensive secondary education. As grammar school pupils were selected by examination at age 11, there was a long-standing push towards '[[comprehensive schools]]' (as non-selective schools were known) from that party when it took majority control of the City Council in 1983. Demand for secondary school places in the City had also dropped precipitously and there was a huge oversupply of school space as Liverpool's population contracted during the severe economic recession of the early 1980s.\n\nThe Deputy Leader of the Labour (Militant) Group on Council at the time was a former LI schoolboy [[Derek Hatton]] who had left without academic distinction in 1964 and with strong feelings of dislike towards the school.<ref>Derek Hatton, Inside Left, 1988</ref> However the man who was Chair of the Educational Committee at the time of the decision to close the school was Dominic Brady, whose qualifications for his position amounted to being a former school caretaker.\n\nAfter closure, the building stood empty and neglected, the roof leaking and the walls crumbling. In 1987 it was announced that the LI Trust (under control of Liverpool Council's Education Department) would grant use of the building and site to a new educational establishment. [[Paul McCartney]] had returned to his old school when with [[Wings (band)|Wings]] he had played a concert at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]] in 1979. After the school's closure in 1985, McCartney returned one night to reminisce about his school days, while he was writing his 'Liverpool Oratorio'. This visit is captured in 'Echoes'; a DVD which accompanies the ''Liverpool Oratoria'' box set. McCartney was determined to save the building somehow and during a conversation with [[Sir George Martin]], the idea of a 'fame school' emerged since Martin was helping [[Mark Featherstone-Witty]] start a London secondary school with an innovative curriculum. McCartney and Featherstone-Witty joined forces to create the [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]] (LIPA). The new company took over the Liverpool Institute Trust established in 1905.\n\nThe building was rebuilt (entirely in parts) behind its old facade and re-opened in 1996 under LIPA's name. The new institute is affiliated with [[Liverpool John Moores University]] and is no longer a Liverpool secondary school.\n\n==Art school==\n[[File:SUITCASE STATUARY IN FRONT OF THE LIVERPOOL ART INSTITUTE.jpg|thumb|Art School]]\nThe city's Art College had its origins as part of the Liverpool Institute. In 1883 a new building housing the School of Art was opened around the corner on Hope Street, adjacent to the principal building housing the High School on Mount Street. The Art College by which it was later known, took in talented students often without formal academic credentials (e.g. [[John Lennon]]) and the College eventually became one of the four constituent parts of the Liverpool Polytechnic in 1970 and later in 1992 [[Liverpool John Moores University]] (LJMU) with the School of Art and Design being housed in the [[Art and Design Academy]].\n\n==Liverpool Institute and music==\n{{Alumni|date=October 2019}}\nMusic and musical performances were a constant theme throughout the life of the school and the Mount St. building.

The Institute was first known as the '''Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts'''. In 1832 the name was shortened to the '''Liverpool Mechanics' Institution'''. The facade of the [[listed building]], the entrance hall and modified school hall remain after substantial internal reconstruction was completed in the early 1990s.\n\n==School history in brief==\nIts initial primary purpose as a [[Mechanics' Institute]] (one of many established about this time throughout the country) was to provide educational opportunities, mainly through evening classes, for working men. Lectures for the general public were also provided of wide interest covering topics ranging from [[Arctic]] exploration to [[Shakespeare]] and philosophy. Luminaries like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] delivered talks and readings in the main lecture hall (now the architecturally restructured Sir [[Paul McCartney]] Auditorium of [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts|LIPA]]).\n\nBy 1840 the Institution offered evening classes, lectures, a library and a boys' lower and upper school. By the 1850s a formal art school was evolving from the evening classes and in 1856 this diversity was recognised by another name change \u2013 The Liverpool Institute and School of Arts.\n\nA girls' school was founded and opened in 1844 under the name [[Liverpool Institute High School for Girls]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} It was housed in a merchant's mansion across the street from the boys' school in [[Blackburne House]] provided by the generosity of [[George Holt (cotton-broker)|George Holt]]<ref>{{cite web|title=About Blackburne House|url=http://www.blackburnehouse.co.uk/about-blackburne-house/|publisher=Blackburne House|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> and which was later (1872) donated to the school by his family in his memory. The school was one of the first which was open to the public in the country established exclusively for the [[education of girls]].\n\nIn 1905 the [[Liverpool City Council]] took over the management of the secondary schools when the LI Board of Governors presented the school and assets to the City. From then until its closure in 1985, the school was formally known as ''The Liverpool Institute High School for Boys'' or more familiarly as ''The Institute'' or ''The Inny'' to its pupils.\n\nIt was an English [[grammar school]] for boys ages 11 to 18 with an excellent academic reputation built up over more than a century. Its list of scholarships and places at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] runs to some 300 names \u2013 in addition to distinctions gained at [[the University of Liverpool]] and many other prominent British universities. The school was a true measure of Liverpool's intellectual capital, and its old boys could and can be found in later life in many fields of professional distinction including the law, the Church, armed forces, politics, academia, government and colonial administration as well as in trade and commerce.<ref name=Tiffen>A History of the Liverpool Institute Schools, Herbert J Tiffen, 1825\u20131935.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, future Beatles [[Paul MacCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] were educated at the school.<ref>Vincent Perez Benitez, ''The Words and Music of Paul McCartney: The Solo Years'' (Praeger, 2010, ISBN 978-0-313-34969-0), pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\n==Closure of the school==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe school was closed by the city council in 1985. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] nationally opposed grammar schools \u2013 see [[Anthony Crosland]]'s Circular of September 1965 required that Local Authorities bring forward schemes for comprehensive secondary education. As grammar school pupils were selected by examination at age 11, there was a long-standing push towards '[[comprehensive schools]]' (as non-selective schools were known) from that party when it took majority control of the City Council in 1983. Demand for secondary school places in the City had also dropped precipitously and there was a huge oversupply of school space as Liverpool's population contracted during the severe economic recession of the early 1980s.\n\nThe Deputy Leader of the Labour (Militant) Group on Council at the time was a former LI schoolboy [[Derek Hatton]] who had left without academic distinction in 1964 and with strong feelings of dislike towards the school.<ref>Derek Hatton, Inside Left, 1988</ref> However the man who was Chair of the Educational Committee at the time of the decision to close the school was Dominic Brady, whose qualifications for his position amounted to being a former school caretaker.\n\nAfter closure, the building stood empty and neglected, the roof leaking and the walls crumbling. In 1987 it was announced that the LI Trust (under control of Liverpool Council's Education Department) would grant use of the building and site to a new educational establishment. [[Paul McCartney]] had returned to his old school when with [[Wings (band)|Wings]] he had played a concert at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]] in 1979. After the school's closure in 1985, McCartney returned one night to reminisce about his school days, while he was writing his 'Liverpool Oratorio'. This visit is captured in 'Echoes'; a DVD which accompanies the ''Liverpool Oratoria'' box set. McCartney was determined to save the building somehow and during a conversation with [[Sir George Martin]], the idea of a 'fame school' emerged since Martin was helping [[Mark Featherstone-Witty]] start a London secondary school with an innovative curriculum. McCartney and Featherstone-Witty joined forces to create the [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]] (LIPA). The new company took over the Liverpool Institute Trust established in 1905.\n\nThe building was rebuilt (entirely in parts) behind its old facade and re-opened in 1996 under LIPA's name. This new institute is currently affiliated with [[LJMU]] and is no longer a Liverpool secondary school.\n\n==Art school==\n[[File:SUITCASE STATUARY IN FRONT OF THE LIVERPOOL ART INSTITUTE.jpg|thumb|Art School]]\nThe city's Art College had its origins as part of the Liverpool Institute. In 1883 a new building housing the School of Art was opened around the corner on Hope Street, adjacent to the principal building housing the High School on Mount Street. The Art College by which it was later known, took in talented students often without formal academic credentials (e.g. [[John Lennon]]) and the College eventually became one of the four constituent parts of the Liverpool Polytechnic in 1970 and later in 1992 [[Liverpool John Moores University]] (LJMU) with the School of Art and Design being housed in the [[Art and Design Academy]].\n\n==Liverpool Institute and music==\n{{Alumni|date=October 2019}}\nMusic and musical performances were a constant theme throughout the life of the school and the Mount St. building.
