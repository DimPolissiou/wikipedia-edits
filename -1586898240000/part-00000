The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, [[Pliny the Younger]], who at that point was staying at [[Misenum]], on the other side of the Bay of Naples about {{convert|29|km}} from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning.\n\nAround 1:00&nbsp;p.m., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, [[pyroclastic flow]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating the remaining population and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\n\n<blockquote>Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of [[Vesuvius]]; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancient-literature.com/rome_pliny_epistulae_VI16.html |title=Pliny the Younger, Epistulae VI.16 & VI.20 |website=Ancient Literature |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Stratigraphic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption.svg|350px|right|thumb|Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Modern coast lines are shown; [[Pliny the Younger]] was at [[Misenum]].]]\n\nSigur\u00f0sson, Cashdollar, and [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Sparks]] undertook a detailed stratigraphic study of the layers of ash, based on excavations and surveys, which was published in 1982. Their conclusion was that the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 unfolded in two phases, [[Vesuvian eruption|Vesuvian]] and [[Pelean eruption|Pelean]], which alternated six times. <ref>{{cite journal|first=Haraldur |last=Sigur\u00f0sson |first2=Stanford |last2=Cashdollar |first3=R.

Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep layer, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. [[Herculaneum]] and [[Oplontis]] received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments up to {{convert|20|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} deep. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nThe eruption is viewed as primarily [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]], where the chief energy supporting the blast column came from escaping steam created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, coming into contact with hot magma.\n\n====Timing of explosions====\n\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigur\u00f0sson and Casey concluded that an early explosion produced a column of ash and pumice which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum, which was upwind.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002}}</ref> Subsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents.\n\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing [[Rectina]] to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\n\n=== Magnetic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Wn\u0119trze krateru Wezuwiusz.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the crater of Vesuvius]]\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200&nbsp;samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the {{nowrap|deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}.</ref>}} The deposits were placed by [[pyroclastic density current]]s (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAll crystal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it [[ferromagnetic]], as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are [[magnetic dipole]]s, are held in alignment by being bound in a [[crystal]]line structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=10}}.</ref> Heating the material adds [[internal energy]] to it. At the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever [[magnetic field]] might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \"block out\" non-residual fields.\n\nA [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a [[spectrum]] of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in AD 79. The overall field of the sample was the [[vector sum]] of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\n\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of {{nowrap|{{convert|40|C-change|sigfig=1}}}} from {{convert|100|C|F|sigfig=2}} until it reached the low unblocking temperature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=8}}.</ref> Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \"fabric\" of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows:\n\n* On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in|sigfig=1}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}.</ref> It heated the roof tiles to {{convert|120|-|140|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}.</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\n\n* Early in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was {{convert|180|-|220|C|sigfig=2}}, minimum temperatures; of the second, {{convert|220|-|260|C|sigfig=2}}. The depositional temperature of the first was {{convert|140|-|300|C|sigfig=2}}. Upstream and downstream of the flow it was {{convert|300|-|360|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as {{convert|100|C|sigfig=3}}, the boiling point of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=14}}.</ref> The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\n\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one metre more of deposits fell over the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=15}}.</ref>\n\n==The Two Plinys==\n[[Image:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]\n\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by [[Pliny the Younger]], who was 17 at the time of the eruption,<ref>His 18th year by Roman reckoning, as they counted the first 12 months as the first year</ref> to the historian [[Tacitus]] and written some 25 years after the event.<ref>Delphi Complete Works of Pliny the Younger, Volume 28 of Delphi Ancient Classics</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= C.

[...] it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and spotted, according as it was either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders.}}\n\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor woke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\", which is evidence for a [[tsunami]]. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\n\n=== Pliny the Elder ===\n{{further information|Pliny the Elder}}\n\nPliny's uncle [[Pliny the Elder]] was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Bassus{{fact|April 2020}}) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.<ref name=PYVI.16/>\n\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice, and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \"[[Fortune favours the bold|Fortune favors the brave]]\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} from Pompeii), where [[Pomponianus]] was.<ref name=PYVI.16/> Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.<ref name=PYVI.16/> \n\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages.

They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again, but the wind had not changed.

His friends then departed, escaping ultimately by land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/pliny.htm | author = Richard V.

These people were concentrated in the vaults at a density as high as three per square metre and were all caught by the first surge, dying of thermal shock and partly carbonised by later and hotter surges.

The large majority of extant medieval manuscript copies \u2013 there are no surviving Roman copies \u2013 indicate a date corresponding to August 24, and from the discovery of the cities into the 21st century this was accepted by most scholars and by nearly all books written about Pompeii and Herculaneum for the general public.\n\nSince at least the late [[18th century]], a minority among archaeologists and other scientists have suggested that the eruption began ''after'' August 24, during the autumn, perhaps in October or November. In 1797 the researcher Carlo Rosini reported that excavations at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] had uncovered traces of fruits and [[braziers]] indicative of the autumn, not the summer. \n\nMore recently, in 1990 and 2001, archaeologists discovered more remnants of autumnal fruits (such as the pomegranate), the remains of victims of the eruption in heavy clothing, and large earthenware storage vessels laden with wine (at the time of their burial by Vesuvius). The wine-related discovery may show that the eruption was after the year's grape harvest and wine making.<ref name=\"journalvolcanology\">{{harvnb|Rolandi|2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a study of prevailing winds in Campania showed that the southeasterly debris pattern of the first-century eruption is quite consistent with an autumn event, and inconsistent with an August date.

Given the limited space on each coin, his achievements were stamped on the coins using an arcane encoding.

The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, [[Pliny the Younger]], who at that point was staying at [[Misenum]], on the other side of the Bay of Naples about {{convert|29|km}} from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning.\n\nAround 1:00&nbsp;p.m., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, [[pyroclastic flow]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating the remaining population and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\n\n<blockquote>Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of [[Vesuvius]]; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancient-literature.com/rome_pliny_epistulae_VI16.html |title=Pliny the Younger, Epistulae VI.16 & VI.20 |website=Ancient Literature |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Stratigraphic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption.svg|350px|right|thumb|Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Their conclusion was that the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 unfolded in two phases, [[Vesuvian eruption|Vesuvian]] and [[Pelean eruption|Pelean]], which alternated six times. <ref>{{cite journal|first=Haraldur |last=Sigur\u00f0sson |first2=Stanford |last2=Cashdollar |first3=R.

Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep layer, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. [[Herculaneum]] and [[Oplontis]] received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments up to {{convert|20|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} deep. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nThe eruption is viewed as primarily [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]], where the chief energy supporting the blast column came from escaping steam created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, coming into contact with hot magma.\n\n====Timing of explosions====\n\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigur\u00f0sson and Casey concluded that an early explosion produced a column of ash and pumice which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum, which was upwind.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002}}</ref> Subsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents.\n\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing [[Rectina]] to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\n\n=== Magnetic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Wn\u0119trze krateru Wezuwiusz.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the crater of Vesuvius]]\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200&nbsp;samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the {{nowrap|deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}.</ref>}} The deposits were placed by [[pyroclastic density current]]s (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAll crystal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it [[ferromagnetic]], as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are [[magnetic dipole]]s, are held in alignment by being bound in a [[crystal]]line structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=10}}.</ref> Heating the material adds [[internal energy]] to it. At the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever [[magnetic field]] might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \"block out\" non-residual fields.\n\nA [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a [[spectrum]] of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in AD 79. The overall field of the sample was the [[vector sum]] of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\n\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of {{nowrap|{{convert|40|C-change|sigfig=1}}}} from {{convert|100|C|F|sigfig=2}} until it reached the low unblocking temperature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=8}}.</ref> Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction.

Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\n\n* Early in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was {{convert|180|-|220|C|sigfig=2}}, minimum temperatures; of the second, {{convert|220|-|260|C|sigfig=2}}. The depositional temperature of the first was {{convert|140|-|300|C|sigfig=2}}. Upstream and downstream of the flow it was {{convert|300|-|360|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as {{convert|100|C|sigfig=3}}, the boiling point of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=14}}.</ref> The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\n\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one metre more of deposits fell over the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=15}}.</ref>\n\n==The Two Plinys==\n[[Image:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]\n\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by [[Pliny the Younger]], who was 17 at the time of the eruption,<ref>His 18th year by Roman reckoning, as they counted the first 12 months as the first year</ref> to the historian [[Tacitus]] and written some 25 years after the event.<ref>Delphi Complete Works of Pliny the Younger, Volume 28 of Delphi Ancient Classics</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= C.

[...] it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and spotted, according as it was either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders.}}\n\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor woke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\", which is evidence for a [[tsunami]]. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\n\n=== Pliny the Elder ===\n{{further information|Pliny the Elder}}\n\nPliny's uncle [[Pliny the Elder]] was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Bassus) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.<ref name=PYVI.16/>\n\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice, and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \"[[Fortune favours the bold|Fortune favors the brave]]\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} from Pompeii), where [[Pomponianus]] was.<ref name=PYVI.16/> Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.<ref name=PYVI.16/> \n\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress.<ref name=PYVI.16/> They woke Pliny, who had been napping and snoring loudly. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again, but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise, even with assistance. His friends then departed, escaping ultimately by land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/pliny.htm | author = Richard V.

How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery.

The large majority of extant medieval manuscript copies \u2013 there are no surviving Roman copies \u2013 indicate a date corresponding to August 24, and from the discovery of the cities into the 21st century this was accepted by most scholars and by nearly all books written about Pompeii and Herculaneum for the general public.\n\nSince at least the late [[18th century]], a minority among archaeologists and other scientists have suggested that the eruption began ''after'' August 24, during the autumn, perhaps in October or November. In 1797 the researcher Carlo Rosini reported that excavations at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] had uncovered traces of fruits and [[braziers]] indicative of the autumn, not the summer. \n\nMore recently, in 1990 and 2001, archaeologists discovered more remnants of autumnal fruits (such as the pomegranate), the remains of victims of the eruption in heavy clothing, and large earthenware storage vessels laden with wine (at the time of their burial by Vesuvius).

The TVF is a product of one of the most important events that transpired in the Cenozoic Era, the Indo-Asian continent-continent collision which occurred ca. 59 Ma. The result of the collision was the uplift of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] along with Asian continent acidification (the release of CO2 due to volcanic activity), global climate change, tectonism and volcanic activity associated with the TVF. Prior to continent collision during the Paleozoic, the Tengchong block was located along the Indian margin of the [[Gondwana]].

Founded in 1876 as a [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] school, it was originally the first college started by members of the [[Church of the Brethren]] as a center for vocational learning for those who could not afford formal education. Today, Juniata has about 1,600 students from 42 states and territories and 45 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juniata.edu/services/catalog/print_whole.html |title=Juniata College Online Catalog |publisher=Juniata College |date=2015 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Martin G. Brumbaugh (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Martin Grove Brumbaugh]]The Huntingdon [[Normal School]] was established by a spry young Huntingdon physician, Dr. Andrew B. Brumbaugh, and his two cousins, Henry and John Brumbaugh.  Henry provided a second-story room over his local print shop for classes, while John lodged and fed the college's first teacher, Jacob M. Zuck. Andrew was to \"provide students and furniture\".<ref name=JCWebHistory>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.juniata.edu/about/history/|website=Juniata College|publisher=Juniata College|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=TruthSetsFree>{{cite book|last1=Kaylor|first1=Earl C.|title=Truth Sets Free: A Centennial History of Juniata College, 1876-1976|date=1977|publisher=A.S.

Miller, and Gaius M. Brumbaugh, the only son of Andrew Brumbaugh.\n\nIn 1877, the school changed its name to \"Brethren Normal School.\"  At this time Zuck also discussed adding a \"Scientific Course\" and issuing \"Certificates of Graduation\". In 1879, classes moved into Founder's Hall, the school's first permanent building on the present-day campus then only known as \"The Building\".  On May 11 of same year, Jacob Zuck died from pneumonia at age 32 when he insisted on sleeping in the then unfinished Founders Hall without a heater.  James Quinter was than chosen to lead the school as the school's first president.<ref name=TruthSetsFree />\n\nThe college was renamed \"Juniata College\" in 1894 for the nearby [[Juniata River]], one of the principal tributaries of the [[Susquehanna River]], due to a ruling at the Brethren Church's Annual Meeting against using the term \"Brethren\" in naming a school.  The name Juniata College was made the schools legal name in 1896.<ref name=TruthSetsFree />\n\nIn 1895, [[Martin Grove Brumbaugh|Dr. Martin Grove Brumbaugh]], an 1881 graduate from Brethren Normal (Huntingdon Normal), took over the active presidency of Juniata until 1910.  During and after his tenure, Brumbaugh remained intimately connected to the college and reacquired the college's presidency in 1924, after having served as governor of Pennsylvania from 1915 to 1919 and as commissioner of education to Puerto Rico in 1900.<ref name=UncommonVisions>{{cite book|last1=Sigel|first1=Nancy|title=Juniata College: Uncommon Visions of Juniata's Past|date=2000|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-7385-0240-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uq9QHiHOuTEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nM.

Two new buildings since 2000 include the von Liebig Center for Science and the Suzanne von Liebig Theatre. Founders Hall, the first building on campus, has also been renovated recently.  Construction was finished in the summer of 2009 and uses underground geothermal energy to heat and cool the building. This building is recognized as a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold building.\n\n[[File:Nathan Hall.jpg|thumbnail|left|Nathan Hall]]\nThe newest building project on campus is Nathan Hall, a dormitory named in honor of longtime Juniata employee, Hilda Nathan. Hilda worked in the treasurer\u2019s office from 1946 to 1976. The new residence hall, which opened to students for the Fall 2014 semester, offers significant improvements in the areas of accessibility, community and sustainability. Nathan Hall has an elevator and is designed for accessibility throughout the building. The space also is designed to foster community with features such as informal gathering spaces and lounges within the building and outside.[[File:Carnegie museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|Carnegie Hall]] The dorm also was constructed using \"green\" technologies such as geothermal heating, energy-efficient lighting, plantings and green spaces. The building also offers a bike shelter to encourage less driving.\n\nOther off-campus sites include the Baker Peace Chapel (designed by [[Maya Lin]]) and the \"cliffs,\" which has views of the Juniata River.  The college also owns the Raystown Field Station, a 365-acre (1.48 km2) reserve on [http://raystown.org/ Raystown Lake], which includes an [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold building and two lodges for semester-long residential programs, often focused on environmental topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juniata.edu/services/station/LakesideCenter/Lakesidecenter_home.html |title=Juniata College- Raystown Field Station- Grove Farm |publisher=Juniata.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n\nCarnegie Hall was completed in 1907, paid for in part by a grant from U.S. Steel magnate [[Andrew Carnegie]] and served as a library for Juniata until 1963, when the College's current L.A. Beeghly Library was completed. The Museum houses a permanent collection, which includes works from the [[Hudson River School]], American portrait miniatures, as well as [[Old Master]] paintings and prints. The Museum hosts regional, national, and international exhibitions.\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Program of emphasis===\nJuniata College features a \"Program of Emphasis\" rather than the common [[Academic major]].  Within a certain course framework, students choose and create their own Program of Emphasis and graduate with a degree in it.  There are designated Programs of Emphasis that follow a set of courses (e.g. Environmental Science, Communication and Anthropology, etc.) or students may create their own with the approval of two faculty advisors.\n\n===Areas of study===\nJuniata is a liberal arts institution.  It has programs in a variety of areas, from the natural sciences to the arts, social sciences, and humanities.  Many students who enter Juniata for the strong science programs, however, find that they enjoy world culture, international programs, peace studies, politics, or a variety of other disciplines.  This varied combination allows students to explore different facets of the world.\n\nThe school has a 79% graduation rate; of those, 96% do so within four years.  Juniata also has a 95% acceptance rate to all postgraduate programs, including medical, podiatric, dental, occupational therapy, physical therapy, chiropractic, and law schools.\n\nSince 2003, Juniata has produced eight Academic All-Americans, five American Physiological Society Undergraduate Research Fellows, 20 Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholars, 19 Fulbright Scholars, 14 Goldwater Fellows, one Pickering Fellow, eight St. Andrew's Society Scholars, and one Davies-Jackson Scholar.  Juniata also perennially places at least one student as a Harvard Summer Research Scholar.\n\nNearly forty-five percent of Juniata students design their own program of emphasis, and Juniata offers study-abroad opportunities in 22 countries on 6 continents.\n\n===Rankings===\nJuniata College ranks 133rd in the 2015 Forbes.com College Rankings, ranks 36th in the 2014 Washington Monthly Best Bang for the Buck Rankings, ranks 105th in the 2014 [[U.S. News & World Report]] Rankings for Liberal Arts Colleges, and ranks 81st in [[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]] Magazine 2014 rankings for Best Values in Private Colleges.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nJuniata College has also been selected by the 2015 [[Princeton Review]] as one of the Best 379 Colleges, and has been mentioned in the following publications: [[Loren Pope]]'s [[Colleges That Change Lives]]; [[Kaplan, Inc.]]'s Insider's Guide to the 328 Most Interesting Colleges; Peterson's Competitive Colleges; Miriam Weinstein's Making A Difference College Guide: Outstanding Colleges to Help You Make a Better World; Barron's Best Buys in College Education; Leland Miles' Provoking Thought: What Colleges Should Do for Students; [[Elle Girl]] Magazine: Top 50 colleges that Dare to be Different; Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges; Don Asher's Cool Colleges, and the Fiske Guide to Colleges.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Kennedy.jpg|thumbnail|Memorial Gymnasium inside the Kennedy Sports & Recreation Center]]\nJuniata is a [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] collegiate sports institution.  It is well known for its volleyball program (Men's and Women's) and is also a charter member of the [[Landmark Conference]].  Juniata athletes compete in the Landmark Conference except for volleyball and football.  The Juniata Men's Volleyball Team competes in the [[Continental Volleyball Conference]] (formerly it competed in the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] winning several titles under, both, Division I and Division III sanctioning).  The Juniata Eagles Football Squad is a member of the [[Centennial Conference]].  Juniata had a school record of five Academic All-Americans in 2004\u20132005 academic year and 55 All-American honors since 1998.\n\nIn addition, \"College Hill\" sports 2 National Championships in Women's Volleyball (2004 & 2006).  Men's Volleyball boasts one EIVA Championship as an NCAA Division I exception (1992) and 6 National Championships as a Division III powerhouse (1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 & 2009).\n\nThe Goal Post Trophy goes to the winner of the annual football game with rival [[Susquehanna University]].  It is a section of the goal post that was torn down after the 1952 Juniata-Susquehanna game.  The visiting Indians (now Eagles) upset the Crusaders in Selinsgrove, and Juniata fans tore down the goal post after the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosusqu.com/information/traditions/index |title=GO SU! - Susquehanna |publisher=Gosusqu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>  At roughly 5 feet tall, it is one of the tallest trophies in college football.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Annual events===\nJuniata College has a tradition of campus-wide events dating back to its founding days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juniata.edu/life/traditions.html |title=Juniata College - Campus Life - Campus Traditions |publisher=Juniata.edu |accessdate=2013-11-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170842/http://www.juniata.edu/life/traditions.html |archivedate=2007-03-05 }}</ref>\n\n*'''Lobsterfest''', ''Established: 1988'' &mdash; Lobsterfest is held at the end of the first week of classes and welcomes students back to campus after summer break. Lobsterfest is a picnic that features [[American lobster|lobsters]] as the main course and live entertainment. In addition, the Student Organization Fair is held during Lobsterfest and gives new students the opportunity to see and sign up for campus clubs.\n[[File:Storming the Arch 062 (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|Storming of the Arch 2014]]\n*'''Storming of the Arch''', ''Established: Mid-1940s'' &mdash; Storming of the Arch takes place on the second Thursday of fall semester and is optional for any new freshmen. Freshmen gather on the center of the campus quad with the intention of charging the Cloister Arch and making it through to the other side, a mission complicated by a group of upperclassmen - \"defenders\" of the Arch.  Freshmen charge the Arch until they are all knocked down or someone gets through the gauntlet of upperclassmen. To date, only one student has made it through the arch, a 2018 graduate, Blair Altland. Storming of the Arch was canceled in the mid-1990s due to the number of students being injured but was reinstated by several officers of the Men's [[rugby football|rugby]] team who reorganized it as a charity event.\n*'''[[Mountain Day]]''', ''Established: 1896'' &mdash; Mountain Day is the oldest tradition at Juniata and occurs on an unannounced [[fall]] day.  The specific date of Mountain Day is not known to students nor faculty until the morning of the event; however, its possible date is a constant source of campus speculation.  On Mountain day, all classes are canceled and both students and faculty are shuttled to Raystown Lake, a popular destination in the area.  The day includes a picnic lunch, nature walks, crafts, music, swimming, boating, and a class vs. class tug-of-war.[[File:Mountain Day 018 (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|President Troha on a Slip n' Slide during Mountain Day 2014]]\n*'''[[Homecoming]] Weekend''', ''Established: 1923'' &mdash; Homecoming features alumni reunion activities, sporting events, and a class spirit competition. A unique aspect of Juniata's Homecoming celebration is the presentation of the Community Contribution Awards during half-time of the football game rather than having a [[Homecoming|Homecoming king and queen]].

This sing-along culminates with the singing of \"[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]\" with various sections of the dining hall acting out the different parts of the song. Tickets for the sections are sold first-come, first-served and students camp out during the week(s) prior in order to acquire their desired section (the \"Five Golden Rings\" section is very popular). The Madrigal \"line\" is typically an elaborate tent city on the lawn around the campus center. It is tradition for some to play pranks on the \"line.\" These pranks in past years have included: blowing air horns throughout the night, water balloons, flooding the lawn where the tents are located, playing recorded animal sounds, and gluing tent zippers shut.\n*'''Pig Roast''', ''Established: 1986'' &mdash; Pigroast is an annual barbecue held at Raystown Lake and is sponsored by the Men's rugby team with the support of the Women's Rugby team.

Founded in 1876 as a [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] school, it was originally the first college started by members of the [[Church of the Brethren]] as a center for vocational learning for those who could not afford formal education. Today, Juniata has about 1,600 students from 42 states and territories and 45 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juniata.edu/services/catalog/print_whole.html |title=Juniata College Online Catalog |publisher=Juniata College |date=2015 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Martin G.

Miller, and Gaius M. Brumbaugh, the only son of Andrew Brumbaugh.\n\nIn 1877 the school changed its name to \"Brethren Normal School.\"  At this time Zuck also discussed adding a \"Scientific Course\" and issuing \"Certificates of Graduation\". In 1879, classes moved into Founder's Hall, the school's first permanent building on the present-day campus then only known as \"The Building\".  On May 11 of same year, Jacob Zuck died from pneumonia at age 32 when he insisted on sleeping in the then unfinished Founders Hall without a heater.  James Quinter was than chosen to lead the school as the school's first president.<ref name=TruthSetsFree />\n\nThe college was renamed \"Juniata College\" in 1894 for the nearby [[Juniata River]], one of the principal tributaries of the [[Susquehanna River]], due to a ruling at the Brethren Church's Annual Meeting against using the term \"Brethren\" in naming a school.  The name Juniata College was made the schools legal name in 1896.<ref name=TruthSetsFree />\n\nIn 1895, [[Martin Grove Brumbaugh|Dr. Martin Grove Brumbaugh]], an 1881 graduate from Brethren Normal (Huntingdon Normal), took over the active presidency of Juniata until 1910.  During and after his tenure, Brumbaugh remained intimately connected to the college and reacquired the college's presidency in 1924, after having served as governor of Pennsylvania from 1915 to 1919 and as commissioner of education to Puerto Rico in 1900.<ref name=UncommonVisions>{{cite book|last1=Sigel|first1=Nancy|title=Juniata College: Uncommon Visions of Juniata's Past|date=2000|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-7385-0240-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uq9QHiHOuTEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nM.

Two new buildings since 2000 include the von Liebig Center for Science and the Suzanne von Liebig Theatre. Founders Hall, the first building on campus, has also been renovated recently.  Construction was finished in the summer of 2009 and uses underground geothermal energy to heat and cool the building. This building is recognized as a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold building.\n\n[[File:Nathan Hall.jpg|thumbnail|left|Nathan Hall]]\nThe newest building project on campus is Nathan Hall, a dormitory named in honor of longtime Juniata employee, Hilda Nathan. Hilda worked in the treasurer\u2019s office from 1946 to 1976. The new residence hall, which opened to students for the Fall 2014 semester, offers significant improvements in the areas of accessibility, community and sustainability. Nathan Hall has an elevator and is designed for accessibility throughout the building. The space also is designed to foster community with features such as informal gathering spaces and lounges within the building and outside.[[File:Carnegie museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|Carnegie Hall]] The dorm also was constructed using \"green\" technologies such as geothermal heating, energy-efficient lighting, plantings and green spaces. The building also offers a bike shelter to encourage less driving.\n\nOther off-campus sites include the Baker Peace Chapel (designed by [[Maya Lin]]) and the \"cliffs,\" which has views of the Juniata River.  The college also owns the Raystown Field Station, a 365-acre (1.48 km2) reserve on [http://raystown.org/ Raystown Lake], which includes an [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold building and two lodges for semester-long residential programs, often focused on environmental topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juniata.edu/services/station/LakesideCenter/Lakesidecenter_home.html |title=Juniata College- Raystown Field Station- Grove Farm |publisher=Juniata.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n\nCarnegie Hall was completed in 1907, paid for in part by a grant from U.S. Steel magnate [[Andrew Carnegie]] and served as a library for Juniata until 1963, when the College's current L.A. Beeghly Library was completed. The Museum houses a permanent collection, which includes works from the [[Hudson River School]], American portrait miniatures, as well as [[Old Master]] paintings and prints. The Museum hosts regional, national, and international exhibitions.\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Program of emphasis===\nJuniata College features a \"Program of Emphasis\" rather than the common [[Academic major]].  Within a certain course framework, students choose and create their own Program of Emphasis and graduate with a degree in it.  There are designated Programs of Emphasis that follow a set of courses (e.g. Environmental Science, Communication and Anthropology, etc.) or students may create their own with the approval of two faculty advisors.\n\n===Areas of study===\nJuniata is a liberal arts institution.  It has programs in a variety of areas, from the natural sciences to the arts, social sciences, and humanities.  Many students who enter Juniata for the strong science programs, however, find that they enjoy world culture, international programs, peace studies, politics, or a variety of other disciplines.  This varied combination allows students to explore different facets of the world.\n\nThe school has a 79% graduation rate; of those, 96% do so within four years.  Juniata also has a 95% acceptance rate to all postgraduate programs, including medical, podiatric, dental, occupational therapy, physical therapy, chiropractic, and law schools.\n\nSince 2003, Juniata has produced eight Academic All-Americans, five American Physiological Society Undergraduate Research Fellows, 20 Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholars, 19 Fulbright Scholars, 14 Goldwater Fellows, one Pickering Fellow, eight St. Andrew's Society Scholars, and one Davies-Jackson Scholar.  Juniata also perennially places at least one student as a Harvard Summer Research Scholar.\n\nNearly forty-five percent of Juniata students design their own program of emphasis, and Juniata offers study-abroad opportunities in 22 countries on 6 continents.\n\n===Rankings===\nJuniata College ranks 133rd in the 2015 Forbes.com College Rankings, ranks 36th in the 2014 Washington Monthly Best Bang for the Buck Rankings, ranks 105th in the 2014 [[U.S. News & World Report]] Rankings for Liberal Arts Colleges, and ranks 81st in [[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]] Magazine 2014 rankings for Best Values in Private Colleges.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nJuniata College has also been selected by the 2015 [[Princeton Review]] as one of the Best 379 Colleges, and has been mentioned in the following publications: [[Loren Pope]]'s [[Colleges That Change Lives]]; [[Kaplan, Inc.]]'s Insider's Guide to the 328 Most Interesting Colleges; Peterson's Competitive Colleges; Miriam Weinstein's Making A Difference College Guide: Outstanding Colleges to Help You Make a Better World; Barron's Best Buys in College Education; Leland Miles' Provoking Thought: What Colleges Should Do for Students; [[Elle Girl]] Magazine: Top 50 colleges that Dare to be Different; Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges; Don Asher's Cool Colleges, and the Fiske Guide to Colleges.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Kennedy.jpg|thumbnail|Memorial Gymnasium inside the Kennedy Sports & Recreation Center]]\nJuniata is a [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] collegiate sports institution.  It is well known for its volleyball program (Men's and Women's) and is also a charter member of the [[Landmark Conference]].  Juniata athletes compete in the Landmark Conference except for volleyball and football.  The Juniata Men's Volleyball Team competes in the [[Continental Volleyball Conference]] (formerly it competed in the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] winning several titles under, both, Division I and Division III sanctioning).  The Juniata Eagles Football Squad is a member of the [[Centennial Conference]].  Juniata had a school record of five Academic All-Americans in 2004\u20132005 academic year and 55 All-American honors since 1998.\n\nIn addition, \"College Hill\" sports 2 National Championships in Women's Volleyball (2004 & 2006).  Men's Volleyball boasts one EIVA Championship as an NCAA Division I exception (1992) and 6 National Championships as a Division III powerhouse (1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 & 2009).\n\nThe Goal Post Trophy goes to the winner of the annual football game with rival [[Susquehanna University]].  It is a section of the goal post that was torn down after the 1952 Juniata-Susquehanna game.  The visiting Indians (now Eagles) upset the Crusaders in Selinsgrove, and Juniata fans tore down the goal post after the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosusqu.com/information/traditions/index |title=GO SU! - Susquehanna |publisher=Gosusqu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>  At roughly 5 feet tall, it is one of the tallest trophies in college football.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Annual events===\nJuniata College has a tradition of campus-wide events dating back to its founding days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juniata.edu/life/traditions.html |title=Juniata College - Campus Life - Campus Traditions |publisher=Juniata.edu |accessdate=2013-11-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170842/http://www.juniata.edu/life/traditions.html |archivedate=2007-03-05 }}</ref>\n\n*'''Lobsterfest''', ''Established: 1988'' &mdash; Lobsterfest is held at the end of the first week of classes and welcomes students back to campus after summer break. Lobsterfest is a picnic that features [[American lobster|lobsters]] as the main course and live entertainment. In addition, the Student Organization Fair is held during Lobsterfest and gives new students the opportunity to see and sign up for campus clubs.\n[[File:Storming the Arch 062 (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|Storming of the Arch 2014]]\n*'''Storming of the Arch''', ''Established: Mid-1940s'' &mdash; Storming of the Arch takes place on the second Thursday of fall semester and is optional for any new freshmen. Freshmen gather on the center of the campus quad with the intention of charging the Cloister Arch and making it through to the other side, a mission complicated by a group of upperclassmen - \"defenders\" of the Arch.  Freshmen charge the Arch until they are all knocked down or someone gets through the gauntlet of upperclassmen. To date, only one student has made it through the arch, a 2018 graduate, Blair Altland. Storming of the Arch was canceled in the mid-1990s due to the number of students being injured but was reinstated by several officers of the Men's [[rugby football|rugby]] team who reorganized it as a charity event.\n*'''[[Mountain Day]]''', ''Established: 1896'' &mdash; Mountain Day is the oldest tradition at Juniata and occurs on an unannounced [[fall]] day.  The specific date of Mountain Day is not known to students nor faculty until the morning of the event; however, its possible date is a constant source of campus speculation.  On Mountain day, all classes are canceled and both students and faculty are shuttled to Raystown Lake, a popular destination in the area.  The day includes a picnic lunch, nature walks, crafts, music, swimming, boating, and a class vs. class tug-of-war.[[File:Mountain Day 018 (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|President Troha on a Slip n' Slide during Mountain Day 2014]]\n*'''[[Homecoming]] Weekend''', ''Established: 1923'' &mdash; Homecoming features alumni reunion activities, sporting events, and a class spirit competition. A unique aspect of Juniata's Homecoming celebration is the presentation of the Community Contribution Awards during half-time of the football game rather than having a [[Homecoming|Homecoming king and queen]].  The award recognizes students who have made outstanding community service contributions, both on-campus and in their local communities.\n*'''Family Weekend''', ''Established: 1936'' &mdash; Usually occurring on a weekend in September, Family Weekend is a chance for students' parents and families to visit the campus. The weekend is filled with activities such as picnics, sporting events, cultural events, tours, etc.\n*'''Mr. Juniata Pageant''', ''Established: 1997'' &mdash; Sponsored by [[Circle K International|Circle K]], the Mr. Juniata Pageant is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] spoof of beauty pageants with men from each class competing for the coveted Mr. Juniata crown.

This holiday tradition starts with a meal served to the students by the faculty and staff of their choosing. After dinner,  guests are entertained with performances by members of the campus community and the group participates in a holiday [[Carol (music)|carol]] sing. This sing-along culminates with the singing of \"[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]\" with various sections of the dining hall acting out the different parts of the song. Tickets for the sections are sold first-come, first-served and students camp out during the week(s) prior in order to acquire their desired section (the \"Five Golden Rings\" section is very popular). The Madrigal \"line\" is typically an elaborate tent city on the lawn around the campus center. It is tradition for some to play pranks on the \"line.\" These pranks in past years have included: blowing air horns throughout the night, water balloons, flooding the lawn where the tents are located, playing recorded animal sounds, and gluing tent zippers shut.\n*'''Pig Roast''', ''Established: 1986'' &mdash; Pigroast is an annual barbecue held at Raystown Lake and is sponsored by the Men's rugby team with the support of the Women's Rugby team. This barbecue also serves as an opportunity for the men's rugby club to play a match against the alumni who return for the event. It occurs the weekend before finals week and serves as the last hurrah for students; particularly the senior class.

Scawen obtained a small majority over Walter by the second votes of Onslow\u2019s supporters. In the [[1734 British general election|1734 general election]] he was re-elected unopposed with Onslow. He voted regularly with the Opposition. He did not stand again in [[1741 British general election|1741]] but in 1747 he used his interest at [[Mitchell (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitchell]] to bring in Thomas Clarke for that borough at the request of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. He also brought in his son [[James Scawen]] at Mitchell in 1761.<ref name = HOP/>\n\nScawen died on 11 February 1774.<ref name = HOP/> His daughter Tryphena married  [[Henry Bathurst, 2nd Earl Bathurst]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|gb}}\n{{s-bef\n | before  = [[John Walter (died 1736)|John Walter]]\n | before2 = [[Sir Nicholas Carew, 1st Baronet|Sir Nicholas Carew]]\n}}\n{{s-title\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Surrey (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey]]\n | years = 1727\u2013[[1741 British general election|1741]]\n | with  =  [[John Walter (died 1736)|John Walter]] 1727\n| with2  =  [[Arthur Onslow]] 1727-1741\n}}\n{{s-aft\n | after  = [[Arthur Onslow]]\n | after2 = [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore|The Lord Baltimore]]\n}}\n\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scawen, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1774 deaths]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1727\u20131734]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1734\u20131741]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Scawen_(died_1774)"}
