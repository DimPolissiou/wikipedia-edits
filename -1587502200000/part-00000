It was first [[Scientific description|described]] in 1910 by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]], who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about its distribution and ecology. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the presence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. The mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor'', who based his description of the species on four adult male [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Vietnam.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=O. |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> Between 1910 and 2003 this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil'').

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] in 1910 by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]], who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about its distribution and ecology. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct.

Wisconsin competes in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the West Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] (Big Ten). The Badgers have competed in the Big Ten since its formation in 1896. They play their home games at [[Camp Randall Stadium]], the fourth-oldest stadium in college football. Wisconsin is one of 26 College football programs to win 700 or more games. Wisconsin has had two [[Heisman Trophy]] winners, [[Alan Ameche]] and [[Ron Dayne]], and have had Eleven former players inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. As of October 19, 2019, the Badgers have an all-time record of 711\u2013496\u201353.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/w/wisconsin/yearly_totals.php|title=Wisconsin Historical Data|work=cfbdatawarehouse.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Wisconsin Badgers football seasons}}\n[[File:Pat O'Dea.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Pat O'Dea|Pat \"Kangaroo Kicker\" O'Dea]]]][[File:Wisconsin1903FootballTeam.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The 1903 team]]\n\n===Team name origin===\nThe team's nickname originates in the early history of Wisconsin. In the 1820s and 1830s, [[prospecting|prospectors]] came to the state looking for minerals, primarily lead. Without shelter in the winter, the miners had to \"live like badgers\" in tunnels burrowed into hillsides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/traditions/notables_120.html|title=UW Badgers|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===The early years (1889\u20131912)===\nThe first Badger football team took the field in 1889, losing the only two games it played that season. In 1890, Wisconsin earned its first victory with a 106\u20130 drubbing of Whitewater Normal School (now the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater]]), still the most lopsided win in school history.  However, the very next week the Badgers suffered what remains their most lopsided defeat, a humiliating 63\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[University of Minnesota]]. Since then, the Badgers and Gophers have met 127 times, making Wisconsin vs Minnesota the most-played rivalry in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&SPSID=39876&SPID=3280&DB_OEM_ID=8400&ATCLID=271627|title=Paul Bunyan's Axe|publisher=The Official Website of Minnesota Athletics|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\nUpon the formation of the [[Big Ten]] conference in 1896, Wisconsin became the first-ever conference champion with a 7\u20131\u20131 record. Over the next ten years, the Badgers won or shared the conference title three more times (1897, 1901, and 1906), and recorded their first undefeated season, going 9\u20130\u20130 (1901). With the exception of their second undefeated season in 1912, in which they won their fifth Big Ten title.\n\n===Moderate successes  (1913\u20131941)===\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\nThe 1912 season would be their last conference title until 1952. The team posted mostly winning seasons over the next several seasons however.\n\n===The climb back to dominance (1942\u20131962)===\n1942 was an important year for Wisconsin football. On October 24, the #6 ranked Badgers defeated the #1 ranked [[1942 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State Buckeyes]] at [[Camp Randall]], catapulting Wisconsin to the #2 spot in the [[Associated Press|AP]] poll. Unfortunately for the Badgers, their national championship hopes were dashed in a 6\u20130 defeat by the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa Hawkeyes]] the following week. Nevertheless, Wisconsin won the remainder of its games, finishing the season 8\u20131\u20131 and #3 in the AP, while garnering the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] vote for National Champion, giving the program its only National Championship to date (The AP National Champions were the Ohio State Buckeyes, whom Wisconsin beat during the season). Afterwards, the Badgers struggled to regain their momentum, with their efforts hampered by many of their star players leaving as a result of [[World War II]]. In the late 1940s, fans began insisting that head coach [[Harry Stuhldreher]] resign, many times chanting \"Goodbye Harry\", especially during 1948, where the Badgers finished 2-7. Stuhldreher stepped down as head coach, while keeping his duties as athletic director. Stuhldreher then named [[Ivy Williamson]] as head coach\n\nThe Badgers experienced great success during the 1950s under Williamson, finishing in the AP Top 25 eight times that decade. In one stretch, from 1950-1954, the Badgers went 26-8-3. The Badgers' success during those seasons was defined by a stout defense, dubbed \"The Hard Rocks\", which usually finished in the top 5 of the nation in overall defense, including leading the nation in 1951. In 1952, the team received its first #1 ranking by the Associated Press. That season, the Badgers again claimed the Big Ten title and earned their first trip to the [[1953 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]]. There they were defeated 7\u20130 by the [[1952 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]], and would finish the season ranked #11 in the AP. In 1954 after a 7-2 season, Wisconsin's [[Alan Ameche]] became the first Badger to win the Heisman Trophy. Ivy Williamson stepped down as head coach in 1955 to become athletic director, and was replaced by his former assistant coach, Milt Bruhn. Bruhn would continue Wisconsin's success, after an initial setback with a 1-5-3 record in 1956. Wisconsin returned to the [[1960 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] as Big Ten Champions in 1959, but fell to the [[1959 Washington Huskies football team|Washington Huskies]], 44-8.\n\nContinuing under the direction of Bruhn in 1962, the Badgers had another landmark season, spearheaded by the passing combination of [[Ron Vander Kelen]] to All-American [[Pat Richter]]. The Badgers standout victory was an upset of #1-ranked Northwestern, who were coached then by the legendary [[Ara Parseghian]]. The Badgers finished 8-1, earned their eighth Big Ten title, and faced the top-ranked [[1962 USC Trojans football team|USC Trojans]] in the [[1963 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]]. Despite a narrow 42\u201337 defeat, the Badgers still ended the season ranked #2 in both the AP and Coaches polls (post-bowl rankings were not introduced until later in the decade).\n\n===Limited successes (1963\u20131989)===\nFollowing the successful 1962 campaign, Wisconsin football scuffled, and Milt Bruhn resigned in 1966 after three straight losing seasons. Wisconsin chose former assistant coach [[John Coatta]]. The Badgers finished even worse under Coatta, going winless for 23 straight games from 1967-1969, and winning only 3 games overall during Coatta's short reign, each of the wins occurring during the 1969 season. What stung even worse for Badger fans during the three season, was the coach that Wisconsin supposedly turned down for the head coaching role, [[Bo Schembechler]], who would become a coaching legend at Michigan.\n\nIn 1970, new athletic director Elroy Hirsch named John Jardine as head coach. While the Badgers weren't a consistent winner under Jardine, the program regained stability, and also brought excitement in running backs Rufus \"Roadrunner\" Ferguson and Billy Marek. The Badgers went 37-47-3 under Jardine, who stepped down in 1977.\n\nAfter more subpar seasons from 1978-1980, the team had a string of seven-win seasons from 1981\u201384 under [[Dave McClain (American football)|Dave McClain]]. During that time the Badgers played in the [[1981 Garden State Bowl|Garden State Bowl]] (1981), [[1982 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]] (1982), and [[1984 Hall of Fame Classic Bowl|Hall of Fame Classic Bowl]] (1984).  McClain's death during spring practice in 1986 sent the Badgers into free fall.  From 1986 to 1990, the Badgers won a total of nine games.\n\n===Barry Alvarez era, \"From Red Ink to Roses\" (1990\u20132005)===\n\nBy the end of the 1989 season, the Wisconsin football program was in disarray, shouldering a debt of over $2 million and with only 30,000 fans attending games at the 77,000-capacity stadium. New athletic director Pat Richter named [[Barry Alvarez]], the defensive coordinator at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], as the new head coach. To bring stability and interest to the program again, Alvarez targeted the top high school players in Wisconsin, \"building a wall\" around the state, and also encouraged players not recruited to join the program as walk-ons. Though Alvarez won his first game as head coach over Ball State, the Badgers finished 1-10 in 1990. The Badgers finished 5-6 in the next two seasons, but there were encouraging signs for the future. They were actually in bowl contention on the last day of the 1992 season, but a narrow loss to Northwestern kept them from going to a bowl. \n\nEverything finally came together for the Badgers in 1993. They steamrolled through the season, finishing 10-1-1, winning their first Big Ten championship since 1962 and beating [[1993 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] 21\u201316 to claim their first [[1994 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] victory.\n\nAfter the surprise success of 1993, the Badgers fell back into mediocrity, though remaining competitive, going 2-1 in bowl games from 1994 to 1997, with victories in the Hall of Fame Bowl in 1994, and the Copper Bowl in 1996. Alvarez retooled the team with a new batch of talented recruits during this stretch of seasons, and they came to full fruition in 1998 and 1999. Among the standouts were cornerback [[Jamar Fletcher]], wide receiver [[Chris Chambers]], quarterback [[Brooks Bollinger]], offensive linemen [[Aaron Gibson]], [[Chris McIntosh]], and [[Mark Tauscher]], and running back [[Ron Dayne]]. With \"The Great Dayne\" leading the way, the Badgers won back-to-back Big Ten championships and back-to-back Rose Bowls over UCLA in [[1999 Rose Bowl|1999]] and Stanford in [[2000 Rose Bowl|2000]]. The 1998 team won a school-record 11 games, while the 1999 team won its first outright Big Ten title since 1962. Ron Dayne set a new NCAA record for career rushing yardage, and won the Heisman Trophy in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, there were hopes of the Badgers winning their third consecutive Big Ten championship and an unprecedented three straight Rose Bowls. However early in the season, Wisconsin's football and basketball programs were hit with \"The Shoe Box scandal\", when a local shoe store gave university athletes discounts on footwear. Wisconsin athletic programs were put on five years of probation and several players were suspended by the NCAA. The Badgers finished 9-4, with a victory over UCLA in the Sun Bowl.\n\nDue to the loss of scholarships as a result of the NCAA investigation, the Badgers struggled through the 2001-2003 seasons, never finishing higher than seventh in the Big Ten. The Badgers returned to the top 20 in the AP polls in 2004 and 2005, with a victory in the Capitol One Bowl in 2005. In 2004, Alvarez was named athletic director, replacing the retiring Pat Richter. The strain of holding both roles became too much for Alvarez, and he stepped down as head coach after the 2005 season.\n\nAlvarez coached the Badgers for 16 seasons, finishing with a 118-73-4 record, three times finishing in the Top 10 in the AP polls, and the only Big Ten head coach to win back-to-back Rose Bowls.\n\n===Bret Bielema era (2006\u20132012)===\nFollowing the 2005 season, Alvarez resigned as head coach in order to focus on his duties as athletic director, a position he had assumed in 2004.  He named his defensive coordinator, [[Bret Bielema]], as his successor. Wisconsin's 2006 team went 12-1 and won the Capital One Bowl over Arkansas 17-14. Wisconsin finished the season ranked 5th in coaches poll and 7th in the AP Poll. From 2006 to 2011, Bielema led the Badgers to six consecutive bowl appearances, going 2\u20134. In 2010, the Badgers won a share of the Big Ten Championship and returned to the [[2011 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] for the first time since 2000.  There they were defeated 21\u201319 by the #3 ranked [[2010 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU Horned Frogs]].  In 2011, the Badgers were once again crowned Big Ten Champs when they defeated Michigan State in the first-ever [[2011 Big Ten Football Championship Game|conference championship game]]. The victory sent Wisconsin back to the [[2012 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] for a second consecutive year, where they were defeated by the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] champion [[2011 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]], 45-38.\n\nThe 2012 season ended with the Badgers winning a third consecutive Big Ten title.  Despite finishing with a 7-5 record and third in the Leaders Division, the Badgers advanced to the Big Ten Championship game by virtue of the fact that [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] were ineligible for postseason play.  A dominating rushing performance led Wisconsin to a 70-31 victory over #12 ranked [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the Big Ten Championship game.

After the season, Wilcox left to take the head coaching job at Cal.\n\nWisconsin came into the 2017 season ranked #9 in the AP poll and was ranked in the top 10 all season. Undefeated during the regular season, the Badgers were ranked fourth in the nation before narrowly losing the Big 10 championship to Ohio State. Despite failing to reach the College Football Playoff, the Badgers rebounded to win the [[2017 Orange Bowl]] over Miami to finish the season with a 13-1 record, their best record since the 2007 season. Wisconsin was ranked as high as 3rd in the nation in week 14 in the AP poll and Coaches poll and received 10 first place votes in the AP poll and 21 first place votes in the Coaches poll. Wisconsin finished the season ranked 6th in the nation. \n\nThere were high expectations the next season as Wisconsin came into the 2018 campaign ranked #4 in the AP poll. However, injuries and inexperience, alongside poor quarterback play, derailed a promising season as the Badgers finished with a 7-5 regular season record, including a loss to Minnesota, which resulted in Wisconsin losing Paul Bunyan\u2019s Axe for the first time since the 2003 season. The Badgers finished the season with a win in a rematch against Miami in the [[2018 Pinstripe Bowl]] to finish 8-5. In the offseason, former starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook transferred to Florida State after an up and down 2018 performance. Wisconsin came into the 2019 season ranked #19 in the AP Poll and shut out 4 teams en route to a 10-2 finish in the regular season and won the Big Ten West, including games vs ranked Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota and were ranked #8 in the AP Poll going in the Big Ten Championship vs #1 Ohio State.

Much prestige was always associated with the game, and the significance was emphasized with its place on the schedule. Between 1933 and 1982, the Wisconsin-Minnesota game was always the final regular-season contest for each school. The series took an added twist in 1948 when more than state bragging rights were on the line. After a 16-0 setback that season, the Wisconsin lettermen's group, the National 'W' Club, presented Minnesota with an axe wielded by Paul Bunyan. He was the mythical giant of Midwestern lumber camps. Each year since, the winner of the annual battle between the Big Ten rivals is presented with the axe, complete with scores inscribed on the handle, for display on its campus.\nWisconsin leads the series at 61-60-8.<ref name=\"Wisconsin-Minnesota-record\"/>\n\n===Iowa===\n{{main article|Iowa\u2013Wisconsin football rivalry}}\nIowa is Wisconsin's other archrival. Although the rivalry started in 1894, the Heartland Trophy was inaugurated in 2004 and goes each year to the winner. The trophy was designed and crafted by artist and former Iowa football player Frank Strub. The trophy, which is a bull mounted on a walnut base (native to both Wisconsin and Iowa), has been inscribed with the scores of all games in the long-time series. With Big Ten expansion, the Wisconsin and Iowa football teams were placed in separate divisions, thus ending their annual rivalry. However, with the addition of Maryland and Rutgers, Iowa and Wisconsin were placed back in the same division in 2014. Wisconsin leads the series at 48-43-2.\n\n===Nebraska===\n{{main article|Nebraska\u2013Wisconsin football rivalry}}\n[[File:Chris Borland tackles Taylor Martinez.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Wisconsin linebacker [[Chris Borland]] tackles Nebraska quarterback [[Taylor Martinez]] during the [[2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]]]\nNebraska is Wisconsin's newest rival. With the inclusion of the Cornhuskers in the Big Ten in 2011 the first three games between the two programs were significant, the third being the [[2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] where the unranked Badgers defeated the heavily favored #14 ranked Cornhuskers, 70-31. Prior to their next matchup in 2014, the University of Nebraska and the University of Wisconsin announced that moving forward the two schools would play for the Freedom Trophy. The trophy sits on a wooden base and features a depiction of Nebraska's Memorial Stadium on one side and Wisconsin's Camp Randall Stadium on the other.  The trophy has an inscription honoring the nation's veterans and symbolizes that Memorial Stadium was built in their honor at Nebraska while Camp Randall Stadium in Wisconsin was built on the site of a former Civil War training site.  The score of each year's contest is inscribed on the trophy.

Wisconsin competes in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the West Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] (Big Ten). The Badgers have competed in the Big Ten since its formation in 1896. They play their home games at [[Camp Randall Stadium]], the fourth-oldest stadium in college football. Wisconsin is one of 26 College football programs to win 700 or more games. Wisconsin has had two [[Heisman Trophy]] winners, [[Alan Ameche]] and [[Ron Dayne]], and have had Eleven former players inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. As of October 19, 2019, the Badgers have an all-time record of 711\u2013496\u201353.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/w/wisconsin/yearly_totals.php|title=Wisconsin Historical Data|work=cfbdatawarehouse.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Wisconsin Badgers football seasons}}\n[[File:Pat O'Dea.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Pat O'Dea|Pat \"Kangaroo Kicker\" O'Dea]]]][[File:Wisconsin1903FootballTeam.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The 1903 team]]\n\n===Team name origin===\nThe team's nickname originates in the early history of Wisconsin. In the 1820s and 1830s, [[prospecting|prospectors]] came to the state looking for minerals, primarily lead. Without shelter in the winter, the miners had to \"live like badgers\" in tunnels burrowed into hillsides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/traditions/notables_120.html|title=UW Badgers|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===The early years (1889\u20131912)===\nThe first Badger football team took the field in 1889, losing the only two games it played that season. In 1890, Wisconsin earned its first victory with a 106\u20130 drubbing of Whitewater Normal School (now the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater]]), still the most lopsided win in school history.  However, the very next week the Badgers suffered what remains their most lopsided defeat, a humiliating 63\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[University of Minnesota]]. Since then, the Badgers and Gophers have met 127 times, making Wisconsin vs Minnesota the most-played rivalry in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&SPSID=39876&SPID=3280&DB_OEM_ID=8400&ATCLID=271627|title=Paul Bunyan's Axe|publisher=The Official Website of Minnesota Athletics|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\nUpon the formation of the [[Big Ten]] conference in 1896, Wisconsin became the first-ever conference champion with a 7\u20131\u20131 record. Over the next ten years, the Badgers won or shared the conference title three more times (1897, 1901, and 1906), and recorded their first undefeated season, going 9\u20130\u20130 (1901). With the exception of their second undefeated season in 1912, in which they won their fifth Big Ten title.\n\n===Moderate successes  (1913\u20131941)===\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\nThe 1912 season would be their last conference title until 1952. The team posted mostly winning seasons over the next several seasons however.\n\n===The climb back to dominance (1942\u20131962)===\n1942 was an important year for Wisconsin football. On October 24, the #6 ranked Badgers defeated the #1 ranked [[1942 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State Buckeyes]] at [[Camp Randall]], catapulting Wisconsin to the #2 spot in the [[Associated Press|AP]] poll. Unfortunately for the Badgers, their national championship hopes were dashed in a 6\u20130 defeat by the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa Hawkeyes]] the following week. Nevertheless, Wisconsin won the remainder of its games, finishing the season 8\u20131\u20131 and #3 in the AP, while garnering the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] vote for National Champion, giving the program its only National Championship to date (The AP National Champions were the Ohio State Buckeyes, whom Wisconsin beat during the season). Afterwards, the Badgers struggled to regain their momentum, with their efforts hampered by many of their star players leaving as a result of [[World War II]]. In the late 1940s, fans began insisting that head coach [[Harry Stuhldreher]] resign, many times chanting \"Goodbye Harry\", especially during 1948, where the Badgers finished 2-7. Stuhldreher stepped down as head coach, while keeping his duties as athletic director. Stuhldreher then named [[Ivy Williamson]] as head coach\n\nThe Badgers experienced great success during the 1950s under Williamson, finishing in the AP Top 25 eight times that decade. In one stretch, from 1950-1954, the Badgers went 26-8-3. The Badgers' success during those seasons was defined by a stout defense, dubbed \"The Hard Rocks\", which usually finished in the top 5 of the nation in overall defense, including leading the nation in 1951. In 1952, the team received its first #1 ranking by the Associated Press. That season, the Badgers again claimed the Big Ten title and earned their first trip to the [[1953 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]]. There they were defeated 7\u20130 by the [[1952 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]], and would finish the season ranked #11 in the AP. In 1954 after a 7-2 season, Wisconsin's [[Alan Ameche]] became the first Badger to win the Heisman Trophy. Ivy Williamson stepped down as head coach in 1955 to become athletic director, and was replaced by his former assistant coach, Milt Bruhn. Bruhn would continue Wisconsin's success, after an initial setback with a 1-5-3 record in 1956. Wisconsin returned to the [[1960 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] as Big Ten Champions in 1959, but fell to the [[1959 Washington Huskies football team|Washington Huskies]], 44-8.\n\nContinuing under the direction of Bruhn in 1962, the Badgers had another landmark season, spearheaded by the passing combination of [[Ron Vander Kelen]] to All-American [[Pat Richter]]. The Badgers standout victory was an upset of #1-ranked Northwestern, who were coached then by the legendary [[Ara Parseghian]]. The Badgers finished 8-1, earned their eighth Big Ten title, and faced the top-ranked [[1962 USC Trojans football team|USC Trojans]] in the [[1963 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]]. Despite a narrow 42\u201337 defeat, the Badgers still ended the season ranked #2 in both the AP and Coaches polls (post-bowl rankings were not introduced until later in the decade).\n\n===Limited successes (1963\u20131989)===\nFollowing the successful 1962 campaign, Wisconsin football scuffled, and Milt Bruhn resigned in 1966 after three straight losing seasons. Wisconsin chose former assistant coach [[John Coatta]]. The Badgers finished even worse under Coatta, going winless for 23 straight games from 1967-1969, and winning only 3 games overall during Coatta's short reign, each of the wins occurring during the 1969 season. What stung even worse for Badger fans during the three season, was the coach that Wisconsin supposedly turned down for the head coaching role, [[Bo Schembechler]], who would become a coaching legend at Michigan.\n\nIn 1970, new athletic director Elroy Hirsch named John Jardine as head coach. While the Badgers weren't a consistent winner under Jardine, the program regained stability, and also brought excitement in running backs Rufus \"Roadrunner\" Ferguson and Billy Marek. The Badgers went 37-47-3 under Jardine, who stepped down in 1977.\n\nAfter more subpar seasons from 1978-1980, the team had a string of seven-win seasons from 1981\u201384 under [[Dave McClain (American football)|Dave McClain]]. During that time the Badgers played in the [[1981 Garden State Bowl|Garden State Bowl]] (1981), [[1982 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]] (1982), and [[1984 Hall of Fame Classic Bowl|Hall of Fame Classic Bowl]] (1984).  McClain's death during spring practice in 1986 sent the Badgers into free fall.  From 1986 to 1990, the Badgers won a total of nine games.\n\n===Barry Alvarez era, \"From Red Ink to Roses\" (1990\u20132005)===\n\nBy the end of the 1989 season, the Wisconsin football program was in disarray, shouldering a debt of over $2 million and with only 30,000 fans attending games at the 77,000-capacity stadium. New athletic director Pat Richter named [[Barry Alvarez]], the defensive coordinator at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], as the new head coach. To bring stability and interest to the program again, Alvarez targeted the top high school players in Wisconsin, \"building a wall\" around the state, and also encouraged players not recruited to join the program as walk-ons. Though Alvarez won his first game as head coach over Ball State, the Badgers finished 1-10 in 1990. The Badgers finished 5-6 in the next two seasons, but there were encouraging signs for the future. They were actually in bowl contention on the last day of the 1992 season, but a narrow loss to Northwestern kept them from going to a bowl. \n\nEverything finally came together for the Badgers in 1993. They steamrolled through the season, finishing 10-1-1, winning their first Big Ten championship since 1962 and beating [[1993 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] 21\u201316 to claim their first [[1994 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] victory.\n\nAfter the surprise success of 1993, the Badgers fell back into mediocrity, though remaining competitive, going 2-1 in bowl games from 1994 to 1997, with victories in the Hall of Fame Bowl in 1994, and the Copper Bowl in 1996. Alvarez retooled the team with a new batch of talented recruits during this stretch of seasons, and they came to full fruition in 1998 and 1999. Among the standouts were cornerback [[Jamar Fletcher]], wide receiver [[Chris Chambers]], quarterback [[Brooks Bollinger]], offensive linemen [[Aaron Gibson]], [[Chris McIntosh]], and [[Mark Tauscher]], and running back [[Ron Dayne]]. With \"The Great Dayne\" leading the way, the Badgers won back-to-back Big Ten championships and back-to-back Rose Bowls over UCLA in [[1999 Rose Bowl|1999]] and Stanford in [[2000 Rose Bowl|2000]]. The 1998 team won a school-record 11 games, while the 1999 team won its first outright Big Ten title since 1962. Ron Dayne set a new NCAA record for career rushing yardage, and won the Heisman Trophy in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, there were hopes of the Badgers winning their third consecutive Big Ten championship and an unprecedented three straight Rose Bowls. However early in the season, Wisconsin's football and basketball programs were hit with \"The Shoe Box scandal\", when a local shoe store gave university athletes discounts on footwear. Wisconsin athletic programs were put on five years of probation and several players were suspended by the NCAA. The Badgers finished 9-4, with a victory over UCLA in the Sun Bowl.\n\nDue to the loss of scholarships as a result of the NCAA investigation, the Badgers struggled through the 2001-2003 seasons, never finishing higher than seventh in the Big Ten. The Badgers returned to the top 20 in the AP polls in 2004 and 2005, with a victory in the Capitol One Bowl in 2005. In 2004, Alvarez was named athletic director, replacing the retiring Pat Richter. The strain of holding both roles became too much for Alvarez, and he stepped down as head coach after the 2005 season.\n\nAlvarez coached the Badgers for 16 seasons, finishing with a 118-73-4 record, three times finishing in the Top 10 in the AP polls, and the only Big Ten head coach to win back-to-back Rose Bowls.\n\n===Bret Bielema era (2006\u20132012)===\nFollowing the 2005 season, Alvarez resigned as head coach in order to focus on his duties as athletic director, a position he had assumed in 2004.  He named his defensive coordinator, [[Bret Bielema]], as his successor. Wisconsin's 2006 team went 12-1 and won the Capital One Bowl over Arkansas 17-14. Wisconsin finished the season ranked 5th in coaches poll and 7th in the AP Poll. From 2006 to 2011, Bielema led the Badgers to six consecutive bowl appearances, going 2\u20134. In 2010, the Badgers won a share of the Big Ten Championship and returned to the [[2011 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] for the first time since 2000.  There they were defeated 21\u201319 by the #3 ranked [[2010 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU Horned Frogs]].  In 2011, the Badgers were once again crowned Big Ten Champs when they defeated Michigan State in the first-ever [[2011 Big Ten Football Championship Game|conference championship game]]. The victory sent Wisconsin back to the [[2012 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] for a second consecutive year, where they were defeated by the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] champion [[2011 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]], 45-38.\n\nThe 2012 season ended with the Badgers winning a third consecutive Big Ten title.  Despite finishing with a 7-5 record and third in the Leaders Division, the Badgers advanced to the Big Ten Championship game by virtue of the fact that [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] were ineligible for postseason play.  A dominating rushing performance led Wisconsin to a 70-31 victory over #12 ranked [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the Big Ten Championship game.  Only days later, Brett Bielema resigned to become the head coach of the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks]]. [[Gary Andersen]], formerly coach of [[Utah State University]], was named head coach on December 19, 2012.

After the season, Wilcox left to take the head coaching job at Cal.\n\nWisconsin came into the 2017 season ranked #9 in the AP poll and was ranked in the top 10 all season. Undefeated during the regular season, the Badgers were ranked fourth in the nation before narrowly losing the Big 10 championship to Ohio State. Despite failing to reach the College Football Playoff, the Badgers rebounded to win the [[2017 Orange Bowl]] over Miami to finish the season with a 13-1 record, their best record since the 2007 season. Wisconsin was ranked as high as 3rd in the nation in week 14 in the AP poll and Coaches poll and received 10 first place votes in the AP poll and 21 first place votes in the Coaches poll. Wisconsin finished the season ranked 6th in the nation. \n\nThere were high expectations the next season as Wisconsin came into the 2018 campaign ranked #4 in the AP poll. However, injuries and inexperience, alongside poor quarterback play, derailed a promising season as the Badgers finished with a 7-5 regular season record, including a loss to Minnesota, which resulted in Wisconsin losing Paul Bunyan\u2019s Axe for the first time since the 2003 season. The Badgers finished the season with a win in a rematch against Miami in the [[2018 Pinstripe Bowl]] to finish 8-5. In the offseason, former starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook transferred to Florida State after an up and down 2018 performance. Wisconsin came into the 2019 season ranked #19 in the AP Poll and shut out 4 teams en route to a 10-2 finish in the regular season and won the Big Ten West, including games vs ranked Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota and were ranked #8 in the AP Poll going in the Big Ten Championship vs #1 Ohio State.

Much prestige was always associated with the game, and the significance was emphasized with its place on the schedule. Between 1933 and 1982, the Wisconsin-Minnesota game was always the final regular-season contest for each school. The series took an added twist in 1948 when more than state bragging rights were on the line. After a 16-0 setback that season, the Wisconsin lettermen's group, the National 'W' Club, presented Minnesota with an axe wielded by Paul Bunyan. He was the mythical giant of Midwestern lumber camps. Each year since, the winner of the annual battle between the Big Ten rivals is presented with the axe, complete with scores inscribed on the handle, for display on its campus.\nWisconsin leads the series at 61-60-8.<ref name=\"Wisconsin-Minnesota-record\"/>\n\n===Iowa===\n{{main article|Iowa\u2013Wisconsin football rivalry}}\nIowa is Wisconsin's other archrival. Although the rivalry started in 1894, the Heartland Trophy was inaugurated in 2004 and goes each year to the winner. The trophy was designed and crafted by artist and former Iowa football player Frank Strub. The trophy, which is a bull mounted on a walnut base (native to both Wisconsin and Iowa), has been inscribed with the scores of all games in the long-time series. With Big Ten expansion, the Wisconsin and Iowa football teams were placed in separate divisions, thus ending their annual rivalry. However, with the addition of Maryland and Rutgers, Iowa and Wisconsin were placed back in the same division in 2014. Wisconsin leads the series at 48-43-2.\n\n===Nebraska===\n{{main article|Nebraska\u2013Wisconsin football rivalry}}\n[[File:Chris Borland tackles Taylor Martinez.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Wisconsin linebacker [[Chris Borland]] tackles Nebraska quarterback [[Taylor Martinez]] during the [[2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]]]\nNebraska is Wisconsin's newest rival. With the inclusion of the Cornhuskers in the Big Ten in 2011 the first three games between the two programs were significant, the third being the [[2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] where the unranked Badgers defeated the heavily favored #14 ranked Cornhuskers, 70-31. Prior to their next matchup in 2014, the University of Nebraska and the University of Wisconsin announced that moving forward the two schools would play for the Freedom Trophy. The trophy sits on a wooden base and features a depiction of Nebraska's Memorial Stadium on one side and Wisconsin's Camp Randall Stadium on the other.  The trophy has an inscription honoring the nation's veterans and symbolizes that Memorial Stadium was built in their honor at Nebraska while Camp Randall Stadium in Wisconsin was built on the site of a former Civil War training site.  The score of each year's contest is inscribed on the trophy. Wisconsin leads the overall series 10-4-0.\n\n==All-time records==\n\n===All-time Big Ten records===\nThis chart includes both the overall record the University of Wisconsin Badgers have with the all-time Big Ten members, as well as the matchups that counted in the Big Ten standings.  Wisconsin has been a member of the Big Ten since its creation in 1896.  Michigan rejoined the league in 1917 after leaving in 1906.  Chicago withdrew after 1939, and then Michigan State (1953), Penn State (1993), and Nebraska (2011), Maryland and Rutgers (2014) joined the Big Ten conference bringing the league total to 14 teams.\n(As of November 24, 2018)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Wisconsin Badgers}}\"\n| style=\"width:235px\" | '''Team'''\n| style=\"width:65px\" | '''Big Ten wins'''\n| style=\"width:65px\" | '''Big Ten losses'''\n| style=\"width:65px\" | '''Big Ten ties'''\n| '''Pct.'''\n| style=\"width:55px\" | '''Overall wins'''\n| style=\"width:55px\" | '''Overall losses'''\n| style=\"width:55px\" | '''Overall ties'''\n| '''Pct.'''\n| style=\"width:70px\" | '''Streak'''\n| style=\"width:65px\" | '''First meeting'''\n| style=\"width:65px\" | '''Last meeting'''\n|-\n| [[Chicago Maroons football|Chicago Maroons]] || 18 || 15 || 5 || {{Winning percentage|18|15|5}} || 19 || 16 || 5 || {{Winning percentage|19|16|5}} || Won 1 || 1894 || 1937\n|-\n| [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois Fighting Illini]] || 42 || 37 || 7 || {{Winning percentage|42|37|7}} || 42 || 37 || 7 || {{Winning percentage|42|37|7}} || lost 1 || 1895 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana Hoosiers]] || 41 || 18 || 2 || {{Winning percentage|41|18|2}} || 41 || 18 || 2 || {{Winning percentage|41|18|2}} || Won 10 || 1907 || 2017\n|-\n| [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa Hawkeyes]] || 48 || 43 || 2 || {{Winning percentage|48|43|2}} || 48 || 43 || 2 || {{Winning percentage|48|43|2}} || Won 4 || 1894 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland Terrapins]] || 3 || 0 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|3|0|0}} || 3 || 0 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|3|0|0}} || Won 3 || 2014 || 2017\n|-\n| [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]] || 16 || 51 || 1 || {{Winning percentage|16|50|1}} || 16 || 51 || 1 || {{Winning percentage|16|51|1}} || Won 1 || 1892 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State Spartans]] || 20 || 29 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|20|29|0}} || 24 || 30 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|24|30|0}} || Won 2 || 1913 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] || 60 || 55 || 8 || {{Winning percentage|61|60|8}} || 60<ref name=\"Wisconsin-Minnesota-record\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin vs. Minnesota series record |publisher=cfbdatawarehouse.com |url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/w/wisconsin/opponents_records.php?teamid=2030 |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref> || 59<ref name=\"Wisconsin-Minnesota-record\"/> || 8 || {{Winning percentage|61|60|8}} || Won 1 || 1890 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] || 7 || 1 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|7|1|0}} || 10 || 4 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|10|4|0}} || Won 7 || 1901 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern Wildcats]] || 56 || 35 || 4 || {{Winning percentage|56|35|4}} || 60 || 36 || 5 || {{Winning percentage|60|36|5}} || Won 1 || 1890 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] || 18 || 57 || 5 || {{Winning percentage|18|57|5}} || 18 || 59 || 5 || {{Winning percentage|18|59|5}} || Lost 5 || 1913 || 2017\n|-\n| [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State Nittany Lions]] || 7 || 9 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|7|9|0}}|| 9 || 10 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|9|10|0}} || Lost 4  || 1953 || 2018 \n|-\n| [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]] || 47 || 27 || 8 || {{Winning percentage|47|27|8}} || 48 || 29 || 8 || {{Winning percentage|48|29|8}} || Won 14 || 1892 || 2019\n|-\n| [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] || 3 || 0 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|3|0|0}} || 3 || 0 || 0 || {{Winning percentage|3|0|0}} || Won 3 || 2014 || 2018\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Wisconsin Badgers||386|375|41|{{Winning percentage|386|375|41}}|402|389|43|{{Winning percentage|402|389|43}}|||}}\n|}\n<small>All Data from The Wisconsin Football Fact Book</small><ref name=\"Wis factbook\">http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/wis/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2013-14/misc_non_event/Fact_Book_2013.pdf</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2019}}{{when|date=August 2019}}\n<!-- Records update through February 12, 2017 game -->\n\n==Traditions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n\n===The Fifth Quarter===\nThe Fifth Quarter is a fan event that takes place following every Wisconsin home football game that originated in 1969.

Those numbers changed in 1994 to 110, 112 and 113 respectively.<ref>[[Telephone numbers in Norway]]</ref>\n\nCalls to the emergency number can be made even if a phone is locked, no SIM is required, and calls must be forwarded by service providers even if the subscriber is barred from making calls due to billing issues.<ref name=tpg/>\n\nFor calls to the [[State Emergency Service]] about non\u2013life-threatening situations, the Australia-wide number 132 500 can be used (except in the Northern Territory).\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1969, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services had many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\", and their location if not calling from a phone with fixed location (landline). The caller is then connected to the emergency service requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially relevant in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a telephone not at a fixed location (mobile), it is necessary for the caller to specify the location.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening. The number for SES calls is 132&nbsp;500, but police or another service dialled inappropriately will notify SES.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]]. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered and the majority of calls took much longer to be answered than usual.

Those numbers changed in 1994 to 110, 112 and 113 respectively.<ref>[[Telephone numbers in Norway]]</ref>\n\nCalls to the emergency number can be made even if a phone is locked, no SIM is required, and calls must be forwarded by service providers even if the subscriber is barred from making calls due to billing issues.<ref name=tpg/>\n\nFor calls to the [[State Emergency Service]] about non\u2013life-threatening situations, the Australia-wide number 132 500 can be used (except in the Northern Territory).\n\n== History ==\nBefore 1969, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services had many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\", and their location if not calling from a phone with fixed location (landline). The caller is then connected to the emergency service requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially relevant in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a telephone not at a fixed location (mobile), it is necessary for the caller to specify the location.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening. The number for SES calls is 132&nbsp;500, but police or another service dialled inappropriately will notify SES.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]].

The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]'' (1999) and ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'' (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at [[Woodstock '99]] and the 2001 [[Big Day Out]] festival.\n\nBorland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist [[Mike Smith (guitarist)|Mike Smith]].

In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album ''[[Gold Cobra]]'' (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with [[Cash Money Records]], but DJ Lethal quit the band soon after before returning in 2018.

According to Durst, \"The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music.\"<ref name=Devenish21/> Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iry4g/i_am_fred_durst_of_limp_bizkitask_me_anything/cb7gdo0 |title=I am Fred Durst of LIMP BIZKIT ...

The band's local popularity was such that [[Sugar Ray]], who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group [[Funkdoobiest]].<ref name=Devenish21/> Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit \"had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.\"<ref name=Devenish21/> However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances.<ref name=Devenish21/> Attracting crowds by [[word of mouth]], the band gave energetic live performances, covering [[George Michael]]'s \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\" and [[Paula Abdul]]'s \"[[Straight Up (Paula Abdul song)|Straight Up]]\", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes.<ref name=Devenish21/> Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.<ref name=Devenish21/>\n\nDurst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager.<ref name=Devenish21/> Later, when [[Korn]] performed in town as the opening act for [[Sick of It All]], Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade [[Reginald Arvizu|Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu]] to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs \"Pollution\", \"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\" and \"Stuck\".

Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style.

While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van. As a result of the near death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band.<ref name=Devenish21/> After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip]], a subsidiary of [[Interscope Records]]. Arvizu persuaded [[Ross Robinson]] to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song \"Sour\".<ref name=Devenish21/> The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, \"Everything\".<ref name=Devenish21/>\n\nDespite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song \"Faith\", Robinson was opposed to recording it, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed him.<ref name=Devenish21/> Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously.<ref name=Devenish21/> The [[progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of [[Maynard James Keenan]].<ref name=Devenish21/>\n\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, naming the album, ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]''.<ref name=Devenish21/> The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music.<ref name=Devenish21/> After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'' music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating \"The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's [[rap metal|rap/thrash]] show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for [[Homosexuality|gay]] men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious.

The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]'' (1999) and ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'' (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at [[Woodstock '99]] and the 2001 [[Big Day Out]] festival.\n\nBorland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist [[Mike Smith (guitarist)|Mike Smith]]. Following the release of their album, ''[[Results May Vary]]'' (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded ''[[The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)]]'' (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer [[Sammy Siegler]] before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album ''[[Gold Cobra]]'' (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with [[Cash Money Records]], but DJ Lethal quit the band soon after before returning in 2018.

Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music.\"<ref name=Devenish21/> Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iry4g/i_am_fred_durst_of_limp_bizkitask_me_anything/cb7gdo0 |title=I am Fred Durst of LIMP BIZKIT ...

The band's local popularity was such that [[Sugar Ray]], who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group [[Funkdoobiest]].<ref name=Devenish21/> Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit \"had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.\"<ref name=Devenish21/> However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances.<ref name=Devenish21/> Attracting crowds by [[word of mouth]], the band gave energetic live performances, covering [[George Michael]]'s \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\" and [[Paula Abdul]]'s \"[[Straight Up (Paula Abdul song)|Straight Up]]\", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes.<ref name=Devenish21/> Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.<ref name=Devenish21/>\n\nDurst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager.<ref name=Devenish21/> Later, when [[Korn]] performed in town as the opening act for [[Sick of It All]], Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade [[Reginald Arvizu|Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu]] to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs \"Pollution\", \"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\" and \"Stuck\".

Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.<ref name=Devenish21/>\n\n=== ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall'' (1997\u20131998) ===\n[[File:Fred Durst at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.JPG|thumb|Following the release of ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall'', vocalist Fred Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope.]]\n\nAfter their performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Mojo Records|Mojo]], a subsidiary of [[MCA Records]]. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van. As a result of the near death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band.<ref name=Devenish21/> After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip]], a subsidiary of [[Interscope Records]]. Arvizu persuaded [[Ross Robinson]] to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song \"Sour\".<ref name=Devenish21/> The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, \"Everything\".<ref name=Devenish21/>\n\nDespite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song \"Faith\", Robinson was opposed to recording it, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed him.<ref name=Devenish21/> Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously.<ref name=Devenish21/> The [[progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of [[Maynard James Keenan]].<ref name=Devenish21/>\n\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, naming the album, ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]''.<ref name=Devenish21/> The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music.<ref name=Devenish21/> After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'' music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating \"The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's [[rap metal|rap/thrash]] show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for [[Homosexuality|gay]] men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile.\"<ref name=Devenish21/> That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for [[Faith No More]], a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the [[nu metal]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2015/8/13/they-did-it-all-for-the-nookie-decibel-explores-the-rise-and-fall-of-nu-metal|title=They Did It All for the Nookie: Decibel Explores the Rise and Fall of Nu-Metal|accessdate=January 18, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226193814/http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2015/8/13/they-did-it-all-for-the-nookie-decibel-explores-the-rise-and-fall-of-nu-metal/|archivedate=February 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The group's keyboardist [[Roddy Bottum]] later recalled \"That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude.

The male mascot is Paws.]]\nThe '''Pawtucket Red Sox''' (known [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as the '''PawSox''') are a professional [[minor league baseball]] team based in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. The team is a member of the [[International League]] and is the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. It plays its home games at [[McCoy Stadium]] in Pawtucket, and is the only [[professional baseball]] team in [[Rhode Island]]. Its most recent [[List of International League champions|championship]] win was in 2014.\n\nThe Pawtucket Red Sox were born as a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] franchise in 1970. Three years later, Boston's Triple-A affiliate in the International League replaced the Eastern League PawSox. After enduring three different owners, at least two threats to move the team elsewhere, and bankruptcy, the PawSox were purchased from the International League by local industrialist [[Ben Mondor]] in January 1977. Over the next 38 years, Mondor (who died in 2010) and his heirs stabilized the franchise and turned it into a success; it was twice (1990 and 2003) selected the winner of ''[[Baseball America]]'s'' Bob Freitas Award as the top Triple-A operation in minor league baseball,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/baseball-america-awards/|title=Baseball America Awards|magazine=[[Baseball America]]|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref> led the league in total attendance three times between 2004 and 2008,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Lloyd|last2=Wolff|first2=Miles|title=The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball|edition=2nd|year=2008|publisher=[[Baseball America]]|location=[[Durham, North Carolina]]|isbn=978-1-932391-17-6|pages=561\u2013724}}</ref> and won three [[Governors' Cup]]s as playoff champions.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, the team was sold to a group headed by then-Boston Red Sox [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]] [[Larry Lucchino]] and Rhode Island attorney James J. Skeffington. Thwarted in two attempts to replace McCoy Stadium with a new facility (first in adjacent [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], then in a downtown site in Pawtucket), the PawSox announced on August 17, 2018, that they will move to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], {{convert|42|mi}} away, in 2021. Ownership later confirmed that the team will become the '''[[Worcester Red Sox]]''' (nicknamed the '''WooSox''') with the move.\n\n==Team history==\n\n===Eastern League franchise (1970\u201372)===\nThe first team to be dubbed the Pawtucket Red Sox debuted at McCoy Stadium in 1970 as a member of the Double-A Eastern League. The franchise, owned by former Major League shortstop [[Joe Buzas]], had spent the previous five seasons (1965\u201369) as the [[Pittsfield Red Sox]] after playing in four different [[Pennsylvania]] cities\u2014[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]\u2014over seven years (1958\u201364).\n\nAfter three seasons, Pawtucket's Eastern League franchise moved to [[Bristol, Connecticut]], in 1973 to make room for the Triple-A PawSox, the former [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)|Louisville Colonels]] of the International League.\n\n[[Carlton Fisk]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] [[catcher]], played for the Eastern League PawSox in 1970. [[Shortstop]] [[Rick Burleson]] and [[first baseman]] [[Cecil Cooper]] are among the players who toiled for both the Double-A and Triple-A versions of the team. This first edition of the PawSox franchise played for ten seasons as the [[Bristol Red Sox]] and then  spent 33 seasons (1983\u20132015) in [[New Britain, Connecticut]], the last 21 of them as the [[New Britain Rock Cats|Rock Cats]]. In 2016, the Rock Cats moved to [[Connecticut]]'s capital city, and were rechristened the [[Hartford Yard Goats]].\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]] had also placed an Eastern League club in Pawtucket, in 1966\u201367. The [[Pawtucket Indians]] moved to [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], in 1968. The [[Pawtucket Slaters (baseball)|Pawtucket Slaters]], a [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] farm club in the Class B [[New England League]], represented the city from 1946 to 1949, when the NEL disbanded.\n\n===Roots in Toronto and Louisville===\n{{See|Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)}}\n\nThe Triple-A team that is now the Pawtucket Red Sox began in 1896 as the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]]. After the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] and its [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball team)|Louisville Colonels]] franchise folded in 1962 and the [[American League]] owners voted down [[Charlie O. Finley]]'s agreement to move the [[Kansas City A's]] to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] in 1964, Louisville was ready for the return of baseball. In 1968 the Maple Leafs, the Red Sox' top minor league club since 1965, were bought by Walter J. Dilbeck and moved to Louisville where they became the new Louisville Colonels and retained their affiliation with the Red Sox. They played at [[Cardinal Stadium|Fairgrounds Stadium]] on the Kentucky State Fairgrounds. While in Louisville, star players included [[Carlton Fisk]] (1971), [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] (1972), and [[Cecil Cooper]] (1972). The Louisville Colonels made the International League playoffs in 1969 and 1972.\n\n===Early struggles and bankruptcy (1973\u201376)===\nIn 1972, the Kentucky State Fair Board remodeled Cardinal Stadium so it could accommodate [[American football|football]]. The renovations made the stadium unsuitable for baseball; among other things, it was far too large for a Triple-A team. However, the stadium was later used by the latter-day [[Louisville Bats|Louisville Redbirds]] club, setting minor league attendance records and outdrawing several major league teams. Following the 1972 season, the Louisville Colonels of the International League moved to McCoy Stadium and became the Pawtucket Red Sox, with Buzas taking over as owner.\n\nThe first Triple-A team was a success on the field, led by future major leaguers Cecil Cooper and [[Dick Pole]], winning the 1973 [[Governors' Cup]] Championship in their inaugural year in the league over the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees|Charleston Charlies]]. Then, they followed up by defeating the [[Tulsa Oilers (baseball)|Tulsa Oilers]] of the American Association to win the [[Junior World Series]]. The following season they finished 30 games below .500 and lost an estimated $40,000. Buzas then sold the team to Philip Anez, a [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|Smithfield]] advertising executive, in January 1975.<ref>[https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/435945474/?terms=Joe%2BBuzas [[Boston Globe]] archives, 9 January 1975]</ref>\n\nWhile the parent club was on their way to the [[1975 World Series]], the 1975 PawSox finished with a 53\u201387 mark.{{Anchor|Rhode Island Red Sox}} The team changed its name to the ''Rhode Island Red Sox'' for the 1976 season, but little changed on the field with a third straight sub-.500 season and falling attendance. Anez threatened to move his club to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. After the season, the franchise went bankrupt, unable to pay off $2 million worth of debt. The International League took it over, then awarded it in December 1976 to Massachusetts businessman Marvin Adelson, who renamed the team the ''New England Red Sox''\u2014and explored transferring it to Worcester. But after less than two months, in January 1977, the league revoked Adelson's franchise, alleging \"nonperformance of terms and conditions\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/436614886/?terms=%22Marv%2BAdelson%22|title=IL Withdraws RI Sox Franchise Offer|last=United Press International|date=19 January 1977|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] archives|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Ben Mondor era (1977\u20132015)===\nAlthough it appeared the Red Sox's stay in the Pawtucket area was about to come to an end, retired [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]] businessman [[Ben Mondor]] stepped in and made sure the team remained in the city. Mondor was granted a brand-new franchise and restored the name to the Pawtucket Red Sox. However, it retained the old team's history and affiliation with the big-league Red Sox. Nonetheless, it was really in 1977 that the current Pawtucket Red Sox, and PawSox, were born.\n\nMondor's tenure began inauspiciously. While the PawSox rebounded to win the regular-season [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], they only drew 1,000 fans per game\u2014believed to be the fewest for a first-place team in the history of the International League. That year's edition of the PawSox fell in the Governors' Cup finals to Charleston in four straight games. However, it won its second league championship in 1984, and drew almost 199,000 fans, second in the league.\n\nAfter several years of playing in a stadium that was barely suitable for a Triple-A team, in 1998 Mondor and team president Mike Tamburro oversaw the transformation of McCoy Stadium from an aging 1942 relic into its renovated form. While they kept the price of tickets at $6 and $10,<ref>[http://www.pawsox.com/tickets/ PawSox.com \u2013 PawSox Tickets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> parking is free. The PawSox led the league in attendance in 2008, when 636,788 fans saw baseball at McCoy, an average of 9,097 for each of the 70 openings. In 2005, they set a franchise record with 688,421 tickets sold during the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=International League: Attendance|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?sid=milb&t=l_att&lid=117|website=www.milb.com|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> [[Kevin Youkilis]] played for the team in 2003, and completed a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate [[Kevin Millar]]'s minor-league records for consecutive games reaching base.\n\nIn addition to their success at the box office, the PawSox have excelled on the field. In 2000, Pawtucket set an all-time franchise record for victories with 82, as the team completed their fifth-straight winning season. Three years later the PawSox would top their own record by winning 83 games. In 2008, they won 85 games. The 1984 team defeated the now-defunct [[Maine Guides]] 3\u20132 to win the 1984 Governors' Cup trophy for their second championship in Pawtucket Red Sox history. In 2012, the PawSox defeated the [[Charlotte Knights]] to win the Governors' Cup for a third time. A fourth title was won in 2014 when the PawSox took down the [[Durham Bulls]] in five games.\n\nThe origins of PawSox are traced back to the first season in which Mondor owned the club. Three weeks before the 1977 season began the team lacked uniforms. BoSox vice president [[Haywood Sullivan]] stepped in and sent Pawtucket 48 sets of old home and away uniforms from the parent club. Although the home uniforms were fine for the team to use, the road uniforms had \"Boston\" stitched across the chest, which was a problem. Tamburro suggested using the name \"PawSox\" across the front, with each unstitched \"Boston\" letter replaced with one that spelled \"PawSox\". Thus, the PawSox name was born out of the necessity of a uniform crisis.\n\nMondor died on October 3, 2010, at the age of 85. His widow, Madeleine, became the new majority owner of the PawSox.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/pawsox/content/sp_bb_mondor_15_05-16-11_L9O4326_v3.2a3c68a.html ''The Providence Journal'', 2011-5-16]</ref>\n\n===Sale and Rhode Island stadium plans (2015\u201318)===\nOn November 29, 2014, it was reported that members of the Boston Red Sox' ownership group were in the process of purchasing the PawSox from Madeleine Mondor and two long-time executives who also held stock in the team: president Tamburro and vice president and general manager Lou Schwechheimer.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/11/27/some-red-sox-owners-poised-purchase-pawsox/Tj3YDozeBmap2p8bEO6qGM/story.html Some Red Sox owners poised to purchase PawSox ''Boston Globe'' 2014-11-29]</ref>\n\nNearly three months later, on February 23, the sale to Lucchino, Skeffington and their partners was formally announced. Lucchino added the title of chairman of the PawSox to his Boston responsibilities, and Skeffington became club president. Other partners included Rhode Island businessmen Bernard Cammarata, William P. Egan, Habib Gorgi, J. Terrence Murray and Thomas M.

The male mascot is Paws.]]\nThe '''Pawtucket Red Sox''' (known [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as the '''PawSox''') are a professional [[minor league baseball]] team based in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. The team is a member of the [[International League]] and is the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. It plays its home games at [[McCoy Stadium]] in Pawtucket, and is the only [[professional baseball]] team in [[Rhode Island]]. Its most recent [[List of International League champions|championship]] win was in 2014.\n\nThe Pawtucket Red Sox were born as a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] franchise in 1970. Three years later, Boston's Triple-A affiliate in the International League replaced the Eastern League PawSox. After enduring three different owners, at least two threats to move the team elsewhere, and bankruptcy, the PawSox were purchased from the International League by local industrialist [[Ben Mondor]] in January 1977. Over the next 38 years, Mondor (who died in 2010) and his heirs stabilized the franchise and turned it into a success; it was twice (1990 and 2003) selected the winner of ''[[Baseball America]]'s'' Bob Freitas Award as the top Triple-A operation in minor league baseball,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/baseball-america-awards/|title=Baseball America Awards|magazine=[[Baseball America]]|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref> led the league in total attendance three times between 2004 and 2008,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Lloyd|last2=Wolff|first2=Miles|title=The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball|edition=2nd|year=2008|publisher=[[Baseball America]]|location=[[Durham, North Carolina]]|isbn=978-1-932391-17-6|pages=561\u2013724}}</ref> and won three [[Governors' Cup]]s as playoff champions.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, the team was sold to a group headed by then-Boston Red Sox [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]] [[Larry Lucchino]] and Rhode Island attorney James J. Skeffington. Thwarted in two attempts to replace McCoy Stadium with a new facility (first in adjacent [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], then in a downtown site in Pawtucket), the PawSox announced on August 17, 2018, that they will move to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], {{convert|42|mi}} away, in 2021. Ownership later confirmed that the team will become the '''[[Worcester Red Sox]]''' (nicknamed the '''WooSox''') with the move.\n\n==Team history==\n\n===Eastern League franchise (1970\u201372)===\nThe first team to be dubbed the Pawtucket Red Sox debuted at McCoy Stadium in 1970 as a member of the Double-A Eastern League. The franchise, owned by former Major League shortstop [[Joe Buzas]], had spent the previous five seasons (1965\u201369) as the [[Pittsfield Red Sox]] after playing in four different [[Pennsylvania]] cities\u2014[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] and [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]\u2014over seven years (1958\u201364).\n\nAfter three seasons, Pawtucket's Eastern League franchise moved to [[Bristol, Connecticut]], in 1973 to make room for the Triple-A PawSox, the former [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)|Louisville Colonels]] of the International League.\n\n[[Carlton Fisk]], the future [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] [[catcher]], played for the Eastern League PawSox in 1970. [[Shortstop]] [[Rick Burleson]] and [[first baseman]] [[Cecil Cooper]] are among the players who toiled for both the Double-A and Triple-A versions of the team. This first edition of the PawSox franchise played for ten seasons as the [[Bristol Red Sox]] and then  spent 33 seasons (1983\u20132015) in [[New Britain, Connecticut]], the last 21 of them as the [[New Britain Rock Cats|Rock Cats]]. In 2016, the Rock Cats moved to [[Connecticut]]'s capital city, and were rechristened the [[Hartford Yard Goats]].\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]] had also placed an Eastern League club in Pawtucket, in 1966\u201367. The [[Pawtucket Indians]] moved to [[Waterbury, Connecticut]], in 1968. The [[Pawtucket Slaters (baseball)|Pawtucket Slaters]], a [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] farm club in the Class B [[New England League]], represented the city from 1946 to 1949, when the NEL disbanded.\n\n===Roots in Toronto and Louisville===\n{{See|Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball)}}\n\nThe Triple-A team that is now the Pawtucket Red Sox began in 1896 as the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Toronto Maple Leafs]]. After the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] and its [[Louisville Colonels (minor league baseball team)|Louisville Colonels]] franchise folded in 1962 and the [[American League]] owners voted down [[Charlie O. Finley]]'s agreement to move the [[Kansas City A's]] to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] in 1964, Louisville was ready for the return of baseball. In 1968 the Maple Leafs, the Red Sox' top minor league club since 1965, were bought by Walter J. Dilbeck and moved to Louisville where they became the new Louisville Colonels and retained their affiliation with the Red Sox. They played at [[Cardinal Stadium|Fairgrounds Stadium]] on the Kentucky State Fairgrounds. While in Louisville, star players included [[Carlton Fisk]] (1971), [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] (1972), and [[Cecil Cooper]] (1972). The Louisville Colonels made the International League playoffs in 1969 and 1972.\n\n===Early struggles and bankruptcy (1973\u201376)===\nIn 1972, the Kentucky State Fair Board remodeled Cardinal Stadium so it could accommodate [[American football|football]]. The renovations made the stadium unsuitable for baseball; among other things, it was far too large for a Triple-A team. However, the stadium was later used by the latter-day [[Louisville Bats|Louisville Redbirds]] club, setting minor league attendance records and outdrawing several major league teams. Following the 1972 season, the Louisville Colonels of the International League moved to McCoy Stadium and became the Pawtucket Red Sox, with Buzas taking over as owner.\n\nThe first Triple-A team was a success on the field, led by future major leaguers Cecil Cooper and [[Dick Pole]], winning the 1973 [[Governors' Cup]] Championship in their inaugural year in the league over the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees|Charleston Charlies]]. Then, they followed up by defeating the [[Tulsa Oilers (baseball)|Tulsa Oilers]] of the American Association to win the [[Junior World Series]]. The following season they finished 30 games below .500 and lost an estimated $40,000. Buzas then sold the team to Philip Anez, a [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|Smithfield]] advertising executive, in January 1975.<ref>[https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/435945474/?terms=Joe%2BBuzas [[Boston Globe]] archives, 9 January 1975]</ref>\n\nWhile the parent club was on their way to the [[1975 World Series]], the 1975 PawSox finished with a 53\u201387 mark.{{Anchor|Rhode Island Red Sox}} The team changed its name to the ''Rhode Island Red Sox'' for the 1976 season, but little changed on the field with a third straight sub-.500 season and falling attendance. Anez threatened to move his club to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. After the season, the franchise went bankrupt, unable to pay off $2 million worth of debt. The International League took it over, then awarded it in December 1976 to Massachusetts businessman Marvin Adelson, who renamed the team the ''New England Red Sox''\u2014and explored transferring it to Worcester. But after less than two months, in January 1977, the league revoked Adelson's franchise, alleging \"nonperformance of terms and conditions\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/image/436614886/?terms=%22Marv%2BAdelson%22|title=IL Withdraws RI Sox Franchise Offer|last=United Press International|date=19 January 1977|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] archives|accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The Ben Mondor era (1977\u20132015)===\nAlthough it appeared the Red Sox's stay in the Pawtucket area was about to come to an end, retired [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]] businessman [[Ben Mondor]] stepped in and made sure the team remained in the city. Mondor was granted a brand-new franchise and restored the name to the Pawtucket Red Sox. However, it retained the old team's history and affiliation with the big-league Red Sox. Nonetheless, it was really in 1977 that the current Pawtucket Red Sox, and PawSox, were born.\n\nMondor's tenure began inauspiciously. While the PawSox rebounded to win the regular-season [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], they only drew 1,000 fans per game\u2014believed to be the fewest for a first-place team in the history of the International League. That year's edition of the PawSox fell in the Governors' Cup finals to Charleston in four straight games. However, it won its second league championship in 1984, and drew almost 199,000 fans, second in the league.\n\nAfter several years of playing in a stadium that was barely suitable for a Triple-A team, in 1998 Mondor and team president Mike Tamburro oversaw the transformation of McCoy Stadium from an aging 1942 relic into its renovated form. While they kept the price of tickets at $6 and $10,<ref>[http://www.pawsox.com/tickets/ PawSox.com \u2013 PawSox Tickets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> parking is free. The PawSox led the league in attendance in 2008, when 636,788 fans saw baseball at McCoy, an average of 9,097 for each of the 70 openings. In 2005, they set a franchise record with 688,421 tickets sold during the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=International League: Attendance|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?sid=milb&t=l_att&lid=117|website=www.milb.com|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> [[Kevin Youkilis]] played for the team in 2003, and completed a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate [[Kevin Millar]]'s minor-league records for consecutive games reaching base.\n\nIn addition to their success at the box office, the PawSox have excelled on the field. In 2000, Pawtucket set an all-time franchise record for victories with 82, as the team completed their fifth-straight winning season. Three years later the PawSox would top their own record by winning 83 games. In 2008, they won 85 games. The 1984 team defeated the now-defunct [[Maine Guides]] 3\u20132 to win the 1984 Governors' Cup trophy for their second championship in Pawtucket Red Sox history. In 2012, the PawSox defeated the [[Charlotte Knights]] to win the Governors' Cup for a third time. A fourth title was won in 2014 when the PawSox took down the [[Durham Bulls]] in five games.\n\nThe origins of PawSox are traced back to the first season in which Mondor owned the club. Three weeks before the 1977 season began the team lacked uniforms. BoSox vice president [[Haywood Sullivan]] stepped in and sent Pawtucket 48 sets of old home and away uniforms from the parent club. Although the home uniforms were fine for the team to use, the road uniforms had \"Boston\" stitched across the chest, which was a problem. Tamburro suggested using the name \"PawSox\" across the front, with each unstitched \"Boston\" letter replaced with one that spelled \"PawSox\". Thus, the PawSox name was born out of the necessity of a uniform crisis.\n\nMondor died on October 3, 2010, at the age of 85. His widow, Madeleine, became the new majority owner of the PawSox.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/pawsox/content/sp_bb_mondor_15_05-16-11_L9O4326_v3.2a3c68a.html ''The Providence Journal'', 2011-5-16]</ref>\n\n===Sale and Rhode Island stadium plans (2015\u201318)===\nOn November 29, 2014, it was reported that members of the Boston Red Sox' ownership group were in the process of purchasing the PawSox from Madeleine Mondor and two long-time executives who also held stock in the team: president Tamburro and vice president and general manager Lou Schwechheimer.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/11/27/some-red-sox-owners-poised-purchase-pawsox/Tj3YDozeBmap2p8bEO6qGM/story.html Some Red Sox owners poised to purchase PawSox ''Boston Globe'' 2014-11-29]</ref>\n\nNearly three months later, on February 23, the sale to Lucchino, Skeffington and their partners was formally announced. Lucchino added the title of chairman of the PawSox to his Boston responsibilities, and Skeffington became club president. Other partners included Rhode Island businessmen Bernard Cammarata, William P. Egan, Habib Gorgi, J. Terrence Murray and Thomas M.

Mark A. R. Kleiman, a prominent economist who has consistently voiced concern about the negative effects of legal cannabis sales, pointed out that since the early 1990s, as pot usage in America has dramatically increased, violent crime has significantly decreased. One of the experts that Gladwell quotes as warning Canadian parliament on the uncertainties around cannabis, RAND Drug Policy Research Center co-director Beau Kilmer, tweeted in response to Berenson a rather comprehensive study showing, \u201cMarijuana use does not induce violent crime.\u201d Another researcher pointed out that Berenson\u2019s contention that legalization leads to violence, based on limited data from Washington and Colorado, is akin to saying that organic food causes autism, because sales of organic food have risen, in recent years, apace with autism diagnoses.}}{{ r | Hart_and_Ksir | p=1 | q=It is true that people diagnosed with psychosis are more likely to report current or prior use of marijuana than people without psychosis. The easy conclusion to draw from that is that marijuana use caused an increased risk of psychosis, and it is that easy answer that Berenson has seized upon. However, this ignores evidence that psychotic behavior is also associated with higher rates of tobacco use, and with the use of stimulants and opioids. Do all these things \u201ccause\u201d psychosis, or is there another, more likely answer? In our many decades of college teaching, one of the most important things we have tried to impart to our students is the distinction between correlation (two things are statistically associated) and causation (one thing causes another). For example, the wearing of light clothing is more likely during the same months as higher sales of ice-cream, but we do not believe that either causes the other. }}{{ r | Open_Letter | p=1 | q=Overview of the Problems with the Scientific Claims of the Book: * Attributing cause to mere associations. Berenson irresponsibly and dangerously claims a causal link between marijuana use and increases in rates of psychosis and schizophrenia, which have purportedly led to increases in population-level violence. While associations between marijuana use and mental illness have been established, research suggests that the association is complex and mediated by multiple factors other than marijuana, including genetics. Similarly, associations between individual characteristics and violence are multi-factorial. Thus, establishing marijuana as a causal link to violence at the individual level is both theoretically and empirically problematic. Further weakening his arguments, the vast majority of people who use marijuana do not develop psychosis or schizophrenia, nor do they engage in violence, thus making Berenson\u2019s claims far-reaching and exaggerated. }}{{ r | guardian-alarmism | p=1 | q=A group of 75 scholars and medical professionals have criticised a controversial new book about the purported dangers of marijuana, calling it an example of \u201calarmism\u201d designed to stir up public fear \u201cbased on a deeply inaccurate misreading of science\u201d. [The article links to the previous reference.] }}\nas well as [[cherry picking]]{{ r | Nation_TYC | p=1 | q=Additionally, while Berenson takes the trouble to position himself as an expert at interpreting data based on his time as a reporter covering the health-care industry, he has been criticized for cherry-picking studies in this book. The most notable critique comes from one of the researchers who conducted the study he cites for \u201carguably the most important finding of all\u201d: a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that Berenson claims establishes the link between psychosis and marijuana. \u201cIn response to the recent @NYTimes editorial on cannabis and as a committee member on the @theNASEM #cannabis and #cannabinoids report we did NOT conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia,\u201d pharmacologist and cannabis researcher Ziva Cooper tweeted in response to an op-ed by Berenson in The New York Times. }}\ndata that fits his narrative, and falling victim to [[selection bias]] via his use of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]]{{ r | Nation_TYC | p=1 | q=Likewise, Berenson relies heavily on selective anecdotal evidence. For example, he recounts the story of a Mormon man who shot and killed his wife after eating part of a THC-infused candy bar\u2014but he glosses over the marital problems that the couple were having at the time of the wife\u2019s murder, and the fact that she\u2019d expressed a fear of her husband to friends in the days prior to her murder. }}\nto back up his assertions.{{ r | Open_Letter | p=1 | q=Overview of the Problems with the Scientific Claims of the Book: *Attributing cause to mere associations. *Berenson cherry-picks data. *Berenson is guilty of selection bias. *In addition to his flawed use of science, Berenson\u2019s argument outright ignores most of the harms of prohibition, focusing narrowly on the harms of marijuana use. None would argue that marijuana use is risk-free. ... We urge policymakers and the public to rely on scientific evidence, not flawed pop science and ideological polemics, in formulating their opinions about marijuana legalization. }}{{ r | guardian-alarmism | p=1 | q=A group of 75 scholars and medical professionals have criticised a controversial new book about the purported dangers of marijuana, calling it an example of \u201calarmism\u201d designed to stir up public fear \u201cbased on a deeply inaccurate misreading of science\u201d. }}{{ r | Hart_and_Ksir | p=1 | q=Does marijuana cause psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and do associated symptoms like paranoia lead to violent crimes? That&apos;s what writer Alex Berenson is claiming. As part of his new book promotion, Berenson published a New York Times op-ed that also blames the drug for \u201csharp increases in murders and aggravated assaults\u201d purportedly observed in some states that allow adult recreational marijuana use.

Mark A. R. Kleiman, a prominent economist who has consistently voiced concern about the negative effects of legal cannabis sales, pointed out that since the early 1990s, as pot usage in America has dramatically increased, violent crime has significantly decreased. One of the experts that Gladwell quotes as warning Canadian parliament on the uncertainties around cannabis, RAND Drug Policy Research Center co-director Beau Kilmer, tweeted in response to Berenson a rather comprehensive study showing, \u201cMarijuana use does not induce violent crime.\u201d Another researcher pointed out that Berenson\u2019s contention that legalization leads to violence, based on limited data from Washington and Colorado, is akin to saying that organic food causes autism, because sales of organic food have risen, in recent years, apace with autism diagnoses.}}{{ r | Hart_and_Ksir | p=1 | q=It is true that people diagnosed with psychosis are more likely to report current or prior use of marijuana than people without psychosis. The easy conclusion to draw from that is that marijuana use caused an increased risk of psychosis, and it is that easy answer that Berenson has seized upon. However, this ignores evidence that psychotic behavior is also associated with higher rates of tobacco use, and with the use of stimulants and opioids. Do all these things \u201ccause\u201d psychosis, or is there another, more likely answer? In our many decades of college teaching, one of the most important things we have tried to impart to our students is the distinction between correlation (two things are statistically associated) and causation (one thing causes another). For example, the wearing of light clothing is more likely during the same months as higher sales of ice-cream, but we do not believe that either causes the other. }}{{ r | Open_Letter | p=1 | q=Overview of the Problems with the Scientific Claims of the Book: * Attributing cause to mere associations. Berenson irresponsibly and dangerously claims a causal link between marijuana use and increases in rates of psychosis and schizophrenia, which have purportedly led to increases in population-level violence. While associations between marijuana use and mental illness have been established, research suggests that the association is complex and mediated by multiple factors other than marijuana, including genetics. Similarly, associations between individual characteristics and violence are multi-factorial. Thus, establishing marijuana as a causal link to violence at the individual level is both theoretically and empirically problematic. Further weakening his arguments, the vast majority of people who use marijuana do not develop psychosis or schizophrenia, nor do they engage in violence, thus making Berenson\u2019s claims far-reaching and exaggerated. }}{{ r | guardian-alarmism | p=1 | q=A group of 75 scholars and medical professionals have criticised a controversial new book about the purported dangers of marijuana, calling it an example of \u201calarmism\u201d designed to stir up public fear \u201cbased on a deeply inaccurate misreading of science\u201d. [The article links to the previous reference.] }}\nas well as [[cherry picking]]{{ r | Nation_TYC | p=1 | q=Additionally, while Berenson takes the trouble to position himself as an expert at interpreting data based on his time as a reporter covering the health-care industry, he has been criticized for cherry-picking studies in this book. The most notable critique comes from one of the researchers who conducted the study he cites for \u201carguably the most important finding of all\u201d: a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that Berenson claims establishes the link between psychosis and marijuana. \u201cIn response to the recent @NYTimes editorial on cannabis and as a committee member on the @theNASEM #cannabis and #cannabinoids report we did NOT conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia,\u201d pharmacologist and cannabis researcher Ziva Cooper tweeted in response to an op-ed by Berenson in The New York Times. }}\ndata that fits his narrative, and falling victim to [[selection bias]] via his use of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]]{{ r | Nation_TYC | p=1 | q=Likewise, Berenson relies heavily on selective anecdotal evidence. For example, he recounts the story of a Mormon man who shot and killed his wife after eating part of a THC-infused candy bar\u2014but he glosses over the marital problems that the couple were having at the time of the wife\u2019s murder, and the fact that she\u2019d expressed a fear of her husband to friends in the days prior to her murder. }}\nto back up his assertions.{{ r | Open_Letter | p=1 | q=Overview of the Problems with the Scientific Claims of the Book: *Attributing cause to mere associations. *Berenson cherry-picks data. *Berenson is guilty of selection bias. *In addition to his flawed use of science, Berenson\u2019s argument outright ignores most of the harms of prohibition, focusing narrowly on the harms of marijuana use. None would argue that marijuana use is risk-free. ... We urge policymakers and the public to rely on scientific evidence, not flawed pop science and ideological polemics, in formulating their opinions about marijuana legalization. }}{{ r | guardian-alarmism | p=1 | q=A group of 75 scholars and medical professionals have criticised a controversial new book about the purported dangers of marijuana, calling it an example of \u201calarmism\u201d designed to stir up public fear \u201cbased on a deeply inaccurate misreading of science\u201d. }}{{ r | Hart_and_Ksir | p=1 | q=Does marijuana cause psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and do associated symptoms like paranoia lead to violent crimes? That&apos;s what writer Alex Berenson is claiming. As part of his new book promotion, Berenson published a New York Times op-ed that also blames the drug for \u201csharp increases in murders and aggravated assaults\u201d purportedly observed in some states that allow adult recreational marijuana use. As scientists with a combined 70-plus years of drug education and research on psychoactive substances, we find Berenson\u2019s assertions to be misinformed and reckless. }}{{ r | WP | p=1 | q=\"Tell Your Children\u201d reignites a long-held concern about cannabis&apos;s public safety. But in relying on sensationalism over science, it has become just the latest use of alarmist claims and attention-seeking to upend a serious public policy dialogue.
