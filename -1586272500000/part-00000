First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staff.<ref name=\"20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.

In 1969, he moved back to [[Toronto]], where he founded Great Ideas Advertising, a [[commercial art]] studio.<ref name=\"bio\" /> On several occasions in the 1960s he was commissioned to illustrate covers for ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine. His controversial views were not well known in the 1960s and 1970s, since he published his opinions under the pseudonym '''Christof Friedrich'''. At the time, he was also an organizer among immigrants for the [[Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes]], [[Quebec]]'s [[Social Credit]] party. In 1968, he joined the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and ran in that year's [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1968|Liberal leadership convention]] under the anglicised name '''Ernest Zundel'''<ref>[http://nizkor.net/ftp.cgi/people/g/ftp.py?people/g//gostick.ron/the-zundel-affair The Zundel Affair], Shofar FTP Archives, nizkor.net</ref> as a self-described \"nuisance candidate\", running on an \"immigrant rights\" platform.

He dropped out of the contest prior to the election, but not before delivering his campaign speech to the convention.\n\nZ\u00fcndel gained prominence and respectability during the 1970s as spokesman for Concerned Parents of German Descent, a group that claimed [[Canadians of German descent|German-Canadians]] and their children were the target of discrimination due to anti-German stereotyping in the media. In the late 1970s, Z\u00fcndel, as the group's spokesman, issued press releases protesting the NBC ''[[Holocaust (TV miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' miniseries for its depiction of Germans. In the late 1970s, reporter [[Mark Bonokoski]] unmasked Z\u00fcndel and ended his career as a credible media spokesperson by revealing that he was publishing neo-nazi and antisemitic pamphlets such as ''The Hitler We Loved and Why'' under the pseudonym Christof Friedrich.<ref>Bonokoski, Mark.

He purportedly had a mailing list of 29,000 in the United States alone. Advertisement space for Samisdat Publishers was purchased in well-known reputable American magazines and even comic books. [[West Germany]] became another large market, in violation of West German ''Volksverhetzung'' (incitement of the masses) laws preventing Holocaust denial and dissemination of Nazi and neo-Nazi material, with Samisdat going so far as to send mass mailings to every member of the West German [[Bundestag]] (parliament).\n\nIn December 1980, the West German Federal Ministry of Finance told the Bundestag that between January 1978 and December 1979, \"200 shipments of right-wing content, including books, periodicals, symbols, decorations, films, cassettes, and records\" had been intercepted entering West Germany; these shipments \"came overwhelmingly from Canada.\" On 23 April 1981, the West German government sent a letter to the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], confirming that the source of the material was Samisdat Publishers.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1982, Z\u00fcndel had his mailing privileges suspended by the Canadian government on the grounds that he had been using the mail to send [[hate speech|hate propaganda]], a criminal offence in Canada. Z\u00fcndel then began shipping from a post office box in [[Niagara Falls, New York]], until the ban on his mailing in Canada was lifted in January 1983.\n\n== Trials in the 1980s ==\nIn 1983, [[Sabina Citron]], a [[Holocaust survivor]] and founder of the Canadian Holocaust Remembrance Association, filed a private complaint against Z\u00fcndel before the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]]. In 1984, the Ontario government joined the criminal proceedings against Z\u00fcndel based on Citron's complaint. Z\u00fcndel was charged under the Criminal Code, section 181, of spreading false news by publishing ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?|Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth At Last]]''.\n\nZ\u00fcndel underwent two criminal trials in 1985 and 1988. The charge against Z\u00fcndel alleged that he \"did publish a statement or tale, namely, ''Did Six Million Really Die?'' that he knows is false and that is likely to cause mischief to the public interest in social and racial tolerance, contrary to the Criminal Code\". After a much publicized trial in 1985, Z\u00fcndel was found guilty. One of the prosecution witnesses, [[Auschwitz]] survivor Arnold Friedman, a Holocaust educator in Toronto, testified that \"prisoners marched off to the ovens never returned\" to which Zundel's lawyer, [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], replied \"if those who disappeared might not have been led out a nearby gate\".<ref>The Press, Christchurch, New Zealand, January 15, 1985</ref> \n\nHis conviction was later overturned in an appeal on a legal technicality, leading to a second trial in 1988, in which he was again convicted. Z\u00fcndel was originally found guilty by two juries but was finally acquitted upon appeal by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] which held in 1992 that section 181 (formerly known as section 177) was a violation of the guarantee of [[freedom of expression]] under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].\n\nThe 1988 trial relied on testimony from [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]]s [[David Irving]] and [[Fred A. Leuchter]], a self-taught execution technician.<ref name=\"transcript\">{{cite news | url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | access-date =March 4, 2007}}</ref> Leuchter's testimony as an expert witness was accepted by the court, but his accompanying [[Leuchter report]] was excluded, based on his lack of engineering credentials. In 1985, key expert testimony against Z\u00fcndel's alleged Holocaust denial was provided at great lengths by Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]], who refused to testify at Z\u00fcndel's 1988 trial. Z\u00fcndel was convicted in 1988 and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by an Ontario court; however, in 1992 in ''[[R v Zundel]]'' his conviction was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] when the law under which he had been charged, ''reporting false news'', was ruled unconstitutional.<ref>{{lexum-scc2|1992|2|731}}</ref>\n\n== Canadian Human Rights Commission; first departure from Canada==\nIn 1997, Z\u00fcndel's marriage with his second wife, Irene Marcarelli, collapsed after 18 months. She subsequently testified against him in the late 1990s when he was under investigation by the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] for promoting hatred against Jews via his website. In January 2000, before the commission had completed its hearings, he left Canada for [[Sevierville, Tennessee]] in the US, where he married his third wife, [[Ingrid Rimland]],<ref name=\"Blount County jail\" /> and vowed never to return to Canada.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Freeze |first1=Colin |title=Deportation to Germany threatens jailed Zundel |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/deportation-to-germany-threatens-jailed-zundel/article25279412/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 13, 2003}}</ref>\n\n== Detention, deportation, and imprisonment ==\n\n===Deportation from the United States===\nIn 2003, Z\u00fcndel was arrested by the United States government for violating immigration rules, specifically visa waiver overstay, which he argued was a trumped up charge. After two weeks he was deported. A warrant for his arrest for ''Volksverhetzung'' (incitement of the masses) had been issued in Germany, where he remained a citizen,  in the same year. At his hearing, Z\u00fcndel described himself as \"the [[Gandhi]] of the right\".<ref name=\"ADL\" />\n\n===Detention and deportation from Canada===\nAlthough Z\u00fcndel lived in Canada for more than 40 years prior to moving to the United States, he never gained [[Canadian citizenship]].

When returning to Canada, Z\u00fcndel claimed [[refugee]] status in hopes of preventing his deportation to Germany. This claim elicited public ridicule; [[Rex Murphy]], a columnist for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and a well-known commentator on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], wrote, \"If Ernst Z\u00fcndel is a refugee, [[Daffy Duck]] is [[Albert Einstein]]&nbsp; ...

During the hearing, Z\u00fcndel characterized his position as \"Sometimes I feel like a black man being convicted on [[Ku Klux Klan]] news clippings.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">http://www.worldofradio.com/dxld3171.txt</ref>\n\nZ\u00fcndel meanwhile moved to be released from detention on his own recognizance while the legal proceedings were ongoing. His lawyer, [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], introduced as a \"surprise witness\" [[Lorraine Day]], a California doctor who practised [[Alternative cancer treatments|alternative cancer treatment]]s, to testify that Z\u00fcndel's incarceration at Toronto's [[Toronto West Detention Centre]] was causing his chest tumor (revealed to the court a few weeks previously) to grow and his blood pressure to rise, that the medication supplied to control his blood pressure was causing side effects such as a slow heart rate and loss of memory, and that he needed \"exercise, fresh air, and freedom from stress. The whole point is we need to have his high blood pressure controlled without the drug.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> On January 21, 2004, after three months of hearings including both public and secret testimony, Justice Blais again ruled against Z\u00fcndel with a damning statement.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Canadian right-wing leader [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]] attempted to hold numerous rallies in support of Z\u00fcndel, both in Ontario and in Alberta.  The rallies were met with formidable opposition, namely by the [[Anti-Racist Action]] group, which heightened its opposition to Fromm's pro-Z\u00fcndel work in the summer of 2004. The anti-racist efforts included participation by numerous Toronto activist groups and individuals, including Shane Ruttle Martinez and Marcell Rodden, and  successfully managed to prevent similar future congregations of the neo-Nazis.  Fromm eventually ceased his efforts after being advised by Z\u00fcndel's attorneys that public clashes between supporters and opponents of Z\u00fcndel were not assisting the image of their client's case.\n\nOn February 24, 2005, Justice Blais ruled that Canada could deport Z\u00fcndel back to Germany at any time, and on February 25, Z\u00fcndel's lawyer, Peter Lindsay, announced that his client would not attempt to obtain a stay against the deportation and that his fight to remain in Canada was over. In his decision, Justice Blais noted that Z\u00fcndel had had the opportunity to respond to the allegations of the decision of January 21 by explaining the nature of his contacts with the extremists mentioned and/or providing exonerating witnesses, but had failed to do so. Blais found that \"Mr. Z\u00fcndel's activities are not only a threat to Canada's national security, but also a threat to the international community of nations.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Makin |first1=Kirk |title=Court finds Zundel can be deported |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/court-finds-zundel-can-be-deported/article976436/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\nZ\u00fcndel was deported to Germany on March 1, 2005.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/zundel-turned-over-to-german-authorities-1.529567| work=CBC News | title=Zundel turned over to German authorities | date=March 1, 2005 }}</ref> Upon his arrival at Frankfurt airport, he was immediately arrested and detained in Mannheim prison awaiting trial for inciting racial hatred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/kanada-holocaust-leugner-zuendel-abgeschoben-a-344288.html|title=Kanada: Holocaust-Leugner Z\u00fcndel abgeschoben - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|publisher=}}</ref> In 2007, Z\u00fcndel's appeal to the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] against deportation was rejected, partly for his failure to exhaust all domestic remedies through a thorough defence as required by its charter, and partly because the committee ruled the case inadmissible as it did not find his rights had been violated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/1341-2005.html|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Trial and imprisonment in Germany ===\nGerman prosecutors charged Z\u00fcndel on July 19, 2005, with 14 counts of inciting racial hatred, which is punishable under [[Strafgesetzbuch|German penal code]], [http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#130 Section 130, 2.(3)] ([[Volksverhetzung|Agitation (sedition) of the People]]) with up to 5 years in prison. The indictment stated Z\u00fcndel \"denied the fate of destruction for the Jews planned by [[National Socialist]] powerholders and justified this by saying that the mass destruction in [[Auschwitz]] and [[Treblinka]], among others, were an invention of the Jews and served the repression and extortion of the German people.\"\n\nHis trial was scheduled for five days beginning November 8, 2005, but ran into an early delay when Judge Ulrich Meinerzhagen ruled that lawyer [[Horst Mahler]], whose licence to practise as a lawyer was withdrawn in 2004 and who, in January 2005, was sentenced to nine months in prison for inciting racial hatred, could not be part of the defence team. Mahler had been associated with the violent far-left [[Red Army Faction]] in the 1970s, but had since become a supporter of far-right and antisemitic groups. Z\u00fcndel's public defender [[Sylvia Stolz]] was also dismissed on the grounds that her written submissions to the court included Mahler's ideas.

His father was captured and incarcerated as a [[prisoner of war]] and did not return home until 1947, by which time he had become an alcoholic.

In 1969, he moved back to [[Toronto]], where he founded Great Ideas Advertising, a [[commercial art]] studio.<ref name=\"bio\" /> On several occasions in the 1960s he was commissioned to illustrate covers for ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine. His controversial views were not well known in the 1960s and 1970s, since he published his opinions under the pseudonym '''Christof Friedrich'''. At the time, he was also an organizer among immigrants for the [[Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes]], [[Quebec]]'s [[Social Credit]] party. In 1968, he joined the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and ran in that year's [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1968|Liberal leadership convention]] under the anglicised name '''Ernest Zundel'''<ref>[http://nizkor.net/ftp.cgi/people/g/ftp.py?people/g//gostick.ron/the-zundel-affair The Zundel Affair], Shofar FTP Archives, nizkor.net</ref> as a self-described \"nuisance candidate\", running on an \"immigrant rights\" platform. He used his candidacy to campaign against [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] attitudes. He dropped out of the contest prior to the election, but not before delivering his campaign speech to the convention.\n\nZ\u00fcndel gained prominence and respectability during the 1970s as spokesman for Concerned Parents of German Descent, a group that claimed [[Canadians of German descent|German-Canadians]] and their children were the target of discrimination due to anti-German stereotyping in the media. In the late 1970s, Z\u00fcndel, as the group's spokesman, issued press releases protesting the NBC ''[[Holocaust (TV miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' miniseries for its depiction of Germans. In the late 1970s, reporter [[Mark Bonokoski]] unmasked Z\u00fcndel and ended his career as a credible media spokesperson by revealing that he was publishing neo-nazi and antisemitic pamphlets such as ''The Hitler We Loved and Why'' under the pseudonym Christof Friedrich.<ref>Bonokoski, Mark.

He purportedly had a mailing list of 29,000 in the United States alone. Advertisement space for Samisdat Publishers was purchased in well-known reputable American magazines and even comic books. [[West Germany]] became another large market, in violation of West German ''Volksverhetzung'' (incitement of the masses) laws preventing Holocaust denial and dissemination of Nazi and neo-Nazi material, with Samisdat going so far as to send mass mailings to every member of the West German [[Bundestag]] (parliament).\n\nIn December 1980, the West German Federal Ministry of Finance told the Bundestag that between January 1978 and December 1979, \"200 shipments of right-wing content, including books, periodicals, symbols, decorations, films, cassettes, and records\" had been intercepted entering West Germany; these shipments \"came overwhelmingly from Canada.\" On 23 April 1981, the West German government sent a letter to the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], confirming that the source of the material was Samisdat Publishers.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1982, Z\u00fcndel had his mailing privileges suspended by the Canadian government on the grounds that he had been using the mail to send [[hate speech|hate propaganda]], a criminal offence in Canada. Z\u00fcndel then began shipping from a post office box in [[Niagara Falls, New York]], until the ban on his mailing in Canada was lifted in January 1983.\n\n== Trials in the 1980s ==\nIn 1983, [[Sabina Citron]], a [[Holocaust survivor]] and founder of the Canadian Holocaust Remembrance Association, filed a private complaint against Z\u00fcndel before the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]]. In 1984, the Ontario government joined the criminal proceedings against Z\u00fcndel based on Citron's complaint. Z\u00fcndel was charged under the Criminal Code, section 181, of spreading false news by publishing ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?|Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth At Last]]''.\n\nZ\u00fcndel underwent two criminal trials in 1985 and 1988. The charge against Z\u00fcndel alleged that he \"did publish a statement or tale, namely, ''Did Six Million Really Die?'' that he knows is false and that is likely to cause mischief to the public interest in social and racial tolerance, contrary to the Criminal Code\". After a much publicized trial in 1985, Z\u00fcndel was found guilty. One of the prosecution witnesses, [[Auschwitz]] survivor Arnold Friedman, a Holocaust educator in Toronto, testified that \"prisoners marched off to the ovens never returned\" to which Zundel's lawyer, [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], replied \"if those who disappeared might not have been led out a nearby gate\".<ref>The Press, Christchurch, New Zealand, January 15, 1985</ref> \n\nHis conviction was later overturned in an appeal on a legal technicality, leading to a second trial in 1988, in which he was again convicted. Z\u00fcndel was originally found guilty by two juries but was finally acquitted upon appeal by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] which held in 1992 that section 181 (formerly known as section 177) was a violation of the guarantee of [[freedom of expression]] under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].\n\nThe 1988 trial relied on testimony from [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]]s [[David Irving]] and [[Fred A. Leuchter]], a self-taught execution technician.<ref name=\"transcript\">{{cite news | url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | access-date =March 4, 2007}}</ref> Leuchter's testimony as an expert witness was accepted by the court, but his accompanying [[Leuchter report]] was excluded, based on his lack of engineering credentials. In 1985, key expert testimony against Z\u00fcndel's alleged Holocaust denial was provided at great lengths by Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]], who refused to testify at Z\u00fcndel's 1988 trial. Z\u00fcndel was convicted in 1988 and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by an Ontario court; however, in 1992 in ''[[R v Zundel]]'' his conviction was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] when the law under which he had been charged, ''reporting false news'', was ruled unconstitutional.<ref>{{lexum-scc2|1992|2|731}}</ref>\n\n== Canadian Human Rights Commission; first departure from Canada==\nIn 1997, Z\u00fcndel's marriage with his second wife, Irene Marcarelli, collapsed after 18 months. She subsequently testified against him in the late 1990s when he was under investigation by the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] for promoting hatred against Jews via his website. In January 2000, before the commission had completed its hearings, he left Canada for [[Sevierville, Tennessee]] in the US, where he married his third wife, [[Ingrid Rimland]],<ref name=\"Blount County jail\" /> and vowed never to return to Canada.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Freeze |first1=Colin |title=Deportation to Germany threatens jailed Zundel |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/deportation-to-germany-threatens-jailed-zundel/article25279412/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 13, 2003}}</ref>\n\n== Detention, deportation, and imprisonment ==\n\n===Deportation from the United States===\nIn 2003, Z\u00fcndel was arrested by the United States government for violating immigration rules, specifically visa waiver overstay, which he argued was a trumped up charge. After two weeks he was deported. A warrant for his arrest for ''Volksverhetzung'' (incitement of the masses) had been issued in Germany, where he remained a citizen,  in the same year. At his hearing, Z\u00fcndel described himself as \"the [[Gandhi]] of the right\".<ref name=\"ADL\" />\n\n===Detention and deportation from Canada===\nAlthough Z\u00fcndel lived in Canada for more than 40 years prior to moving to the United States, he never gained [[Canadian citizenship]]. Applications for citizenship were rejected in 1966 and 1994 for undisclosed reasons.<ref name = \"conviction\" /> On his return to Canada, he had no status in the country as he was not a citizen and as his [[landed immigrant]] status had been forfeited by his prolonged absence from the country. When returning to Canada, Z\u00fcndel claimed [[refugee]] status in hopes of preventing his deportation to Germany. This claim elicited public ridicule; [[Rex Murphy]], a columnist for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and a well-known commentator on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], wrote, \"If Ernst Z\u00fcndel is a refugee, [[Daffy Duck]] is [[Albert Einstein]]&nbsp; ...

During the hearing, Z\u00fcndel characterized his position as \"Sometimes I feel like a black man being convicted on [[Ku Klux Klan]] news clippings.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">http://www.worldofradio.com/dxld3171.txt</ref>\n\nZ\u00fcndel meanwhile moved to be released from detention on his own recognizance while the legal proceedings were ongoing. His lawyer, [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], introduced as a \"surprise witness\" [[Lorraine Day]], a California doctor who practised [[Alternative cancer treatments|alternative cancer treatment]]s, to testify that Z\u00fcndel's incarceration at Toronto's [[Toronto West Detention Centre]] was causing his chest tumor (revealed to the court a few weeks previously) to grow and his blood pressure to rise, that the medication supplied to control his blood pressure was causing side effects such as a slow heart rate and loss of memory, and that he needed \"exercise, fresh air, and freedom from stress. The whole point is we need to have his high blood pressure controlled without the drug.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> On January 21, 2004, after three months of hearings including both public and secret testimony, Justice Blais again ruled against Z\u00fcndel with a damning statement.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Canadian right-wing leader [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]] attempted to hold numerous rallies in support of Z\u00fcndel, both in Ontario and in Alberta.  The rallies were met with formidable opposition, namely by the [[Anti-Racist Action]] group, which heightened its opposition to Fromm's pro-Z\u00fcndel work in the summer of 2004. The anti-racist efforts included participation by numerous Toronto activist groups and individuals, including Shane Ruttle Martinez and Marcell Rodden, and  successfully managed to prevent similar future congregations of the neo-Nazis.  Fromm eventually ceased his efforts after being advised by Z\u00fcndel's attorneys that public clashes between supporters and opponents of Z\u00fcndel were not assisting the image of their client's case.\n\nOn February 24, 2005, Justice Blais ruled that Canada could deport Z\u00fcndel back to Germany at any time, and on February 25, Z\u00fcndel's lawyer, Peter Lindsay, announced that his client would not attempt to obtain a stay against the deportation and that his fight to remain in Canada was over. In his decision, Justice Blais noted that Z\u00fcndel had had the opportunity to respond to the allegations of the decision of January 21 by explaining the nature of his contacts with the extremists mentioned and/or providing exonerating witnesses, but had failed to do so. Blais found that \"Mr. Z\u00fcndel's activities are not only a threat to Canada's national security, but also a threat to the international community of nations.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Makin |first1=Kirk |title=Court finds Zundel can be deported |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/court-finds-zundel-can-be-deported/article976436/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=February 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\nZ\u00fcndel was deported to Germany on March 1, 2005.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/zundel-turned-over-to-german-authorities-1.529567| work=CBC News | title=Zundel turned over to German authorities | date=March 1, 2005 }}</ref> Upon his arrival at Frankfurt airport, he was immediately arrested and detained in Mannheim prison awaiting trial for inciting racial hatred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/kanada-holocaust-leugner-zuendel-abgeschoben-a-344288.html|title=Kanada: Holocaust-Leugner Z\u00fcndel abgeschoben - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|publisher=}}</ref> In 2007, Z\u00fcndel's appeal to the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] against deportation was rejected, partly for his failure to exhaust all domestic remedies through a thorough defence as required by its charter, and partly because the committee ruled the case inadmissible as it did not find his rights had been violated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/1341-2005.html|title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Trial and imprisonment in Germany ===\nGerman prosecutors charged Z\u00fcndel on July 19, 2005, with 14 counts of inciting racial hatred, which is punishable under [[Strafgesetzbuch|German penal code]], [http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#130 Section 130, 2.(3)] ([[Volksverhetzung|Agitation (sedition) of the People]]) with up to 5 years in prison. The indictment stated Z\u00fcndel \"denied the fate of destruction for the Jews planned by [[National Socialist]] powerholders and justified this by saying that the mass destruction in [[Auschwitz]] and [[Treblinka]], among others, were an invention of the Jews and served the repression and extortion of the German people.\"\n\nHis trial was scheduled for five days beginning November 8, 2005, but ran into an early delay when Judge Ulrich Meinerzhagen ruled that lawyer [[Horst Mahler]], whose licence to practise as a lawyer was withdrawn in 2004 and who, in January 2005, was sentenced to nine months in prison for inciting racial hatred, could not be part of the defence team. Mahler had been associated with the violent far-left [[Red Army Faction]] in the 1970s, but had since become a supporter of far-right and antisemitic groups. Z\u00fcndel's public defender [[Sylvia Stolz]] was also dismissed on the grounds that her written submissions to the court included Mahler's ideas. On November 15, 2005, Meinerzhagen announced that the trial was to be rescheduled to allow new counsel time to prepare.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/neo-nazi-trial-put-on-ice-after-upset/a-1777889|title=Neo-Nazi Trial Put on Ice After Upset|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]  |date=November 15, 2005|access-date=March 7, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe trial resumed on February 9, 2006, for several court sessions but then adjourned on March 9 when the trial judge asked for Sylvia Stolz to be removed as Z\u00fcndel's defence lawyer after she repeatedly disrupted the trial and had to be dragged out of the court by two bailiffs. Stolz signed \"Heil Hitler\" on court motions, said the Holocaust was \"the biggest lie in world history,\" and yelled that the judge deserved the death penalty for \"offering succour to the enemy\". In 2008, Stolz was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison and stripped of her licence to practice law for five years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/german-neo-nazi-lawyer-sentenced-for-denying-holocaust/a-3058271 |title=German Neo-Nazi Lawyer Sentenced for Denying Holocaust|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]  |date=January 14, 2008 |access-date=March 7, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/zuendel-prozess-anwaeltin-aus-dem-saal-getragen-558993.html |title=Anw\u00e4ltin aus dem Saal getragen |trans-title=Lawyer Dragged Out of Court |publisher=[[Stern (magazine)|Star]] |date=January 14, 2008 |access-date=March 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402161814/http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/zuendel-prozess-anwaeltin-aus-dem-saal-getragen-558993.html |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe trial again resumed on June 9, 2006, and continued, intermittently, into early 2007.

These titles include \"Secret Nazi Polar Expeditions\" (1978) and \"Hitler at the South Pole\" (1979). He promoted the idea of Nazi secret bases in Antarctica, [[Nazi UFOs]], secret polar bases and [[Hollow Earth]] theories.\n\nAlong with Willibald Mattern, a German [[wikt:\u00e9migr\u00e9|\u00e9migr\u00e9]] living in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], Z\u00fcndel also wrote ''UFOs: Nazi Secret Weapon?'' on Nazi UFOs in German and translated into English.\n\nIt is not clear whether Z\u00fcndel really believed these theories or whether they were merely speculative fiction.<ref name=\"UFO secret weapon\" /><ref name=\"flying saucers\" /><ref>Goodricke-Clarke.

(which became an underground bestseller, going through several printings) was nothing more than popular fiction to build publicity for Samisdat. Said Z\u00fcndel in a telephone conversation with Miele:\n\"I realized that North Americans were not interested in being educated. They want to be entertained. The book was for fun. With a picture of the F\u00fchrer on the cover and flying saucers coming out of Antarctica it was a chance to get on radio and TV talk shows. For about 15 minutes of an hour program I'd talk about that esoteric stuff. Then I would start talking about all those Jewish scientists in [[concentration camp]]s, working on these secret weapons. And that was my chance to talk about what I wanted to talk about.\" \"In that case,\" I asked him, \"do you still stand by what you wrote in the UFO book?\" \"Look,\" he replied, \"it has a question mark at the end of the title.\"<ref name=\"flying saucers\" /><ref>Baker, Alan.

The [[Tai peoples]] migrated south in a series of waves beginning in the 7th century and accelerated following the [[Mongol conquest of China|Mongol conquest of Yunnan]] (1253\u20131256) into the northern reaches of what would become the kingdom of Lan Xang.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=24\u201326}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|2006 |p=6}}\n\nThe fertile northern [[Mekong]] valleys were occupied by the [[Dvaravati]] culture of the [[Mon people]] and subsequently by the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]], where the principal city-state in the north was known then as [[Muang Sua]] and alternately as ''Xieng Dong Xieng Thong'' \"The City of Flame Trees beside the River Dong\", (modern city of [[Luang Prabang]]).{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=24\u201326}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|2006 |p=6}}\n\nWith the rise of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] the principal city-states of [[Muang Sua]] ([[Luang Prabang]]) and south to the twin cities of ''Vieng Chan Vieng Kham'' ([[Vientiane]]), came increasingly under Tai influence.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=45,51; 33\u201335}} Following the death of the Sukhothai king [[Ram Khamhaeng]], and internal disputes within the kingdom of [[Lan Na]], both ''Vieng Chan Vieng Kham'' ([[Vientiane]]) and ''Muang Sua'' ([[Luang Prabang]]) were independent Lao-Tai [[mandala (political model)|mandalas]] until the founding of Lan Xang in 1353.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003|p=51}}\n\n=== The Legends of Khun Borom ===\nThe cultural memory of the early migrations and the mixing of Tai influence with the indigenous, Mon, and [[Khmer people]]s were preserved in the origin myths and traditions of Lan Xang. The cultural, linguistic, and political roots which highlight the commonality of these early legends can help to understand Lan Xang and its relations with neighboring kingdoms. The ''Nithan Khun Borum'' \"Story of [[Khun Borom]]\" was central to these origin stories and formed the introduction to the ''Phongsavadan'' or court chronicles which were read aloud during auspicious occasions and festivals.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=22\u201329}} Throughout the history of Lan Xang the legitimacy of the monarchy was tied to the single dynasty of [[Khun Lo]], the legendary king of Muang Sua and son of Khun Borom.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=11\u201315}}{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=9\u201310}}{{sfnp|Evans| 2009| p=2}}\n\n=== The Conquests of King Fa Ngum ===\nThe traditional court histories of Lan Xang begin in the ''Year of the N\u0101ga'' 1316 (the [[n\u0101ga]] a mythical serpent of the Mekong and a protector spirit of the kingdom) with the birth of [[Fa Ngum]].{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=26}} Fa Ngum's Grandfather Souvanna Khampong was king of [[Muang Sua]] and his father Chao Fa Ngiao was the crown prince. As a youth Fa Ngum was sent to the [[Khmer Empire]] to live as a son of King Jayavarman IX, where he was given princess Keo Kang Ya. In 1343 King Souvanna Khampong died, and a succession dispute for Muang Sua took place.{{sfnp|Coe| 2003 }}\n\nIn 1349 Fa Ngum was granted an army known as the \"Ten Thousand\" to take the crown. At the time the Khmer Empire was in decline (possibly from an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] and the combined influx of [[Tai peoples]]),{{sfnp|Coe| 2003 }} both Lanna and Sukhothai had been established in what had been Khmer territory, and the Siamese were growing in the area of the [[Chao Phraya River]] which would become the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=30\u201349}} The opportunity for the Khmer was to create a friendly buffer state in an area they could no longer effectively control with only a moderately sized military force.\n\nFa Ngum's campaign started in southern Laos, taking the towns and cities in the region around Champasak and moving northward through Thakek and [[Khammouane Province|Kham Muang]] along the middle [[Mekong]]. From his position on the middle [[Mekong]], Fa Ngum sought assistance and supply from [[Vientiane]] in attacking Muang Sua, which they refused. However, Prince Nho of [[Muang Phuan]] (Muang Phoueune) offered assistance and vassalage to Fa Ngum for assistance in a succession dispute of his own and help in securing Muang Phuan from the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]. Fa Ngum agreed and quickly moved his army to take Muang Phuan and then on to take [[Xam Neua]] and several smaller cities of the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=30\u201335}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=38\u201343}}\n\nThe \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, concerned with their rival [[Champa]] to the south sought a clearly defined border with the growing power of Fa Ngum. The result was to use the [[Annamite Range]] as both a cultural and territorial barrier between the two kingdoms. Continuing his conquests Fa Ngum turned toward the [[Sip Song Chau Tai]] along the [[Red River (Asia)|Red]] and [[Black River (Asia)|Black River]] valleys, which were heavily populated with [[Lao people|Lao]]. Having secured a sizable force of Lao from each territory under his domain Fa Ngum moved down the [[Nam Ou]] to take [[Muang Sua]]. Despite three attacks the King of Muang Sua, who was Fa Ngum's uncle, was unable to deter the size of Fa Ngum's army and committed suicide rather than be taken alive.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=30\u201335}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=38\u201343}}\n\nIn 1353 Fa Ngum was crowned,<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coed\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George Coed\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

King Phayu of Lanna raised an army which Fa Ngum overwhelmed at [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]], forcing Lanna to cede some its territory and provide valuable gifts in exchange for mutual recognition. Having secured his immediate borders Fa Ngum returned to [[Muang Sua]]. {{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=30\u201335}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=38\u201343}}\n\nIn 1351 [[Uthong]], who was married to a daughter of the Khmer King Suphanburi, founded the city of [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. However, the remains of the Khmer Empire were in direct conflict with the growing power of Ayutthaya and the two became rivals rather than allies. Throughout the 1350s Ayutthaya expanded over western Khmer territories and the [[Khorat Plateau]]. In 1352 [[Angkor]] was attacked by Ayutthaya in a failed attempt to take the capital. {{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=52}}\n\n[[Vientiane]] remained independent and powerful, and the growing power of Ayutthaya threatened regional stability. In 1356 Fa Ngum marched south to take [[Vientiane]] for failing to support his earlier advance on [[Muang Sua]]. In 1357 he took [[Vientiane]] and the surrounding plains, and marched south to assert [[Lao people|Lao]] control over the areas seized by Ayutthaya. Fa Ngum moved across the [[Khorat Plateau]] taking the major cities along the [[Mun River|Mun]] and [[Chi River]]s and moving as far south as [[Roi Et]].{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=36}}\n\nIn Roi Et, Fa Ngum directly challenged Ayutthaya, which acknowledged Lan Xang's control over the [[Khorat Plateau]]. Uthong sent 100 elephants, gold, silver, over 1,000 pieces of ivory and betrothed his daughter Nang Keo Lot Fa to be a second wife to Fa Ngum.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=36}} By 1357 Fa Ngum had established the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] for the Kingdom of Lan Xang which extended from the borders of the Sipsong Panna with China south to [[Krati\u00e9 Province|Sambor]] below the [[Mekong]] rapids at [[Khong Island]], and from the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7tnamese border along the [[Annamite Range]] to the western escarpment of the [[Khorat Plateau]].

Fa Ngum became an exile in [[Muang Nan]], where he died between 1373 and 1390.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|2003|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-86448-954-5|p=80}}\n\nIn 1371, Oun Huean was crowned as [[Samsenthai|King Samsenthai]] (King of 300,000 Tai) a carefully chosen name for the Lao-Khmer prince, which showed preference for the Lao-tai population he governed over the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] factions at court. Samenthai consolidated the gains of his father, and fought back Lanna in [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] during the 1390s. In 1402 he received formal recognition for Lan Xang from the [[Ming Empire]] in China.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|2003|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-86448-954-5|p=80}}\n\n[[File:Map-of-southeast-asia 1400 CE.png|thumb|upright|Mainland Southeast Asia in the early 15th century<br /> '''Teal''': Lan Xang <br /> '''Purple''': [[Lan Na]] <br /> '''Orange''': [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] <br /> '''Blue Violet''': [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] <br /> '''Red''': [[Khmer Empire]] <br />'''Yellow''': [[Champa]] <br /> '''Blue''': [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]]]\nIn 1416, at the age of sixty, [[Samsenthai]] died and was succeeded by his song [[Lan Kham Daeng]].

An army of 30,000 with 100 elephant cavalry was dispatched, but instead sided with the Chinese.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=47\u201348}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=20\u201321}}\n\nThe death of [[Lan Kham Daeng]] ushered in a period of uncertainty and [[regicide]]. from 1428 to 1440 seven kings ruled Lan Xang, all were killed by assassination or intrigue guided by a Queen known only by her title as ''Maha Devi'' or as ''[[Nang Keo Phimpha]]'' \"The Cruel\". It is possible that from 1440 to 1442 she ruled Lan Xang as the first and only female leader, before being drowned in the Mekong in 1442 as an offering to the [[N\u0101ga|naga]]. In 1440 [[Vientiane]] revolted, but despite the years of instability the capital at [[Muang Sua]] was able to suppress the rebellion. An [[interregnum]] began in 1453 and ended in 1456 with the crowning of King Chakkaphat (1456\u20131479).{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|1993}}\n\n=== The White Elephant War with Vietnam ===\nIn 1448 during the disorder of the ''Maha Devi'', Muang Phuan and some areas along the [[Black River (Asia)|Black River]] were annexed by the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and several skirmishes took place against Lanna along the [[Nan River]].{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=65}} In 1471 [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng|Emperor L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]] of  [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] invaded and destroyed the kingdom of [[Champa]]. Also in 1471, Muang Phuan revolted and several Vietnamese were killed. By 1478 preparations were being made for a full-scale invasion of Lan Xang in retribution for the rebellion in Muang Phuan and, more importantly, for supportin the [[Ming Empire]] in 1421.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=51\u201352}}\n\nAround the same time, a [[White elephant (animal)|white elephant]] had been captured and brought to King Chakkaphat. The elephant was recognized as a symbol of kingship throughout Southeast Asia and [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]] requested the animal's hair to be brought as a gift to the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t court. The request was seen as an affront, and according to legend, a box filled with dung was sent instead. The pretext having been set, a massive Viet force marched in five columns to subdue Muang Phuan, and was met with a Lan Xang force of 200,000 infantry and 2,000 elephant cavalry in support which was led by the crown prince and three supporting generals.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=51\u201352}}\n\nThe \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t won a hard-fought victory and continued north to threaten [[Muang Sua]]. King Chakkaphat and the court fled south toward [[Vientiane]] along the [[Mekong]]. The [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] took the capital of [[Luang Prabang]], and then divided their forces to create a [[pincer attack]]. One branch continued west taking Sipsong Panna and threatening Lanna and another force headed south along the [[Mekong]] toward [[Vientiane]]. King Tilok and Lanna preemptively destroyed the northern army, and the forces around [[Vientiane]] rallied under King Chakkaphat's younger son Prince Thaen Kham. The combined forces destroyed the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] army, which fled in the direction of Muang Phuan. Although numbering only about 4,000 men, the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t destroyed the Muang Phuan capital in one last act of vengeance before retreating.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=66\u201367}}\n\nPrince Thaen Kham then offered to restore his father Chakkphat to the throne, but he refused and abdicated in favor of his son who was crowned as Suvanna Balang (The Golden Chair) in 1479. The \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t would not invade the unified Lan Xang for the next 200 years, and Lanna became a close ally to Lan Xang.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=21\u201322}}{{sfnp|Bush|Elliot|Ray|2011|p=26}}\n\n=== King Visoun and a Flowering of Culture ===\n[[File:Wat Visoun, Luang Prabang Laos by Louis Delaporte.jpg|thumbnail|right|Wat Visoun, as seen by Louis Delaporte c.1867]]\nThrough subsequent kings Lan Xang would repair the damage of the war with the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, which led to a blossoming of culture and trade. [[Visunarat|King Visoun]] (1500\u20131520) was a major patron of the arts and during his reign the classical literature of Lan Xang was first written.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=22\u201325}} The [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] monks and monasteries became centers of learning and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] grew in both cultural and political power. The ''Nithan Khun Borom'' (Story of [[Khun Borom]]) first appeared in written form, along with several transcriptions of the [[Jataka Tales]] which recall previous lives of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The [[Tripitaka]] was transcribed from [[Pali]] to [[Lao language|Lao]], and the Lao version of the [[Ramayana]] or ''[[Pra Lak Pra Lam]]'' was also written.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=74}}\n\nEpic poems were written along with treatises on medicine, astrology and law. Lao [[Lao music|court music]] was also systematized and the classical court orchestra took shape. [[Visunarat|King Visoun]] also sponsored several major temples or \"wats\" throughout the country. He chose the [[Phra Bang]] a standing image of the [[Buddha]] in the [[mudra]] or position of \"dispelling fear\" to be the [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] of Lan Xang.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=74}} The [[Phra Bang]] had been brought by Fa Ngum's Khmer wife Keo Kang Ya from [[Angkor]] as a gift from her father.

In 1523 he requested a copy of the [[Tripi\u1e6daka]] from King Kaeo in Lanna, and in 1527 he abolished [[Satsana Phi|spirit worship]] throughout the kingdom. In 1532 the period of peace ended for Lan Xang when Muang Phuan rebelled and took Photisarath two years to fully suppress.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=56\u201361}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=74\u201375}}{{sfnp|Viravong| 1964| p=50\u201351}}\n\nIn 1533 he moved his court to [[Vientiane]], the commercial capital of Lan Xang which was located on the floodplains of the [[Mekong]] below the capital at [[Luang Prabang]]. Vientiane was the principal city of Lan Xang, and lay at the confluence of trade routes, but that access also made it the focal point for invasion from which it was difficult to defend. The move allowed Photisarath to better administer the kingdom and to respond to the outlying provinces which bordered the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] and the growing power of [[Burma]].{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=56\u201361}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=74\u201375}}{{sfnp|Viravong| 1964| p=50\u201351}}\n\nIn 1539 he made a pilgrimage to [[That Sikhottabong|Sikhottabong]] and he also made improvements to [[That Phanom]] to reinforce Lan Xang's southern regional power. Also in 1539 Photisarath accepted a [[Thai people|Thai]] noble who was seeking asylum from King [[Chairacha]] of Ayutthaya for a failed rebellion. The incident resulted in a series of full-scale invasion of Lan Xang which was soundly defeated at ''Sala Kham'' in 1540.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=56\u201361}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=74\u201375}}{{sfnp|Viravong| 1964| p=50\u201351}}\n\nLanna had a series of internal succession disputes throughout the 1540s. The weakened kingdom was invaded first by the [[Burma|Burmese]] and then in 1545 by Ayutthaya. Both attempted invasions were repulsed although significant damage had been done in the surrounding countryside. Lan Xang dispatched reinforcements to support their allies in Lanna. In response, Chairacha set out at the head of a second army in 1547 to take [[Chiang Mai]] where he was again defeated and forced into full retreat to Ayutthaya, where he died almost immediately upon his return.{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=78}}\n\nThe succession disputes in Lanna continued, but the position of Lanna between the aggressive states of Burma and Ayutthaya necessitated that the kingdom be brought back to order. In recognition for his assistance against Ayutthaya, and his strong familial ties to Lanna, King Photisarath was offered the throne of Lanna for his son Prince [[Setthathirath]], who in 1547 was crowned King in Chiang Mai. Lan Xang was at the height of their political power, with Photisarath as King of Lan Xang and Setthathirath his son as King of [[Lanna]]. In the elaborate court ceremony recorded in the ''Chiang Mai Chronicles'', Setthathirath took possession of the [[Emerald Buddha]] as his personal [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] (which would later become the palladium of Vientiane) and was given the princesses Nang Thip and Nang Tonkham as queens.{{sfnp|Wyatt|Wichienkeeo| 1995| p=118\u2013119}}\n\nThe peace would not last long. In 1548, the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1547\u201349)|Burmese invaded Ayutthaya]] but failed to take the capital; that same year Photisarath was approached by Burma with offers of an alliance. Photisarath neither accepted the alliance, nor did he support Ayutthaya which had unsuccessfully tried to invade Lan Xang only eight years earlier. In 1550 Photisarath returned to Luang Prabang, but was killed in an accident while riding an elephant in front of the fifteen international delegations which were seeking an audience.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=64\u201368}}\n\n=== King Setthathirath and the Burmese invasions ===\n[[File:Setthathirat.JPG|thumb|Statue of King Sai Setthathirath at [[Pha That Luang]], [[Vientiane]]]]\nIn 1548 [[Setthathirath|King Setthathirath]] (as King of Lanna) had taken [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] as his capital.

Following the untimely death of his father, King Setthathirath left Lanna leaving his wife as [[regent]]. Arriving in Lan Xang, Setthathirath was crowned as King of Lan Xang.

For his success, Sen Soulintha was given the title ''Luxai'' (Victorious) and offered one of his daughters to King Setthathirath. In 1556 Burma, under [[Bayinnaung|King Bayinnaung]] invaded Lanna. King Mekuti of Lanna surrendered Chiang Mai without a fight, but was reinstated as a Burmese vassal under military occupation.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=71\u201373}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=78}}\n\nIn 1560, King Setthathirath formally moved the capital of Lan Xang from Luang Prabang to Vientiane, which would remain the capital over the next two hundred and fifty years.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=73}} The formal movement of the capital followed an expansive building program which included strengthening city defenses, the construction of a massive formal palace and the [[Haw Phra Kaew]] to house the [[Emerald Buddha]], and major renovations to [[That Luang]] in Vientiane. In Luang Prabang, [[Wat Xieng Thong]] was constructed perhaps in compensation for the loss of status as the former capital of Lan Xang, and in [[Nakhon Phanom]] major renovations were made to [[That Phanom]].{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=61\u201372}}\n\nIn 1563, a treaty was signed between Lan Xang and Ayutthaya, which was sealed by the betrothal of Princess Thepkasattri (whose mother was Queen [[Suriyothai]] of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]).

Facing the threat of a superior Burmese force, King Chakkraphat had lost a potential alliance with Lan Xang, the northern territories of Ayutthaya and his daughter. To prevent further incursions, King Chakkraphat became a vassal of Burma and had to deliver both himself and his son [[Prince Ramesuan]] as hostages to King Bayinnaung leaving another son   [[Mahinthrathirat|Prince Mahinthrathirat]] as a vassal in Ayutthaya.{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=81}}\n\nThe Burmese then turned north to depose King Mekuti of Lanna, who had failed to support the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya in 1563.<ref name=geh-167-168>Harvey 1925: 167\u2013168</ref><ref name=my-2-266-268>Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 266\u2013268</ref> When Chiang Mai fell to the Burmese, a number of refugees fled to Vientiane and Lan Xang. King Setthathirath, realizing that Vientiane could not be held against a prolonged siege, ordered the city to be evacuated and stripped of supplies. When the Burmese took Vientiane they were forced into the countryside for supplies, where King Setthathirath had organized [[guerrilla]] attacks and small raids to harass the Burmese troops. Facing disease, malnutrition and demoralizing guerrilla warfare, King Bayinnaung was forced to retreat in 1565 leaving Lan Xang the only remaining independent [[Tai peoples|Tai]] kingdom.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=73\u201375}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=81\u201382}}\n\n==== Covert plans ====\n{{See also|Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1568\u201370)}}\n[[File:Wat Xieng Thong Laos I.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Wat Xieng Thong]], [[Luang Prabang]]]]\nIn 1567, King Mahinthrathirat approached King Setthathirath with covert plans for Ayutthaya to rebel against Burma by launching a counterattack against Mahathammarachathirat in Phitsanulok. The plan would involve an overland invasion from Lan Xang with assistance from the royal navy in Ayutthaya passing up the [[Nan River]]. Mahathammarachathirat was in Burma at the time, and Maha Chakkraphat had been allowed to return to Ayutthaya as Burma was facing small rebellions in the [[Shan people|Shan]] areas.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=78\u201379}}\n\nThe plan was discovered and reinforcements were sent to Phitsanulok. Realizing Phitsanulok was too fortified, King Setthathirath withdrew his attack, but set up a devastating counter ambush on his retreat to Vientiane in which five pursuing Burmese generals were killed. Seizing on the weakness, King Chakkraphat ordered a second attack on Phitsanulok in which he successfully took the city, but could only briefly hold it having suffered repeated heavy losses.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=78\u201379}}\n\nKing Bayinnaung sent a massive invasion in 1568 in response to the uprising. In early 1569, the city of Ayutthaya was directly under threat and Vientiane sent reinforcements. The Burmese had planned on the reinforcements however and King Setthathirath fell into a trap.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003|p=82}} After a two-day struggle the Lan Xang forces prevailed at the Pa Sak Valley near [[Phetchabun Province|Phetchabun]], at which point one of the commanding generals from [[Nakhon Phanom]] broke south toward Ayutthaya.

King Setthathirath upon reaching Vientiane ordered an immediate evacuation. The Burmese took several weeks to regroup and rest having taken Ayutthaya, which allowed Setthathirath to rally his forces and plan for prolonged guerrilla warfare. The Burmese arrived in Vientiane and were able to take the lightly defended city. Just as in 1565, Setthathirath began a guerrilla campaign from his base near the [[Nam Ngum]], northeast of Vientiane. In 1570 Bayinnaung retreated, Setthathirath counterattacked and more than 30,000 were taken prisoner, along with 100 elephants, and 2,300 pieces of ivory from the retreating Burmese.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=79\u201381}}\n\nIn 1571, the Ayutthaya Kingdom and Lan Na were Burmese vassals. Having twice defended Lan Xang from Burmese invasions, King Setthathirath moved south to conduct a campaign against the [[Khmer Empire]]. Defeating the Khmer would have greatly strengthened Lan Xang, giving it vital sea access, trade opportunities, and most importantly, European firearms which had been growing use since the early 1500s. The ''Khmer Chronicles'' record that armies from Lan Xang invaded in 1571 and 1572, during the second invasion King Barom Reacha I was slain in an elephant duel. The Khmer must have rallied and Lan Xang retreated, Setthathirath went missing near [[Attapeu Province|Attapeu]].

He fell under immediate suspicion, and a civil war raged in Vientiane as a succession dispute took place. In 1573, he emerged as king [[regent]] but lacked support. Upon hearing reports of the unrest, Bayinnaung dispatched emissaries demanding the immediate surrender of Lan Xang. Sen Soulintha had the emissaries killed.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=85}}\n\nBayinnaung invaded Vientiane in 1574, Sen Soulintha ordered the city to be evacuated but he lacked the support of the people and the army.

The [[History of Myanmar#First Taungoo Empire (1510\u201399)|First Taungoo Empire (1510\u201399)]] was established but faced internal rebellions. In 1580 Sen Soulintha returned as a Burmese vassal, and in 1581 Bayinnaung died with his son King [[Nanda Bayin]] in control of the Toungoo Empire.

The [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] in Lan Xang sent a mission to [[Nandabayin|King Nandabayin]] asking for Nokeo Koumane to be returned to Lan Xang as a vassal king. In 1591 he was crowned in [[Vientiane]], gathered an army and marched to [[Luang Prabang]] where he reunited the cities, declared Lan Xang independence and cast off any allegiance to the [[Toungoo Empire]]. King Nokeo Koumane then marched toward Muang Phuan and then to the central provinces reuniting all the former territories of Lan Xang.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=88\u201390}}\n\nIn 1593 King Nokeo Koumane launched an attack against Lanna and the Taungoo [[Nawrahta Minsaw|Prince Tharrawaddy Min]]. Tharrawaddy Min sought assistance from [[Burma]], but rebellions throughout the empire prevented any support. In desperation a request was sent to the Burmese vassal in Ayutthaya [[Naresuan|King Naresuan]]. [[Naresuan|King Naresuan]] dispatched a large army and turned on [[Tharrawaddy Min]], forcing the Burmese to accept Ayutthaya as independent and Lanna as a vassal kingdom. King Nokeo Koumane realized he was outnumbered by the combined strength of Ayutthaya and [[Kingdom of Lanna|Lanna]] and called off the attack. In 1596, King Nokeo Koumane died suddenly and without an heir. Although he had united Lan Xang, and restored the kingdom to a point that it could repel an outside invasion, a succession dispute took place and a series of weak kings followed until 1637.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=88\u201390}}\n\n=== The Golden Age of Lan Xang ===\n[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|Seated Buddha figure from Lan Xang, 17th century]]\nUnder the reign of [[Sourigna Vongsa|King Sourigna Vongsa]] (1637\u20131694) Lan Xang experienced a fifty seven-year period of peace and restoration.{{sfnp|Ivarsson| 2008| p=113}} During the period the Lan Xang [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] was at the apex of power, drawing monks and nuns for religious study from throughout [[Southeast Asia]].

When Sourigna Vongsa died in 1694, he left two young grandsons (Prince Kingkitsarat and Prince Inthasom) and two daughters (Princess Kumar and Princess Sumangala) with claims to the throne. A succession dispute took place where the king's nephew [[Setthathirath II|Prince Sai Ong Hue]] emerged; Sourigna Vongsa's grandsons fled into exile in Sipsong Panna and Princess Sumangala to Champasak. In 1705, Prince Kingkitsarat took a small force from his uncle in Sipsong Panna and marched toward [[Luang Prabang]]. Sai Ong Hue's brother, the governor of Luang Prabang, fled and Kingkitsarat was made crowned as a rival king in Luang Prabang. In 1707 Lan Xang was divided and the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Prabang]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] emerged. In 1713 the [[Kingdom of Champasak]] emerged after a rebellion against Vientiane.{{sfnp|Viravong| 1964 }}\n\nThe Lao kingdoms remained independent until 1779 when they then would become vassals to Thailand. However, the kingdoms maintained their monarchical roots and a degree of autonomy.{{sfnp|Wyatt|1963|p=13\u201332}}{{sfnp|Ngaosyvathn| 1998 }} For instance, Vientiane also had a tributary relationship with the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] court at [[Hu\u1ebf]], a relationship that, in the wake of the failed [[Laotian Rebellion]] for independence (1826\u20131829) of [[Anouvong]], the last king of Vientiane, became a ''[[casus belli]]'' for the [[Siamese\u2013Vietnamese War (1831\u201334)]].\n\n==Political organization==\n[[File:Ho Phra Keo ruins in Vientiane, Laos by Louis Delaporte c.1867.jpg|thumbnail|right|Ruins of the [[Haw Phra Kaew|Ho Phra Keo]] royal temple as depicted by Louis Delaporte (c.1867) following the destruction of Vientiane in 1828.]]\nThe [[Mekong River]] formed the political and economic arteries for the Kingdom of Lan Xang, so much so that the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name for the river ''L\u00e1n C\u0101ng'' \u703e\u6ec4 is synonymous with the Lao kingdom. The river provided the means for the people, commerce and armies of Lan Xang to move between regional power centers, but also formed important geographic and defensive barriers. Major rapids formed the boundaries between the areas (and subsequent kingdoms) of [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Prabang]], [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] and Champasak. The [[Khone Falls]] and [[Si Phan Don]] region were not navigable and provided a natural defense for Lan Xang from invasion coming upriver. {{sfnp|Osborne| 2001|p=18\u201319; 136\u2013154}}\n\nThe major cities of Lan Xang were located in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Vientiane]] including the towns in [[Nong Khai]], [[Muang Phuan]], Muang Sa or Muang Champa Nakhon ([[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]]), [[Nong Khai]], [[That Sikhottabong|Sikhottabong]] (which in later periods would become [[Thakhek]], [[Nakhon Phanom]], and [[Sakon Nakhon]]), and Xiang Hun([[Jinghong]]) (later [[Muang Sing]]) in Sip Song Panna. These major cities were known as \"muang\" or \"vieng\" and were classified based on substantial fortifications and city walls, the Lao chronicles record five supporting cities, and ninety-seven border \"muang.\" {{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=35}}\n\nSupporting cities were found along the [[Khorat Plateau]], and were based on trade or military importance. Say Fong was a Khmer trading post which became famous as a Lao cultural center for writing and arts. Vieng Khuk was mentioned by Van Wuysthoff, and was the \"port city\" for Vientiane, where trade between [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants took place before being destroyed in the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Lao-Siamese War]] in 1827. South of Vientiane on the [[Khorat Plateau]], [[Nong Bua Lamphu Province|Nong Bua Lamphu]] (or Muang Dan) was a major fortified city and traditionally administered by the Lao crown princes.{{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=20\u201340}}\n\n[[Nong Bua Lamphu Province|Nong Bua Lamphu]] was where the Lao defeated Ayutthaya in 1571, and was the site of a major battle against [[Anouvong|King Anouvong]] in 1827 when the city was totally destroyed by Thailand for its symbolic importance. [[Roi Et]] on the southern [[Khorat Plateau]] was also heavily fortified, and had been founded by the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] as a major trading center between the [[Pao River, Thailand|Pao]], [[Mun River|Mun]] and [[Chi River|Chi]] Rivers. Trade cities also existed at [[Loei Province|Loei]], and Nong Han Noi on the [[Songkhram River|Song Khram River]]. {{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=20\u201340}}\n\nThe [[mueang]] or \"city-states\" formed independent polities bound to the regional power of the king in a system known as a [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]]. Each city was headed by a city lord or ''chao mueang''. The [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] formed an important interdependent system of trade and tribute, which was based more on controlling resources and local populations than it was regional territories. Both wars and the production of rice required large scale labor forces. In [[Southeast Asia]] it was common practice for an invading army to forcibly move a population to where they may be more accessible for taxation, conscription or [[corvee]] labor. War was also an important means of generating wealth via tribute, and it was not uncommon in the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala system]] to pay tribute to more than one regional power at a time. {{sfnp|Turton| 2000|p=16}}\n\n== Society ==\nLan Xang had ethnic diversity from trade and overland ethnic migrations. The multiple [[hill tribe]] peoples were grouped into the broad cultural categories of [[Lao Theung]] (which included most indigenous groups and the [[Mon-Khmer]]) and [[Lao Sung]]. The [[Lao Loum]] were ethnically dominant and there were several closely related [[Tai peoples|Tai]] groups which included the [[Tai Dam people|Tai Dam]], [[Tai Daeng people|Tai Daeng]], [[Lu people|Tai Lu]], [[Tai Yuan]], and [[Phuan people]]. Perhaps because of the complicated ethnic diversity of Lan Xang the structure of society was fairly straightforward, especially in comparison to the neighboring [[Thai people]] with the ''sakdi na'' system or the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] with their complex [[caste system]] and concepts of a divine kingship or ''[[devaraja]]''. {{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=36}}\n\nLao society was divided with the religious and secular authority of the royal family at the top, followed by nobles, and then the peasantry which included merchants, artisans, farmers, and general laborers. {{sfnp|Evans| 2003}} Outside the system but above all were the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] or clergy, which provided not only social mobility but also a means for education. {{sfnp|McDaniel| 2008}} The hill peoples or [[Lao Theung]] were outside the social system, along with the ''kha'' or \"prisoners\" which were either taken in war or were working for criminal offences or debts. {{sfnp|Turton| 2000|p=16}} [[Thai people|Siamese]], [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and [[Shan people|Shan]] formed the majority of the itinerant merchants, but there were small populations of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] around major trading cities and in Muang Phuan.\n\n== Religion ==\n[[Image:Laosgoldenstupa.jpg|thumb|250px|Monk repainting a [[N\u0101ga]] at Pha That Luang]]\n[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] was the state religion of Lan Xang beginning with [[King Photisarath]] in 1527, but had been a growing part of cultural legacy since Fa Ngum. {{sfnp|Holt| 2009|p=10\u201315}} Within the villages, monasteries and towns of Lan Xang much of daily life revolved around the local temple or [[wat]]. The temples were centers of learning, and all males were expected to spend at least some part of their life in religious contemplation as a monk or novice. Kings could establish their legitimacy through supporting the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] and caring for or constructing new temples. Lan Xang had several powerful [[Lao Buddhist sculpture|Buddha images]] which served as [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]]s and spiritual symbols of the kingdom which included the [[Phra Bang]], [[Emerald Buddha|Phra Keo]] (the \"Emerald\" Buddha), Phra Saekham, and Phra Luk (the crystal Buddha of Champasak). {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2008|p=33}}\n\n[[Animism]] was also one of the earliest, enduring and most important belief systems to the Lao-Tai groups, and the traditions and practices which began in Lan Xang have remained a vital part of [[Lao people|Lao]] spirituality. Among the ethnic hill tribes of the [[Lao Sung]] and [[Lao Theung]] [[animism]] was the dominant religion. The [[Lao Loum]] believed that ancient mythical serpents known as ''[[ngueak]]'' inhabited major waterways, carving out the surrounding countryside and protecting key points along rivers or other bodies of water. The earliest name for the [[Mekong River]] was ''Nam Nyai Ngu Luang'' or \"Great River of the Giant Serpent.\" {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=7}}\n\nNgueak, and the [[n\u0101ga]] which have been \"tamed\" by [[Buddhism]], were believed to bring rains, or change shape, and [[n\u0101ga]] in particular were believed to be protection spirits which inhabited the cities of [[Vientiane]] and [[Luang Prabang]] in Lan Xang. [[N\u0101ga]] have endured as common motifs not only in myth and legend, but also on Lao temples, and silk weavings. {{sfnp|Bunce| 2004|p=247}} [[N\u0101ga]] became a potent symbol of the kingdom of Lan Xang, so much so that when Thailand was forced to cede the territories which would become [[Laos]] in 1893, the kings of Thailand ordered new state seals which showed the [[garuda]] [[Emblem of Thailand|symbol of Thailand]] feeding on the [[n\u0101ga]] of Lan Xang as a thinly veiled threat that the territorial loss had not been forgotten. {{sfnp|Ngaosyvathn| 2009|p=55\u201356}}\n\nThe natural world was also home to a number of spirits which are part of the [[Satsana Phi]]. ''Phi'' are spirits of buildings or territories, natural places, or phenomena; they are also ancestral spirits that protect people, or can also include malevolent spirits. The ''phi'' which are guardian deities of places, or towns are celebrated at festivals with communal gatherings and offerings of food. The spirits run throughout Lao folk literature.{{sfnp|Tossa| Nattavong|MacDonald |2008|p=75\u201389}}\n\n''Phi'' were believed to influence natural phenomena including human illness and thus the [[Baci ceremony|baci]] became an important part of [[Lao people|Lao]] identity and religious health over the millennia. [[Spirit house]]s were an important folk custom which were used to ensure balance with the natural and supernatural world. Astrology was also a vital part to understanding the natural and spiritual worlds and became an important cultural means to enforce social taboos and customs.\n\n== Economy ==\nLan Xang was at the center of the overland trade routes in [[Southeast Asia]]. In the north and northwest the overland trade routes from [[Burma]] and [[Kingdom of Lanna|Lanna]] passed through Lan Xang and Sipsong Panna ( [[Xishuangbanna]] ) toward [[Yunnan]], where they would join with the [[Tea-Horse Road|Chinese Tea-Horse Road]]. Trade in [[Luang Prabang]] would flow down the [[Mekong]] to [[Vientiane]] where it could then be transported overland to the headwaters of the [[Nan River|Nan]] and [[Chao praya|Chao Praya rivers]], or overland by ox cart or elephant over the [[Khorat Plateau]] to [[Roi Et]].{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|1998| p=49}}\n\nIn the east the [[Annamite Range]] formed a barrier, but the areas of [[Muang Phuan]] and Xam Neua were regular points of commerce with [[Vietnam]]. Trade from [[Thakhek]] and Champasak flowed down the [[Mekong]] to the [[Khong Island|Island of Khong]], where the goods would then be portaged past [[Si Phan Don]] and the [[Khone Falls]] to join with the [[Mekong]] again and on to the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] in the south. Lao merchants (''lam'') would travel to [[Lao Theung]] and [[Lao Sung]] areas to exchange cloth, iron and silver for forest products, which would be floated via streams on bamboo rafts until they met with larger rivers.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|1998| p=49}}\n\n[[Image:Khone Phapheng Falls - 1.jpg|thumb|300px|The Khone Falls, on the Mekong River.]]\nThe principle Lao agricultural crops were [[glutinous rice]] and forest timber. Both were labor-intensive and were difficult to transport using the overland routes. Subsistence farming of root crops, bananas, gourds, cucumbers, yams, water buffalo, chickens, pigs and other domesticated animals was indigenous within Lan Xang. {{sfnp|Simms|1999| p=24}} Forest products were generally easier to transport and traded at a higher value. Elephants, ivory, [[benzoin resin]] (similar to [[Frankincense]]), [[lac]] (used in lacquer production), [[cardamom]], beeswax, rhinoceros horn, along with porcupine quills and a variety of skins were commonly traded. {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|1998| p=48\u201349}} Of particular importance was the deer skin trade, which was in high demand in [[China]] and [[Japan]] and would reach its way to market having gone through [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]] trade posts. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=96}}\n\nLao craftsmanship in silk production, weaving, gold, and especially silver was in high demand. {{sfnp|Simms|1999| p=95}} Villages would specialize in a particular craft or skill where they would manufacture tools, weapons, pottery, paper, jewelry, alcohol ([[Lao-Lao|lao-lao]]), elephant training or other unique trades. Iron ore was mined in Muang Phuan, tin and gems would also be mined in the north of [[Luang Prabang]] or east along the [[Annamite Range]]. {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998| p=48\u201349}}\n\n[[Luang Prabang]] was important as the religious and royal capital of Lan Xang, but [[Vientiane]] was the largest most populous city (as well as the political capital beginning in 1560) and thus was of crucial commercial importance. [[Vientiane]] was originally a [[Mon people|Mon]] city named ''Chandapuri'' or \"City of the Moon.\" {{sfnp|Simms|1999| p=31}} The [[Lao people|Lao]] would change the name to ''Vieng Chanthaburi Sisattanak'' which means \"Walled City of Sandalwood and a Million Nagas,\" later shortening it further to simply ''Vieng Chan'' ([[Vientiane]]). {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox |2006 |p=53}} [[That Sikhottabong|Sikhottabong]] in [[Khammouan]] and [[That Phanom District|Nakon Phanom]] were also regional trading powers for central Lan Xang, just as [[Roi Et]] was crucial for overland trade on the [[Khorat Plateau]].\n\n== Decline ==\nThe [[Lao people|Lao]] developed a distinct cultural, linguistic, religious, and political history during the four hundred-year period of Lan Xang. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=76}} The monarchy in Laos, which was a direct continuation from the traditions of Lan Xang would continue for seven hundred and fifty years through the [[Khun Lo|Khun Lo Dynasty]] until 1975.{{sfnp|Evans| 2009| p=17; 84}} The decline of Lan Xang vis-\u00e0-vis their neighboring kingdoms was primarily due to geography, weak internal political structures, limited agricultural production, and the international arms trade.\n\nDespite its relative size, Lan Xang was landlocked throughout its history. The [[Mekong River]], formed the major means of transportation in the kingdom, is navigable only along certain stretches. Surrounding Lan Xang were populous and powerful neighboring states: [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] [[China]], [[Burma]], Ayutthaya, Sukhothai, Lanna, the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and the Khmer. Politically, a [[feudal system]] of relatively independent mueang and nobles held regional autonomy.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=84\u201385}}\n\nThe succession of the monarchs was never based solely on [[primogeniture]], as both the ''Sena'' (a council which could include senior royal family members, ministers, and generals) and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (senior members of the clergy) would choose a suitable successor based on both legitimacy and individual merit. The state bureaucracy as originally designed by Fa Ngum and [[Samsenthai]] was along a military structure which included some social mobility through [[meritocracy]]. Over time however social distinctions became more entrenched and the bureaucracy became based on hereditary title. The political institutions in Lan Xang created disputes and instability especially during royal successions. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=84\u201385}}\n\nTrade and the economy of Lan Xang were based on high value commodities which could be easily transported using overland trade routes. Agricultural products like rice were too heavy for transport, and were both taxed and consumed by the regional mueang. The narrow valleys and climate along the [[Mekong]] was suitable for only certain varieties of [[glutinous rice]]. The rice varieties were both low yield, and labor-intensive in comparison to the [[Deepwater rice|floating rice]] grown in Thailand. {{sfnp|Golomb| 1976| p=1\u201315}} Both Ayutthaya and Thailand profited immensely from the international rice trade with the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Muslim]] and European traders. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=109\u2013110}}\n\nThe demand for Lan Xang's high value trade commodities had to pass through intermediary kingdoms to reach world markets, thus for example when [[Japanese people|Japanese]] demand for forest products increased it was the [[Siamese people|Siamese]] which benefited from the trade. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=93; 73}} Maritime trade routes became more important than the [[Tea-Horse Road|Tea Routes]] in northern Lan Xang, the river trade along the [[Mekong]] and [[Chao Praya]], or the overland trade with [[Vietnam]]. Trade with Europeans for weapons began as early as 1511 in Ayutthaya, and by contrast the first European trade mission to Lan Xang was not until the 1640s.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=74}} Access to advanced European weapons proved decisive during the Burmese invasions of Lan Xang and would become more important in subsequent wars with [[Vietnam]] and Thailand during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. {{sfnp|Ngaosyvathn| 1998|p=117\u2013120}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vat Yotkeo]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{loc}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Askew|first1=Marc|first2=Colin|last2=Long|first3=William|last3=Logan|title=Vientiane: Transformations of a Lao Landscape|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-33141-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bunce|first=Fredrick|title=Buddhist Textiles of Laos: Lan Na the Isan|year=2004|publisher=D.K.

The [[Tai peoples]] migrated south in a series of waves beginning in the 7th century and accelerated following the [[Mongol conquest of China|Mongol conquest of Yunnan]] (1253\u20131256) into the northern reaches of what would become the kingdom of Lan Xang.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=24\u201326}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|2006 |p=6}}\n\nThe fertile northern [[Mekong]] valleys were occupied by the [[Dvaravati]] culture of the [[Mon people]] and subsequently by the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]], where the principal city-state in the north was known then as [[Muang Sua]] and alternately as ''Xieng Dong Xieng Thong'' \"The City of Flame Trees beside the River Dong\", (modern city of [[Luang Prabang]]).{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=24\u201326}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|2006 |p=6}}\n\nWith the rise of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] the principal city-states of [[Muang Sua]] ([[Luang Prabang]]) and south to the twin cities of ''Vieng Chan Vieng Kham'' ([[Vientiane]]), came increasingly under Tai influence.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=45,51; 33\u201335}} Following the death of the Sukhothai king [[Ram Khamhaeng]], and internal disputes within the kingdom of [[Lan Na]], both ''Vieng Chan Vieng Kham'' ([[Vientiane]]) and ''Muang Sua'' ([[Luang Prabang]]) were independent Lao-Tai [[mandala (political model)|mandalas]] until the founding of Lan Xang in 1353.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003|p=51}}\n\n=== The Legends of Khun Borom ===\nThe cultural memory of the early migrations and the mixing of Tai influence with the indigenous, Mon, and [[Khmer people]]s were preserved in the origin myths and traditions of Lan Xang.

The ''Nithan Khun Borum'' \"Story of [[Khun Borom]]\" was central to these origin stories and formed the introduction to the ''Phongsavadan'' or court chronicles which were read aloud during auspicious occasions and festivals.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=22\u201329}} Throughout the history of Lan Xang the legitimacy of the monarchy was tied to the single dynasty of [[Khun Lo]], the legendary king of Muang Sua and son of Khun Borom.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=11\u201315}}{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=9\u201310}}{{sfnp|Evans| 2009| p=2}}\n\n=== The Conquests of King Fa Ngum ===\nThe traditional court histories of Lan Xang begin in the ''Year of the N\u0101ga'' 1316 (the [[n\u0101ga]] a mythical serpent of the Mekong and a protector spirit of the kingdom) with the birth of [[Fa Ngum]].{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=26}} Fa Ngum's Grandfather Souvanna Khampong was king of [[Muang Sua]] and his father Chao Fa Ngiao was the crown prince. As a youth Fa Ngum was sent to the [[Khmer Empire]] to live as a son of King Jayavarman IX, where he was given princess Keo Kang Ya. In 1343 King Souvanna Khampong died, and a succession dispute for Muang Sua took place.{{sfnp|Coe| 2003 }}\n\nIn 1349 Fa Ngum was granted an army known as the \"Ten Thousand\" to take the crown. At the time the Khmer Empire was in decline (possibly from an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] and the combined influx of [[Tai peoples]]),{{sfnp|Coe| 2003 }} both Lanna and Sukhothai had been established in what had been Khmer territory, and the Siamese were growing in the area of the [[Chao Phraya River]] which would become the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=30\u201349}} The opportunity for the Khmer was to create a friendly buffer state in an area they could no longer effectively control with only a moderately sized military force.\n\nFa Ngum's campaign started in southern Laos, taking the towns and cities in the region around Champasak and moving northward through Thakek and [[Khammouane Province|Kham Muang]] along the middle [[Mekong]]. From his position on the middle [[Mekong]], Fa Ngum sought assistance and supply from [[Vientiane]] in attacking Muang Sua, which they refused. However, Prince Nho of [[Muang Phuan]] (Muang Phoueune) offered assistance and vassalage to Fa Ngum for assistance in a succession dispute of his own and help in securing Muang Phuan from the [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]. Fa Ngum agreed and quickly moved his army to take Muang Phuan and then on to take [[Xam Neua]] and several smaller cities of the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=30\u201335}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=38\u201343}}\n\nThe \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, concerned with their rival [[Champa]] to the south sought a clearly defined border with the growing power of Fa Ngum. The result was to use the [[Annamite Range]] as both a cultural and territorial barrier between the two kingdoms. Continuing his conquests Fa Ngum turned toward the [[Sip Song Chau Tai]] along the [[Red River (Asia)|Red]] and [[Black River (Asia)|Black River]] valleys, which were heavily populated with [[Lao people|Lao]]. Having secured a sizable force of Lao from each territory under his domain Fa Ngum moved down the [[Nam Ou]] to take [[Muang Sua]]. Despite three attacks the King of Muang Sua, who was Fa Ngum's uncle, was unable to deter the size of Fa Ngum's army and committed suicide rather than be taken alive.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=30\u201335}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=38\u201343}}\n\nIn 1353 Fa Ngum was crowned,<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coed\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George Coed\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

King Phayu of Lanna raised an army which Fa Ngum overwhelmed at [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]], forcing Lanna to cede some its territory and provide valuable gifts in exchange for mutual recognition. Having secured his immediate borders Fa Ngum returned to [[Muang Sua]]. {{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=30\u201335}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=38\u201343}}\n\nIn 1351 [[Uthong]], who was married to a daughter of the Khmer King Suphanburi, founded the city of [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. However, the remains of the Khmer Empire were in direct conflict with the growing power of Ayutthaya and the two became rivals rather than allies. Throughout the 1350s Ayutthaya expanded over western Khmer territories and the [[Khorat Plateau]]. In 1352 [[Angkor]] was attacked by Ayutthaya in a failed attempt to take the capital. {{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=52}}\n\n[[Vientiane]] remained independent and powerful, and the growing power of Ayutthaya threatened regional stability. In 1356 Fa Ngum marched south to take [[Vientiane]] for failing to support his earlier advance on [[Muang Sua]].

Vientiane was the principal city of Lan Xang, and lay at the confluence of trade routes, but that access also made it the focal point for invasion from which it was difficult to defend. The move allowed Photisarath to better administer the kingdom and to respond to the outlying provinces which bordered the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] and the growing power of [[Burma]].{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=56\u201361}}{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998|p=74\u201375}}{{sfnp|Viravong| 1964| p=50\u201351}}\n\nIn 1539 he made a pilgrimage to [[That Sikhottabong|Sikhottabong]] and he also made improvements to [[That Phanom]] to reinforce Lan Xang's southern regional power.

The weakened kingdom was invaded first by the [[Burma|Burmese]] and then in 1545 by Ayutthaya. Both attempted invasions were repulsed although significant damage had been done in the surrounding countryside. Lan Xang dispatched reinforcements to support their allies in Lanna. In response, Chairacha set out at the head of a second army in 1547 to take [[Chiang Mai]] where he was again defeated and forced into full retreat to Ayutthaya, where he died almost immediately upon his return.{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=78}}\n\nThe succession disputes in Lanna continued, but the position of Lanna between the aggressive states of Burma and Ayutthaya necessitated that the kingdom be brought back to order. In recognition for his assistance against Ayutthaya, and his strong familial ties to Lanna, King Photisarath was offered the throne of Lanna for his son Prince [[Setthathirath]], who in 1547 was crowned King in Chiang Mai. Lan Xang was at the height of their political power, with Photisarath as King of Lan Xang and Setthathirath his son as King of [[Lanna]]. In the elaborate court ceremony recorded in the ''Chiang Mai Chronicles'', Setthathirath took possession of the [[Emerald Buddha]] as his personal [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] (which would later become the palladium of Vientiane) and was given the princesses Nang Thip and Nang Tonkham as queens.{{sfnp|Wyatt|Wichienkeeo| 1995| p=118\u2013119}}\n\nThe peace would not last long.

Photisarath neither accepted the alliance, nor did he support Ayutthaya which had unsuccessfully tried to invade Lan Xang only eight years earlier. In 1550 Photisarath returned to Luang Prabang, but was killed in an accident while riding an elephant in front of the fifteen international delegations which were seeking an audience.{{sfnp|Simms| 1999|p=64\u201368}}\n\n=== King Setthathirath and the Burmese invasions ===\n[[File:Setthathirat.JPG|thumb|Statue of King Sai Setthathirath at [[Pha That Luang]], [[Vientiane]]]]\nIn 1548 [[Setthathirath|King Setthathirath]] (as King of Lanna) had taken [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] as his capital.

To prevent further incursions, King Chakkraphat became a vassal of Burma and had to deliver both himself and his son [[Prince Ramesuan]] as hostages to King Bayinnaung leaving another son   [[Mahinthrathirat|Prince Mahinthrathirat]] as a vassal in Ayutthaya.{{sfnp|Wyatt|2003|p=81}}\n\nThe Burmese then turned north to depose King Mekuti of Lanna, who had failed to support the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya in 1563.<ref name=geh-167-168>Harvey 1925: 167\u2013168</ref><ref name=my-2-266-268>Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 266\u2013268</ref> When Chiang Mai fell to the Burmese, a number of refugees fled to Vientiane and Lan Xang.

When the Burmese took Vientiane they were forced into the countryside for supplies, where King Setthathirath had organized [[guerrilla]] attacks and small raids to harass the Burmese troops.

The Burmese arrived in Vientiane and were able to take the lightly defended city. Just as in 1565, Setthathirath began a guerrilla campaign from his base near the [[Nam Ngum]], northeast of Vientiane.

Truly it is of prodigious size, so large one would take it for a city, both with respect to its situation and the infinite number of people who live there. The apartments of the king are adorned with a magnificent portal and include a number of beautiful rooms along with a great salon, all made from incorruptible timber (teak) and adorned outside and inside with excellent bas-reliefs, so delicately gilded that they seem to be plated with gold rather than covered with gold leaf. From the king's apartments, on entering the very spacious courtyards, one sees first a great series of houses, all of brick and covered with tiles, where usually live the secondary wives of the king; and beyond them a line of more houses, built in the same symmetrical form for the officials of the court. I could write a whole volume if I tried to describe exactly all the other parts of the palace, its riches, apartments, gardens, and all the other similar things.| Fr.

When Sourigna Vongsa died in 1694, he left two young grandsons (Prince Kingkitsarat and Prince Inthasom) and two daughters (Princess Kumar and Princess Sumangala) with claims to the throne. A succession dispute took place where the king's nephew [[Setthathirath II|Prince Sai Ong Hue]] emerged; Sourigna Vongsa's grandsons fled into exile in Sipsong Panna and Princess Sumangala to Champasak. In 1705, Prince Kingkitsarat took a small force from his uncle in Sipsong Panna and marched toward [[Luang Prabang]]. Sai Ong Hue's brother, the governor of Luang Prabang, fled and Kingkitsarat was made crowned as a rival king in Luang Prabang. In 1707 Lan Xang was divided and the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Prabang]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] emerged. In 1713 the [[Kingdom of Champasak]] emerged after a rebellion against Vientiane.{{sfnp|Viravong| 1964 }}\n\nThe Lao kingdoms remained independent until 1779 when they then would become vassals to Thailand. However, the kingdoms maintained their monarchical roots and a degree of autonomy.{{sfnp|Wyatt|1963|p=13\u201332}}{{sfnp|Ngaosyvathn| 1998 }} For instance, Vientiane also had a tributary relationship with the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] court at [[Hu\u1ebf]], a relationship that, in the wake of the failed [[Laotian Rebellion]] for independence (1826\u20131829) of [[Anouvong]], the last king of Vientiane, became a ''[[casus belli]]'' for the [[Siamese\u2013Vietnamese War (1831\u201334)]].\n\n==Political organization==\n[[File:Ho Phra Keo ruins in Vientiane, Laos by Louis Delaporte c.1867.jpg|thumbnail|right|Ruins of the [[Haw Phra Kaew|Ho Phra Keo]] royal temple as depicted by Louis Delaporte (c.1867) following the destruction of Vientiane in 1828.]]\nThe [[Mekong River]] formed the political and economic arteries for the Kingdom of Lan Xang, so much so that the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name for the river ''L\u00e1n C\u0101ng'' \u703e\u6ec4 is synonymous with the Lao kingdom. The river provided the means for the people, commerce and armies of Lan Xang to move between regional power centers, but also formed important geographic and defensive barriers. Major rapids formed the boundaries between the areas (and subsequent kingdoms) of [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Prabang]], [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] and Champasak. The [[Khone Falls]] and [[Si Phan Don]] region were not navigable and provided a natural defense for Lan Xang from invasion coming upriver. {{sfnp|Osborne| 2001|p=18\u201319; 136\u2013154}}\n\nThe major cities of Lan Xang were located in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Vientiane]] including the towns in [[Nong Khai]], [[Muang Phuan]], Muang Sa or Muang Champa Nakhon ([[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]]), [[Nong Khai]], [[That Sikhottabong|Sikhottabong]] (which in later periods would become [[Thakhek]], [[Nakhon Phanom]], and [[Sakon Nakhon]]), and Xiang Hun([[Jinghong]]) (later [[Muang Sing]]) in Sip Song Panna. These major cities were known as \"muang\" or \"vieng\" and were classified based on substantial fortifications and city walls, the Lao chronicles record five supporting cities, and ninety-seven border \"muang.\" {{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=35}}\n\nSupporting cities were found along the [[Khorat Plateau]], and were based on trade or military importance. Say Fong was a Khmer trading post which became famous as a Lao cultural center for writing and arts. Vieng Khuk was mentioned by Van Wuysthoff, and was the \"port city\" for Vientiane, where trade between [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants took place before being destroyed in the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Lao-Siamese War]] in 1827. South of Vientiane on the [[Khorat Plateau]], [[Nong Bua Lamphu Province|Nong Bua Lamphu]] (or Muang Dan) was a major fortified city and traditionally administered by the Lao crown princes.{{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=20\u201340}}\n\n[[Nong Bua Lamphu Province|Nong Bua Lamphu]] was where the Lao defeated Ayutthaya in 1571, and was the site of a major battle against [[Anouvong|King Anouvong]] in 1827 when the city was totally destroyed by Thailand for its symbolic importance. [[Roi Et]] on the southern [[Khorat Plateau]] was also heavily fortified, and had been founded by the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] as a major trading center between the [[Pao River, Thailand|Pao]], [[Mun River|Mun]] and [[Chi River|Chi]] Rivers. Trade cities also existed at [[Loei Province|Loei]], and Nong Han Noi on the [[Songkhram River|Song Khram River]]. {{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=20\u201340}}\n\nThe [[mueang]] or \"city-states\" formed independent polities bound to the regional power of the king in a system known as a [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]]. Each city was headed by a city lord or ''chao mueang''. The [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] formed an important interdependent system of trade and tribute, which was based more on controlling resources and local populations than it was regional territories. Both wars and the production of rice required large scale labor forces. In [[Southeast Asia]] it was common practice for an invading army to forcibly move a population to where they may be more accessible for taxation, conscription or [[corvee]] labor. War was also an important means of generating wealth via tribute, and it was not uncommon in the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala system]] to pay tribute to more than one regional power at a time. {{sfnp|Turton| 2000|p=16}}\n\n== Society ==\nLan Xang had ethnic diversity from trade and overland ethnic migrations. The multiple [[hill tribe]] peoples were grouped into the broad cultural categories of [[Lao Theung]] (which included most indigenous groups and the [[Mon-Khmer]]) and [[Lao Sung]]. The [[Lao Loum]] were ethnically dominant and there were several closely related [[Tai peoples|Tai]] groups which included the [[Tai Dam people|Tai Dam]], [[Tai Daeng people|Tai Daeng]], [[Lu people|Tai Lu]], [[Tai Yuan]], and [[Phuan people]]. Perhaps because of the complicated ethnic diversity of Lan Xang the structure of society was fairly straightforward, especially in comparison to the neighboring [[Thai people]] with the ''sakdi na'' system or the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] with their complex [[caste system]] and concepts of a divine kingship or ''[[devaraja]]''. {{sfnp|Askew| 2007|p=36}}\n\nLao society was divided with the religious and secular authority of the royal family at the top, followed by nobles, and then the peasantry which included merchants, artisans, farmers, and general laborers. {{sfnp|Evans| 2003}} Outside the system but above all were the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] or clergy, which provided not only social mobility but also a means for education. {{sfnp|McDaniel| 2008}} The hill peoples or [[Lao Theung]] were outside the social system, along with the ''kha'' or \"prisoners\" which were either taken in war or were working for criminal offences or debts. {{sfnp|Turton| 2000|p=16}} [[Thai people|Siamese]], [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and [[Shan people|Shan]] formed the majority of the itinerant merchants, but there were small populations of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] around major trading cities and in Muang Phuan.\n\n== Religion ==\n[[Image:Laosgoldenstupa.jpg|thumb|250px|Monk repainting a [[N\u0101ga]] at Pha That Luang]]\n[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] was the state religion of Lan Xang beginning with [[King Photisarath]] in 1527, but had been a growing part of cultural legacy since Fa Ngum. {{sfnp|Holt| 2009|p=10\u201315}} Within the villages, monasteries and towns of Lan Xang much of daily life revolved around the local temple or [[wat]]. The temples were centers of learning, and all males were expected to spend at least some part of their life in religious contemplation as a monk or novice. Kings could establish their legitimacy through supporting the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] and caring for or constructing new temples. Lan Xang had several powerful [[Lao Buddhist sculpture|Buddha images]] which served as [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]]s and spiritual symbols of the kingdom which included the [[Phra Bang]], [[Emerald Buddha|Phra Keo]] (the \"Emerald\" Buddha), Phra Saekham, and Phra Luk (the crystal Buddha of Champasak). {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2008|p=33}}\n\n[[Animism]] was also one of the earliest, enduring and most important belief systems to the Lao-Tai groups, and the traditions and practices which began in Lan Xang have remained a vital part of [[Lao people|Lao]] spirituality. Among the ethnic hill tribes of the [[Lao Sung]] and [[Lao Theung]] [[animism]] was the dominant religion. The [[Lao Loum]] believed that ancient mythical serpents known as ''[[ngueak]]'' inhabited major waterways, carving out the surrounding countryside and protecting key points along rivers or other bodies of water. The earliest name for the [[Mekong River]] was ''Nam Nyai Ngu Luang'' or \"Great River of the Giant Serpent.\" {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 2006|p=7}}\n\nNgueak, and the [[n\u0101ga]] which have been \"tamed\" by [[Buddhism]], were believed to bring rains, or change shape, and [[n\u0101ga]] in particular were believed to be protection spirits which inhabited the cities of [[Vientiane]] and [[Luang Prabang]] in Lan Xang. [[N\u0101ga]] have endured as common motifs not only in myth and legend, but also on Lao temples, and silk weavings. {{sfnp|Bunce| 2004|p=247}} [[N\u0101ga]] became a potent symbol of the kingdom of Lan Xang, so much so that when Thailand was forced to cede the territories which would become [[Laos]] in 1893, the kings of Thailand ordered new state seals which showed the [[garuda]] [[Emblem of Thailand|symbol of Thailand]] feeding on the [[n\u0101ga]] of Lan Xang as a thinly veiled threat that the territorial loss had not been forgotten. {{sfnp|Ngaosyvathn| 2009|p=55\u201356}}\n\nThe natural world was also home to a number of spirits which are part of the [[Satsana Phi]]. ''Phi'' are spirits of buildings or territories, natural places, or phenomena; they are also ancestral spirits that protect people, or can also include malevolent spirits. The ''phi'' which are guardian deities of places, or towns are celebrated at festivals with communal gatherings and offerings of food. The spirits run throughout Lao folk literature.{{sfnp|Tossa| Nattavong|MacDonald |2008|p=75\u201389}}\n\n''Phi'' were believed to influence natural phenomena including human illness and thus the [[Baci ceremony|baci]] became an important part of [[Lao people|Lao]] identity and religious health over the millennia. [[Spirit house]]s were an important folk custom which were used to ensure balance with the natural and supernatural world. Astrology was also a vital part to understanding the natural and spiritual worlds and became an important cultural means to enforce social taboos and customs.\n\n== Economy ==\nLan Xang was at the center of the overland trade routes in [[Southeast Asia]]. In the north and northwest the overland trade routes from [[Burma]] and [[Kingdom of Lanna|Lanna]] passed through Lan Xang and Sipsong Panna ( [[Xishuangbanna]] ) toward [[Yunnan]], where they would join with the [[Tea-Horse Road|Chinese Tea-Horse Road]]. Trade in [[Luang Prabang]] would flow down the [[Mekong]] to [[Vientiane]] where it could then be transported overland to the headwaters of the [[Nan River|Nan]] and [[Chao praya|Chao Praya rivers]], or overland by ox cart or elephant over the [[Khorat Plateau]] to [[Roi Et]].{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|1998| p=49}}\n\nIn the east the [[Annamite Range]] formed a barrier, but the areas of [[Muang Phuan]] and Xam Neua were regular points of commerce with [[Vietnam]]. Trade from [[Thakhek]] and Champasak flowed down the [[Mekong]] to the [[Khong Island|Island of Khong]], where the goods would then be portaged past [[Si Phan Don]] and the [[Khone Falls]] to join with the [[Mekong]] again and on to the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] in the south. Lao merchants (''lam'') would travel to [[Lao Theung]] and [[Lao Sung]] areas to exchange cloth, iron and silver for forest products, which would be floated via streams on bamboo rafts until they met with larger rivers.{{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|1998| p=49}}\n\n[[Image:Khone Phapheng Falls - 1.jpg|thumb|300px|The Khone Falls, on the Mekong River.]]\nThe principle Lao agricultural crops were [[glutinous rice]] and forest timber. Both were labor-intensive and were difficult to transport using the overland routes. Subsistence farming of root crops, bananas, gourds, cucumbers, yams, water buffalo, chickens, pigs and other domesticated animals was indigenous within Lan Xang. {{sfnp|Simms|1999| p=24}} Forest products were generally easier to transport and traded at a higher value. Elephants, ivory, [[benzoin resin]] (similar to [[Frankincense]]), [[lac]] (used in lacquer production), [[cardamom]], beeswax, rhinoceros horn, along with porcupine quills and a variety of skins were commonly traded. {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox|1998| p=48\u201349}} Of particular importance was the deer skin trade, which was in high demand in [[China]] and [[Japan]] and would reach its way to market having gone through [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]] trade posts. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=96}}\n\nLao craftsmanship in silk production, weaving, gold, and especially silver was in high demand. {{sfnp|Simms|1999| p=95}} Villages would specialize in a particular craft or skill where they would manufacture tools, weapons, pottery, paper, jewelry, alcohol ([[Lao-Lao|lao-lao]]), elephant training or other unique trades. Iron ore was mined in Muang Phuan, tin and gems would also be mined in the north of [[Luang Prabang]] or east along the [[Annamite Range]]. {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox| 1998| p=48\u201349}}\n\n[[Luang Prabang]] was important as the religious and royal capital of Lan Xang, but [[Vientiane]] was the largest most populous city (as well as the political capital beginning in 1560) and thus was of crucial commercial importance. [[Vientiane]] was originally a [[Mon people|Mon]] city named ''Chandapuri'' or \"City of the Moon.\" {{sfnp|Simms|1999| p=31}} The [[Lao people|Lao]] would change the name to ''Vieng Chanthaburi Sisattanak'' which means \"Walled City of Sandalwood and a Million Nagas,\" later shortening it further to simply ''Vieng Chan'' ([[Vientiane]]). {{sfnp|Stuart-Fox |2006 |p=53}} [[That Sikhottabong|Sikhottabong]] in [[Khammouan]] and [[That Phanom District|Nakon Phanom]] were also regional trading powers for central Lan Xang, just as [[Roi Et]] was crucial for overland trade on the [[Khorat Plateau]].\n\n== Decline ==\nThe [[Lao people|Lao]] developed a distinct cultural, linguistic, religious, and political history during the four hundred-year period of Lan Xang. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=76}} The monarchy in Laos, which was a direct continuation from the traditions of Lan Xang would continue for seven hundred and fifty years through the [[Khun Lo|Khun Lo Dynasty]] until 1975.{{sfnp|Evans| 2009| p=17; 84}} The decline of Lan Xang vis-\u00e0-vis their neighboring kingdoms was primarily due to geography, weak internal political structures, limited agricultural production, and the international arms trade.\n\nDespite its relative size, Lan Xang was landlocked throughout its history. The [[Mekong River]], formed the major means of transportation in the kingdom, is navigable only along certain stretches. Surrounding Lan Xang were populous and powerful neighboring states: [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] [[China]], [[Burma]], Ayutthaya, Sukhothai, Lanna, the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and the Khmer. Politically, a [[feudal system]] of relatively independent mueang and nobles held regional autonomy.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=84\u201385}}\n\nThe succession of the monarchs was never based solely on [[primogeniture]], as both the ''Sena'' (a council which could include senior royal family members, ministers, and generals) and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (senior members of the clergy) would choose a suitable successor based on both legitimacy and individual merit. The state bureaucracy as originally designed by Fa Ngum and [[Samsenthai]] was along a military structure which included some social mobility through [[meritocracy]]. Over time however social distinctions became more entrenched and the bureaucracy became based on hereditary title. The political institutions in Lan Xang created disputes and instability especially during royal successions. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=84\u201385}}\n\nTrade and the economy of Lan Xang were based on high value commodities which could be easily transported using overland trade routes. Agricultural products like rice were too heavy for transport, and were both taxed and consumed by the regional mueang. The narrow valleys and climate along the [[Mekong]] was suitable for only certain varieties of [[glutinous rice]]. The rice varieties were both low yield, and labor-intensive in comparison to the [[Deepwater rice|floating rice]] grown in Thailand. {{sfnp|Golomb| 1976| p=1\u201315}} Both Ayutthaya and Thailand profited immensely from the international rice trade with the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Muslim]] and European traders. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=109\u2013110}}\n\nThe demand for Lan Xang's high value trade commodities had to pass through intermediary kingdoms to reach world markets, thus for example when [[Japanese people|Japanese]] demand for forest products increased it was the [[Siamese people|Siamese]] which benefited from the trade. {{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=93; 73}} Maritime trade routes became more important than the [[Tea-Horse Road|Tea Routes]] in northern Lan Xang, the river trade along the [[Mekong]] and [[Chao Praya]], or the overland trade with [[Vietnam]]. Trade with Europeans for weapons began as early as 1511 in Ayutthaya, and by contrast the first European trade mission to Lan Xang was not until the 1640s.{{sfnp|Wyatt| 2003| p=74}} Access to advanced European weapons proved decisive during the Burmese invasions of Lan Xang and would become more important in subsequent wars with [[Vietnam]] and Thailand during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. {{sfnp|Ngaosyvathn| 1998|p=117\u2013120}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vat Yotkeo]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{loc}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Askew|first1=Marc|first2=Colin|last2=Long|first3=William|last3=Logan|title=Vientiane: Transformations of a Lao Landscape|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-33141-8|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bunce|first=Fredrick|title=Buddhist Textiles of Laos: Lan Na the Isan|year=2004|publisher=D.K.

Each team should say a connecting word, i.e., if team A says a word connecting to the one told by Jegan, then team B should say a word connecting to what was told by team C.
