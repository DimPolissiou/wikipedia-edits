It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary ''[[vihara]]s'' in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of [[Pawon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Replika Candi Pawon|work=Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya|url=http://www.dhammacakka.org/?channel=tentangkami&mode=detailfasilitas&id=93}}</ref> and [[Plaosan]]'s ''perwara'' (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of [[Cambodia]] (such as the [[Angkor Wat]]), Champa (Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[India]] are also called ''candi'' in Indonesian.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prambanan]] temple compound.

However, the term also applied to many non-religious structures dated from the same period, such as ''gapura'' (gates),'' petirtaan'' (pools) and some of habitation complexes. Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"Between the 7th and 15th centuries, hundred of religious structures were constructed of brick and stone in Java, Sumatra and Bali.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The candi was designed to mimic [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]], the holy mountain the abode of gods. The whole temple is a model of Hindu universe according to [[Hindu cosmology]] and the layers of [[Loka]].<ref name=\"SEDYAWATIp4\">{{harvp|Sedyawati|2013|p=4}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure elements ===\n[[File:Prambanan Cross Section Shiva.svg|thumb|upright|The Shiva temple Candi Prambanan consist of three ascending realms, temple's base (Bhurloka), body (Bhurvaloka) and roof (Svarloka).]]\nThe candi structure and layout recognize the hierarchy of the zones, spanned from the less holy to the holiest realms. The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons.

The inner courtyard and the roof of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''svarloka''. The roof of Hindu structure usually crowned with ''[[Gemstone|ratna]]'' ([[sanskrit]]: jewel) or [[vajra]], or in eastern Java period, crowned by cube structure.

It was one of the earliest temple in Java.]]\nThere are material, form, and location exceptions to these general design traits. While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of winged lion also found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]].\n\n=== Stupa and Ratna pinnacles ===\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudu-13.jpg|thumb|left|Bell-shaped perforated stupas of Borobudur.]]\nThe religions dedicated in the temples of ancient Java can be easily distinguished mainly from its pinnacles on top of the roof. Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].

It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary ''[[vihara]]s'' in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of [[Pawon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Replika Candi Pawon|work=Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya|url=http://www.dhammacakka.org/?channel=tentangkami&mode=detailfasilitas&id=93}}</ref> and [[Plaosan]]'s ''perwara'' (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of [[Cambodia]] (such as the [[Angkor Wat]]), Champa (Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[India]] are also called ''candi'' in Indonesian.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prambanan]] temple compound.

However, the term also applied to many non-religious structures dated from the same period, such as ''gapura'' (gates),'' petirtaan'' (pools) and some of habitation complexes. Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"Between the 7th and 15th centuries, hundred of religious structures were constructed of brick and stone in Java, Sumatra and Bali.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The candi was designed to mimic [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]], the holy mountain the abode of gods. The whole temple is a model of Hindu universe according to [[Hindu cosmology]] and the layers of [[Loka]].<ref name=\"SEDYAWATIp4\">{{harvp|Sedyawati|2013|p=4}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure elements ===\n[[File:Prambanan Cross Section Shiva.svg|thumb|upright|The Shiva temple Candi Prambanan consist of three ascending realms, temple's base (Bhurloka), body (Bhurvaloka) and roof (Svarloka).]]\nThe candi structure and layout recognize the hierarchy of the zones, spanned from the less holy to the holiest realms. The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons.

The inner courtyard and the roof of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''svarloka''. The roof of Hindu structure usually crowned with ''[[Gemstone|ratna]]'' ([[sanskrit]]: jewel) or [[vajra]], or in eastern Java period, crowned by cube structure.

It was one of the earliest temple in Java.]]\nThere are material, form, and location exceptions to these general design traits. While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of winged lion also found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]].\n\n=== Stupa and Ratna pinnacles ===\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudu-13.jpg|thumb|left|Bell-shaped perforated stupas of Borobudur.]]\nThe religions dedicated in the temples of ancient Java can be easily distinguished mainly from its pinnacles on top of the roof. Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].

Along with [[Mehrabad International Airport]], Imam Khomeini Airport is one of the two international airports serving [[Tehran]]. All international flights in Tehran, with the exception of [[Hajj]] charters, are currently served by this airport, and all domestic flights are served by Mehrabad Airport. IKA ranks third in terms of total passenger traffic in Iran after Tehran Mehrabad Airport and [[Mashhad Airport]]. The airport is operated by the Iran Airports Company and is the primary operating base for [[Iran Air]] and [[Mahan Air]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early planning===\nConstruction of the airport began prior to the 1979 [[Iranian revolution]]. The original designers were Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS), an American engineering and architectural consulting partnership. A local joint venture was formed between TAMS and local firm Abdol Aziz Farmanfarmaian Associates called TAMS-AFFA, to carry out the full design and supervision of construction. Following the Iranian revolution, however, the project was abandoned until the government of Iran decided to design and build the airport using local expertise.\n\n===Construction===\nFrench firm [[A\u00e9roports de Paris|ADP]] was selected to head the local designers and engineering firms. A [[turnkey]] design and build contract was awarded to a local [[general contractor]] company, Kayson Co., to carry out and manage the construction. After two years this contract was abandoned and was awarded to a [[bonyad]], the [[Mostazafan Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-airport-codes.com/iran/imam-khomeini-international-11430.html|title=Imam Khomeini International Airport (IKA)|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Initial opening===\n[[File:Iran Air Airbus, At Imam Khomeini International Airport Refuling, loading cargo and catering during March 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Iran Air]] [[Airbus A300]], being refuelled at Imam Khomeini International Airport.]]After construction of Terminal 1 was completed by the Mostazafan Foundation, the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization decided to turn the management of operations along with the construction of the second terminal to the TAV (Tepe-Akfen-Vie) consortium consisting of two Turkish (Tepe and Akfen) and an Austrian (Vie) companies. The original opening was scheduled for 11 February 2004, the onset of the auspicious \"Ten-Day Dawn\" (1\u201311 February) celebrations, marking the anniversary of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]]. There were numerous issues surrounding the construction of the airport including the supply of fuel to the new airport, and a delay in signing a deal with the [[Ministry of Petroleum of Iran|Iranian oil ministry]] forced a delay in the opening of the airport until 8 May 2004.\n\nJust prior to the opening on 8 May, two local airlines refused to switch to the new airport. ''Economic Hayat-e No'' daily quoted Ali Abedzadeh, director of semi-privately owned [[Iran Aseman Airlines]], as saying \"We are not flying from an airport run by foreigners.\" TAV officials were ordered to withdraw their personnel and equipment from the airport on 7 May 2004, and operations were handed over to [[Iran Air]]. \"I think they (the armed forces) were given false reports that the Turks were still on the site, while they had all evacuated the airport by Friday,\" airport manager Hossein Pirouzi said. However, on 8 May, a few hours after the opening of airport, the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] of the [[Iranian Armed Forces]] closed it, citing security fears over the use of foreigners in the running of the airport. Only one [[Emirates Airline|Emirates]] flight from [[Dubai]] was allowed to land. The second flight from [[Dubai]], which was an Iran Air flight, was forced to land in [[Isfahan International Airport]], because the Mehrabad Airport did not allow it to land there after the Imam Khomeini airport was closed by the armed forces. The rest of the flights were diverted to Mehrabad. On 11 May, in a meeting of the [[Turkish Foreign Ministry]] Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal and [[Iranian Foreign Minister]] [[Kamal Kharrazi]], the Turkish expressed unease about the actions of the Iranian armed forces. The airport reopened on 13 May, as deputy head of Iran's Joint Chiefs of staff Brigadier-General Alireza Afshar stated \"because foreign companies will no longer be in charge of the airport's operation, security obstacles are removed.\"\n\n===Second opening===\n[[File:Line-up of Mahan Air Airbus A340s at IKIA.jpg|thumb|[[Mahan Air]] [[Airbus A340]]s parked at IKIA.]]\n[[File:Inaugural flight of Emirates A380 to Tehran.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Airbus A380]] saluted by traditional water cannon ceremony In Imam Khomeini Int'l Airport, 2014]]\nIn April 2005 the $350 million Imam Khomeini International Airport was reopened under the management of a consortium of four local airlines\u2014[[Mahan Air]], [[Aseman Airlines|Aseman]], [[Caspian Airlines]] and [[Kish Air]]\u2014although no formal contract appeared to have been awarded.

The metro connection for IKIA was opened on 7 August 2017, as a station on the new Tehran Metro Line 8, which is an extension of [[Tehran Metro Line 1]]. There are provisions for a second station serving the planned Iranshahr Terminal (Terminal 3) in the future.\n\nLine 8 is the first 24/7 operational metro line in Tehran, serving mid-night passengers from [[Darvazeh Dowlat Metro Station]] to the Imam Khomeini Airport Metro Station. To arrive at Line 8, Line 1 passengers must transit from [[Shahed - Bagher Shahr Metro Station]] to [[Shahr-e Aftab Metro Station]], then, at [[Shahr-e Aftab Metro Station]], passengers must board a Line 8 train.\n\n====High-speed rail====\nThe airport is planned to be served by the [[Tehran-Qom-Isfahan High Speed Rail]]. The new link will enable direct rail access from the cities of [[Qom]] and [[Isfahan]] and a fast non-stop connection to [[Tehran Railway Station]]. The line is currently in early planning and construction phase.\n\n===Highway===\nImam Khomeini Airport is accessible from [[Tehran]] by car, taxi and shuttle buses via [[Freeway 7 (Iran)|Tehran-Qom]] and [[Freeway 5 (Iran)|Tehran-Saveh]] freeways. Airport-operated taxis serve arriving passenger 24/7. In 2017, a typical taxi journey from the airport to the center of Tehran takes around 45 minutes which costs about 850000-900000 Iranian rial or US$10 and are often light yellow [[Toyota Camry]], [[Toyota RAV4]], [[Volkswagen Caddy]] or [[IKCO Samand]].<ref>https://www.ikac.ir/en/taxi</ref>\n\n*[[File:Freeway in Iran.svg|32px]][[File:Road5.png|13px]] [[Freeway 5 (Iran)|Freeway 5]]\n*[[File:Freeway in Iran.svg|32px]][[File:Iran Freeway 7.png|13px]] [[Freeway 7 (Iran)|Freeway 7]]\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n* On 15 July 2009, [[Caspian Airlines Flight 7908]], a [[Tupolev Tu-154]] bound for [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]] crashed into a field in the village of [[Farsian, Qazvin|Farsiyan]] in [[Qazvin province]] (north-western Iran), 16&nbsp;minutes after take-off from Imam Khomeini Airport.

Along with [[Mehrabad International Airport]], Imam Khomeini Airport is one of the two international airports serving [[Tehran]]. All international flights in Tehran, with the exception of [[Hajj]] charters, are currently served by this airport, and all domestic flights are served by Mehrabad Airport. IKA ranks third in terms of total passenger traffic in Iran after Tehran Mehrabad Airport and [[Mashhad Airport]]. The airport is operated by the Iran Airports Company and is the primary operating base for [[Iran Air]] and [[Mahan Air]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early planning===\nConstruction of the airport began prior to the 1979 [[Iranian revolution]]. The original designers were Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS), an American engineering and architectural consulting partnership. A local joint venture was formed between TAMS and local firm Abdol Aziz Farmanfarmaian Associates called TAMS-AFFA, to carry out the full design and supervision of construction. Following the Iranian revolution, however, the project was abandoned until the government of Iran decided to design and build the airport using local expertise.\n\n===Construction===\nFrench firm [[A\u00e9roports de Paris|ADP]] was selected to head the local designers and engineering firms. A [[turnkey]] design and build contract was awarded to a local [[general contractor]] company, Kayson Co., to carry out and manage the construction. After two years this contract was abandoned and was awarded to a [[bonyad]], the [[Mostazafan Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-airport-codes.com/iran/imam-khomeini-international-11430.html|title=Imam Khomeini International Airport (IKA)|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Initial opening===\n[[File:Iran Air Airbus, At Imam Khomeini International Airport Refuling, loading cargo and catering during March 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Iran Air]] [[Airbus A300]], being refuelled at Imam Khomeini International Airport.]]After construction of Terminal 1 was completed by the Mostazafan Foundation, the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization decided to turn the management of operations along with the construction of the second terminal to the TAV (Tepe-Akfen-Vie) consortium consisting of two Turkish (Tepe and Akfen) and an Austrian (Vie) companies. The original opening was scheduled for 11 February 2004, the onset of the auspicious \"Ten-Day Dawn\" (1\u201311 February) celebrations, marking the anniversary of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic Revolution]]. There were numerous issues surrounding the construction of the airport including the supply of fuel to the new airport, and a delay in signing a deal with the [[Ministry of Petroleum of Iran|Iranian oil ministry]] forced a delay in the opening of the airport until 8 May 2004.\n\nJust prior to the opening on 8 May, two local airlines refused to switch to the new airport. ''Economic Hayat-e No'' daily quoted Ali Abedzadeh, director of semi-privately owned [[Iran Aseman Airlines]], as saying \"We are not flying from an airport run by foreigners.\" TAV officials were ordered to withdraw their personnel and equipment from the airport on 7 May 2004, and operations were handed over to [[Iran Air]]. \"I think they (the armed forces) were given false reports that the Turks were still on the site, while they had all evacuated the airport by Friday,\" airport manager Hossein Pirouzi said. However, on 8 May, a few hours after the opening of airport, the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] of the [[Iranian Armed Forces]] closed it, citing security fears over the use of foreigners in the running of the airport. Only one [[Emirates Airline|Emirates]] flight from [[Dubai]] was allowed to land. The second flight from [[Dubai]], which was an Iran Air flight, was forced to land in [[Isfahan International Airport]], because the Mehrabad Airport did not allow it to land there after the Imam Khomeini airport was closed by the armed forces. The rest of the flights were diverted to Mehrabad. On 11 May, in a meeting of the [[Turkish Foreign Ministry]] Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal and [[Iranian Foreign Minister]] [[Kamal Kharrazi]], the Turkish expressed unease about the actions of the Iranian armed forces. The airport reopened on 13 May, as deputy head of Iran's Joint Chiefs of staff Brigadier-General Alireza Afshar stated \"because foreign companies will no longer be in charge of the airport's operation, security obstacles are removed.\"\n\n===Second opening===\n[[File:Line-up of Mahan Air Airbus A340s at IKIA.jpg|thumb|[[Mahan Air]] [[Airbus A340]]s parked at IKIA.]]\n[[File:Inaugural flight of Emirates A380 to Tehran.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Airbus A380]] saluted by traditional water cannon ceremony In Imam Khomeini Int'l Airport, 2014]]\nIn April 2005 the $350 million Imam Khomeini International Airport was reopened under the management of a consortium of four local airlines\u2014[[Mahan Air]], [[Aseman Airlines|Aseman]], [[Caspian Airlines]] and [[Kish Air]]\u2014although no formal contract appeared to have been awarded.

A [[druid]] explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter, and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and serving spoon. Then they see a phantom, a tall beautiful man, on a throne, who introduces himself as [[Lugh]]. The woman is the [[Loathly lady|sovereignty]] of Ireland, and she serves Conn a meal consisting of an ox's rib {{convert|24|ft|m|-1|disp=x| long (| approximately)}}, and a boar's rib.{{efn|Here, the Irish foot is ''[[wikt:traig|traig]]''.}} When she serves drinks, she asks \"To whom shall this cup be given?\", and Lugh recites a poem which tells Conn how many years he will reign, and the names of the kings who will follow him.

The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]], on Tuesday 20 October according to [[Ruaidhr\u00ed \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]] in his 'Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia' (1685).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ogygiaorchronolo02oflaiala/page/214/mode/2up/search/conn+]</ref> The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/leborgablare00macauoft/page/332/mode/2up]</ref> Baile in Sc\u00e1il,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lecturesonmanusc00ocuruoft/page/620/mode/2up]</ref> Gilla C\u00f3em\u00e1in's poem \"Annalad annall uile\",<ref>[http://elverdissen.dyndns.org/~nodus/618-POEMS.pdf]</ref> [[Fland Mainistrech]]'s poem \"Rig Themra dia tesband tn\u00fa\"<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G800011C/text004.html]</ref> in the [[Book of Leinster]] and the ''Annals''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gb0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22T%C3%BAath+Amrois%22&source=bl&ots=PWyXzakIhg&sig=ACfU3U05_iImxpyz0e1xT69Ju-4suVrh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ85yT0_DoAhX1tHEKHWffDt0Q6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22T%C3%BAath%20Amrois%22&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/annalsoftigernac00stokuoft/page/8/mode/2up]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LY9nAAAAMAAJ&q=%22tuath+ambrois%22&dq=%22tuath+ambrois%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq_e695PDoAhUOTBUIHed5DhwQ6AEIQjAD]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/revueceltique41pari/page/316/mode/2up/search/ambrois]</ref> <ref>[https://www.academia.edu/1273930/A_facsimile_edition_of_the_Annals_of_Roscrea]</ref> say Tipraite defeated him in battle in T\u00faath Amrois.

A [[druid]] explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree.

The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]], on Tuesday 20 October according to [[Ruaidhr\u00ed \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]] in his 'Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia' (1685).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ogygiaorchronolo02oflaiala/page/214/mode/2up/search/conn+]</ref> The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/leborgablare00macauoft/page/332/mode/2up]</ref> Baile in Sc\u00e1il,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lecturesonmanusc00ocuruoft/page/620/mode/2up]</ref> Gilla C\u00f3em\u00e1in's poem \"Annalad annall uile\",<ref>[http://elverdissen.dyndns.org/~nodus/618-POEMS.pdf]</ref> [[Fland Mainistrech]]'s poem \"Rig Themra dia tesband tn\u00fa\"<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G800011C/text004.html]</ref> in the [[Book of Leinster]] and the ''Annals''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gb0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22T%C3%BAath+Amrois%22&source=bl&ots=PWyXzakIhg&sig=ACfU3U05_iImxpyz0e1xT69Ju-4suVrh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ85yT0_DoAhX1tHEKHWffDt0Q6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22T%C3%BAath%20Amrois%22&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/annalsoftigernac00stokuoft/page/8/mode/2up]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LY9nAAAAMAAJ&q=%22tuath+ambrois%22&dq=%22tuath+ambrois%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq_e695PDoAhUOTBUIHed5DhwQ6AEIQjAD]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/revueceltique41pari/page/316/mode/2up/search/ambrois]</ref> say Tipraite defeated him in battle in T\u00faath Amrois.

Successive governments have increasingly provided formal legal and political opportunity for [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to seek redress for breaches by the Crown of the guarantees set out in the Treaty of Waitangi. While it has resulted in putting to rest a number of significant longstanding grievances, the process has been subject to criticisms from a number of angles, from those who believe that the redress is insufficient to compensate for M\u0101ori losses, to those who see no value in revisiting painful and contentious historical issues. The settlements are typically seen as part of a broader [[M\u0101ori Renaissance]].\n\nBecause the Treaty of Waitangi has limited legal standing in itself, the primary means of registering and researching Treaty claims is through the [[Waitangi Tribunal]]. The primary means of settling those claims is through negotiations with the government of the day.\n\n== History of the Treaty ==\n{{main|Treaty of Waitangi}}\n[[File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg|thumb|200px|The Treaty of Waitangi]]\nThe [[Treaty of Waitangi]] is often considered to be the founding document for European ([[P\u0101keh\u0101]]) settlement in New Zealand. It guaranteed to [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] the right to keep their lands, forests, fisheries and all their treasures, but they would hand sovereignty in the [[New Zealand English|English]] version, and governorship in the [[Te Reo|M\u0101ori]] version, over to [[the Crown]] and would also be able to sell only to the Crown. Initially, there was little dispute, as the settlers were able to buy land from the M\u0101ori through legal channels. However, after a while, M\u0101ori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases. Agreements were negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from the wrong people altogether. Unrest and rebellion caused by these actions were met with further punitive land confiscations. Eventually this led to the [[New Zealand Wars]], which culminated in the confiscation of a large part of the [[Waikato]] and [[Taranaki]].\n\n== Early settlements ==\nIn the 1920s, land commissions investigated the grievances of [[hap\u016b]] whose land had been confiscated or otherwise fraudulently obtained in the previous century, and many were found to be valid.<ref name=\"e20\">{{cite web | last = Treaty of Waitangi Information Unit | title = Early Twentieth Century | publisher = State Services Commission | year = 2005 | url = http://www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz/story/earlytwentiethcentury.php | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908095310/http://www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz/story/earlytwentiethcentury.php | archive-date = 8 September 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> By the 1940s, settlements in the form of modest annual payments had been arranged with some hap\u016b.

M\u0101ori expressed their frustration about continuing violations of the treaty and subsequent legislation by government officials, as well as inequitable legislation and unsympathetic decisions by the [[M\u0101ori Land Court]] alienating M\u0101ori land from its M\u0101ori owners.<ref name=\"Maori Protests\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/nga-ropu-tautohetohe-maori-protest-movements/page-1|title=Ng\u0101 r\u014dp\u016b tautohetohe \u2013 M\u0101ori protest movements|last=Keane|first=Basil|date=2012-06-20|website=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=23 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the Treaty of Waitangi Act established the Waitangi Tribunal to hear claims of Crown violations of the Treaty of Waitangi, to address those concerns. It allowed any M\u0101ori to lodge a claim against the Crown for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its [[Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi|principles]]. Originally its mandate was limited to claims about contemporary issues, that is, those that occurred after the establishment of the Tribunal. Early claims included the \"Te Reo M\u0101ori\" claim.<ref name=\"TeReo\">{{cite web | last = Waitangi Tribunal | title = Te Report of the Waitangi Tribunal on the Te Reo Maori Claim | date = c. 1986 | url = http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid={6113B0B0-13B5-400A-AFC7-76F76D3DDD92} | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061002091224/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid=%7B6113B0B0-13B5-400A-AFC7-76F76D3DDD92%7D | archive-date = 2 October 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> As a result of the Tribunal's report into the claim, in 1987 the government made [[M\u0101ori language|Te Reo M\u0101ori]] an official language of New Zealand, and established the [[Maori Language Commission]] to foster it. The pivotal issue considered by the Tribunal was whether a language could be considered a \"treasure\" or \"taonga\", and thus protected by the Treaty.\n\nIn 1985 the [[New Zealand Labour Party#Fourth Labour Government|Fourth Labour Government]] extended the Tribunal's powers to allow it to consider Crown actions dating back to 1840,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PlibC5191/historical-treaty-settlements|title=Research papers|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}</ref> including the period covered by the New Zealand Wars. The number of claims quickly rose, and during the early 1990s, the government began to negotiate settlements of historical (pre-1992) claims.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Therese|date=1970-01-01|title=History and the Treaty of Waitangi Settlement Process|journal=The Journal of New Zealand Studies|issue=18|doi=10.26686/jnzs.v0i18.2184|issn=2324-3740|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Settlements of the 1990s==\nWhile early Tribunal recommendations mainly concerned a contemporary issue that could be revised or rectified by the government at the time, historical settlements raised more complex issues. The [[Office of Treaty Settlements]] was established in the Ministry of Justice to develop government policy on historical claims. In 1995, the government developed the \"Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims\"<ref name=\"Crown Proposals\">{{cite web | last = Office of Treaty Settlements| title = Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims | year = 1995 | url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/1996/91.html | accessdate = 15 August 2006 }}</ref> to attempt to address the issues. A key element of the proposals was the creation of a \"fiscal envelope\" of [[NZD|$]]1&nbsp;billion for the settlement of all historical claims, an effective limit on what the Crown would pay out in settlements. The Crown held a series of consultation [[Hui (M\u0101ori assembly)|hui]] around the country, at which M\u0101ori vehemently rejected such a limitation in advance of the extent of claims being fully known.<ref name=\"Gardiner\">{{Cite book | last=Gardiner| given=Wira| title=Return to Sender; what really happened at the fiscal envelope hui| publisher=Reed| place=[[Auckland]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-7900-0460-7 }}</ref> The concept of the fiscal envelope was subsequently dropped after the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 general election]].\n\nDespite the protest, three major settlements were reached during this time. The Minister of Justice and Treaty Negotiations at the time, [[Doug Graham|Sir Douglas Graham]], is credited with leading a largely conservative [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|National government]] to make these breakthroughs.<ref name=\"Lean\">{{cite journal | last = Lean | first = Mary | title = Getting the Government to Say Sorry | journal = For a Change | publisher=Initiatives of Change | date = October\u2013November 1999| url = http://www.forachange.co.uk/index.php?subjid=154,150&stoid=149  | accessdate = 15 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228213327/http://www.forachange.net/browse/article/1649.html |archivedate=28 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sealord===\nThe Treaty guaranteed to M\u0101ori their lands, forests and fisheries. Over time, however, New Zealand law began to regulate [[Fishing industry in New Zealand|commercial fisheries]], so that M\u0101ori control was substantially eroded. To resolve this grievance, in 1989 an interim agreement was reached. The Crown transferred 10 percent of New Zealand's [[Quota Management System|fishing quota]] (some 60,000 tonnes), together with shareholdings in fishing companies and $50&nbsp;million in cash, to the Waitangi Fisheries Commission. This commission was responsible for holding the fisheries assets on behalf of M\u0101ori until an agreement was reached as to how the assets were to be shared among tribes. In 1992, a second part of the deal, referred to as the [[Sealord]] deal, marked full and final settlement of [[Fishing industry in New Zealand#M.C4.81ori role|M\u0101ori commercial fishing claims]] under the Treaty of Waitangi. This included 50% of Sealord Fisheries and 20% of all new species brought under the quota system, more shares in fishing companies, and $18&nbsp;million in cash. In total it was worth around $170&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Walrond\">{{cite web | last = Walrond | first = Carl | title = Fishing Industry | encyclopedia = [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/HarvestingTheSea/FishingIndustry/7/en | accessdate = 15 August 2006 }}</ref> This settlement was undertaken under the leadership of the Hon.

[[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato]]-[[Tainui]]'s confiscation claims were settled for a package worth $170&nbsp;million, in a mixture of cash and Crown-owned land. The settlement was accompanied by a formal apology as part of the claims legislation, granted [[Royal assent]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in person during her 1995 Royal tour of New Zealand. The Crown apologised for the [[Invasion of the Waikato]] and the subsequent indiscriminate confiscation of land.\n\n===Ng\u0101i Tahu===\n[[Ng\u0101i Tahu]]'s claims covered a large proportion of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, and related to the Crown's failure to meet its end of the bargain in land sales that took place from the 1840s.<ref name=\"NgaiTahu\">{{cite web | last = Te Runanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu | title = Claim History Overview | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ngaitahu.iwi.nz/About%20Ngai%20Tahu/The%20Settlement/Claim%20History%20Overview | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810111837/http://www.ngaitahu.iwi.nz/About%20Ngai%20Tahu/The%20Settlement/Claim%20History%20Overview | archive-date = 10 August 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Ng\u0101i Tahu sought recognition of their relationship with the land, as well as cash and property, and a number of novel arrangements were developed to address this. Among other things, Ng\u0101i Tahu and the Crown agreed that Mt Cook would be formally renamed [[Aoraki/Mount Cook]], and returned to Ng\u0101i Tahu to be gifted back to the people of New Zealand.\n\n==Settlements of the 2000s==\nThe process of negotiating historical claims continued after the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] and the subsequent change in government without radical change to government policy. The models developed for the early settlements remain a strong influence. The first [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Minister of Treaty Negotiations was [[Margaret Wilson]]. On her appointment as [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in early 2005, she was followed in the role by [[Mark Burton]]. He was replaced by Deputy Prime Minister [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]] in November 2007.\n\nIn June 2008, the Crown and representatives from seven Maori tribes signed an agreement relating to Crown forest land that was dubbed \"Treelords\" by the media,<ref name=\"Treelords\">{{cite news | title = The Treelords deal in 168 words | date = 26 June 2008 | publisher = New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=252&objectid=10518439| accessdate = 3 July 2008 }}</ref> because of perceived similarities to the Sealord deal of the 1990s. Like Sealord, it relates to a single issue, but covers multiple tribes. The agreement contains only financial redress, on account against comprehensive settlements to be negotiated with each tribe within the Collective. The agreement is the largest to date, by financial value, at NZ$196&nbsp;million worth of forest land in total (including the value of the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapu share). In addition, but not counted by the government as part of the redress package, the tribes will receive rentals that have accumulated on the land since 1989, valued at NZ$223&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Collective Deed\">{{cite web | last = Office of Treaty Settlements | title = Central North Island Forests Iwi Collective Deed of Settlement | date = 25 June 2008 | url = http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/CNIsummary.pdf | accessdate = 3 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081017185332/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/CNIsummary.pdf | archive-date = 17 October 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs at July 2008, there have been 23 settlements (counting the above) of various sizes.<ref name=\"QuarterlyReport\">{{Cite web |url=http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/FourMonthlyReportMarch-June2008.pdf |title=Four Monthly Report |last=Office of Treaty Settlements |date=June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018025424/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/FourMonthlyReportMarch-June2008.pdf |archive-date=18 October 2008 |access-date=25 September 2008}}</ref> Except as noted above, settlements generally include financial redress, a formal Crown apology for breaches of the Treaty, and recognition of the group's cultural associations with various sites.\n\nIn November 2008, [[Chris Finlayson]], a Wellington-based lawyer with experience in Treaty claims, was appointed Minister for Treaty Negotiations following the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] victory in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]].\n\nAs well as the much publicised land and financial compensation, many of these later settlements included changing the official placenames.

As noted above, M\u0101ori were concerned that the level of redress provided was too low, and that the settlement process was subject to too much Crown control. Conservationists were concerned about the impact of claims to conservation land, and many P\u0101keh\u0101 were concerned that settlements would directly affect them. Public Access New Zealand and the One New Zealand Foundation<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://onenzfoundation.co.nz/|title=One New Zealand Foundation Inc.|website=onenzfoundation.co.nz|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> respectively were lobby groups formed to represent these views. In general, those who feel that the Treaty claims process has gone too far are P\u0101keh\u0101, while those who believe it does not go far enough are M\u0101ori. However, there are some exceptions on both sides: the politician who has perhaps been most prominent in arguing against the Treaty is [[Winston Peters]], who is M\u0101ori, while there have been a number of P\u0101keh\u0101 pro-Treaty groups.\n\nHowever, during the 1990s there was broad agreement between major political parties that the settlement of historical claims was appropriate, within the confines of the government's policy to limit impact on private landowners and access to conservation land. Legislation enacting Treaty settlements was passed by Parliament with an overwhelming majority. On the claimants' side, support for a settlement was expressed through ratification among adult members of a tribe, in contrast with the early settlement attempts of the 1940s.\n\nOver time, the consensus on the part of politicians has frayed. Winston Peters has critiqued the increasing number of claims registered at the Waitangi Tribunal, a result of the law which allows any M\u0101ori to lodge a claim, and suggested that a \"Treaty of Waitangi Gravy Train\" has formed around the claims process.<ref name=\"Peters\">{{cite press release | title = \"Victimcrats\" and the \"Wellington Problem\" | publisher = New Zealand First | date = 7 March 2002 | url = http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/content/display_item.php?t=1&i=25 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20030712111635/http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/content/display_item.php?t=1&i=25 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 12 July 2003 | accessdate = 15 August 2006 }}</ref> The [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party has echoed that criticism \u2013 despite stating that \"claims should be promptly settled where land was unlawfully taken or improperly compensated, if we can identify the descendants of those who were wronged\",<ref name=\"ACT\">{{cite web  | last = ACT Party | title = ACT on The Treaty of Waitangi and M\u0101ori Affairs | date = c. 2005 | url = http://www.act.org.nz/policy_treaty_details.aspx | accessdate = 15 August 2006 |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20060518141006/http://www.act.org.nz/policy_treaty_details.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 18 May 2006}}</ref> they have never voted in support of Treaty settlement legislation, and coined the phrase \"Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry\",<ref name=\"Newman\">{{cite web  | last = Newman | first = Muriel | title = ACT's once radical policies are now determining the future of New Zealand| date = c. 2005 | url = http://www.act.org.nz/news-article.aspx/27258| accessdate = 15 August 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> to describe the participants in the settlement process.\n\nThe [[Orewa Speech]] in 2004 saw the National Party for the first time take up the term \"Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry\".

Successive governments have increasingly provided formal legal and political opportunity for [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to seek redress for breaches by the Crown of the guarantees set out in the Treaty of Waitangi. While it has resulted in putting to rest a number of significant longstanding grievances, the process has been subject to criticisms from a number of angles, from those who believe that the redress is insufficient to compensate for M\u0101ori losses, to those who see no value in revisiting painful and contentious historical issues. The settlements are typically seen as part of a broader [[M\u0101ori Renaissance]].\n\nBecause the Treaty of Waitangi has limited legal standing in itself, the primary means of registering and researching Treaty claims is through the [[Waitangi Tribunal]]. The primary means of settling those claims is through negotiations with the government of the day.\n\n== History of the Treaty ==\n{{main|Treaty of Waitangi}}\n[[File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg|thumb|200px|The Treaty of Waitangi]]\nThe [[Treaty of Waitangi]] is often considered to be the founding document for European ([[P\u0101keh\u0101]]) settlement in New Zealand. It guaranteed to [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] the right to keep their lands, forests, fisheries and all their treasures, but they would hand sovereignty in the [[New Zealand English|English]] version, and governorship in the [[Te Reo|M\u0101ori]] version, over to [[the Crown]] and would also be able to sell only to the Crown. Initially, there was little dispute, as the settlers were able to buy land from the M\u0101ori through legal channels. However, after a while, M\u0101ori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases. Agreements were negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from the wrong people altogether. Unrest and rebellion caused by these actions were met with further punitive land confiscations. Eventually this led to the [[New Zealand Wars]], which culminated in the confiscation of a large part of the [[Waikato]] and [[Taranaki]].\n\n== Early settlements ==\nIn the 1920s, land commissions investigated the grievances of [[hap\u016b]] whose land had been confiscated or otherwise fraudulently obtained in the previous century, and many were found to be valid.<ref name=\"e20\">{{cite web | last = Treaty of Waitangi Information Unit | title = Early Twentieth Century | publisher = State Services Commission | year = 2005 | url = http://www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz/story/earlytwentiethcentury.php | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908095310/http://www.treatyofwaitangi.govt.nz/story/earlytwentiethcentury.php | archive-date = 8 September 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> By the 1940s, settlements in the form of modest annual payments had been arranged with some hap\u016b. However, hap\u016b came to consider the amounts to be inadequate, especially as inflation eroded their value, and the Crown has conceded that it did not sufficiently seek the agreement of hap\u016b to declare their claims settled.<ref name=\"NgaRauru\">{{cite web | last = Office of Treaty Settlements | title = Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi Settlement Summary | year = 2003 | url = http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/NgaRauru-Summary.pdf | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060723170912/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/NgaRauru-Summary.pdf | archive-date = 23 July 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== The Waitangi Tribunal ==\n{{main|Waitangi Tribunal|Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975}}\nDuring the late 1960s and 1970s the Treaty of Waitangi became the focus of a strong M\u0101ori protest movement which rallied around calls for the government to 'honour the treaty' and to 'redress treaty grievances'. M\u0101ori expressed their frustration about continuing violations of the treaty and subsequent legislation by government officials, as well as inequitable legislation and unsympathetic decisions by the [[M\u0101ori Land Court]] alienating M\u0101ori land from its M\u0101ori owners.<ref name=\"Maori Protests\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/nga-ropu-tautohetohe-maori-protest-movements/page-1|title=Ng\u0101 r\u014dp\u016b tautohetohe \u2013 M\u0101ori protest movements|last=Keane|first=Basil|date=2012-06-20|website=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=23 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the Treaty of Waitangi Act established the Waitangi Tribunal to hear claims of Crown violations of the Treaty of Waitangi, to address those concerns. It allowed any M\u0101ori to lodge a claim against the Crown for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi and its [[Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi|principles]]. Originally its mandate was limited to claims about contemporary issues, that is, those that occurred after the establishment of the Tribunal. Early claims included the \"Te Reo M\u0101ori\" claim.<ref name=\"TeReo\">{{cite web | last = Waitangi Tribunal | title = Te Report of the Waitangi Tribunal on the Te Reo Maori Claim | date = c. 1986 | url = http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid={6113B0B0-13B5-400A-AFC7-76F76D3DDD92} | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061002091224/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid=%7B6113B0B0-13B5-400A-AFC7-76F76D3DDD92%7D | archive-date = 2 October 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> As a result of the Tribunal's report into the claim, in 1987 the government made [[M\u0101ori language|Te Reo M\u0101ori]] an official language of New Zealand, and established the [[Maori Language Commission]] to foster it. The pivotal issue considered by the Tribunal was whether a language could be considered a \"treasure\" or \"taonga\", and thus protected by the Treaty.\n\nIn 1985 the [[New Zealand Labour Party#Fourth Labour Government|Fourth Labour Government]] extended the Tribunal's powers to allow it to consider Crown actions dating back to 1840,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PlibC5191/historical-treaty-settlements|title=Research papers|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}</ref> including the period covered by the New Zealand Wars. The number of claims quickly rose, and during the early 1990s, the government began to negotiate settlements of historical (pre-1992) claims.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Therese|date=1970-01-01|title=History and the Treaty of Waitangi Settlement Process|journal=The Journal of New Zealand Studies|issue=18|doi=10.26686/jnzs.v0i18.2184|issn=2324-3740|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Settlements of the 1990s==\nWhile early Tribunal recommendations mainly concerned a contemporary issue that could be revised or rectified by the government at the time, historical settlements raised more complex issues. The [[Office of Treaty Settlements]] was established in the Ministry of Justice to develop government policy on historical claims. In 1995, the government developed the \"Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims\"<ref name=\"Crown Proposals\">{{cite web | last = Office of Treaty Settlements| title = Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims | year = 1995 | url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/1996/91.html | accessdate = 15 August 2006 }}</ref> to attempt to address the issues. A key element of the proposals was the creation of a \"fiscal envelope\" of [[NZD|$]]1&nbsp;billion for the settlement of all historical claims, an effective limit on what the Crown would pay out in settlements. The Crown held a series of consultation [[Hui (M\u0101ori assembly)|hui]] around the country, at which M\u0101ori vehemently rejected such a limitation in advance of the extent of claims being fully known.<ref name=\"Gardiner\">{{Cite book | last=Gardiner| given=Wira| title=Return to Sender; what really happened at the fiscal envelope hui| publisher=Reed| place=[[Auckland]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-7900-0460-7 }}</ref> The concept of the fiscal envelope was subsequently dropped after the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 general election]].\n\nDespite the protest, three major settlements were reached during this time. The Minister of Justice and Treaty Negotiations at the time, [[Doug Graham|Sir Douglas Graham]], is credited with leading a largely conservative [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|National government]] to make these breakthroughs.<ref name=\"Lean\">{{cite journal | last = Lean | first = Mary | title = Getting the Government to Say Sorry | journal = For a Change | publisher=Initiatives of Change | date = October\u2013November 1999| url = http://www.forachange.co.uk/index.php?subjid=154,150&stoid=149  | accessdate = 15 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228213327/http://www.forachange.net/browse/article/1649.html |archivedate=28 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sealord===\nThe Treaty guaranteed to M\u0101ori their lands, forests and fisheries. Over time, however, New Zealand law began to regulate [[Fishing industry in New Zealand|commercial fisheries]], so that M\u0101ori control was substantially eroded. To resolve this grievance, in 1989 an interim agreement was reached. The Crown transferred 10 percent of New Zealand's [[Quota Management System|fishing quota]] (some 60,000 tonnes), together with shareholdings in fishing companies and $50&nbsp;million in cash, to the Waitangi Fisheries Commission. This commission was responsible for holding the fisheries assets on behalf of M\u0101ori until an agreement was reached as to how the assets were to be shared among tribes.

This included 50% of Sealord Fisheries and 20% of all new species brought under the quota system, more shares in fishing companies, and $18&nbsp;million in cash.

[[Waikato (iwi)|Waikato]]-[[Tainui]]'s confiscation claims were settled for a package worth $170&nbsp;million, in a mixture of cash and Crown-owned land. The settlement was accompanied by a formal apology as part of the claims legislation, granted [[Royal assent]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in person during her 1995 Royal tour of New Zealand. The Crown apologised for the [[Invasion of the Waikato]] and the subsequent indiscriminate confiscation of land.\n\n===Ng\u0101i Tahu===\n[[Ng\u0101i Tahu]]'s claims covered a large proportion of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, and related to the Crown's failure to meet its end of the bargain in land sales that took place from the 1840s.<ref name=\"NgaiTahu\">{{cite web | last = Te Runanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu | title = Claim History Overview | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ngaitahu.iwi.nz/About%20Ngai%20Tahu/The%20Settlement/Claim%20History%20Overview | accessdate = 15 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810111837/http://www.ngaitahu.iwi.nz/About%20Ngai%20Tahu/The%20Settlement/Claim%20History%20Overview | archive-date = 10 August 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Ng\u0101i Tahu sought recognition of their relationship with the land, as well as cash and property, and a number of novel arrangements were developed to address this. Among other things, Ng\u0101i Tahu and the Crown agreed that Mt Cook would be formally renamed [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]], and returned to Ng\u0101i Tahu to be gifted back to the people of New Zealand.\n\n==Settlements of the 2000s==\nThe process of negotiating historical claims continued after the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] and the subsequent change in government without radical change to government policy. The models developed for the early settlements remain a strong influence. The first [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Minister of Treaty Negotiations was [[Margaret Wilson]]. On her appointment as [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in early 2005, she was followed in the role by [[Mark Burton]]. He was replaced by Deputy Prime Minister [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]] in November 2007.\n\nIn June 2008, the Crown and representatives from seven Maori tribes signed an agreement relating to Crown forest land that was dubbed \"Treelords\" by the media,<ref name=\"Treelords\">{{cite news | title = The Treelords deal in 168 words | date = 26 June 2008 | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=252&objectid=10518439| accessdate = 3 July 2008 }}</ref> because of perceived similarities to the Sealord deal of the 1990s. Like Sealord, it relates to a single issue, but covers multiple tribes. The agreement contains only financial redress, on account against comprehensive settlements to be negotiated with each tribe within the Collective. The agreement is the largest to date, by financial value, at NZ$196&nbsp;million worth of forest land in total (including the value of the Affiliate Te Arawa Iwi and Hapu share). In addition, but not counted by the government as part of the redress package, the tribes will receive rentals that have accumulated on the land since 1989, valued at NZ$223&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Collective Deed\">{{cite web | last = Office of Treaty Settlements | title = Central North Island Forests Iwi Collective Deed of Settlement | date = 25 June 2008 | url = http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/CNIsummary.pdf | accessdate = 3 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081017185332/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/CNIsummary.pdf | archive-date = 17 October 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs at July 2008, there have been 23 settlements (counting the above) of various sizes.<ref name=\"QuarterlyReport\">{{Cite web |url=http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/FourMonthlyReportMarch-June2008.pdf |title=Four Monthly Report |last=Office of Treaty Settlements |date=June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018025424/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/DocumentLibrary/FourMonthlyReportMarch-June2008.pdf |archive-date=18 October 2008 |access-date=25 September 2008}}</ref> Except as noted above, settlements generally include financial redress, a formal Crown apology for breaches of the Treaty, and recognition of the group's cultural associations with various sites.\n\nIn November 2008, [[Chris Finlayson]], a Wellington-based lawyer with experience in Treaty claims, was appointed Minister for Treaty Negotiations following the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] victory in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]].\n\nAs well as the much publicised land and financial compensation, many of these later settlements included changing the official placenames.

As noted above, M\u0101ori were concerned that the level of redress provided was too low, and that the settlement process was subject to too much Crown control. Conservationists were concerned about the impact of claims to conservation land, and many P\u0101keh\u0101 were concerned that settlements would directly affect them. Public Access New Zealand and the One New Zealand Foundation<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://onenzfoundation.co.nz/|title=One New Zealand Foundation Inc.|website=onenzfoundation.co.nz|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> respectively were lobby groups formed to represent these views. In general, those who feel that the Treaty claims process has gone too far are P\u0101keh\u0101, while those who believe it does not go far enough are M\u0101ori. However, there are some exceptions on both sides: the politician who has perhaps been most prominent in arguing against the Treaty is [[Winston Peters]], who is M\u0101ori, while there have been a number of P\u0101keh\u0101 pro-Treaty groups.\n\nHowever, during the 1990s there was broad agreement between major political parties that the settlement of historical claims was appropriate, within the confines of the government's policy to limit impact on private landowners and access to conservation land. Legislation enacting Treaty settlements was passed by Parliament with an overwhelming majority. On the claimants' side, support for a settlement was expressed through ratification among adult members of a tribe, in contrast with the early settlement attempts of the 1940s.\n\nOver time, the consensus on the part of politicians has frayed. Winston Peters has critiqued the increasing number of claims registered at the Waitangi Tribunal, a result of the law which allows any M\u0101ori to lodge a claim, and suggested that a \"Treaty of Waitangi Gravy Train\" has formed around the claims process.<ref name=\"Peters\">{{cite press release | title = \"Victimcrats\" and the \"Wellington Problem\" | publisher = New Zealand First | date = 7 March 2002 | url = http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/content/display_item.php?t=1&i=25 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20030712111635/http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/content/display_item.php?t=1&i=25 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 12 July 2003 | accessdate = 15 August 2006 }}</ref> The [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party has echoed that criticism \u2013 despite stating that \"claims should be promptly settled where land was unlawfully taken or improperly compensated, if we can identify the descendants of those who were wronged\",<ref name=\"ACT\">{{cite web  | last = ACT Party | title = ACT on The Treaty of Waitangi and M\u0101ori Affairs | date = c. 2005 | url = http://www.act.org.nz/policy_treaty_details.aspx | accessdate = 15 August 2006 |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20060518141006/http://www.act.org.nz/policy_treaty_details.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 18 May 2006}}</ref> they have never voted in support of Treaty settlement legislation, and coined the phrase \"Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry\",<ref name=\"Newman\">{{cite web  | last = Newman | first = Muriel | title = ACT's once radical policies are now determining the future of New Zealand| date = c. 2005 | url = http://www.act.org.nz/news-article.aspx/27258| accessdate = 15 August 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> to describe the participants in the settlement process.\n\nThe [[Orewa Speech]] in 2004 saw the National Party for the first time take up the term \"Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry\".
