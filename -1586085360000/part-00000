Undertaker would find Hunter's statement of having \"already beaten everyone in the business\" as arrogant as the two never met in a one-on-one match before. Following various brawls between their respective allies, Undertaker would have Kane hold Stephanie McMahon hostage unless then-commissioner, William Regal, give them matches against Triple H and the Big Show respectively.\n\nFollowing a match involving a brawl through the crowd, The Undertaker finally pinned Triple H after using the [[Powerbomb|Last Ride]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania28/2012/02/24/19419436.html|title=The first battle with Triple H|last=Van Der Greind|first=Blaine|date=24 February 2012|accessdate=24 December 2014|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canoe]]|website=slam.canoe.ca/}}</ref> This bout marked The Undertaker's first WrestleMania appearance under his \"American Badass\" biker persona.\n\n=== WrestleMania X8 (10\u20130) ===\nDuring No Way Out 2002, Undertaker would face The Rock after the two had been feuding, but he would lose the match thanks to Ric Flair's interference, sparking a feud between the two which led to a match at WrestleMania.\n\n[[File:TakerTombstone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Undertaker delivering a Tombstone Piledriver to Ric Flair]]\nFought under [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Disqualification rules]], The Undertaker beat Ric Flair after delivering a Tombstone Piledriver, despite interference from [[Arn Anderson]].

Triple H initially rejected before accepting. Contested inside a Hell in a Cell, and refereed by Shawn Michaels, the match, billed as the \"End of an Era\" began with both men brawling in and around the ring. Shortly afterwards, with the steel steps inside the ring, Triple H hit a spinebuster on Undertaker, who then managed to lock in the Hell's Gate, which was countered when Triple H lifted him up and slammed him on the steel steps. The match was littered with weapon shots, including 16 consecutive chair shots by Triple H, followed by a sledgehammer shot to the skull, all the while Undertaker instructed Michaels not to stop the match. When being checked on by Michaels, Undertaker locked him in the Hell's Gate, leaving him out cold. Replacement referee [[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] ran down to the ring after Undertaker hit a chokeslam on Triple H, but could only make a two-count, and was then on the receiving end of a chokeslam himself. Michaels recovered and hit Undertaker with Sweet Chin Music followed by a Triple H Pedigree, but this wasn't enough for the three count. Both men traded finishing moves for near-falls, before Undertaker delivered his own series of chair shots for another two count. Undertaker won shortly afterwards with a Tombstone Piledriver.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania28/2012/03/29/19565486.html|title=Highs of Taker-HHH, Cena-Rock and Punk-Jericho overcome plenty of lows at WrestleMania XXVIII|last1=Plummer|first1=Dale|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=24 December 2014|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canoe]]|last2=Tylwalk|first2=Nick|website=slam.canoe.ca/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/kellerstake/article_59863.shtml|title=Keller's WWE WrestleMania 28 Take:|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=24 December 2014|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|authorlink=Wade Keller|website=www.pwtorch.com/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wweppvs/article_59831.shtml|title=Caldwell's WWE WrestleMania 28 PPV Report|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=1 April 2012|accessdate=24 December 2014|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|website=www.pwtorch.com/}}</ref> It was praised as one of the greatest Hell in a Cell matches of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/s216/wwe/feature/a525105/wwe-hell-in-a-cell-5-best-ever-bouts.html|title=WWE Hell in a Cell: 5 best-ever bouts|last=Nissim|first=Mayer|date=25 October 2013|accessdate=24 December 2014|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|website=www.digitalspy.com/}}</ref> while Triple H thought it was one of his favorite matches of his career.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/other-sports/news/13043/9530307/wwe-hell-in-a-cell-triple-h-says-undertaker-clash-at-wrestlemania-28-was-one-of-his-best|title=Triple H says Undertaker clash at WrestleMania 28 was one of his best|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=27 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027111223/http://www1.skysports.com/other-sports/news/13043/9530307/wwe-hell-in-a-cell-triple-h-says-undertaker-clash-at-wrestlemania-28-was-one-of-his-best|archivedate=October 27, 2014|url-status=dead|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|website=[[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref>\n\n=== WrestleMania 29 (21\u20130) ===\nIn a controversial angle the week before [[WrestleMania 29]], CM Punk's manager [[Paul Heyman]], dressed as, and using the mannerisms of, the recently deceased [[Paul Bearer]], came out to confront The Undertaker whilst flanked by Undertaker's signature [[druid]]s.

Subsequently, [[David Satter]] has interviewed Pavel Voloshin.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a hunting cartridge that would not be able to detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm Today is the Federal Security Service Employee Day: Satisfied with the year summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |date=31 January 2011 }}, [[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]], 20 December 2001, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244%26m=8.htm computer translation]</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, the Russian newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Subsequently, [[David Satter]] has interviewed Pavel Voloshin.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar Mark Sinclair - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> He did not occupy a university chair, but he was the conservator of the department of antiquities at the [[Louvre]], president of the jury of the [[:fr:Agr%C3%A9gation de philosophie en France|Aggregation of philosophy in France]] and [[:fr:Inspection g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale des biblioth%C3%A8ques|Inspector General of Libraries]].<ref name=\"SinclairI-1\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|[[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau]], ''Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien'']]\nRavaisson's chief philosophical works are: \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893).

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|[[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau]], ''Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien'']]\nRavaisson's chief philosophical works are: \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893).

The expedition marked the first time a six-member crew inhabited the station. Because each [[Soyuz-TMA]] spacecraft could hold only three people, two separate launches were necessary: [[Soyuz TMA-14]] launched on 26 March 2009, and [[Soyuz TMA-15]] followed on 27 May 2009.<ref name=\"launch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition20/launch.html|title=Expedition 20 Crew Launches from Baikonur|last=NASA HQ|date=24 May 2009|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nSoyuz TMA-15 launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] at 10:34 UTC on 27 May 2009.<ref name=\"launch\" /> The vehicle docked with the station on 29 May 2009, officially changing the Soyuz TMA-14 crew from [[Expedition 19]] to Expedition 20.<ref name=\"dock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition20/docking.html|title=Expedition 20 Crew Docks with Space Station|last=NASA HQ|date=29 May 2009|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Gennady Padalka]] was the first commander of a six-member station crew, and the first commander of two consecutive expeditions (Expedition 19 and 20). [[Nicole Stott]] was the final expedition astronaut to be launched on the shuttle.\n\nDuring the expedition, Koichi Wakata performed a special experiment wherein he did not change his underpants for one month, in order to test a specially-designed underwear without washing or changing; he reportedly did not develop body odor due to the effects of the special garment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8177743.stm |work=BBC News | title=Astronaut wore pants for a month | date=31 July 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe station would not be permanently occupied by six crew members all year. For example, when the Expedition 20 crew ([[Roman Romanenko]], [[Frank De Winne]] and [[Robert Thirsk|Bob Thirsk]]) returned to Earth in November 2009, for a period of about two weeks only two crew members ([[Jeffrey Williams (astronaut)|Jeff Williams]] and [[Maksim Surayev|Max Surayev]]) were aboard. This increased to five in early December, when [[Oleg Kotov]], [[Timothy Creamer]] and [[Soichi Noguchi]] arrived on [[Soyuz TMA-17]]. It decreased to three when Williams and Surayev departed in March 2010, and finally returned to six in April 2010 with the arrival of [[Soyuz TMA-18]], carrying [[Aleksandr Skvortsov (cosmonaut)|Aleksandr Skvortsov]], [[Mikhail Korniyenko]] and [[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]].<ref name=\"ISSEx\">{{cite web|title=International Space Station Expeditions|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html|date=10 April 2009|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"current\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html|title=International Space Station|accessdate=22 October 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA}}</ref>\n\n==Crew==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n! width=\"150\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\" | <center>'''Position<ref name=\"crew1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-306_Expedition_crews.html|title=NASA Assigns Space Station Crews, Updates Expedition Numbering |accessdate=21 November 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA HQ}}</ref>'''</center>\n! width=\"150\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\" | <center>'''First Part<br /><small>(May to July 2009)</small>'''</center>\n! width=\"150\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\" | <center>'''Second Part<br /><small>(July to August 2009)</small>'''</center>\n! width=\"150\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\" | <center>'''Third Part<br /><small>(August to October 2009)</small>'''</center>\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=3 align=center|{{Flagicon|RUS}} [[Gennady Padalka]], [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RSA]]<br />Third spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 1\n|colspan=3 align=center|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Michael R.

Like many of Stephenson's other novels, it covers [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[religion]], [[computer science]], [[politics]], [[cryptography]], [[memetics]] and [[philosophy]].\n\nStephenson explained the title of the novel in his 1999 essay \"[[In the Beginning... Was the Command Line]]\" as his term for a particular software [[Failure causes|failure mode]] on the early [[Apple Macintosh]] computer. Stephenson wrote about the Macintosh that \"When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the [[bitmap]], the result was something that looked vaguely like [[Noise (video)|static on a broken television]] set\u2014a 'snow crash'\u2009\". Stephenson has also mentioned that [[Julian Jaynes]]' book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]'' was one of the main influences on ''Snow Crash''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/review/neal-stephenson-anathem/|quote=I\u2019d had a similar reaction to yours when I\u2019d first read The Origin of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, and that, combined with the desire to use IT, were two elements from which Snow Crash grew.|title=Interviews - Neal Stephenson: Anathem - A Conversation with James Mustich, Editor-in-Chief of the Barnes & Noble Review |first=James |last=Mustich |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2014-08-06 |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble|barnesandnoble.com]]}}</ref>\n\nThe book presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] [[programming language]] for the [[brainstem]], which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus, similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter-program which he called a nam-shub that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah (a re-interpretation of the ancient Near Eastern story of the [[Tower of Babel]]).\n\n''Snow Crash'' was nominated for both the [[BSFA Awards|British Science Fiction Award]] in 1993, and the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] in 1994.<ref name=\"WWE-1993\">{{cite web | url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1993| title = 1993 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref><ref name=\"WWE-1994\">{{cite web | url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1994| title = 1994 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe story opens in [[Los Angeles]] in the 21st century, an unspecified number of years after a worldwide economic collapse.  Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States, as the [[US federal government]] has ceded most of its power and territory to private organizations and [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]].<ref>\"''Snow Crash'' depicts a twenty-first-century America in which the needs of entrepreneurs have won out over hopes of a free and [[egalitarian]] society.\" Rorty, ''Achieving Our Country'', 4.</ref> [[Franchising]], individual [[sovereignty]], and private vehicles reign supreme. [[Mercenary]] armies compete for national defense contracts while private [[security guard]]s preserve the peace in sovereign, [[Gated community|gated housing developments]]. Highway companies compete to attract drivers to their roads and all mail delivery is by hired courier. The remnants of government maintain authority only in isolated compounds where they do tedious [[Make-work job|make-work]] that is, by and large, irrelevant to the society around them.\n\nMuch of the world's territory has been carved up into sovereign enclaves, each run by its own [[big business]] franchise (such as \"Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong\", or the corporatized [[American Mafia]]), or various residential ''burbclaves'' \u2014 quasi-sovereign gated communities.\n\nThis arrangement resembles [[anarcho-capitalism]], a theme Stephenson carries over to his next novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]''. As described in both novels, and the short story \"[[The Great Simoleon Caper]]\" (1995), [[hyperinflation]] has sapped the value of the US dollar to the extent that [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] dollar bills\u2014''[[Edwin Meese|Ed Meeses]]''\u2014are nearly disregarded and the [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]] dollar note\u2014the ''[[Ronald Reagan|Gipper]]''\u2014is the standard \"small\" bill. This hyperinflation was created by the government overprinting money, due to loss of tax revenues, as people increasingly began to use [[electronic currency]], exchanged in [[anonymous internet banking|encrypted online transactions]] and thus untaxable. For physical transactions, they resort to alternative currencies such as yen or \"Kongbucks\" (the official currency of Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong). Hyperinflation has also negatively affected much of the rest of the world (with some exceptions like Japan), resulting in waves of desperate refugees from Asia who cross the Pacific in rickety ships hoping to arrive in North America.\n\nThe ''[[Metaverse]]'', a phrase coined by Stephenson as a successor to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson's vision of how a [[virtual reality]]\u2013based Internet might evolve in the near future. Resembling a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO), the Metaverse is populated by user-controlled [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] as well as system [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]]. Although there are public-access Metaverse [[Computer terminal|terminals]] in ''Reality'', using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse [[denization|denizens]], in part because of the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatars]]. Status in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one's avatar.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\nHiro Protagonist is a hacker and pizza delivery driver for the Mafia. He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier ([[courier]]) who [[Illeism|refers to herself in the third person]], during a failed attempt to make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC, the for-profit organization that evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress. Within the Metaverse, Hiro is offered a datafile named Snow Crash by a man named Raven who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a bitmap image contained in the file which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research, positing connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture and the legend of [[Tower of Babel]]. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears.\n\nThe Mafia boss Uncle Enzo begins to take a paternal interest in Y.T. Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and offers her freelance jobs. Hiro's investigations and Y.T.'s intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates and a media magnate named L. Bob Rife beginning to emerge. Juanita's research showed that the ancient Sumerian [[Proto-Human language|ur-language]] allowed brain function to be 'programmed' using audio stimuli in conjunction with a DNA altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized around these programs (known as ''[[Me (mythology)|me]]'') which were administered by priests to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus (known as ''the nam-shub of Enki'') which when delivered stopped the Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and led to the development of other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel myth. L. Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed the drug Snow Crash in order to make the public vulnerable to new forms of ''me'' which he would control. The physical form of the virus is distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend Wayne's church via infected blood. There is also a digital version to which hackers are especially vulnerable as they are accustomed to processing information in binary form.\n\nHiro heads north to where the Raft, a huge collection of boats containing Eurasian refugees, is approaching the American coast. The center of the Raft is L Bob Rife's yacht, formerly the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'' nuclear-powered aircraft carrier]]. Rife has been using the Raft as a mechanism to indoctrinate and infect thousands with the virus and to import it to America. Y.T. is captured and brought to Rife on the Raft, who intends to use her as a hostage, knowing her connection to Uncle Enzo. With help from the Mafia, Hiro makes it onto the raft and recovers the ''nam-shub'' of Enki which Rife had been concealing. With help from Juanita who had previously infiltrated the Raft, the ''nam-shub'' is read out and Rife's control over the Raft is broken. Rife flees the Raft, taking Y.T., and Raven attempts to activate the digital form of Snow Crash at a virtual concert within the Metaverse. Hiro is able to neutralize the virus and Y.T. escapes. After a confrontation with the Mafia, Raven is injured, and Rife is killed as he attempts to flee on his private jet. Y.T. is reunited with her mother and Hiro and Juanita appear reconciled.\n\n== Characteristic technologies ==\nVarious technologies are employed in this fictional world, and help define it. Among these are:\n\n=== Rat Things ===\nRat Things, also known as semi-autonomous guard units, are cybernetic personal defensive guards found in and around Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong. Engineered from [[pit bull terrier]]s surgically augmented with cybernetic components, Rat Things are named for their long, flexible tails.\n\nRat Things were invented by Mr. Ng, of Ng Security Industries, who was severely handicapped after a helicopter accident in Vietnam. Like the Rat Things, Mr. Ng is also a cyborg.\n\nRat Things remember their previous lives as dogs. They can also communicate with other Rat Things by \"barking\" in the Metaverse. Although their minds are largely controlled by their implants, they can sometimes act independently of their programming. When in the Metaverse and not performing guard duties, Rat Things experience running on endless beaches, playing in the surf, eating [[steaks]] that grow on trees, and blood-drenched Frisbees floating around, waiting to be caught.\n\nLike other technology in ''Snow Crash'', Rat Things are powered by a [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|nuclear isotope battery]], which requires extensive cooling due to the massive amount of waste heat generated. The Rat Things are passively cooled by a system of [[heat sinks]] that are only effective when the Rat Thing runs fast enough to move ambient air across the fins. To prevent rapid overheating when stationary, they must remain in their hutches (effectively dog houses), where they are continuously sprayed by jets of refrigerant. Through running, Rat Things are capable of breaking the [[sound barrier]] (about 768&nbsp;mph at sea level), although this is not typically permitted by Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong's \"good neighbor\" policies due to noise reasons. Because they must be either moving at high velocities or actively cooling in their hutches, Rat Things are rarely seen by human eyes and few people know what they look like.\n\n===Smartwheels===<!-- Anchor from redirect from [Smartwheels]; caution. -->\nA fictional type of wheel used on skateboards and advanced motorcycles. They consist of small segments of contact surface mounted on telescoping spokes, allowing the wheel to take the shape of cracks, curbs, and bumps.  They have a passing mention in ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' as being used on a wheelchair belonging to a minor character.<ref>Note:Arthur C. Clarke's version of adaptive wheels are utilized by the lunar transport which shuttles Dr. Heywood Floyd to the site where the [[Tycho Magnetic Anomaly TMA-1]] was excavated on the moon.</ref>\n\n===Reason===<!-- [[Reason (weapon system)]] points here; please do not remove this section without fixing all articles linking to it. -->\nReason is a [[railgun]] in a [[rotary cannon]] configuration which fires [[depleted uranium]] [[flechette]]s. It is mounted to a large, wheeled ammunition box and is equipped with a harness for user comfort, a [[atomic battery|nuclear]] battery pack, and a water-cooled heat exchanger. The weapon, created by Ng, was still in [[beta testing]], and suffers a [[Crash (computing)|software crash]] during a battle, resulting in the death of its user. Hiro is later able to apply a [[firmware]] update, and uses it until its ammunition supply is depleted. It bears, in inscription on its nameplate, the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[Ultima Ratio Regum]]'', \"the last argument of kings\".\n\n=== Metaverse ===\n{{Main|Metaverse}}\n\nThe Metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://metaverseroadmap.org/inputs4.html#glossary\n|title=Smart, J.M., Cascio, J. and Paffendorf, J., Metaverse Roadmap Overview, 2007.\n|publisher=Accelerated Studies Foundation\n|accessdate=2010-09-23\n}}</ref> including the sum of all [[virtual world]]s, [[augmented reality]], and the internet.  The word ''metaverse'' combines the prefix \"[[meta]]\" (meaning \"beyond\") with \"[[universe]]\" and is typically used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe.<ref name=\"IEEE VW Standard Working Group\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metaversestandards.org|title=IEEE VW Standard Working Group|accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref>\n\nStephenson's Metaverse appears to its users as an [[urban area|urban]] environment, developed along a single hundred-meter-wide road, the Street, that runs the entire 65536&nbsp;km (2<sup>16</sup> km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical [[planet]]. The virtual [[real estate]] is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real [[Association for Computing Machinery]], and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.\n\nUsers of the Metaverse gain access to it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from low-quality public terminals in booths (with the penalty of presenting a grainy [[black and white]] appearance). Stephenson also describes a [[sub-culture]] of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the Metaverse by wearing portable terminals, goggles and other equipment; they are given the sobriquet \"[[gargoyle]]s\" due to their grotesque appearance. The users of the Metaverse experience it from a [[First person (video games)|first person perspective]].\n\nWithin the Metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, \"to prevent people from walking around a mile high\". Transport within the Metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the [[monorail]] that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at [[256 (number)|256]] ''Express Ports'', located evenly at 256&nbsp;km intervals, and ''Local Ports'', one kilometer apart.\n\n== Literary significance and criticism ==\n''Snow Crash'' established Stephenson as a major science fiction writer of the 1990s.

Michaels contends that this basic idea of language as code is central to the construct of ''Snow Crash'' (\"... a good deal of ''Snow Crash''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s plot depends upon eliding the distinction between hackers and their computers, as if\u2014indeed, in the novel, just because\u2014looking at code will do to the hacker what receiving it will do to the computer\"<ref name=michaels68/>), but at the same time, trivializes the role of meaning in linguistic works.  {{bquote|The body that is infected by a virus does not become infected because it understands the virus any more than the body that does not become infected misunderstands the virus.

In contrast, it uniquely risks developing a racialized view of culture.

Like many of Stephenson's other novels, it covers [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[religion]], [[computer science]], [[politics]], [[cryptography]], [[memetics]] and [[philosophy]].\n\nStephenson explained the title of the novel in his 1999 essay \"[[In the Beginning... Was the Command Line]]\" as his term for a particular software [[Failure causes|failure mode]] on the early [[Apple Macintosh]] computer. Stephenson wrote about the Macintosh that \"When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the [[bitmap]], the result was something that looked vaguely like [[Noise (video)|static on a broken television]] set\u2014a 'snow crash'\u2009\". Stephenson has also mentioned that [[Julian Jaynes]]' book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]'' was one of the main influences on ''Snow Crash''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/review/neal-stephenson-anathem/|quote=I\u2019d had a similar reaction to yours when I\u2019d first read The Origin of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, and that, combined with the desire to use IT, were two elements from which Snow Crash grew.|title=Interviews - Neal Stephenson: Anathem - A Conversation with James Mustich, Editor-in-Chief of the Barnes & Noble Review |first=James |last=Mustich |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2014-08-06 |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble|barnesandnoble.com]]}}</ref>\n\nThe book presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] [[programming language]] for the [[brainstem]], which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus, similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter-program which he called a nam-shub that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah (a re-interpretation of the ancient Near Eastern story of the [[Tower of Babel]]).\n\n''Snow Crash'' was nominated for both the [[BSFA Awards|British Science Fiction Award]] in 1993, and the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] in 1994.<ref name=\"WWE-1993\">{{cite web | url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1993| title = 1993 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref><ref name=\"WWE-1994\">{{cite web | url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1994| title = 1994 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe story opens in [[Los Angeles]] in the 21st century, an unspecified number of years after a worldwide economic collapse.  Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States, as the [[US federal government]] has ceded most of its power and territory to private organizations and [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]].<ref>\"''Snow Crash'' depicts a twenty-first-century America in which the needs of entrepreneurs have won out over hopes of a free and [[egalitarian]] society.\" Rorty, ''Achieving Our Country'', 4.</ref> [[Franchising]], individual [[sovereignty]], and private vehicles reign supreme. [[Mercenary]] armies compete for national defense contracts while private [[security guard]]s preserve the peace in sovereign, [[Gated community|gated housing developments]]. Highway companies compete to attract drivers to their roads and all mail delivery is by hired courier. The remnants of government maintain authority only in isolated compounds where they do tedious [[Make-work job|make-work]] that is, by and large, irrelevant to the society around them.\n\nMuch of the world's territory has been carved up into sovereign enclaves, each run by its own [[big business]] franchise (such as \"Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong\", or the corporatized [[American Mafia]]), or various residential ''burbclaves'' \u2014 quasi-sovereign gated communities.\n\nThis arrangement resembles [[anarcho-capitalism]], a theme Stephenson carries over to his next novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]''. As described in both novels, and the short story \"[[The Great Simoleon Caper]]\" (1995), [[hyperinflation]] has sapped the value of the US dollar to the extent that [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] dollar bills\u2014''[[Edwin Meese|Ed Meeses]]''\u2014are nearly disregarded and the [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]] dollar note\u2014the ''[[Ronald Reagan|Gipper]]''\u2014is the standard \"small\" bill. This hyperinflation was created by the government overprinting money, due to loss of tax revenues, as people increasingly began to use [[electronic currency]], exchanged in [[anonymous internet banking|encrypted online transactions]] and thus untaxable. For physical transactions, they resort to alternative currencies such as yen or \"Kongbucks\" (the official currency of Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong). Hyperinflation has also negatively affected much of the rest of the world (with some exceptions like Japan), resulting in waves of desperate refugees from Asia who cross the Pacific in rickety ships hoping to arrive in North America.\n\nThe ''[[Metaverse]]'', a phrase coined by Stephenson as a successor to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson's vision of how a [[virtual reality]]\u2013based Internet might evolve in the near future. Resembling a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO), the Metaverse is populated by user-controlled [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] as well as system [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]]. Although there are public-access Metaverse [[Computer terminal|terminals]] in ''Reality'', using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse [[denization|denizens]], in part because of the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatars]]. Status in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one's avatar.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\nHiro Protagonist is a hacker and pizza delivery driver for the Mafia. He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier ([[courier]]) who [[Illeism|refers to herself in the third person]], during a failed attempt to make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC, the for-profit organization that evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress. Within the Metaverse, Hiro is offered a datafile named Snow Crash by a man named Raven who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a bitmap image contained in the file which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research, positing connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture and the legend of [[Tower of Babel]]. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears.\n\nThe Mafia boss Uncle Enzo begins to take a paternal interest in Y.T. Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and offers her freelance jobs. Hiro's investigations and Y.T.'s intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates and a media magnate named L. Bob Rife beginning to emerge. Juanita's research showed that the ancient Sumerian [[Proto-Human language|ur-language]] allowed brain function to be 'programmed' using audio stimuli in conjunction with a DNA altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized around these programs (known as ''[[Me (mythology)|me]]'') which were administered by priests to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus (known as ''the nam-shub of Enki'') which when delivered stopped the Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and led to the development of other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel myth. L. Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed the drug Snow Crash in order to make the public vulnerable to new forms of ''me'' which he would control. The physical form of the virus is distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend Wayne's church via infected blood. There is also a digital version to which hackers are especially vulnerable as they are accustomed to processing information in binary form.\n\nHiro heads north to where the Raft, a huge collection of boats containing Eurasian refugees, is approaching the American coast. The center of the Raft is L Bob Rife's yacht, formerly the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'' nuclear-powered aircraft carrier]]. Rife has been using the Raft as a mechanism to indoctrinate and infect thousands with the virus and to import it to America. Y.T. is captured and brought to Rife on the Raft, who intends to use her as a hostage, knowing her connection to Uncle Enzo. With help from the Mafia, Hiro makes it onto the raft and recovers the ''nam-shub'' of Enki which Rife had been concealing. With help from Juanita who had previously infiltrated the Raft, the ''nam-shub'' is read out and Rife's control over the Raft is broken. Rife flees the Raft, taking Y.T., and Raven attempts to activate the digital form of Snow Crash at a virtual concert within the Metaverse. Hiro is able to neutralize the virus and Y.T. escapes. After a confrontation with the Mafia, Raven is injured, and Rife is killed as he attempts to flee on his private jet. Y.T. is reunited with her mother and Hiro and Juanita appear reconciled.\n\n== Characteristic technologies ==\nVarious technologies are employed in this fictional world, and help define it. Among these are:\n\n=== Rat Things ===\nRat Things, also known as semi-autonomous guard units, are cybernetic personal defensive guards found in and around Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong. Engineered from [[pit bull terrier]]s surgically augmented with cybernetic components, Rat Things are named for their long, flexible tails.\n\nRat Things were invented by Mr. Ng, of Ng Security Industries, who was severely handicapped after a helicopter accident in Vietnam. Like the Rat Things, Mr. Ng is also a cyborg.\n\nRat Things remember their previous lives as dogs. They can also communicate with other Rat Things by \"barking\" in the Metaverse. Although their minds are largely controlled by their implants, they can sometimes act independently of their programming. When in the Metaverse and not performing guard duties, Rat Things experience running on endless beaches, playing in the surf, eating [[steaks]] that grow on trees, and blood-drenched Frisbees floating around, waiting to be caught.\n\nLike other technology in ''Snow Crash'', Rat Things are powered by a [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|nuclear isotope battery]], which requires extensive cooling due to the massive amount of waste heat generated. The Rat Things are passively cooled by a system of [[heat sinks]] that are only effective when the Rat Thing runs fast enough to move ambient air across the fins. To prevent rapid overheating when stationary, they must remain in their hutches (effectively dog houses), where they are continuously sprayed by jets of refrigerant. Through running, Rat Things are capable of breaking the [[sound barrier]] (about 768&nbsp;mph at sea level), although this is not typically permitted by Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong's \"good neighbor\" policies due to noise reasons. Because they must be either moving at high velocities or actively cooling in their hutches, Rat Things are rarely seen by human eyes and few people know what they look like.\n\n===Smartwheels===<!-- Anchor from redirect from [Smartwheels]; caution. -->\nA fictional type of wheel used on skateboards and advanced motorcycles. They consist of small segments of contact surface mounted on telescoping spokes, allowing the wheel to take the shape of cracks, curbs, and bumps.  They have a passing mention in ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' as being used on a wheelchair belonging to a minor character.<ref>Note:Arthur C. Clarke's version of adaptive wheels are utilized by the lunar transport which shuttles Dr. Heywood Floyd to the site where the [[Tycho Magnetic Anomaly TMA-1]] was excavated on the moon.</ref>\n\n===Reason===<!-- [[Reason (weapon system)]] points here; please do not remove this section without fixing all articles linking to it. -->\nReason is a [[railgun]] in a [[rotary cannon]] configuration which fires [[depleted uranium]] [[flechette]]s. It is mounted to a large, wheeled ammunition box and is equipped with a harness for user comfort, a [[atomic battery|nuclear]] battery pack, and a water-cooled heat exchanger. The weapon, created by Ng, was still in [[beta testing]], and suffers a [[Crash (computing)|software crash]] during a battle, resulting in the death of its user. Hiro is later able to apply a [[firmware]] update, and uses it until its ammunition supply is depleted. It bears, in inscription on its nameplate, the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[Ultima Ratio Regum]]'', \"the last argument of kings\".\n\n=== Metaverse ===\n{{Main|Metaverse}}\n\nThe Metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://metaverseroadmap.org/inputs4.html#glossary\n|title=Smart, J.M., Cascio, J. and Paffendorf, J., Metaverse Roadmap Overview, 2007.\n|publisher=Accelerated Studies Foundation\n|accessdate=2010-09-23\n}}</ref> including the sum of all [[virtual world]]s, [[augmented reality]], and the internet.  The word ''metaverse'' combines the prefix \"[[meta]]\" (meaning \"beyond\") with \"[[universe]]\" and is typically used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe.<ref name=\"IEEE VW Standard Working Group\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metaversestandards.org|title=IEEE VW Standard Working Group|accessdate=2013-10-15}}</ref>\n\nStephenson's Metaverse appears to its users as an [[urban area|urban]] environment, developed along a single hundred-meter-wide road, the Street, that runs the entire 65536&nbsp;km (2<sup>16</sup> km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical [[planet]]. The virtual [[real estate]] is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real [[Association for Computing Machinery]], and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.\n\nUsers of the Metaverse gain access to it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from low-quality public terminals in booths (with the penalty of presenting a grainy [[black and white]] appearance). Stephenson also describes a [[sub-culture]] of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the Metaverse by wearing portable terminals, goggles and other equipment; they are given the sobriquet \"[[gargoyle]]s\" due to their grotesque appearance. The users of the Metaverse experience it from a [[First person (video games)|first person perspective]].\n\nWithin the Metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, \"to prevent people from walking around a mile high\". Transport within the Metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the [[monorail]] that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at [[256 (number)|256]] ''Express Ports'', located evenly at 256&nbsp;km intervals, and ''Local Ports'', one kilometer apart.\n\n== Literary significance and criticism ==\n''Snow Crash'' established Stephenson as a major science fiction writer of the 1990s.

Michaels contends that this basic idea of language as code is central to the construct of ''Snow Crash'' (\"... a good deal of ''Snow Crash''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s plot depends upon eliding the distinction between hackers and their computers, as if\u2014indeed, in the novel, just because\u2014looking at code will do to the hacker what receiving it will do to the computer\"<ref name=michaels68/>), but at the same time, trivializes the role of meaning in linguistic works.  {{bquote|The body that is infected by a virus does not become infected because it understands the virus any more than the body that does not become infected misunderstands the virus. So a world in which everything\u2014from bitmaps to blood\u2014can be understood as a \"form of speech\" is also a world in which nothing actually is ''understood'', a world in which what a speech act does is disconnected from what it means.|author=Walter Micheals|title=The shape of the signifier|page=69}}  In this respect, Stephenson's views are not shared with other contemporary writers such as [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Kathy Acker]], [[Octavia Butler]], [[Paul de Man]] and [[Richard Rorty]] (with respect to the latter's literary criticism).
