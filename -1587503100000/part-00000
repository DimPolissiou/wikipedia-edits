The expedition started moving towards Aqaba in May.  They lost three men to attacks by snakes in the [[Wadi Sirhan]] region, while Nuri Shaalan was paid 6,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]] in gold for the use of Wadi Sirhan as a base.  While in Bair, Lawrence and Auda decided to attack the rail line in the area of [[Daraa]], to convince the Turks the main Arab force was at [[Azraq, Jordan|Azrak in Sirhan]].  Finding no suitable targets that far north, Lawrence and Zaal ended up attacking the Atwi station south of [[Amman]], before returning to Bair.<ref name=\"TE\"/>{{rp|228, 263, 269\u201370, 285\u201387, 293\u201394}}\n\n===Aba al Lasan and Aqaba===\nThree Howeitat clans on Nagb el Shtar, the Dhumaniyeh, the Darausha, and the Dhiabat, aided the effort to secure the pass of Aba el Lissan, along the [[Ma'an|Maan]]\u2013Aqaba road.  The Dhumaniyeh attacked the Fuweilah [[blockhouse]] at the pass while the Arab force under Auda and Lawrence attacked the Ghadir el Haj garrison along the rail line south of Maan, destroying 10 bridges.  However, the Dhumaniyeh were unable to keep control of the pass when a Turkish relief battalion under Niaz Bey arrived, occupying Aba el Lissan.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|295\u201399, 309}}\n\nAuda personally led a charge of 50 horsemen against the Turkish troops on 2 July, while 400 camelmen under Nasir and Lawrence charged into their flank. The result was 300 Turkish casualties and only 160 prisoners, while the Arabs lost 2 dead. Lawrence was nearly killed in the action after he accidentally shot his camel in the head with his pistol. Auda was hit by 6 bullets, which destroyed his field glasses, holster, and scabbard; but left him unharmed.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|300\u201305, 664}}\n[[File:T E Lawrence and the Arab Revolt 1916 - 1918 Q59207.jpg|left|thumb|Discussing surrender terms, 5 July]]\n\nThree more Turkish posts lay ahead on the way to Aqaba: Guweira, Kethera, and Khadra.  Guweira was captured by Sheikh ibn Jad by the time Auda and Lawrence arrived, and the 120 soldiers in that Turkish garrison had become prisoners.  Kethira was taken on the night of 4 July, aided by a [[lunar eclipse]].  Khadra, at the mouth of the Itm, and its 300-man garrison surrendered on the 6th.

Auda established an advance post at Guweira with 600 of his clan, which they held for the next month and a half, enough time for the gain of Aqaba to be consolidated, even though the Ottomans were able to retake Abu al-Lissan and Fuweilah.

At [[Ismailia|Ismailia Station]], Lawrence convinced Burmester and [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Admiral Wemyss]] to send [[HMIS Dufferin|HMIS ''Dufferin'']] to Aqaba with food, bringing back the prisoners on the return trip.  Lawrence then took a train to Cairo.  In Cairo, Lawrence reported to Clayton and then [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby]], from whom Lawrence requested arms, supplies, an immediate 16,000 pounds in gold to pay debts incurred, and a further 200,000 [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to support his plans to threaten communications with Jerusalem. Allenby promised Lawrence to do what he could, and subsequently told [[Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet|Robertson]], \"...even the partial success of Captain Lawrence's scheme would seriously disorganize Turkish railway communications south of Aleppo, while its complete success would destroy effectively his only main artery of communication...\"<ref name=Neil/>{{rp|280}}<ref name=TE/>{{rp|315\u201321}}\n\nAqaba became a major Royal Navy depot, supplying and transporting Feisal's forces upon his arrival on 23 August, as HMS ''[[HMS Euryalus (1901)|Euryalus]]'' and then HMS ''[[HMS Humber (1913)|Humber]]'' guarded the port.
