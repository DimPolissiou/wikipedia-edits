Mainly, it is seen in commercial egg layers whereby contaminated egg trays are often reused. The virus can survive both inside the eggs and on the eggshell. The virus can migrate from the eggshell to the tray and back to the other eggs placed in the same tray.

Bonnie Sue and Haldeman had a son together named Roger, who was born in 1966.\n\nKoresh described his early childhood as lonely.<ref name=\"wilson\" /> Due to his poor study skills and [[dyslexia]], he was put in [[special education]] classes and nicknamed \"Vernie\" by his fellow students.<ref>[http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=264991&airingid=266793 Final 24 Episode on David Koresh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221211632/http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=264991&airingid=266793 |date=December 21, 2008 }}.</ref> Koresh dropped out of [[Garland High School]] in his junior year.\n\nWhen he was 19 years old, Koresh had an [[statutory rape|illegal sexual relationship]] with a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant.<ref name=\"wilson\" /> He claimed to have become a [[born-again Christian]] in the [[Southern Baptist Church]] and soon joined his mother's church, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. There he became infatuated with the pastor's daughter and, while praying for guidance, he opened his eyes and allegedly found the [[Bible]] open at [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah 34:16]], stating that \"none should want for her mate\"; convinced this was a sign from God, he approached the pastor and told him that God wanted him to have his daughter for a wife. The pastor threw him out, and when he continued to persist with his pursuit of the daughter, he was expelled from the congregation.<ref name=\"wilson\" />\n\nIn 1981, Koresh moved to [[Waco, Texas]], where he joined the [[Branch Davidians]] (not to be confused with the original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist group). [[Benjamin Roden]], who died in 1978, originated the Branch group in 1955 with new teachings that were not connected with the original Davidians. Koresh played guitar and sang in church services at the [[Mount Carmel Center]], the sect's headquarters outside Waco.\n\n==Ascent to leadership of the Branch Davidians==\nIn 1983, Koresh began claiming the gift of [[prophecy]]. It is speculated by David Thibodeau in his 1999 book, ''A Place Called Waco'', that he had a sexual relationship with [[Lois Roden]], the widow of Benjamin Roden and leader of the cult, who was then <!-- Born August 1916. -->in her late-sixties, with Koresh eventually claiming that God had chosen him to father a child with her, who would be the [[Messiah|Chosen One]].<ref name=\"wilson\"/> In 1983, Lois allowed Koresh to begin teaching his own message, called \"The Serpent's Root,\" which caused controversy in the group. Lois's son [[George Roden]] intended to be the cult's next leader and considered Koresh an interloper.\n\nWhen Koresh announced that God had instructed him to marry Rachel Jones (who then added Koresh to her name), there was a short period of calm at the Mount Carmel Center, but it proved only temporary. In the ensuing power struggle, George Roden claimed to have the support of the majority of the cult, forcing Koresh and his group off the property at gunpoint. Koresh and around 25 followers set up camp at [[Palestine, Texas]], {{convert|90|miles|km}} from Waco, where they lived under rough conditions in buses and tents for the next two years. During this time, Koresh undertook recruitment of new followers in [[California]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], and [[Australia]]. That same year he traveled to Israel, where he claimed he had a vision that he was the modern-day [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].\n\nThe founder of the Davidian movement, [[Victor Houteff]], wanted to be God's implement and establish the Davidic kingdom in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Koresh also wanted to be God's tool and set up the Davidic kingdom in [[Jerusalem]]. At least until 1990, he believed the place of his martyrdom might be in Israel, but by 1991 he was convinced that his martyrdom would be in the U.S. Instead of Israel, he said the prophecies of Daniel would be fulfilled in Waco and that the Mount Carmel Center was the Davidic kingdom.<ref name=\"valentine\">{{Citation| surname=Valentine| given=Carol A.| title=David Koresh and The Cuckoo's Egg \u2013 pt. 3| year=2001| url=http://www.public-action.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/page/b_kce3.html}}</ref>\n\nAfter being exiled to the Palestine camp, Koresh and his followers eked out a primitive existence. When Lois died in 1986, the exiled Branch Davidians wondered if they would ever be able to return to the Mount Carmel Center. But despite the displacement, \"Koresh now enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the [Branch Davidian] community\".<ref>David G. Bromley and Edward D. Silver, \"The Davidian Tradition: From Patronal Clan to Prophetic Movement,\" p.54 in Stuart A. Wright, Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995)</ref> By late 1987, Roden's support was in steep decline. To regain it, he challenged Koresh to a contest to raise the dead, going so far as to exhume a corpse to demonstrate his spiritual supremacy. Koresh went to authorities to file charges against Roden for illegally exhuming a corpse, but was told he would have to show proof (such as a photograph of the corpse).\n\nKoresh seized the opportunity to seek criminal [[prosecution]] of Roden by returning to the Mount Carmel Center with seven armed followers, allegedly attempting to get photographic proof of the crime. Koresh's group was discovered by Roden and a gunfight broke out. When the sheriff arrived, Roden had already suffered a minor gunshot wound and was pinned down behind a tree. As a result of the incident, Koresh and his followers were charged with [[attempted murder]]. At the trial, Koresh explained that he went to the Mount Carmel Center to uncover evidence of criminal disturbance of a corpse by Roden. Koresh's followers were [[acquittal|acquitted]], and in Koresh's case a [[Trial (law)|mistrial]] was declared.\n\nIn 1989, Roden murdered Wayman Dale Adair with an [[axe]] blow to the skull after Adair stated his belief that he (Adair) was the true messiah.<ref>Marc Breault and Martin King, ''Inside the Cult'', Signet, 1st Printing June 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-451-18029-2}}.

Since Roden owed thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes on the Mount Carmel Center, Koresh and his followers were able to raise the money and reclaim the property. Roden continued to harass the Koresh faction by [[vexatious litigation|filing legal papers]] while imprisoned. When Koresh and his followers reclaimed the Mount Carmel Center, they discovered that tenants who had rented from Roden had left behind a [[methamphetamine]] laboratory, which Koresh reported to the local police department and asked to have removed.<ref name=\"thibodeau\">{{Citation| surname=Thibodeau| given=David| title=The truth about Waco| year=1999| url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/09/09/waco/}}</ref><ref name=\"lujan\">Thomas R.

His first name, David, symbolized a lineage directly to the biblical [[King David]], from whom the new messiah would descend. By taking the name of David Koresh, he was \"professing himself to be the spiritual descendant of King David, a messianic figure carrying out a divinely commissioned errand.\"<ref>Bromley and Silver, p.57</ref>\n\n==Allegations of child abuse and statutory rape==\nKoresh was alleged to be involved in multiple incidents of [[child abuse]] and child [[sexual abuse]].<ref>See Christopher G.

The underage girl was Michelle Jones, the younger sister of Koresh's legal wife Rachel and the daughter of lifelong Branch Davidians Perry and Mary Belle Jones. \n\nA six-month investigation of child abuse allegations by the Texas Child Protection Services in 1992 failed to turn up any evidence, possibly because the Branch Davidians concealed the spiritual marriage of Koresh to Michelle, assigning a surrogate husband (David Thibodeau) to the girl for the sake of appearances.<ref>David Thibodeau and Leon Whiteson, A Place Called Waco: A Survivor's Story (New York: Public Affairs, 1999)</ref>\n\nRegarding the allegations of child abuse, the evidence is less certain. In one widely reported incident, ex-members claimed that Koresh became irritated with the cries of his son Cyrus and spanked the child severely for several minutes on three consecutive visits to the child's bedroom. In a second report, a man involved in a custody battle visited the Mount Carmel Center and claimed to have seen the beating of a young boy with a stick.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nFinally, the FBI's justification for forcing an end to the 51-day standoff was predicated on the charge that Koresh was abusing children inside the Mount Carmel Center.  There were allegations he had fathered children with under-age girls in his cult. In hours following the deadly conflagration, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] told reporters that, \"We had specific information that babies were being beaten.\"<ref>Sam Howe Verovek, \"In Shadow of Texas Siege, Uncertainty for Innocents.\" New York Times, 1993, March 8</ref> However, [[FBI Director]] [[William Sessions]] publicly denied the charge and told reporters that they had no such information about child abuse inside the Mount Carmel Center.<ref>Stephen Labaton, \"Confusion Abounds in the Capital on Rationale for Assault on Cult,\" New York Times, 1993, April 21</ref> A careful examination of the other child abuse charges found the evidence to be weak and ambiguous, casting doubt on the allegations.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 1995</ref>\n\nThe allegations of child abuse stem largely from detractors and ex-members.<ref>John R.

Wright (ed.), Armageddon in Waco</ref> The 1993 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report cites allegations of child [[child sexual abuse|sexual]] and [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse. Legal scholars point out that the ATF had no legal jurisdiction in the matter of child protection and it appears that these accounts were inserted by the ATF to inflame the case against Koresh. For example, the account of former Branch Davidian Jeannine Bunds is reproduced in the affidavit. She claimed that Koresh had fathered at least fifteen children with various women and girls and that she had personally delivered seven of these infants. Bunds also claims that Koresh would annul all marriages of couples who joined the group and had exclusive sexual access to the women and girls.<ref name=\"dpmt_justice\">{{Citation |surname=U.S. Department of Justice |year=1993 |chapter=Evidence of Historical Child Sexual and Physical Abuse |title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas February 28 to April 19, 1993 (From ATF Affidavit in Support of Arrest of Koresh, taken from ATF Special Agent Aguilera's interview of former compound resident Jeannine Bunds, included in Agent Aguilera's affidavit in support of the Koresh arrest warrant \"Davy Aguilera, Special Agent Bureau of ATF, Subscribed and sworn to before me this 25th day of February 1993 Dennis G.

The ensuing gun battle resulted in the deaths of four agents and six Branch Davidians. Shortly after the initial raid, the [[FBI]] [[Hostage Rescue Team]] took command of the federal operation, because the FBI has jurisdiction over incidents involving the deaths of federal agents. The negotiating team established contact with Koresh inside the compound. Communication over the next 51 days included telephone exchanges with various FBI negotiators.\n\nKoresh himself had been seriously injured by a gunshot. As the standoff continued, Koresh and his closest male leaders negotiated delays, possibly so that he could write religious documents he said he needed to complete before he surrendered. His conversations with the negotiators were dense and included biblical imagery. The federal negotiators treated the situation as a hostage crisis.\n\nThe siege of Mount Carmel Center ended 51 days later on April 19, 1993, when U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] approved recommendations of FBI officials to proceed with a final advance in which the Branch Davidians were to be removed from their building by force. In an attempt to flush Koresh from the stronghold, the FBI resorted to pumping [[CS gas]] from a [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]] with battering ram into the compound.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://libertyunderfire.org/2013/04/remembering-waco-and-the-branch-davidian-church-twenty-years-latter/|title=Remembering Waco and the Branch Davidian Church 20 years later.|date=April 30, 2013|newspaper=Liberty Under Fire|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the advance on the compound, the church building caught fire in circumstances that are still disputed.

There he became infatuated with the pastor's daughter and, while praying for guidance, he opened his eyes and allegedly found the [[Bible]] open at [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah 34:16]], stating that \"none should want for her mate\"; convinced this was a sign from God, he approached the pastor and told him that God wanted him to have his daughter for a wife. The pastor threw him out, and when he continued to persist with his pursuit of the daughter, he was expelled from the congregation.<ref name=\"wilson\" />\n\nIn 1981, Koresh moved to [[Waco, Texas]], where he joined the [[Branch Davidians]] (not to be confused with the original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist group). [[Benjamin Roden]], who died in 1978, originated the Branch group in 1955 with new teachings that were not connected with the original Davidians. Koresh played guitar and sang in church services at the [[Mount Carmel Center]], the sect's headquarters outside Waco.\n\n==Ascent to leadership of the Branch Davidians==\nIn 1983, Koresh began claiming the gift of [[prophecy]]. It is speculated by David Thibodeau in his 1999 book, ''A Place Called Waco'', that he had a sexual relationship with [[Lois Roden]], the widow of Benjamin Roden and leader of the cult, who was then <!-- Born August 1916. -->in her late-sixties, with Koresh eventually claiming that God had chosen him to father a child with her, who would be the [[Messiah|Chosen One]].<ref name=\"wilson\"/> In 1983, Lois allowed Koresh to begin teaching his own message, called \"The Serpent's Root,\" which caused controversy in the group. Lois's son [[George Roden]] intended to be the cult's next leader and considered Koresh an interloper.\n\nWhen Koresh announced that God had instructed him to marry Rachel Jones (who then added Koresh to her name), there was a short period of calm at the Mount Carmel Center, but it proved only temporary. In the ensuing power struggle, George Roden claimed to have the support of the majority of the cult, forcing Koresh and his group off the property at gunpoint. Koresh and around 25 followers set up camp at [[Palestine, Texas]], {{convert|90|miles|km}} from Waco, where they lived under rough conditions in buses and tents for the next two years. During this time, Koresh undertook recruitment of new followers in [[California]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], and [[Australia]]. That same year he traveled to Israel, where he claimed he had a vision that he was the modern-day [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].\n\nThe founder of the Davidian movement, [[Victor Houteff]], wanted to be God's implement and establish the Davidic kingdom in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Koresh also wanted to be God's tool and set up the Davidic kingdom in [[Jerusalem]]. At least until 1990, he believed the place of his martyrdom might be in Israel, but by 1991 he was convinced that his martyrdom would be in the U.S. Instead of Israel, he said the prophecies of Daniel would be fulfilled in Waco and that the Mount Carmel Center was the Davidic kingdom.<ref name=\"valentine\">{{Citation| surname=Valentine| given=Carol A.| title=David Koresh and The Cuckoo's Egg \u2013 pt. 3| year=2001| url=http://www.public-action.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/page/b_kce3.html}}</ref>\n\nAfter being exiled to the Palestine camp, Koresh and his followers eked out a primitive existence. When Lois died in 1986, the exiled Branch Davidians wondered if they would ever be able to return to the Mount Carmel Center. But despite the displacement, \"Koresh now enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the [Branch Davidian] community\".<ref>David G. Bromley and Edward D. Silver, \"The Davidian Tradition: From Patronal Clan to Prophetic Movement,\" p.54 in Stuart A. Wright, Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995)</ref> By late 1987, Roden's support was in steep decline. To regain it, he challenged Koresh to a contest to raise the dead, going so far as to exhume a corpse to demonstrate his spiritual supremacy. Koresh went to authorities to file charges against Roden for illegally exhuming a corpse, but was told he would have to show proof (such as a photograph of the corpse).\n\nKoresh seized the opportunity to seek criminal [[prosecution]] of Roden by returning to the Mount Carmel Center with seven armed followers, allegedly attempting to get photographic proof of the crime. Koresh's group was discovered by Roden and a gunfight broke out. When the sheriff arrived, Roden had already suffered a minor gunshot wound and was pinned down behind a tree. As a result of the incident, Koresh and his followers were charged with [[attempted murder]]. At the trial, Koresh explained that he went to the Mount Carmel Center to uncover evidence of criminal disturbance of a corpse by Roden. Koresh's followers were [[acquittal|acquitted]], and in Koresh's case a [[Trial (law)|mistrial]] was declared.\n\nIn 1989, Roden murdered Wayman Dale Adair with an [[axe]] blow to the skull after Adair stated his belief that he (Adair) was the true messiah.<ref>Marc Breault and Martin King, ''Inside the Cult'', Signet, 1st Printing June 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-451-18029-2}}.

Since Roden owed thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes on the Mount Carmel Center, Koresh and his followers were able to raise the money and reclaim the property. Roden continued to harass the Koresh faction by [[vexatious litigation|filing legal papers]] while imprisoned. When Koresh and his followers reclaimed the Mount Carmel Center, they discovered that tenants who had rented from Roden had left behind a [[methamphetamine]] laboratory, which Koresh reported to the local police department and asked to have removed.<ref name=\"thibodeau\">{{Citation| surname=Thibodeau| given=David| title=The truth about Waco| year=1999| url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/09/09/waco/}}</ref><ref name=\"lujan\">Thomas R.

His first name, David, symbolized a lineage directly to the biblical [[King David]], from whom the new messiah would descend. By taking the name of David Koresh, he was \"professing himself to be the spiritual descendant of King David, a messianic figure carrying out a divinely commissioned errand.\"<ref>Bromley and Silver, p.57</ref>\n\n==Allegations of child abuse and statutory rape==\nKoresh was alleged to be involved in multiple incidents of [[child abuse]] and child [[sexual abuse]].<ref>See Christopher G.

The underage girl was Michelle Jones, the younger sister of Koresh's legal wife Rachel and the daughter of lifelong Branch Davidians Perry and Mary Belle Jones. \n\nA six-month investigation of child abuse allegations by the Texas Child Protection Services in 1992 failed to turn up any evidence, possibly because the Branch Davidians concealed the spiritual marriage of Koresh to Michelle, assigning a surrogate husband (David Thibodeau) to the girl for the sake of appearances.<ref>David Thibodeau and Leon Whiteson, A Place Called Waco: A Survivor's Story (New York: Public Affairs, 1999)</ref>\n\nRegarding the allegations of child abuse, the evidence is less certain. In one widely reported incident, ex-members claimed that Koresh became irritated with the cries of his son Cyrus and spanked the child severely for several minutes on three consecutive visits to the child's bedroom. In a second report, a man involved in a custody battle visited the Mount Carmel Center and claimed to have seen the beating of a young boy with a stick.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nFinally, the FBI's justification for forcing an end to the 51-day standoff was predicated on the charge that Koresh was abusing children inside the Mount Carmel Center.  There were allegations he had fathered children with under-age girls in his cult. In hours following the deadly conflagration, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] told reporters that, \"We had specific information that babies were being beaten.\"<ref>Sam Howe Verovek, \"In Shadow of Texas Siege, Uncertainty for Innocents.\" New York Times, 1993, March 8</ref> However, [[FBI Director]] [[William Sessions]] publicly denied the charge and told reporters that they had no such information about child abuse inside the Mount Carmel Center.<ref>Stephen Labaton, \"Confusion Abounds in the Capital on Rationale for Assault on Cult,\" New York Times, 1993, April 21</ref> A careful examination of the other child abuse charges found the evidence to be weak and ambiguous, casting doubt on the allegations.<ref>Ellison and Bartkowski, 1995</ref>\n\nThe allegations of child abuse stem largely from detractors and ex-members.<ref>John R. Hall, \"Public Narratives and the Apocalyptic Sect,\" pp.205\u2013235 in Stuart A. Wright (ed.), Armageddon in Waco (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1995); Stuart A.

Legal scholars point out that the ATF had no legal jurisdiction in the matter of child protection and it appears that these accounts were inserted by the ATF to inflame the case against Koresh. For example, the account of former Branch Davidian Jeannine Bunds is reproduced in the affidavit.

The ensuing gun battle resulted in the deaths of four agents and six Branch Davidians. Shortly after the initial raid, the [[FBI]] [[Hostage Rescue Team]] took command of the federal operation, because the FBI has jurisdiction over incidents involving the deaths of federal agents. The negotiating team established contact with Koresh inside the compound. Communication over the next 51 days included telephone exchanges with various FBI negotiators.\n\nKoresh himself had been seriously injured by a gunshot. As the standoff continued, Koresh and his closest male leaders negotiated delays, possibly so that he could write religious documents he said he needed to complete before he surrendered. His conversations with the negotiators were dense and included biblical imagery. The federal negotiators treated the situation as a hostage crisis.\n\nThe siege of Mount Carmel Center ended 51 days later on April 19, 1993, when U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] approved recommendations of FBI officials to proceed with a final advance in which the Branch Davidians were to be removed from their building by force. In an attempt to flush Koresh from the stronghold, the FBI resorted to pumping [[CS gas]] from a [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]] with battering ram into the compound.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://libertyunderfire.org/2013/04/remembering-waco-and-the-branch-davidian-church-twenty-years-latter/|title=Remembering Waco and the Branch Davidian Church 20 years later.|date=April 30, 2013|newspaper=Liberty Under Fire|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the advance on the compound, the church building caught fire in circumstances that are still disputed.

Around the same time, [[Rigvedic tribes|Indo-Aryan tribes]] moved into the [[Punjab]] from regions further northwest in several [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|waves of migration]].  The resulting [[Vedic Period|Vedic period]] was marked by the composition of the [[Vedas]], large collections of hymns of these tribes whose postulated religious culture, through synthesis with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, gave rise to [[Hinduism]]. The [[Caste system of India|caste system]], which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose later during this period. Towards the end of the period, around 600 BCE, after the pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain, large swaths of which they deforested to pave way for agriculture,  a second urbanisation took place. The small Indo-Aryan chieftaincies, or [[janapada]]s, were consolidated into larger states, or [[mahajanapadas]]. This urbanisation was accompanied by the rise of new [[\u015arama\u1e47a|ascetic]] movements, including [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], which challenged the primacy of rituals, presided by Brahmin priests, that had come to be associated with Vedic religion,<ref name=\"Flood 1996 82\"/> and gave rise to new religious concepts.<ref>Flood, Gavin.

During this period, aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Middle East and the [[Mediterranean]].

The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of [[Brahmi]] and was used to write the [[Sanskrit language]]. The Shunga Empire played an imperative role in patronising [[Indian culture]] at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.

The territory of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The S\u0101tav\u0101hanas started out as feudatories to the [[Mauryan dynasty]], but declared independence with its decline.\n\nThe S\u0101tav\u0101hanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted in Buddhist monuments from [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) to [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]]. They were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] to the southern tip of India.\n\nThey had to compete with the [[Shunga Empire]] and then the [[Kanva dynasty]] of [[Magadha]] to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaders like the [[Sakas]], [[Yavanas]] and [[Pahlavas]]. In particular, their struggles with the [[Western Kshatrapas]] went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] and [[Sri Yajna S\u0101takarni]] were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the [[Western Kshatrapas]] and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states.\n\n====Trade and travels to India====\n{{Further|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}\n[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silk Road]] and [[Spice trade]], ancient trade routes that linked India with the [[Old World]]; carried goods and ideas between the ancient civilisations of the Old World and India.

The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of [[Urdu]] was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the intermingling of the local speakers of Sanskritic [[Prakrit]]s with immigrants speaking [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] under the Muslim rulers. The Delhi Sultanate is the only Indo-Islamic empire to enthrone one of the few female rulers in India, [[Razia Sultana]] (1236\u20131240).\n\nDuring the Delhi Sultanate, there was a synthesis between Indian civilization and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. The latter was a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] civilization, with a [[multicultural]] and [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] society, and wide-ranging international networks, including social and economic networks, spanning large parts of [[Afro-Eurasia]], leading to escalating circulation of goods, peoples, technologies and ideas. While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp=50\u201352}} However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=re2000>Richard Eaton (2000), [http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/3/283.extract Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States], Journal of Islamic Studies, 11(3), pp. 283\u2013319</ref>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasions of India]] were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate. A major factor in their success was their Turkic [[Mamluk]] slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic [[cavalry]] warfare as the [[Mongols]], as a result of having similar [[nomad]]ic Central Asian roots.

The Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], [[Bharatpur State|Jats]] and [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]]. In 1737, the Maratha general [[Bajirao]] of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao, however, easily routed the novice Mughal general and the rest of the imperial Mughal army fled. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army. This essentially brought an end to the Mughal Empire.

After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company. The hard-fought [[First Anglo-Sikh War|first Anglo-Sikh war]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|second Anglo-Sikh war]] marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire, making it among the last areas of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British.\n\n====Other kingdoms====\nThe [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in southern India expanded to its greatest extent under [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]] in the later half of the 18th century. Under their rule, Mysore fought series of wars against the Marathas and British or their combined forces. The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] ended in April 1787, following the finalizing of ''treaty of Gajendragad'', in which, Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] took place, where the Mysoreans used the [[Mysorean rockets]]. The [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1798\u20131799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)]].\n\nHyderabad was founded by the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] of [[Golconda]] in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad]] in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the [[Battle of Palkhed]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ga-pmgxsWwoC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=Bajirao+I#v=onepage&q=Bajirao%20I ''History Modern India'' By S.N.

It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Masulipatnam]] on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and the grant of the rights to establish a factory in [[Surat]] in 1612 by the Mughal emperor Jahangir.  In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara ruler]] farther south, a second factory was established in [[Madras]] on the southeastern coast. [[Bombay]] island, not far from Surat, a former Portuguese outpost gifted to [[Kingdom of England|England]] as [[dowry]] in the marriage of [[Catherine of Braganza]] to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was leased by the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the Company established a presence on the eastern coast as well; far up that coast, in the [[Ganges River]] delta, a factory was set up in Calcutta. Since, during this time other ''companies''\u2014established by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[French East India Company|French]], and [[Danish East India Company|Danish]]\u2014were similarly expanding in the region, the English Company's unremarkable beginnings on [[coastal India]] offered no clues to what would become a lengthy presence on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Company's victory under [[Robert Clive]] in the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]] and another victory in the 1764 [[Battle of Buxar]] (in Bihar), consolidated the Company's power, and forced emperor [[Shah Alam II]] to appoint it the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'', or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and [[Odisha|Orissa]].  The Company thus became the ''de facto'' ruler of large areas of the [[Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests|lower Gangetic plain]] by 1773.  It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1766\u201399) and the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] (1772\u20131818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the [[Sutlej River]]. With the defeat of the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], no native power represented a threat for the Company any longer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Markovits|2004|pp=271\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the Company's power chiefly took two forms.  The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions, which collectively came to comprise [[British India]].  The annexed regions included the [[North-Western Provinces]] (comprising [[Rohilkhand]], [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], and the [[Doab]]) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam ([[Ahom Kingdom]] 1828), and [[Sindh]] (1843). [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]], and [[Kashmir]], were annexed after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]] in 1849\u201356 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General); however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] (1850) to the [[Dogra Dynasty]] of [[Jammu]], and thereby became a princely state. In 1854 [[Berar Province|Berar]] was annexed, and the state of [[Oudh State|Oudh]] two years later.<ref name=\"ludden-expansion\"/>\n\n{{Gallery|align=center\n|width=180 |lines=5\n|File:Warren_Hastings_greyscale.jpg|[[Warren Hastings]], the first Governor-General of [[Bengal Presidency|Fort William (Bengal)]] who oversaw the Company's territories in India.\n|File:India 1835 2 Mohurs.jpg|Gold coin, minted 1835, with obverse showing the bust of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], king of United Kingdom from 21 August 1765 to 20 June 1837, and reverse marked \"Two [[mohur]]s\" in English (do [[ashrafi]] in [[Urdu]]) issued during [[Company rule in India]]\n|File:Railway bridge bhor ghaut incline1855.jpg|Photograph (1855) showing the construction of the Bhor Ghaut incline bridge, Bombay; the incline was conceived by George Clark, the Chief Engineer in the East India Company's Government of Bombay.\n|File:Ganges canal roorkee1860.jpg|Watercolor (1863) titled, \"The [[Ganges Canal]], [[Roorkee]], [[Saharanpur District]] ([[Uttar Pradesh|U.P.]]).\" The canal was the brainchild of [[Proby Cautley|Sir Proby Cautley]]; construction began in 1840, and the canal was opened by Governor-General Lord Dalhousie in April 1854\n}}\n\nThe second form of asserting power involved treaties in which Indian rulers acknowledged the Company's [[hegemony]] in return for limited internal [[autonomy]]. Since the Company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up ''political'' underpinnings for its rule.<ref name=\"brown-p67\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=67}}</ref> The most important such support came from the ''[[subsidiary alliance]]s'' with Indian princes during the first 75 years of Company rule.<ref name=\"brown-p67\"/> In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India.<ref name=\"brown-p67\"/> When an Indian ruler, who was able to secure his territory, wanted to enter such an alliance, the Company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule, which did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects.<ref name=\"brown-68\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=68}}</ref>\n\nIn return, the Company undertook the \"defense of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor.\"<ref name=\"brown-68\" /> Subsidiary alliances created the [[Princely States|princely states]], of the Hindu [[maharaja]]s and the Muslim [[nawab]]s.  Prominent among the princely states were: [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] (1791), [[Jaipur State|Jaipur]] (1794), [[Travancore]] (1795), [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (1798), [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] (1799), [[Cis-Sutlej states|Cis-Sutlej Hill States]] (1815), [[Central India Agency]] (1819), [[Cutch State|Cutch]] and [[Baroda State|Gujarat Gaikwad territories]] (1819), [[Rajputana]] (1818), and [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] (1833).<ref name=\"ludden-expansion\">{{Harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=133}}</ref>\n<!--The East India Company also concluded treaties with various Afghan rulers and with [[Ranjit Singh]] of the Punjab, to counterbalance Russia's support of [[Iran|Persian]] plans in western [[Afghanistan]].

It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of large [[Indian diaspora]], which spread from the Indian Ocean (i.e. [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]) to Pacific Ocean (i.e. [[Fiji]]), as well as the growth of [[Indo-Caribbean]] and [[Indo-African]] population.\n\n==Modern period and independence (after c. 1850 CE)==\n===Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences===\n{{Main|Indian rebellion of 1857}}\n{{Gallery|align=center\n|width=140|lines=4\n|File:Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning - Project Gutenberg eText 16528.jpg|[[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Charles Canning]], the [[Governor-General of India]] during the rebellion.\n|File:Dalhousie.jpg|[[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\n|File:Rani of jhansi.jpg|[[Rani of Jhansi|Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi]], one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\n|File:Bahadur Shah II of India.jpg|[[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\n}}\nThe Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the Company's rule. The spark that led to the mutiny was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the [[Enfield rifle]], which was insensitive to local religious prohibition; key mutineer being [[Mangal Pandey]].<ref name=\"Saul David page 70\">Saul David, p. 70, ''The Indian Mutiny'', Penguin Books 2003</ref> In addition, the underlying grievances over British taxation, the ethnic gulf between the British officers and their Indian troops, and land annexations played a significant role in the rebellion. Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], and felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=91}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the mutiny in [[Meerut]], the rebels very quickly reached [[Delhi]]. The rebels had also captured large tracts of the [[North-Western Provinces]] and [[Awadh]] (Oudh). Most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British presence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=177}}, {{Harvnb|Bayly|2000|p=357}}</ref> However, the British East India Company mobilised rapidly, with the assistance of friendly [[Princely states]]. But, it took the British remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 to suppress the rebellion. Due to the rebels being poorly equipped and no outside support or funding, they were brutally subdued by the British.<ref>Christopher Hibbert, ''The Great Mutiny: India 1857'' (1980)</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the [[British Crown]], which began to administer most of India as a number of provinces. The Crown controlled the Company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947\u201348.<ref>{{Citation |first=Wilhelm von |last=Pochhammer |title=India's road to nationhood: a political history of the subcontinent |publisher=Allied Publishers |year=1981 |isbn=978-81-7764-715-0 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===British Raj (1858\u20131947)===\n{{main|British Raj}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| title = British Raj\n| image1 = British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|caption1=The British Indian Empire in 1909.

The [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Morley-Minto reforms of 1909]] provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy's executive council.

The mutinies were rapidly suppressed.

Around the same time, [[Rigvedic tribes|Indo-Aryan tribes]] moved into the [[Punjab]] from regions further northwest in several [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|waves of migration]].  The resulting [[Vedic Period|Vedic period]] was marked by the composition of the [[Vedas]], large collections of hymns of these tribes whose postulated religious culture, through synthesis with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, gave rise to [[Hinduism]]. The [[Caste system of India|caste system]], which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose later during this period. Towards the end of the period, around 600 BCE, after the pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain, large swaths of which they deforested to pave way for agriculture,  a second urbanisation took place. The small Indo-Aryan chieftaincies, or [[janapada]]s, were consolidated into larger states, or [[mahajanapadas]]. This urbanisation was accompanied by the rise of new [[\u015arama\u1e47a|ascetic]] movements, including [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], which challenged the primacy of rituals, presided by Brahmin priests, that had come to be associated with Vedic religion,<ref name=\"Flood 1996 82\"/> and gave rise to new religious concepts.<ref>Flood, Gavin.

This period, witnessing a [[Hindu]] religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or \"[[Golden Age of India]]\". During this period, aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Middle East and the [[Mediterranean]]. Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of [[Southeast Asia]], which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in Southeast Asia ([[Greater India]]).<ref>''The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia: From Early Times to c. 1800'', Band 1 by [[Nicholas Tarling]], p. 281</ref><ref name=\"Flood, Gavin 2003. pg. 273-4\">Flood, Gavin.

However, the region of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] (around modern day [[Odisha]]) remained outside Mauryan control, perhaps interfering with their trade with the south.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\n[[File:Lomas_Rishi_entrance.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Mauryan carved door of [[Lomas Rishi cave|Lomas Rishi]], one of the [[Barabar Caves]], c. 250 BCE.]]\nBindusara was succeeded by [[Ashoka]], whose reign lasted for around 37 years until his death in about 232&nbsp;BCE.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|pp=204\u2013206}} His campaign against the Kalingans in about 260&nbsp;BCE, though successful, led to immense loss of life and misery.

Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of [[Jainism]] increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of India.

The Shunga rulers helped to establish the tradition of royal sponsorship of learning and art. The script used by the empire was a variant of [[Brahmi]] and was used to write the [[Sanskrit language]]. The Shunga Empire played an imperative role in patronising [[Indian culture]] at a time when some of the most important developments in Hindu thought were taking place.

The territory of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The S\u0101tav\u0101hanas started out as feudatories to the [[Mauryan dynasty]], but declared independence with its decline.\n\nThe S\u0101tav\u0101hanas are known for their patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism, which resulted in Buddhist monuments from [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) to [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]]. They were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] to the southern tip of India.\n\nThey had to compete with the [[Shunga Empire]] and then the [[Kanva dynasty]] of [[Magadha]] to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect large part of India against foreign invaders like the [[Sakas]], [[Yavanas]] and [[Pahlavas]]. In particular, their struggles with the [[Western Kshatrapas]] went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] and [[Sri Yajna S\u0101takarni]] were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the [[Western Kshatrapas]] and to stop their expansion.

The military exploits of the first three rulers \u2013 [[Chandragupta I]], [[Samudragupta]], and [[Chandragupta II]] \u2013 brought much of India under their leadership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thestoryofindia/gallery/photos/8.html |title=The Story of India&nbsp;\u2013 Photo Gallery |publisher=PBS |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref> Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era.

The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing. It is surmised that the language of [[Urdu]] was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the intermingling of the local speakers of Sanskritic [[Prakrit]]s with immigrants speaking [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] under the Muslim rulers.

While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp=50\u201352}} However, the Delhi Sultanate also caused large-scale destruction and desecration of temples in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=re2000>Richard Eaton (2000), [http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/3/283.extract Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States], Journal of Islamic Studies, 11(3), pp. 283\u2013319</ref>\n\nThe [[Mongol invasions of India]] were successfully repelled by the Delhi Sultanate. A major factor in their success was their Turkic [[Mamluk]] slave army, who were highly skilled in the same style of nomadic [[cavalry]] warfare as the [[Mongols]], as a result of having similar [[nomad]]ic Central Asian roots.

The Mughals suffered several blows due to invasions from [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], [[Bharatpur State|Jats]] and [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]]. In 1737, the Maratha general [[Bajirao]] of the Maratha Empire invaded and plundered Delhi. Under the general Amir Khan Umrao Al Udat, the Mughal Emperor sent 8,000 troops to drive away the 5,000 Maratha cavalry soldiers. Baji Rao, however, easily routed the novice Mughal general and the rest of the imperial Mughal army fled. In 1737, in the final defeat of Mughal Empire, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army, Nizam-ul-mulk, was routed at Bhopal by the Maratha army.

After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire weakened, leading to conflict with the British East India Company.

The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] ended in April 1787, following the finalizing of ''treaty of Gajendragad'', in which, Tipu Sultan was obligated to pay tribute to the Marathas. Concurrently, the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] took place, where the Mysoreans used the [[Mysorean rockets]]. The [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1798\u20131799) saw the death of Tipu. Mysore's alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the British East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)]].\n\nHyderabad was founded by the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] of [[Golconda]] in 1591. Following a brief Mughal rule, Asif Jah, a Mughal official, seized control of Hyderabad and declared himself [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam-al-Mulk of Hyderabad]] in 1724. The Nizams lost considerable territory and paid tribute to the Maratha Empire after being routed in multiple battles, such as the [[Battle of Palkhed]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ga-pmgxsWwoC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=Bajirao+I#v=onepage&q=Bajirao%20I ''History Modern India'' By S.N.

It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Masulipatnam]] on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and the grant of the rights to establish a factory in [[Surat]] in 1612 by the Mughal emperor Jahangir.  In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara ruler]] farther south, a second factory was established in [[Madras]] on the southeastern coast. [[Bombay]] island, not far from Surat, a former Portuguese outpost gifted to [[Kingdom of England|England]] as [[dowry]] in the marriage of [[Catherine of Braganza]] to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was leased by the Company in 1668. Two decades later, the Company established a presence on the eastern coast as well; far up that coast, in the [[Ganges River]] delta, a factory was set up in Calcutta. Since, during this time other ''companies''\u2014established by the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[French East India Company|French]], and [[Danish East India Company|Danish]]\u2014were similarly expanding in the region, the English Company's unremarkable beginnings on [[coastal India]] offered no clues to what would become a lengthy presence on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Company's victory under [[Robert Clive]] in the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]] and another victory in the 1764 [[Battle of Buxar]] (in Bihar), consolidated the Company's power, and forced emperor [[Shah Alam II]] to appoint it the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'', or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and [[Odisha|Orissa]].  The Company thus became the ''de facto'' ruler of large areas of the [[Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests|lower Gangetic plain]] by 1773.  It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1766\u201399) and the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] (1772\u20131818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the [[Sutlej River]]. With the defeat of the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], no native power represented a threat for the Company any longer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Markovits|2004|pp=271\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the Company's power chiefly took two forms.  The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions, which collectively came to comprise [[British India]].  The annexed regions included the [[North-Western Provinces]] (comprising [[Rohilkhand]], [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], and the [[Doab]]) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam ([[Ahom Kingdom]] 1828), and [[Sindh]] (1843). [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]], and [[Kashmir]], were annexed after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]] in 1849\u201356 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General); however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] (1850) to the [[Dogra Dynasty]] of [[Jammu]], and thereby became a princely state.

Since the Company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up ''political'' underpinnings for its rule.<ref name=\"brown-p67\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=67}}</ref> The most important such support came from the ''[[subsidiary alliance]]s'' with Indian princes during the first 75 years of Company rule.<ref name=\"brown-p67\"/> In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-thirds of India.<ref name=\"brown-p67\"/> When an Indian ruler, who was able to secure his territory, wanted to enter such an alliance, the Company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule, which did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects.<ref name=\"brown-68\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=68}}</ref>\n\nIn return, the Company undertook the \"defense of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor.\"<ref name=\"brown-68\" /> Subsidiary alliances created the [[Princely States|princely states]], of the Hindu [[maharaja]]s and the Muslim [[nawab]]s.

It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of large [[Indian diaspora]], which spread from the Indian Ocean (i.e. [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]) to Pacific Ocean (i.e. [[Fiji]]), as well as the growth of [[Indo-Caribbean]] and [[Indo-African]] population.\n\n==Modern period and independence (after c. 1850 CE)==\n===Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences===\n{{Main|Indian rebellion of 1857}}\n{{Gallery|align=center\n|width=140|lines=4\n|File:Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning - Project Gutenberg eText 16528.jpg|[[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Charles Canning]], the [[Governor-General of India]] during the rebellion.\n|File:Dalhousie.jpg|[[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\n|File:Rani of jhansi.jpg|[[Rani of Jhansi|Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi]], one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\n|File:Bahadur Shah II of India.jpg|[[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India by the rebels, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\n}}\nThe Indian rebellion of 1857 was a large-scale rebellion by soldiers employed by the British East India Company in northern and central India against the Company's rule.

Within weeks after Pandey's mutiny, dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion. The rebel soldiers were later joined by Indian nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], and felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=91}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the mutiny in [[Meerut]], the rebels very quickly reached [[Delhi]].

The Crown controlled the Company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir).

The mutinies were rapidly suppressed. Also in early 1946, new elections were called and [[Congress]] candidates won in eight of the eleven provinces.\n\nLate in 1946, the Labour government decided to end [[United Kingdom|British]] rule of [[India]], and in early 1947 [[United Kingdom|Britain]] announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948 and participating in the formation of an [[Interim Government of India|interim government]].\n\nAlong with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. The Muslims had always been a minority within the Indian subcontinent, and the prospect of an exclusively Hindu government made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to mistrust Hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign Raj, although Gandhi called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership.\n\nMuslim League leader [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] proclaimed 16 August 1946 as [[Direct Action Day]], with the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslim homeland in British India, which resulted in the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would be later called the \"[[Direct Action Day|Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946]]\". The communal violence spread to [[Bihar]] (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), to [[Noakhali]] in Bengal (where Hindus were targeted by Muslims), in [[Garhmukteshwar]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), and on to [[Rawalpindi]] in March 1947 in which Hindus were attacked or driven out by Muslims.\n\n====Independence and partition (c. 1947\u2013present)====\n{{Main|Partition of India|History of the Republic of India|History of Pakistan|History of Bangladesh}}\n{{Gallery\n|align=center\n|width=180 |lines=4\n|File:Brit IndianEmpireReligions3.jpg|A map of the prevailing religions of the British Indian empire based on district-wise majorities based on the Indian census of 1909, and published in the [[Imperial Gazetteer of India]].

In particular, the partition of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies. <ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Mountbatten''(1985) p. 401.</ref><ref name=symonds>{{cite book| last = Symonds | first = Richard | author-link=Richard Symonds (academic) | title = The Making of Pakistan | year = 1950 | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | oclc = 1462689 | page = 74| quote = At the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve millions became homeless.}}</ref><ref name=\"Abid2014\">{{cite web |last1=Abid |first1=Abdul Majeed |title=The forgotten massacre |url=https://nation.com.pk/29-Dec-2014/the-forgotten-massacre |website=The Nation |date=29 December 2014|quote=On the same dates [4 and 5 March 1947], Muslim League-led mobs fell with determination and full preparations on the helpless Hindus and Sikhs scattered in the villages of Multan, Rawalpindi, Campbellpur, Jhelum and Sargodha.
