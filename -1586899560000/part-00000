His father died two years later in 1737 and he inherited Poynton Lodge which he rebuilt in the 1750s.

He immediately began a campaign to have himself made a [[Order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]], an honour to which he believed his new wealth now entitled him, but the [[George II of Great Britain|King]] angrily rejected the proposal when it was put to him by [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|The Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles]].

His wife Jane died in 1761 and he remarried to  Frances Bisshopp, daughter of [[Sir Cecil Bisshopp, 6th Baronet]] on 4 February 1764. In 1766, with [[Charles Roe]], an industrialist from Macclesfield, he promoted a scheme to run a canal from the [[River Weaver]] near [[Northwich]] to the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] at Stockport, which would have opened a market for the coalfield on his Poynton estate. However a rival scheme of the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater]], which linked Stockport to the [[Grand Trunk Canal]], was submitted to Parliament on the same day and was chosen in preference by Parliament. Warren's estates included the manor of [[Stockport]], and he tried to enforce  feudal rights as the town grew with industrialisation, seeking to establish manorial monopolies on some goods and levy tolls on the importation of others. His attempts to enlarge his fortune made him unpopular throughout Lancashire and Cheshire.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nWarren's unpopularity led the local merchants to oppose him at the [[1768 British general election|1768 general election]], putting forward [[Lord John Cavendish]] as a candidate. Warren's support from Francis Reynolds was enough to ensure his return and  the backing of [[Duke of Devonshire|his own influential family]] and of the [[Earl of Lonsdale|Lowthers]] was insufficient to make a Cavendish victory likely. Early in the campaign, Cavendish wrote that \"my opponents&nbsp;... have engaged all the lower sort of people, and they spare no expense to keep them firm to them\", and eventually he concluded that \"my opponents were bidding any sums for votes, so that my success was very uncertain and an enormous expense inevitable.\" Cavendish withdrew a week before the election was due, leaving Warren to be returned unopposed.

With their beautiful layouts, and accurate information, Tunzi quickly built a reputation as a top writer and archivist.\" <ref name=\"Journal\" />\n\nTunzi is listed under American Authors on NobelAuthors.com .<ref>http://nobelauthors.com/american-authors/</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Tunzi has been interviewed by several television and radio programs as well as for several newspaper articles and websites throughout his career.<ref>http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-07-21/news/9103210465_1_natural-gas-explosions-natural-gas-al-russell</ref> Between 1972 and 1977, Tunzi routinely was a guest commentator on [[Roy Leonard]]'s radio program on [[WGN (AM)|WGN]], often offering opinions on Elvis Presley's latest record releases and Elvis' personal concert appearances, films and television specials he had recently witnessed, amongst other subjects. Tunzi also regularly appeared as a guest on Jay Gordon's radio program ''Elvis Only''. Tunzi has been a guest on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]'s ''Elvis Radio'' (Channel 19), having been interviewed while in Memphis as well as via the telephone. Many of Tunzi's books are featured in libraries both in the United States and throughout the world.<ref>http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n91020629/</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nTunzi worked at several radio stations in the Chicago area between 1972 and 1982 as an account executive in charge of selling radio advertisements.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubNKpGkhUs4</ref> He also owned Records For A Song, a Chicago area record shop in the late seventies.<ref name=\"Journal\">AMICI Journal, AMICI Journal Publications, Spring 2005, Mike Eder, Page 2, A Look At Joseph A. Tunzi</ref> In 1982, he formed his own publishing company, which up until 1987 strictly dealt with direct mail advertising. By 1985, Tunzi had stopped working for radio stations and began focusing his efforts towards becoming an entrepreneur in direct mail advertising.\n\n== First Book ==\nBy 1988 his company, JAT Publishing (name derived from his initials), diverted its efforts towards self-publishing books that eventually evolved to primarily featuring rare photographs of Elvis Presley throughout his life and career. His first self-published book, though, ''The First Elvis Video Price And Reference Guide'', was a parody of the various price guides that were coming into the collectibles market at the time. As Mike Eder noted in his article, ''A Look At Joseph A. Tunzi'' in ''AMICI Journal'' (National Italian American Celebrity Magazine), \"Feeling many of the values to be arbitrary, and also amused by the huge amount of publications, Joseph decided to do a parody price guide on Elvis Presley's videos.\" <ref name=\"Journal\" /> As Eder further elaborated, \"Tunzi deliberately used subtle humor to test out his theory that these guides were being given too much relevance in collectors' circles.\" <ref name=\"Journal\" /> Steven Opdyke wrote in 1999 that \"Tunzi had another claim to fame. In 1988, he compiled the first Elvis Presley video guide. It contained listings of movie prints, promotional tapes and foreign releases as part of its lengthy presentations. It also had pricing information, which was especially useful for obtaining items with limited distribution.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jlj1AAAAMAAJ&q=Joseph+Tunzi&dq=Joseph+Tunzi |title=The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King |last=Opdyke |first=Steven |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=1999 |isbn=0-313-30815-2 |page=160 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Photo Journals ==\nBeginning with ''Elvis, Encore Performance (Chicago 1972)'' and continuing to this day, Tunzi has written and self-published numerous photo journals on Presley. As Opdyke elaborated in his book, ''The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King'', \"one can only say that Joseph Tunzi (like Elvis biographer Bill E. Burk) has done a ton of work on Elvis. Each book (all from a nineties perspective) has been limited to a specific time period in Elvis' career, concentrating on the music and performances.

Some of these photographers included Jack Lenahan of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] newspaper, Bob Fila of the [[Chicago Tribune]], Dean T. Musser of the [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]'s [[The Journal Gazette]], Hank de Lespinasse, whose photos have appeared in publications such as [[Newsweek]], [[Time (magazine)]], [[Fortune (magazine)]] and [[Sports Illustrated]], Ken Ross of the [[Memphis Press-Scimitar]] and George Wilson of the Oklahoma Journal.\n\nIn 2003, Tunzi's JAT Publishing published Russ Howe and Tom Salva's book of photographs of [[Elvis Presley]] performing at [[Nassau Coliseum]] on June 22\u201323, 1973.<ref>The Central New Jersey Home News Tribune (New Brunswick, New Jersey), Down With The King - Sounding Off By Chris Jordan, Chris Jordan, August 15, 2003, Pulse Page 4</ref>\n\nBeginning with his twentieth year, 2008, Tunzi began publishing all of his latest books in hardback format, though he has recently reverted to publishing some titles in softcover format. That same year, he also published television producer [[Steve Binder]]'s memoir, '' '68 At 40: Retrospective'', of producing the ''Singer Presents Elvis'' television special. This television special is commonly referred to as the [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]]. Later, '''68 At 40: Retrospective'' was reprinted in soft-cover format as well.\n\n== Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977 ==\nIn 1993, Tunzi self-published the first edition in a series of books titled ''Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977'' based on Elvis Presley's recording sessions / live recordings. Two further volumes followed in 1996 and 2004. These books have documented the musicians and backup vocalists who performed with Presley as well as some unreleased recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Elvis+Sessions+Joseph+Tunzi+Billboard+1994&source=bl&ots=M1_4d5D61i&sig=UiG0M6VMCwuKVsIOI83Ryx1oP44&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ps7pUKzgOcbL0AGR24H4Ag&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Elvis%20Sessions%20Joseph%20Tunzi%20Billboard%201994&f=false |title = The Medialine |last = Boehlert |first = Eric |publisher = Howard Lander |date = 16 April 1994 |work = Billboard |accessdate= 12 January 2013 }}</ref> Booklist wrote of Tunzi's first ''Elvis Sessions'' book, \"''Elvis Sessions'' encompasses the King's musical career from his first commercial sides for [[Sun Records]] in 1954 through his final concert recordings in June, 1977, two months before his death. This terrain is traversed in ''Reconsider Baby: The Definitive Elvis Sessionography'' (rev. ed. 1986) but Tunzi also includes material that surfaced recently.\" <ref>{{cite web |url = http://booklistonline.com/Elvis-Sessions-The-Recorded-Music-of-Elvis-Aron-Presley-1953-1977-Joseph-A-Tunzi/pid=953636 |title = Tunzi, Joseph A, Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977 |last = Flagg |first = Gordon |publisher = American Library Association |date = 1 October 1993 |work = Booklist |accessdate= 12 January 2013 }}</ref>''American Libraries'' wrote of Tunzi's first edition of ''Elvis Sessions,'' \"The genuine musical genius of Elvis Presley, has, to a large degree, been obscured by the tragic excesses of his last years and the seemingly inexhaustible supply of tabloid drivel about him. ''Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977'' eschews such nonsense and sticks with the facts about Elvis's recording career, resulting in a solid bit of American pop music history.\" <ref>American Libraries, American Library Association, September, 1993, Unknown Author, Page 718, The Source</ref>\n\nOne of the unreleased recordings by Presley that Tunzi documented in ''Elvis Sessions II: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977'' was an acetate recording he personally owned of ''[[A Little Less Conversation]]'' originally thought to have been made in June 1968 during the production of the \"[[Singer Presents...ELVIS]]\" [[NBC]] television special.<ref>Elvis Sessions II: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977, JAT Publishing, 1996, {{ISBN|1-88846401-1}}, Joseph A. Tunzi, Introduction by Al Pachucki, Pages 139 and 399</ref> However, it has since been determined that this acetate recording was actually an alternate take made in March, 1968 during the soundtrack recording sessions for the 1968 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] motion picture, ''[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]''. A backing track of ''[[A Little Less Conversation]]'' from the ''[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]'' recording sessions was submitted for the 1968 \"Singer Presents Elvis\" television special but ultimately was not used, which lead to some of the confusion regarding the date of the acetate recording. In the mid-nineties, Tunzi sold to [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] (now owned by [[Sony Music]]) the unreleased recording that first appeared on the 1998 double album [[Memories: The '68 Comeback Special]] and was later used in the 2001 Warner Brothers motion picture [[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)]] and ultimately remixed by DJ [[Junkie XL]]. This remix became a worldwide number one hit, part of a marketing campaign for [[Nike, Inc.]]'s \"Secret Tournament\" [[Scorpion KO]] during the [[2002 World Cup]] and a bonus track on the chart-topping compilation [[ELV1S]] 30 #1 Hits.\n\nOpdyke also wrote of Tunzi's first two volumes, \"Tunzi's 1993 \"sessions\" book first came out through mail order only. Recently it appeared in a revised edition (412 pages) that quickly became even more useful than the first. There were many great photos along with endless appendices covering gold and platinum records, concert lists, and even a limited bootleg section.\"<ref>The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King, Greenwood Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-313-30815-2}}, Steven Opdyke, Pages 160-161</ref>\n\nIn November, 2016 Jeremy Roberts wrote an article detailing Elvis' connection to guitarist and entertainer [[Glen Campbell]] and the fact that Campbell has been erroneously cited for several years as having played guitar on the recording sessions that produced the title song, \"[[Viva Las Vegas (song)]]\" of Presley's 1964 film. However, the article points out that after contacting Tunzi, it is clear that Campbell played on Elvis' cover recording of [[Ray Charles]]' [[What'd I Say]] which was also featured in the film.<ref>https://medium.com/@jeremylr/setting-the-record-straight-on-elvis-presley-and-glen-campbells-recording-summit-c1bf3d03ddb3#.eqoin77tw</ref>\n\nTunzi has also written and published ''Elvis No. 1 - The Complete Chart History Of Elvis Presley'', which details Elvis Presley's chart numbers on the various charts in both ''[[Billboard (magazine)]]'' and ''[[Cashbox (magazine)]]''.\n\nA fourth volume of ''Elvis Sessions'' is currently being worked on.\n\n==Television, Compact Disc and DVD releases==\nIn 1997, Tunzi was part of an [[Elvis Presley]] twentieth anniversary [[Blockbuster Video]] television commercial which featured photographs from his own photo agency. In one of the rare occasions, Tunzi was physically credited for photo usage in the television commercial. This commercial promoted an exclusive Elvis Presley [[compact disc]] being sold at [[Blockbuster Video]].\n\nOver the years, his company, JAT Publishing, has expanded to produce several [[compact disc]] and [[DVD]] titles. He has also written and published three projects featuring [[the Beatles]]. These projects included a book titled ''Beatles '65'' which featured the only four known candid color paparazzi photographs taken of Elvis Presley and the members of the Beatles on August 27, 1965. Ken Sharp wrote a column piece titled ''Rock Report'' in ''[[Friday Morning Quarterback]]'' of Tunzi's ''Beatles '65'' that \"the 96-page book draws together exciting and dramatic photographs of the Beatles in concert and at press conferences. Photographs of fans at shows, experiencing the complete electrical shock of \"[[Beatlemania]]\" is also included.\"<ref>Friday Morning QB, Rock Report, Terry Marshall, Ken Sharp, August, 2002</ref> Included with this project was ''Elvis Sings Beatles Songs'', the very first officially sanctioned compact disc release to feature all of Elvis Presley's cover recordings of songs written and originally recorded by the Beatles. Derek Page wrote a review of Tunzi's ''Beatles '65'' in Beatlefan magazine in which he ended his review by saying that ''Beatles '65'' was \"all in all, a marvelous look at The Beatles in their touring prime.\"<ref>Beatlefan magazine, The Goody Press, Executive Editor Al Sussman, Derek Page, Issue #137 (Vol. 23, No. 5), July / August, 2002, {{ISSN|0274-6905}}</ref>\n\nThe second project Tunzi did on the Beatles was ''Beatles '64: Goin' To Kansas City'' which was simply a smaller photo booklet accompanying a CD featuring the audio of a previously unreleased Beatles press conference on September 17, 1964. The third project featuring [[the Beatles]] was the book titled ''1964: The Year That...Changed America & Me''. This book featured black & white photographs of The Beatles arrival in the [[United States of America]] on February 7, 1964, black and white and color photographs of [[the Beatles]] rehearsing and performing during their first three appearances on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]], black and white and color photographs of the group meeting boxer [[Cassius Clay]], later known as [[Muhammad Ali]], while he was in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] training for his February 25, 1964 bout with [[Sonny Liston]], and lastly black and white photographs of the band at a press conference as well as during a concert that took place in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] on September 18, 1964.\n\nIn 1999, Eclipse Music Group released the very first Elvis shaped [[compact disc]], titled ''Elvis Presley Limited Edition Shaped CD.'' Tunzi provided the liner notes for this release.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/elvis-shaped-cd-box-mr0002640563/credits</ref>\n\nTunzi produced a DVD starring Elvis Presley and [[Frank Sinatra]] in 2000, titled ''Welcome Home Elvis'' and in 2001 started a series of DVD videos titled ''Hot Shots & Cool Clips'', which is presently at eight volumes. The ''Welcome Home Elvis'' release was one of the very first independent Elvis Presley video releases on the DVD format. The ''Hot Shots & Cool Clips'' series has featured newsreel, press conference, concert and candid footage of Elvis Presley throughout his career.  The website elvisondvdcd.de stated when discussing the third volume in the ''Hot Shots & Cool Clips'' series that \"Joe Tunzi today is one of a very select group of people who go through obscure archives, searching high and low for undiscovered, rare footage. What he turns up with simply is breathtaking each and every time. On this volume he has collected some of the most rarest footage ever.\"<ref>http://elvisondvdcd.de/elvis-presley-hot-shots-and-cool-clips1--7.html</ref>\n\nTunzi also produced a DVD titled ''Young Man of The Nation'' on Elvis Presley being bestowed as one of the ''Ten Outstanding Young Men In America'' in 1970 by the [[United States Junior Chamber]] of Congress (Jaycees). The name of the award was later changed to the ''[[Ten Outstanding Young Americans]].''\n\nIn 2001, Tunzi released a [[compact disc]] titled ''Elvis, America The Beautiful'', as part of a book package featuring a book of the same name. This set was also sold through [[Time-Life]]. Although the set was conceived prior to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the [[United States]], the sales of this book / CD combination spiked in the aftermath of that tragic event as several thousand sets were sold.\n\nIn 2007, Tunzi collaborated with Sony / BMG on the budget CD title ''Country's Golden Hits,'' a ten track title featuring musical selections from the likes of [[Mac Davis]], [[Sonny James]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Floyd Cramer]], [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Charlie Rich]].<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Countrys-Golden-Hits-Various/dp/B000P1KROI</ref> Initially Tunzi sold this compact disc through his own website but later on it was sold through other outlets including [[Tuesday Morning]]. Most of the songs featured on this compact disc were songs that Elvis Presley had considered recording at some point.\n\n==Research==\nIn August, 2002, Tunzi was one of the first to properly document and correct the erroneous photo credits attributed to the cover of Elvis Presley's first self-titled [[RCA Records]] vinyl album.<ref name=\"biwa\">Tampa Tribune, Steven M.

The front cover, an iconic picture of Elvis Presley performing in concert at the [[Fort Homer W.

Other notable domestic releases to feature his photographs include ''[[Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential '70s Masters]]'', ''[[An Afternoon in the Garden]]'', ''Platinum: A Life In Music'', ''[[Today, Tomorrow, and Forever (Elvis Presley album)]]'', ''[[The Complete Elvis Presley Masters]]'' and the 2016 sixty compact disc boxed set, ''[[The RCA Albums Collection (Elvis Presley box set)]]''.<ref>Hartford Courant (Hartford, Connecticut), August 11, 1997, RCA Keeps Finding Gold In Elvis Tapes, Roger Catlin, Pages E1 and E2</ref> From an international standpoint, Tunzi has also supplied photographs for a number of releases outside the United States, including the Denmark-based Follow That Dream Collectors' Label and the 1999 Japanese [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] Funhouse ten compact disc release ''Elvis Presley - Complete Singles Collection''.

Of course, there are some exceptions, such as the 1999 budget compact disc release, ''Elvis Presley - It's Christmas Time,'' which was simply a reissue of the 1970 [[RCA Camden]] album ''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]'' with a new title and different photo artwork. Additionally, photographs from his archives have appeared in [[Time (magazine)]], [[People (magazine)]] and [[TV Guide]].\n\nTunzi is acknowledged for supplying images, including the album cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s 1973 [[Billboard (magazine)]] number one album, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite (album)]]'' for the 2004 book by Hamish Champ titled ''100 Best Selling Albums of the 70s.''<ref>100 Best Selling Albums of the 70s, Hamish Champ, Amber Books, Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0760756522}}, 2004, page 103</ref>\n \nA photograph from Tunzi's photo agency has been featured inside the [[Valley View Casino Center]] in [[San Diego, California]]. In fact, Joseph A. Tunzi's name is also represented on the wall of The [[Valley View Casino Center]] below the photograph.

These were on November 15, 1970, April 26, 1973 and April 24, 1976.\n\nTunzi supplied the Robertson & Fresch photograph that was used for the cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s first album for a 2006 article in The Pasco Tribune, a section of The Tampa Tribune titled ''Group Wants Creative Industries Business In Armory''<ref>The Pasco Tribune, A Section Of The Tampa Tribune, Group Wants Creative Industries Business In Armory, June 18, 2006, Jose Patino Girona, Page 9</ref> and a 2011 article in the Tampa Tribune newspaper titled ''Armory Shook Up History Of Tampa''.<ref>The Tampa Tribune, Armory Shook Up History Of Tampa, Rodney Kite-Powell, Page 8, December 11, 2011</ref>\n\nJoseph A.

Tunzi has also compiled a massive photo archive, from which he licenses photographs of Presley.\n\nAdam Victor referred to Tunzi in his 2008 publication, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'' as \"one of the world's most prolific Elvis authors, with more than twenty books to his name, specializing in photo books about specific events and tours through his own publishing operation, J.A.T.

Tunzi also regularly appeared as a guest on Jay Gordon's radio program ''Elvis Only''. Tunzi has been a guest on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]'s ''Elvis Radio'' (Channel 19), having been interviewed while in Memphis as well as via the telephone. Many of Tunzi's books are featured in libraries both in the United States and throughout the world. <ref>http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n91020629/</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nTunzi worked at several radio stations in the Chicago area between 1972 and 1982 as an account executive in charge of selling radio advertisements.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubNKpGkhUs4</ref> He also owned Records For A Song, a Chicago area record shop in the late seventies.<ref name=\"Journal\">AMICI Journal, AMICI Journal Publications, Spring 2005, Mike Eder, Page 2, A Look At Joseph A. Tunzi</ref> In 1982, he formed his own publishing company, which up until 1987 strictly dealt with direct mail advertising. By 1985, Tunzi had stopped working for radio stations and began focusing his efforts towards becoming an entrepreneur in direct mail advertising.\n\n== First Book ==\nBy 1988 his company, JAT Publishing (name derived from his initials), diverted its efforts towards self-publishing books that eventually evolved to primarily featuring rare photographs of Elvis Presley throughout his life and career. His first self-published book, though, ''The First Elvis Video Price And Reference Guide'', was a parody of the various price guides that were coming into the collectibles market at the time. As Mike Eder noted in his article, ''A Look At Joseph A. Tunzi'' in ''AMICI Journal'' (National Italian American Celebrity Magazine), \"Feeling many of the values to be arbitrary, and also amused by the huge amount of publications, Joseph decided to do a parody price guide on Elvis Presley's videos.\" <ref name=\"Journal\" /> As Eder further elaborated, \"Tunzi deliberately used subtle humor to test out his theory that these guides were being given too much relevance in collectors' circles.\" <ref name=\"Journal\" /> Steven Opdyke wrote in 1999 that \"Tunzi had another claim to fame. In 1988, he compiled the first Elvis Presley video guide. It contained listings of movie prints, promotional tapes and foreign releases as part of its lengthy presentations. It also had pricing information, which was especially useful for obtaining items with limited distribution.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jlj1AAAAMAAJ&q=Joseph+Tunzi&dq=Joseph+Tunzi |title=The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King |last=Opdyke |first=Steven |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=1999 |isbn=0-313-30815-2 |page=160 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Photo Journals ==\nBeginning with ''Elvis, Encore Performance (Chicago 1972)'' and continuing to this day, Tunzi has written and self-published numerous photo journals on Presley. As Opdyke elaborated in his book, ''The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King'', \"one can only say that Joseph Tunzi (like Elvis biographer Bill E. Burk) has done a ton of work on Elvis. Each book (all from a nineties perspective) has been limited to a specific time period in Elvis' career, concentrating on the music and performances. Taken together, they formed one of the most in-depth chronicles of the King's career from the late sixties forward.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jlj1AAAAMAAJ&q=Joseph+Tunzi&dq=Joseph+Tunzi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l3T3UOG9Koq20QH_-IGAAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgU |title = The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To books About The King |last = Opdyke |first = Steven |publisher = Greenwood Press |work = The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King |year = 1999 |ISBN= 0-313-30815-2 |pages= 131\u2013132 |accessdate =11 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nTunzi was also a forerunner in using newspaper photography from many award-winning photographers in his publications. Some of these photographers included Jack Lenahan of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] newspaper, Bob Fila of the [[Chicago Tribune]], Dean T. Musser of the [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]'s [[The Journal Gazette]], Hank de Lespinasse, whose photos have appeared in publications such as [[Newsweek]], [[Time (magazine)]], [[Fortune (magazine)]] and [[Sports Illustrated]], Ken Ross of the [[Memphis Press-Scimitar]] and George Wilson of the Oklahoma Journal.\n\nIn 2003, Tunzi's JAT Publishing published Russ Howe and Tom Salva's book of photographs of [[Elvis Presley]] performing at [[Nassau Coliseum]] on June 22\u201323, 1973.<ref>The Central New Jersey Home News Tribune (New Brunswick, New Jersey), Down With The King - Sounding Off By Chris Jordan, Chris Jordan, August 15, 2003, Pulse Page 4</ref>\n\nBeginning with his twentieth year, 2008, Tunzi began publishing all of his latest books in hardback format, though he has recently reverted to publishing some titles in softcover format. That same year, he also published television producer [[Steve Binder]]'s memoir, '' '68 At 40: Retrospective'', of producing the ''Singer Presents Elvis'' television special. This television special is commonly referred to as the [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]]. Later, '''68 At 40: Retrospective'' was reprinted in soft-cover format as well.\n\n== Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977 ==\nIn 1993, Tunzi self-published the first edition in a series of books titled ''Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977'' based on Elvis Presley's recording sessions / live recordings. Two further volumes followed in 1996 and 2004. These books have documented the musicians and backup vocalists who performed with Presley as well as some unreleased recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Elvis+Sessions+Joseph+Tunzi+Billboard+1994&source=bl&ots=M1_4d5D61i&sig=UiG0M6VMCwuKVsIOI83Ryx1oP44&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ps7pUKzgOcbL0AGR24H4Ag&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Elvis%20Sessions%20Joseph%20Tunzi%20Billboard%201994&f=false |title = The Medialine |last = Boehlert |first = Eric |publisher = Howard Lander |date = 16 April 1994 |work = Billboard |accessdate= 12 January 2013 }}</ref> Booklist wrote of Tunzi's first ''Elvis Sessions'' book, \"''Elvis Sessions'' encompasses the King's musical career from his first commercial sides for [[Sun Records]] in 1954 through his final concert recordings in June, 1977, two months before his death. This terrain is traversed in ''Reconsider Baby: The Definitive Elvis Sessionography'' (rev. ed. 1986) but Tunzi also includes material that surfaced recently.\" <ref>{{cite web |url = http://booklistonline.com/Elvis-Sessions-The-Recorded-Music-of-Elvis-Aron-Presley-1953-1977-Joseph-A-Tunzi/pid=953636 |title = Tunzi, Joseph A, Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977 |last = Flagg |first = Gordon |publisher = American Library Association |date = 1 October 1993 |work = Booklist |accessdate= 12 January 2013 }}</ref>''American Libraries'' wrote of Tunzi's first edition of ''Elvis Sessions,'' \"The genuine musical genius of Elvis Presley, has, to a large degree, been obscured by the tragic excesses of his last years and the seemingly inexhaustible supply of tabloid drivel about him. ''Elvis Sessions: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977'' eschews such nonsense and sticks with the facts about Elvis's recording career, resulting in a solid bit of American pop music history.\" <ref>American Libraries, American Library Association, September, 1993, Unknown Author, Page 718, The Source</ref>\n\nOne of the unreleased recordings by Presley that Tunzi documented in ''Elvis Sessions II: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977'' was an acetate recording he personally owned of ''[[A Little Less Conversation]]'' originally thought to have been made in June 1968 during the production of the \"[[Singer Presents...ELVIS]]\" [[NBC]] television special.<ref>Elvis Sessions II: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977, JAT Publishing, 1996, {{ISBN|1-88846401-1}}, Joseph A. Tunzi, Introduction by Al Pachucki, Pages 139 and 399</ref> However, it has since been determined that this acetate recording was actually an alternate take made in March, 1968 during the soundtrack recording sessions for the 1968 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] motion picture, ''[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]''. A backing track of ''[[A Little Less Conversation]]'' from the ''[[Live a Little, Love a Little]]'' recording sessions was submitted for the 1968 \"Singer Presents Elvis\" television special but ultimately was not used, which lead to some of the confusion regarding the date of the acetate recording. In the mid-nineties, Tunzi sold to [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] (now owned by [[Sony Music]]) the unreleased recording that first appeared on the 1998 double album [[Memories: The '68 Comeback Special]] and was later used in the 2001 Warner Brothers motion picture [[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)]] and ultimately remixed by DJ [[Junkie XL]]. This remix became a worldwide number one hit, part of a marketing campaign for [[Nike, Inc.]]'s \"Secret Tournament\" [[Scorpion KO]] during the [[2002 World Cup]] and a bonus track on the chart-topping compilation [[ELV1S]] 30 #1 Hits.\n\nOpdyke also wrote of Tunzi's first two volumes, \"Tunzi's 1993 \"sessions\" book first came out through mail order only. Recently it appeared in a revised edition (412 pages) that quickly became even more useful than the first. There were many great photos along with endless appendices covering gold and platinum records, concert lists, and even a limited bootleg section.\"<ref>The Printed Elvis: The Complete Guide To Books About The King, Greenwood Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-313-30815-2}}, Steven Opdyke, Pages 160-161</ref>\n\nIn November, 2016 Jeremy Roberts wrote an article detailing Elvis' connection to guitarist and entertainer [[Glen Campbell]] and the fact that Campbell has been erroneously cited for several years as having played guitar on the recording sessions that produced the title song, \"[[Viva Las Vegas (song)]]\" of Presley's 1964 film. However, the article points out that after contacting Tunzi, it is clear that Campbell played on Elvis' cover recording of [[Ray Charles]]' [[What'd I Say]] which was also featured in the film.<ref>https://medium.com/@jeremylr/setting-the-record-straight-on-elvis-presley-and-glen-campbells-recording-summit-c1bf3d03ddb3#.eqoin77tw</ref>\n\nTunzi has also written and published ''Elvis No. 1 - The Complete Chart History Of Elvis Presley'', which details Elvis Presley's chart numbers on the various charts in both ''[[Billboard (magazine)]]'' and ''[[Cashbox (magazine)]]''.\n\nA fourth volume of ''Elvis Sessions'' is currently being worked on.\n\n==Television, Compact Disc and DVD releases==\nIn 1997, Tunzi was part of an [[Elvis Presley]] twentieth anniversary [[Blockbuster Video]] television commercial which featured photographs from his own photo agency. In one of the rare occasions, Tunzi was physically credited for photo usage in the television commercial. This commercial promoted an exclusive Elvis Presley [[compact disc]] being sold at [[Blockbuster Video]].\n\nOver the years, his company, JAT Publishing, has expanded to produce several [[compact disc]] and [[DVD]] titles. He has also written and published three projects featuring [[the Beatles]]. These projects included a book titled ''Beatles '65'' which featured the only four known candid color paparazzi photographs taken of Elvis Presley and the members of the Beatles on August 27, 1965. Ken Sharp wrote a column piece titled ''Rock Report'' in ''[[Friday Morning Quarterback]]'' of Tunzi's ''Beatles '65'' that \"the 96-page book draws together exciting and dramatic photographs of the Beatles in concert and at press conferences. Photographs of fans at shows, experiencing the complete electrical shock of \"[[Beatlemania]]\" is also included.\"<ref>Friday Morning QB, Rock Report, Terry Marshall, Ken Sharp, August, 2002</ref> Included with this project was ''Elvis Sings Beatles Songs'', the very first officially sanctioned compact disc release to feature all of Elvis Presley's cover recordings of songs written and originally recorded by the Beatles. Derek Page wrote a review of Tunzi's ''Beatles '65'' in Beatlefan magazine in which he ended his review by saying that ''Beatles '65'' was \"all in all, a marvelous look at The Beatles in their touring prime.\"<ref>Beatlefan magazine, The Goody Press, Executive Editor Al Sussman, Derek Page, Issue #137 (Vol. 23, No. 5), July / August, 2002, {{ISSN|0274-6905}}</ref>\n\nThe second project Tunzi did on the Beatles was ''Beatles '64: Goin' To Kansas City'' which was simply a smaller photo booklet accompanying a CD featuring the audio of a previously unreleased Beatles press conference on September 17, 1964. The third project featuring [[the Beatles]] was the book titled ''1964: The Year That...Changed America & Me''. This book featured black & white photographs of The Beatles arrival in the [[United States of America]] on February 7, 1964, black and white and color photographs of [[the Beatles]] rehearsing and performing during their first three appearances on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]], black and white and color photographs of the group meeting boxer [[Cassius Clay]], later known as [[Muhammad Ali]], while he was in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] training for his February 25, 1964 bout with [[Sonny Liston]], and lastly black and white photographs of the band at a press conference as well as during a concert that took place in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] on September 18, 1964.\n\nIn 1999, Eclipse Music Group released the very first Elvis shaped [[compact disc]], titled ''Elvis Presley Limited Edition Shaped CD.'' Tunzi provided the liner notes for this release.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/elvis-shaped-cd-box-mr0002640563/credits</ref>\n\nTunzi produced a DVD starring Elvis Presley and [[Frank Sinatra]] in 2000, titled ''Welcome Home Elvis'' and in 2001 started a series of DVD videos titled ''Hot Shots & Cool Clips'', which is presently at eight volumes. The ''Welcome Home Elvis'' release was one of the very first independent Elvis Presley video releases on the DVD format. The ''Hot Shots & Cool Clips'' series has featured newsreel, press conference, concert and candid footage of Elvis Presley throughout his career.  The website elvisondvdcd.de stated when discussing the third volume in the ''Hot Shots & Cool Clips'' series that \"Joe Tunzi today is one of a very select group of people who go through obscure archives, searching high and low for undiscovered, rare footage. What he turns up with simply is breathtaking each and every time. On this volume he has collected some of the most rarest footage ever.\"<ref>http://elvisondvdcd.de/elvis-presley-hot-shots-and-cool-clips1--7.html</ref>\n\nTunzi also produced a DVD titled ''Young Man of The Nation'' on Elvis Presley being bestowed as one of the ''Ten Outstanding Young Men In America'' in 1970 by the [[United States Junior Chamber]] of Congress (Jaycees). The name of the award was later changed to the ''[[Ten Outstanding Young Americans]].''\n\nIn 2001, Tunzi released a [[compact disc]] titled ''Elvis, America The Beautiful'', as part of a book package featuring a book of the same name. This set was also sold through [[Time-Life]]. Although the set was conceived prior to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the [[United States]], the sales of this book / CD combination spiked in the aftermath of that tragic event as several thousand sets were sold.\n\nIn 2007, Tunzi collaborated with Sony / BMG on the budget CD title ''Country's Golden Hits,'' a ten track title featuring musical selections from the likes of [[Mac Davis]], [[Sonny James]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Floyd Cramer]], [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Charlie Rich]].<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Countrys-Golden-Hits-Various/dp/B000P1KROI</ref> Initially Tunzi sold this compact disc through his own website but later on it was sold through other outlets including [[Tuesday Morning]]. Most of the songs featured on this compact disc were songs that Elvis Presley had considered recording at some point.\n\n==Research==\nIn August, 2002, Tunzi was one of the first to properly document and correct the erroneous photo credits attributed to the cover of Elvis Presley's first self-titled [[RCA Records]] vinyl album.<ref name=\"biwa\">Tampa Tribune, Steven M.

Of course, there are some exceptions, such as the 1999 budget compact disc release, ''Elvis Presley - It's Christmas Time,'' which was simply a reissue of the 1970 [[RCA Camden]] album ''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]'' with a new title and different photo artwork.

Beginning in the mid-19th century, aside from the work being done by women for broad-based economic and political equality and for social reforms, women sought to change voting laws to allow them to vote.<ref>[[History of Woman Suffrage]]</ref> National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards that objective, especially the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] (founded in 1904 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]), as well as for equal civil rights for women.<ref>Allison Sneider,  \"The New Suffrage History: Voting Rights in International Perspective\", ''History Compass,'' (July 2010) 8#7 pp. 692\u2013703,</ref>\n\nWomen who owned property gained the right to vote in the [[Isle of Man]] in 1881, and in 1893, women in the then British [[colony of New Zealand]] were granted the right to vote. In Australia, women progressively gained the right to vote between 1894 and 1911 (federally in 1902).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Australia and New Zealand|last=Christine.|first=Lindop|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-423390-3|location=Oxford|page=27|oclc=361237847}}</ref> Most major Western powers extended voting rights to women in the interwar period, including Canada (1917), Britain and Germany (1918), Austria and the Netherlands (1919) and the United States (1920). Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (1952), and Switzerland (1971).\n\n[[Leslie P. Hume|Leslie Hume]] argues that the First World War changed the popular mood:\n\n: The women's contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the [[voting booth]]. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Hume|title=The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies 1897\u20131914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1TlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT281|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=281|isbn=978-1-317-21326-0 }}</ref>\n\nExtended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before [[universal suffrage]] for men; for instance, literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it. The [[United Nations]] encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (1979) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this Convention.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:AnnaIIStolQued.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Anna II, Abbess of Quedlinburg]].

Through subsequent centuries, Europe was generally ruled by monarchs, though various forms of parliament arose at different times. The high rank ascribed to [[abbess]]es within the [[Catholic Church]] permitted some women the right to sit and vote at national assemblies \u2013 as with various high-ranking abbesses in Medieval Germany, who were ranked among the independent princes of the empire.

Property and descent were passed through the female line. Women elders voted on hereditary male chiefs and could depose them.\n\nThe emergence of modern democracy generally began with male citizens obtaining the right to vote in advance of female citizens, except in the Kingdom of Hawai'i, where universal suffrage was introduced in 1840 without mention of sex; however, a constitutional amendment in 1852 rescinded female voting and put property qualifications on male voting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kauanui |first=J.

Suffragist themes often included the notions that women were naturally kinder and more concerned about children and the elderly.  As Kraditor shows, it was often assumed that women voters would have a civilizing effect on politics, opposing domestic violence, liquor, and emphasizing cleanliness and community.  An opposing theme, Kraditor argues, held that women had the same moral standards. They should be equal in every way and that there was no such thing as a woman's \"natural role\".<ref>Aileen S.

The first general election at which women could vote was the [[1933 South African general election|1933&nbsp;election]]. At that election [[Leila Reitz]] (wife of [[Deneys Reitz]]) was elected as the first female&nbsp;MP, representing [[Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]]. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the [[Cape Province]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to white foreign nationals when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.\n\nThe right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]], was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult [[coloured]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1981. In 1984 the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was established, and the right to vote for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] and [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.\n\nIn 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] was granted to all adult citizens.\n\n====Southern Rhodesia====\nSouthern Rhodesian white women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie&nbsp;(1875\u20131950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920\u20131928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outside Westminster. The influx of women settlers from Britain proved a decisive factor in the 1922&nbsp;referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner Nationalists]] in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or \"responsible government\".<ref>See Lowry, 1997</ref> Black Rhodesian males qualified for the vote in 1923 (based only upon property, assets, income, and literacy).

Web. 4 Oct. 2016.</ref>\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[Bangladesh]] was (mostly) the province of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.<ref>Dilara Choudhury, and Al Masud Hasanuzzaman,  \"Political Decision-Making in Bangladesh and the Role of Women,\" ''Asian Profile,'' (Feb 1997) 25#1 pp. 53\u201369</ref>\n\n====India====\n{{main|Women's suffrage in India}}\nWomen in India were allowed to vote right from the first general elections after the independence of India in 1947 unlike during the British rule who resisted allowing women to vote.<ref name=\"BBCWomen\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43081429|title=Did the Empire resist women's suffrage in India?|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|date=2018-02-22|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1917. It sought votes for women and the right to hold legislative office on the same basis as men. These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref name = Basu>Aparna Basu, \"Women's Struggle for the Vote: 1917\u20131937,\" ''Indian Historical Review,'' (Jan 2008) 35#1 pp. 128\u201343</ref> British and [[Feminism in India|Indian feminists]] combined in 1918 to publish a magazine ''Stri Dharma'' that featured international news from a feminist perspective.<ref>Michelle Elizabeth Tusan, \"Writing Stri Dharma: international feminism, nationalist politics, and women's press advocacy in late colonial India,\" ''[[Women's History Review]],'' (Dec 2003) 12#4 pp. 623\u201349</ref> In 1919 in the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]], the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being [[monarchy|monarchies]]).<ref name = Basu/> In [[Bengal]] province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.<ref>Barbara Southard, \"Colonial Politics and Women's Rights: Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Bengal, British India in the 1920s,\" ''[[Modern Asian Studies]],'' (March 1993) 27#2 pp. 397\u2013439</ref>\n\nWhereas wealthy and educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This happened when the Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[sacred scripture]] of the Sikh faith.\n\nIn the [[Government of India Act 1935]] the [[British Raj]] set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women's leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.<ref>Basu (Jan 2008), 140\u201343</ref>\n\n====Indonesia====\n[[Indonesia]] granted women voting rights for municipal councils in 1905. Only men who could read and write could vote, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the [[Literacy|literacy rate]] for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group that pressed for women's suffrage in Indonesia was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association), founded in the [[Netherlands]] in 1894. VVV tried to attract Indonesian members, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the first national representative body, the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], was formed which still excluded women from voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, women gained the right to be elected to urban representative institutions, which led to some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, only European women and municipal councils could vote,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}<!-- how can a municipal council be a voter? --> excluding all other women and [[Local government|local councils]]. In September 1941, the Volksraad extended the vote to women of all races. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (subject to property and educational qualifications).<ref name=Blackburn>Blackburn, Susan, 'Winning the Vote for Women in Indonesia' ''Australian Feminist Studies'', Volume 14, Number 29, 1 April 1999, pp. 207\u201318</ref>\n\n====Iran====\n{{see also|1963 Iranian referendum}}\nA [[1963 Iranian referendum|referendum in January 1963]] overwhelmingly approved by voters gave women the right to vote, a right previously denied to them under the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|Iranian Constitution of 1906]] pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 3.<ref name=Timeline />\n\n====Israel====\nWomen have had full suffrage since the [[Israel's independence|establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948.\n\nThe first woman to be elected [[Prime Minister of Israel]] was [[Golda Meir]] in 1969.\n\n====Japan====\n[[File:Woman's Rights Meeting Tokyo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Women's Rights meeting in [[Tokyo]], to push for women's suffrage]]\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Japan}}\n\nAlthough women were allowed to vote in some prefectures in 1880, women's suffrage was enacted at a national level in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305105909/http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archivedate=2008-03-05 |title=The Fusae Ichikawa Memorial Association |publisher=Ichikawa-fusae.or.jp |accessdate=2011-01-08}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 January 2014.</ref>\n\n'''Korea'''\n\nSouth Korean women were granted the vote in 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/empowerment-women-south-korea|title=The Empowerment of Women in South Korea|date=2014-03-11|work=JIA SIPA|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Kuwait====\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Kuwait}}\nWhen voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the [[right to vote]].<ref name=\"stat\">{{Cite book|year=2001|title=African Women and Children: Crisis and Response|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom/page/8 8]|author=Apollo Rwomire|isbn=978-0-275-96218-0}}</ref> The right was later removed.

It promoted a vision of \"transcendent citizenship\" for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a white settler nation. While the women's suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of white women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked white women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \"racial degeneration.\"<ref>Anne-Marie.

Women involved in larger movements for social justice began to agitate equal rights and opportunities on par with men; following the example of their European peers, Elvira Dellepiane Rawson, [[Cecilia Grierson]] and [[Alicia Moreau de Justo]] began to form a number of groups in defense of the civil rights of women between 1900 and 1910.  The first major victories for extending the civil rights of women occurred in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|Province of San Juan]].  Women had been allowed to vote in that province since 1862, but only in municipal elections.  A similar right was extended in the [[Santa Fe Province|province of Santa Fe]] where a constitution that ensured women's suffrage was enacted at the municipal level, although female participation in votes initially remained low. In 1927, San Juan sanctioned its Constitution and broadly recognized the equal rights of men and women. However, the [[1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|1930 coup]] overthrew these advances.\n\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Balvanera - Manifestaci\u00f3n por el voto femenino en 1948.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Women's demonstration in Buenos Aires in front of the National Congress by law for universal suffrage, 1947]]\n\nA great pioneer of women's suffrage was [[Julieta Lanteri]], the daughter of Italian immigrants, who in 1910 requested a national court to grant her the right to citizenship (at the time not generally given to single female immigrants) as well as suffrage. The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: \"As a judge, I have a duty to declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived of what they do not prohibit.\"\n\nIn July 1911, [[Julieta Lanteri|Dr. Lanteri]] were enumerated, and on November 26 of that year exercised her right to vote, the first Ibero-American woman to vote.

In 1935, women's rights supporters founded the Feminine Cultural Group (known as 'ACF' from its initials in Spanish), with the goal of tackling women's problems. The group supported women's political and social rights, and believed it was necessary to involve and inform women about these issues in order to ensure their personal development. It went on to give seminars, as well as founding night schools and the House of Laboring Women.\n\nGroups looking to reform the 1936 Civil Code of Conduct in conjunction with the Venezuelan representation to the Union of American Women called the First Feminine Venezuelan Congress in 1940. In this congress, delegates discussed the situation of women in Venezuela and their demands. Key goals were women's suffrage and a reform to the Civil Code of Conduct. Around twelve thousand signatures were collected and handed to the Venezuelan Congress, which reformed the Civil Code of Conduct in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, groups supporting women's suffrage, the most important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained the right to vote at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the Correo C\u00edvico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the [[1945 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat|1945 Venezuelan Coup d'\u00c9tat]] and the [[1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election|call for a new Constitution]], to which women were elected, women's suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.\n\n==In non-religious organizations==\nThe right of women to vote has sometimes been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, it was not until 1964 that women in the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] in the United States were first allowed to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nad.org/nad-history#1970s |title=NAD History; National Association of the Deaf |publisher=Nad.org |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n===Catholicism===\nThe [[Pope]] is elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp |title=How is the Pope elected? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=2005-04-06 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Women are not appointed as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |title=Women and the Priesthood |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=2011-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904055106/http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |archivedate=2011-09-04 |df= }}</ref> The female Catholic offices of [[Abbess]] or Mother Superior are elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Women in Islam}}\nIn some countries, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Goodstein|first1=Laurie}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{see also|Women in Judaism}}\nIn Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and most Orthodox Jewish movements women have the right to vote.

Hume|Leslie Hume]] argues that the First World War changed the popular mood:\n\n: The women's contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the [[voting booth]]. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Hume|title=The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies 1897\u20131914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1TlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT281|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=281|isbn=978-1-317-21326-0 }}</ref>\n\nExtended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women's suffrage. In many countries, limited suffrage for women was granted before [[universal suffrage]] for men; for instance, literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it. The [[United Nations]] encouraged women's suffrage in the years following World War II, and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (1979) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this Convention.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:AnnaIIStolQued.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Anna II, Abbess of Quedlinburg]].

The first general election at which women could vote was the [[1933 South African general election|1933&nbsp;election]]. At that election [[Leila Reitz]] (wife of [[Deneys Reitz]]) was elected as the first female&nbsp;MP, representing [[Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]]. The limited voting rights available to non-white men in the [[Cape Province]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] ([[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]] practically denied all non-whites the right to vote, and had also done so to white foreign nationals when independent in the 1800s) were not extended to women, and were themselves progressively eliminated between 1936 and 1968.\n\nThe right to vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, established in 1963 for the [[Transkei]] [[bantustan]], was granted to all adult citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. All adult [[coloured]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, all adult [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] citizens were eligible to vote for the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1981. In 1984 the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was established, and the right to vote for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] and [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] was granted to all adult Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.\n\nIn 1994 the bantustans and the Tricameral Parliament were abolished and the right to vote for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] was granted to all adult citizens.\n\n====Southern Rhodesia====\nSouthern Rhodesian white women won the vote in 1919 and Ethel Tawse Jollie&nbsp;(1875\u20131950) was elected to the Southern Rhodesia legislature 1920\u20131928, the first woman to sit in any national Commonwealth Parliament outside Westminster. The influx of women settlers from Britain proved a decisive factor in the 1922&nbsp;referendum that rejected annexation by a South Africa increasingly under the sway of traditionalist [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner Nationalists]] in favor of Rhodesian Home Rule or \"responsible government\".<ref>See Lowry, 1997</ref> Black Rhodesian males qualified for the vote in 1923 (based only upon property, assets, income, and literacy).

Web. 4 Oct. 2016.</ref>\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[Bangladesh]] was (mostly) the province of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable in that since 1991, two women, namely [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia|Begum Khaleda Zia]], have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.<ref>Dilara Choudhury, and Al Masud Hasanuzzaman,  \"Political Decision-Making in Bangladesh and the Role of Women,\" ''Asian Profile,'' (Feb 1997) 25#1 pp. 53\u201369</ref>\n\n====India====\n{{main|Women's suffrage in India}}\nWomen in India were allowed to vote right from the first general elections after the independence of India in 1947 unlike during the British rule who resisted allowing women to vote.<ref name=\"BBCWomen\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43081429|title=Did the Empire resist women's suffrage in India?|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|date=2018-02-22|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB}}</ref> The Women's Indian Association (WIA) was founded in 1917. It sought votes for women and the right to hold legislative office on the same basis as men. These positions were endorsed by the main political groupings, the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref name = Basu>Aparna Basu, \"Women's Struggle for the Vote: 1917\u20131937,\" ''Indian Historical Review,'' (Jan 2008) 35#1 pp. 128\u201343</ref> British and [[Feminism in India|Indian feminists]] combined in 1918 to publish a magazine ''Stri Dharma'' that featured international news from a feminist perspective.<ref>Michelle Elizabeth Tusan, \"Writing Stri Dharma: international feminism, nationalist politics, and women's press advocacy in late colonial India,\" ''[[Women's History Review]],'' (Dec 2003) 12#4 pp. 623\u201349</ref> In 1919 in the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]], the British set up provincial legislatures which had the power to grant women's suffrage. Madras in 1921 granted votes to wealthy and educated women, under the same terms that applied to men. The other provinces followed, but not the princely states (which did not have votes for men either, being [[monarchy|monarchies]]).<ref name = Basu/> In [[Bengal]] province, the provincial assembly rejected it in 1921 but Southard shows an intense campaign produced victory in 1921. Success in Bengal depended on middle class Indian women, who emerged from a fast-growing urban elite. The women leaders in Bengal linked their crusade to a moderate nationalist agenda, by showing how they could participate more fully in nation-building by having voting power. They carefully avoided attacking traditional gender roles by arguing that traditions could coexist with political modernization.<ref>Barbara Southard, \"Colonial Politics and Women's Rights: Woman Suffrage Campaigns in Bengal, British India in the 1920s,\" ''[[Modern Asian Studies]],'' (March 1993) 27#2 pp. 397\u2013439</ref>\n\nWhereas wealthy and educated women in Madras were granted voting right in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 irrespective of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This happened when the Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[sacred scripture]] of the Sikh faith.\n\nIn the [[Government of India Act 1935]] the [[British Raj]] set up a system of separate electorates and separate seats for women. Most women's leaders opposed segregated electorates and demanded adult franchise. In 1931 the Congress promised universal adult franchise when it came to power. It enacted equal voting rights for both men and women in 1947.<ref>Basu (Jan 2008), 140\u201343</ref>\n\n====Indonesia====\n[[Indonesia]] granted women voting rights for municipal councils in 1905. Only men who could read and write could vote, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the [[Literacy|literacy rate]] for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group that pressed for women's suffrage in Indonesia was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association), founded in the [[Netherlands]] in 1894. VVV tried to attract Indonesian members, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the first national representative body, the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]], was formed which still excluded women from voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, women gained the right to be elected to urban representative institutions, which led to some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, only European women and municipal councils could vote,{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}<!-- how can a municipal council be a voter? --> excluding all other women and [[Local government|local councils]]. In September 1941, the Volksraad extended the vote to women of all races. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (subject to property and educational qualifications).<ref name=Blackburn>Blackburn, Susan, 'Winning the Vote for Women in Indonesia' ''Australian Feminist Studies'', Volume 14, Number 29, 1 April 1999, pp. 207\u201318</ref>\n\n====Iran====\n{{see also|1963 Iranian referendum}}\nA [[1963 Iranian referendum|referendum in January 1963]] overwhelmingly approved by voters gave women the right to vote, a right previously denied to them under the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|Iranian Constitution of 1906]] pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 3.<ref name=Timeline />\n\n====Israel====\nWomen have had full suffrage since the [[Israel's independence|establishment]] of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948.\n\nThe first woman to be elected [[Prime Minister of Israel]] was [[Golda Meir]] in 1969.\n\n====Japan====\n[[File:Woman's Rights Meeting Tokyo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Women's Rights meeting in [[Tokyo]], to push for women's suffrage]]\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Japan}}\n\nAlthough women were allowed to vote in some prefectures in 1880, women's suffrage was enacted at a national level in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305105909/http://www.ichikawa-fusae.or.jp/110/main.htm |archivedate=2008-03-05 |title=The Fusae Ichikawa Memorial Association |publisher=Ichikawa-fusae.or.jp |accessdate=2011-01-08}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 14 January 2014.</ref>\n\n'''Korea'''\n\nSouth Korean women were granted the vote in 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/empowerment-women-south-korea|title=The Empowerment of Women in South Korea|date=2014-03-11|work=JIA SIPA|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Kuwait====\n{{Main|Women's suffrage in Kuwait}}\nWhen voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the [[right to vote]].<ref name=\"stat\">{{Cite book|year=2001|title=African Women and Children: Crisis and Response|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanwomenchil00rwom/page/8 8]|author=Apollo Rwomire|isbn=978-0-275-96218-0}}</ref> The right was later removed.

The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a white settler nation. While the women's suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of white women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked white women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \"racial degeneration.\"<ref>Anne-Marie.

The first major victories for extending the civil rights of women occurred in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|Province of San Juan]].  Women had been allowed to vote in that province since 1862, but only in municipal elections.  A similar right was extended in the [[Santa Fe Province|province of Santa Fe]] where a constitution that ensured women's suffrage was enacted at the municipal level, although female participation in votes initially remained low. In 1927, San Juan sanctioned its Constitution and broadly recognized the equal rights of men and women. However, the [[1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat|1930 coup]] overthrew these advances.\n\n[[File:Buenos Aires - Balvanera - Manifestaci\u00f3n por el voto femenino en 1948.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Women's demonstration in Buenos Aires in front of the National Congress by law for universal suffrage, 1947]]\n\nA great pioneer of women's suffrage was [[Julieta Lanteri]], the daughter of Italian immigrants, who in 1910 requested a national court to grant her the right to citizenship (at the time not generally given to single female immigrants) as well as suffrage. The Claros judge upheld her request and declared: \"As a judge, I have a duty to declare that her right to citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore that women enjoy the same political rights as the laws grant to male citizens, with the only restrictions expressly determined such laws, because no inhabitant is deprived of what they do not prohibit.\"\n\nIn July 1911, [[Julieta Lanteri|Dr. Lanteri]] were enumerated, and on November 26 of that year exercised her right to vote, the first Ibero-American woman to vote. Also covered in a judgment in 1919 was presented as a candidate for national deputy for the Independent Centre Party, obtaining 1,730 votes out of 154,302.\n\nIn 1919, Rogelio Araya UCR Argentina had gone down in history for being the first to submit a bill recognizing the right to vote for women, an essential component of universal suffrage. On July 17, 1919, he served as deputy national on behalf of the people of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]].\n\nOn February 27, 1946, three days after the [[1946 Argentine general election|elections]] that consecrated president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his wife First Lady [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] 26 years of age gave his first political speech in an organized women to thank them for their support of Per\u00f3n's candidacy. On that occasion, Eva demanded equal rights for men and women and particularly, women's suffrage:\n\n{{quote|The woman Argentina has exceeded the period of civil tutorials. Women must assert their action, women should vote. The woman, moral spring home, you should take the place in the complex social machinery of the people. He asks a necessity new organize more extended and remodeled groups. It requires, in short, the transformation of the concept of woman who sacrificially has increased the number of its duties without seeking the minimum of their rights.}}\n\nThe bill was presented the new constitutional government assumed immediately after the May 1, 1946. The opposition of conservative bias was evident, not only the opposition parties but even within parties who supported [[Peronism]]. Eva Per\u00f3n constantly pressured the parliament for approval, even causing protests from the latter for this intrusion.\n\nAlthough it was a brief text in three articles, that practically could not give rise to discussions, the Senate recently gave preliminary approval to the project August 21, 1946, and had to wait over a year for the House of Representative to publish the September 9, 1947 Law 13,010, establishing equal political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in [[Argentina]]. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously.\n\n[[File:Eva Per\u00f3n votando.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Eva Per\u00f3n]] voting at the hospital in 1951. It was the first time women had been permitted to vote in national elections in Argentina. To this end Per\u00f3n received the Civic Book No. 00.000.001. It was the first and only time she would vote; Per\u00f3n died July 26, 1952 after developing cervical cancer.]]\n\nIn an official statement on national television, Eva Per\u00f3n announced the extension of suffrage to Argentina's women:\n\n{{quote|Women of this country, this very instant I receive from the Government the law that enshrines our civic rights. And I receive it in front of you, with the confidence that I do so on behalf and in the name of all Argentinian women. I do so joyously, as I feel my hands tremble upon contact with victory proclaiming laurels. Here it is, my sisters, summarized into few articles of compact letters lies a long history of battles, stumbles, and hope.\nBecause of this, in it there lie exasperating indignation, shadows of menacing sunsets, but also cheerful awakenings of triumphal auroras. And the latter which translates the victory of women over the incomprehensions, the denials, and the interests created by the castes now repudiated by our national awakening.\nAnd a leader who destiny forged to victoriously face the problems of our era, General [Per\u00f3n]. With him, and our vote we shall contribute to the perfection of Argentina's democracy, my dear comrades.}}\n\nOn 23 September 1947, they enacted the Female Enrollment Act (No. 13,010) during the first presidency of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, which was implemented in the [[1951 Argentine general election|elections of November 11, 1951]], in which 3,816,654 women voted (63.9% voted for the [[Justicialist Party]] and 30.8% for the [[Radical Civic Union]]). Later in 1952, the first 23 senators and deputies took their seats, representing the Justicialist Party.\n\n====Brazil====\n[[File:Primeiras eleitoras do Brasil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|First women electors of Brazil, Rio Grande do Norte, 1928.]]\nWomen were granted the right to vote and be elected in Electoral Code of 1932, followed by Brazilian Constitution of 1934.

''Woman Suffrage in Mexico''. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1962.</ref>\n\n====Venezuela====\nAfter the [[Generation of 1928|1928 Student Protests]], women started participating more actively in politics.  In 1935, women's rights supporters founded the Feminine Cultural Group (known as 'ACF' from its initials in Spanish), with the goal of tackling women's problems. The group supported women's political and social rights, and believed it was necessary to involve and inform women about these issues in order to ensure their personal development. It went on to give seminars, as well as founding night schools and the House of Laboring Women.\n\nGroups looking to reform the 1936 Civil Code of Conduct in conjunction with the Venezuelan representation to the Union of American Women called the First Feminine Venezuelan Congress in 1940. In this congress, delegates discussed the situation of women in Venezuela and their demands. Key goals were women's suffrage and a reform to the Civil Code of Conduct. Around twelve thousand signatures were collected and handed to the Venezuelan Congress, which reformed the Civil Code of Conduct in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, groups supporting women's suffrage, the most important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained the right to vote at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the Correo C\u00edvico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the [[1945 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat|1945 Venezuelan Coup d'\u00c9tat]] and the [[1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election|call for a new Constitution]], to which women were elected, women's suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.\n\n==In non-religious organizations==\nThe right of women to vote has sometimes been denied in non-religious organizations; for example, it was not until 1964 that women in the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] in the United States were first allowed to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nad.org/nad-history#1970s |title=NAD History; National Association of the Deaf |publisher=Nad.org |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n===Catholicism===\nThe [[Pope]] is elected by the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp |title=How is the Pope elected? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=2005-04-06 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}</ref> Women are not appointed as cardinals, and therefore women cannot vote for the Pope.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |title=Women and the Priesthood |publisher=Catholic.com |accessdate=2011-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904055106/http://www.catholic.com/library/Women_and_the_Priesthood.asp |archivedate=2011-09-04 |df= }}</ref> The female Catholic offices of [[Abbess]] or Mother Superior are elective, the choice being made by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{see also|Women in Islam}}\nIn some countries, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Goodstein|first1=Laurie}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{see also|Women in Judaism}}\nIn Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and most Orthodox Jewish movements women have the right to vote.

He found work among publications such as ''Trossos'', ''La C\u00f2nsola'' (1919\u20131920) or ''La Publicitat'' (1923\u20131936), where he worked as an art director.\n\nAt the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], Foix returned to the familiar business, and his artistic presence for some time receded. During this time he also compiled his entire poetic opus, and he acted as a mentor for young artists adjacent to the avant-garde scene, such as [[Joan Brossa]].\n\nOn 25 May 1962, he became a member of the ''Institut d'Estudis Catalans''. His popularity continued to grow, with thanks to [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] and his song ''\u00c9s quan dormo que hi veig clar'', which was adapted from one of Foix's poems.\n\nHe received many different awards during his life. Included among them are the [[Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] (''Medalla d'Or de la Generalitat de Catalunya'', 1981) and the [[Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes|Catalan Literary Lifetime Achievement Award]] (''Premi d'Honor de les Lletres catalanes'', 1984).

He usually signed his work by using the abbreviation '''J.V. Foix'''.\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in [[Sarri\u00e0, Barcelona]], Foix was a son of one of a baker. He started university studies in law, but soon left them after the second course. Later, he worked in the familiar business as well as he read classic masterpieces of literature by authors such as [[Lord Byron]], [[Dante Alighieri]] or [[Charles Baudelaire]]. Foix remained rooted to the place where he was born, even after the conclusion of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lletra.net/en/author/j-v-foix/a-selection-of-texts |title=Biography at lletrA (English) |publisher=Lletra.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref> Foix's work had consistent liberal tone; he also generally introduced [[avant-garde]] ideas to [[Catalonia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=b619d5e5d74d6210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b619d5e5d74d6210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=detall2&contentid=7a41ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&newLang=en_GB |title=Gencat.cat-Modernisme and Noucentisme trends (English) |publisher=0.gencat.cat |accessdate=2012-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310150716/http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/culturacatalana/menuitem.be2bc4cc4c5aec88f94a9710b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=b619d5e5d74d6210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b619d5e5d74d6210VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=detall2&contentid=7a41ef7fb89d7210VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&newLang=en_GB |archivedate=2012-03-10 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, Foix began to collaborate with ''La Revista'' and started to become interested in avant-garde art. He found work among publications such as ''Trossos'', ''La C\u00f2nsola'' (1919\u20131920) or ''La Publicitat'' (1923\u20131936), where he worked as an art director.\n\nAt the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], Foix returned to the familiar business, and his artistic presence for some time receded. During this time he also compiled his entire poetic opus, and he acted as a mentor for young artists adjacent to the avant-garde scene, such as [[Joan Brossa]].\n\nOn 25 May 1962, he became a member of the ''Institut d'Estudis Catalans''. His popularity continued to grow, with thanks to [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] and his song ''\u00c9s quan dormo que hi veig clar'', which was adapted from one of Foix's poems.\n\nHe received many different awards during his life. Included among them are the [[Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] (''Medalla d'Or de la Generalitat de Catalunya'', 1981) and the [[Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes|Catalan Literary Lifetime Achievement Award]] (''Premi d'Honor de les Lletres catalanes'', 1984).

Adnan Darwiche threatened Razzak, saying ''\"OK I can do this anytime...I want you to give me Bilal or he must leave the country.\"''\n\nRazzak obliged on 7 March 2001, fleeing to Lebanon.

He abandoned his drug business and became deeply [[religious]], attending the [[Hajj]] in 2002 and 2003. There was peace between the families.\n\n===The shooting of Khaled Taleb: 30 July 2003===\n\nThe feud was reignited more than 2 years after the [[kneecapping]] of Bilal Razzak.\n\nTaleb, who had been Adnan Darwiche's right-hand man in his former drug business, was shot by 2 masked men as he spoke to a friend in the Halal's Butcher shop in [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]]. He was shot in both legs. Taleb believed that the gunmen were Gehad and Ziad Razzak, although nobody was ever charged in relation to the shooting.\n\nAccording to Taleb, Adnan Darwiche said that if the Razzaks were responsible then ''\" they're gonna cop it, they're dead...this is it I'm either gonna die or spend the rest of my life in gaol, it's on\"'' and ''\"this was it the Razzak's and they were all dead\"''.\n\n===The Yanderra Street shooting: 27 August 2003===\n\nAdnan Darwiche concluded that the Razzaks were responsible. According to Taleb, on 25 August 2003 Adnan and Abdul Darwiche, Touma and Aouad visited him and told him they had discovered that Gehad and Ziad Razzak were living at Yanderra Street, Condell Park. Adnan Darwiche said ''\"this is what's gonna happen. Fidel can drive down the road and shoot at their house, then they come out to see what the fuck happened, I and Abdul will be standing on the corner with SKS's and blast em\"''.\n\nOn the evening of 27 August, 2003 Adnan Darwiche and another man (suspected to be Abdul Darwiche, although he was later acquitted) took up positions near the Yanderra Street house. They were both armed with [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s. A third man (suspected to be Aouad, although he was never charged) drove to the house and fired 11 shots at a car parked outside the house.\n\nFarouk Razzak came out of the house to investigate. He saw \"like some shadow go towards the right, under the dark, the trees... suddenly I see two different persons. Since I saw them, I yell to them, I swear to them 'Hey boy, what you fucking' \u2013 and then the fire comes out of the gun, they did not let me finish my words... and I turn back and I walk just normal. I didn't run. I walk normal until I get the screen door, the screen door lock by itself. I put the handle and the bullets, I think it must miss my eyes maybe one millimeter and, my head, my everywhere. They stop me. I think second on the door, I can't move. The handle comes off in my hand, and I feel burn\".\n\nThe gunmen fired 55 rounds, but Farouk Razzak was not hit. Nor were the other occupants of the house, his wife Nahla, son Mohamad and daughter Jomana. The gunmen were so inaccurate that shots hit houses as far east as no. 96 (five houses down the street). Farouk yelled to Nahla \"Listen, that pigs, Abdul and Eddie, they shot me\".<ref name=\"2006 NSWSC 848\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|848|2006|litigants=R v Abdul Darwiche |date=8 March 2006 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Taleb, Darwiche said after the shooting ''\"Ziggy came out on the porch and then Frank came out. Ziggy had a gun and was looking around. I and Abdul blasted em, fuckin missed.\"'' and ''\"Fuck them. Fuck all of them.\"''\n\n===The murder of Ali Abdul Razzak: 29 August 2003===\n\nAccording to Jamal Razzak, he was assaulted by Adnan and Abdul Darwiche and another man in Greenacre at 11:30 am. He alleged that Abdul Darwiche pointed an assault style rifle at him through the passenger window of a vehicle. No charges were ever laid in relation to this alleged incident.\n\nAt 1:23 pm Ali Abdul Razzak was shot and killed while seated in his car which was parked near the Lakemba Mosque. Witnesses observed a small black hatchback vehicle that stopped in front of Razzak's vehicle. The driver and passenger of the black hatchback were wearing balaclavas. The passenger got out of the car, holding a black pistol. He fired shots at Razzak and got back into the passenger seat of the vehicle, which drove off. 14 fired cartridge cases were found at the scene.\n\nAccording to Taleb, he was visited at his sister's house at about 2:00 pm by Adnan Darwiche, Gary Awad and Touma. Darwiche said ''\"I waited, when he got in the car I unloaded a magazine on him, I saw one bullet hit him just above the eyebrow. I saw him take his last breath.\"'' and gave Taleb a.40 calibre Glock pistol to get rid of.\n\nDarwiche was later acquitted of Razzak's murder and nobody else has ever been charged.\n\nOn 30 August 2003 55 shots were fired at Aouad's family home in Liverpool and 65 shots fired at Taleb's house in Liverpool. According to Taleb, Aouad said to him a few days later ''\"I know it was that cunt Hussein'' [Fahda]'', Gehad, Ziggy, and Mohammed for sure there's no doubt about it. They're going to cop it, they're gonna cop it, they're dead, my parents nearly got hit.\"''\n\n===Stolen weapons: September/October 2003===\n\nMeanwhile, 31 Glock pistols were stolen from Obliging Security in Chester Hill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/04/1062548951407.html?from=storyrhs|title=Robbers steal 34 guns from Obliging Security|date=2003-09-04|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> (One of those weapons would later be found at the scene of a shootout involving El-Zeyat and Aouad.)\n\nZiad and Gehad Razzak went into hiding and stayed with a friend, Ali Hamka, who lived at 5 Lawford Street, Greenacre. Hamka's partner, Mervat Nemra, and their 2 young children went to stay with relatives.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 Adnan Darwiche allegedly purchased a rocket launcher from Taha Abdul Rahman for $15,000 and on 9 October 2003 allegedly purchased a further 6 rocket launchers from Rahman, on-selling 5 of them to Mohammad Ali Elomar, who was allegedly involved in a plot to blow up parliament house and/or the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights, saying ''\"Look what is happening overseas. It is a war against Muslims. We should do something about it over here.\"''.

According to Taleb, he accompanied Darwiche on a drive past the house. A man later given the pseudonym \"Mr. W\" testified that Osman drove him past the house, saying ''\"Just drive past, I don't want the Razzaks to recognize the car or me.

He said ''\"I will see you at Erdt's at two o'clock in the morning. At three o'clock there are going to be fireworks.\"''\n\nAccording to Taleb, a Nissan Pulsar was stolen and driven to El-Zeyat's house. Present were Adnan Darwiche, Taleb, El-Zeyat, Aouad, Osman Darwiche, and Awad. There was a discussion about whether or not to use the rocket launcher in the assault. Osman told Adnan ''\"you can't just use that because like you are meant to put them things on your ears to block your ears. You cannot use it if you were to use it like that. It will blow your eardrums out.\"'' It was decided not to use the rocket launcher. Adnan outlined each man's role: Taleb was to have been the driver, but it was considered that due to his injuries, he would become a liability if there was trouble. Osman was assigned the role of driver. Adnan and Touma were to use the [[SKS]] rifles, Aouad was to use a [[Mac 10]]. El-Zeyat insisted that he wanted to be one of the shooters too, and he was drafted into the plans and assigned a Glock. Adnan instructed that the shooters should fire on the house in an \"S\" shape in case the occupants of the house dropped to the floor.\n\nAt 3:00 am Osman dropped the other men off near Lawford Street.

Taleb believed that the gunmen were Gehad and Ziad Razzak, although nobody was ever charged in relation to the shooting.\n\nAccording to Taleb, Adnan Darwiche said that if the Razzaks were responsible then ''\" they're gonna cop it, they're dead...this is it I'm either gonna die or spend the rest of my life in gaol, it's on\"'' and ''\"this was it the Razzak's and they were all dead\"''.\n\n===The Yanderra Street shooting: 27 August 2003===\n\nAdnan Darwiche concluded that the Razzaks were responsible. According to Taleb, on 25 August 2003 Adnan and Abdul Darwiche, Touma and Aouad visited him and told him they had discovered that Gehad and Ziad Razzak were living at Yanderra Street, Condell Park. Adnan Darwiche said ''\"this is what's gonna happen. Fidel can drive down the road and shoot at their house, then they come out to see what the fuck happened, I and Abdul will be standing on the corner with SKS's and blast em\"''.\n\nOn the evening of 27 August, 2003 Adnan Darwiche and another man (suspected to be Abdul Darwiche, although he was later acquitted) took up positions near the Yanderra Street house. They were both armed with [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s. A third man (suspected to be Aouad, although he was never charged) drove to the house and fired 11 shots at a car parked outside the house.\n\nFarouk Razzak came out of the house to investigate. He saw \"like some shadow go towards the right, under the dark, the trees...suddenly I see two different persons. Since I saw them I yell to them, I swear to them 'Hey boy, what you fucking' \u2013 and then the fire comes out of the gun, they did not let me finish my words...and I turn back and I walk just normal. I didn't run. I walk normal until I get the screen door, the screen door lock by itself. I put the handle and the bullets, I think it must miss my eyes maybe one millimeter and, my head, my everywhere. They stop me. I think second on the door, I can't move. The handle comes off in my hand, and I feel burn\".\n\nThe gunmen fired 55 rounds, but Farouk Razzak was not hit. Nor were the other occupants of the house, his wife Nahla, son Mohamad and daughter Jomana. The gunmen were so inaccurate that shots hit houses as far east as no. 96 (five houses down the street). Farouk yelled to Nahla \"Listen, that pigs, Abdul and Eddie, they shot me\".<ref name=\"2006 NSWSC 848\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|848|2006|litigants=R v Abdul Darwiche |date=8 March 2006 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Taleb, Darwiche said after the shooting ''\"Ziggy came out on the porch and then Frank came out. Ziggy had a gun and was looking around. I and Abdul blasted em, fuckin missed.\"'' and ''\"Fuck them. Fuck all of them.\"''\n\n===The murder of Ali Abdul Razzak: 29 August 2003===\n\nAccording to Jamal Razzak, he was assaulted by Adnan and Abdul Darwiche and another man in Greenacre at 11:30 am. He alleged that Abdul Darwiche pointed an assault style rifle at him through the passenger window of a vehicle. No charges were ever laid in relation to this alleged incident.\n\nAt 1:23 pm Ali Abdul Razzak was shot and killed while seated in his car which was parked near the Lakemba Mosque. Witnesses observed a small black hatchback vehicle that stopped in front of Razzak's vehicle. The driver and passenger of the black hatchback were wearing balaclavas. The passenger got out of the car, holding a black pistol. He fired shots at Razzak and got back into the passenger seat of the vehicle, which drove off. 14 fired cartridge cases were found at the scene.\n\nAccording to Taleb, he was visited at his sister's house at about 2:00 pm by Adnan Darwiche, Gary Awad and Touma. Darwiche said ''\"I waited, when he got in the car I unloaded a magazine on him, I saw one bullet hit him just above the eyebrow. I saw him take his last breath.\"'' and gave Taleb a.40 calibre Glock pistol to get rid of.\n\nDarwiche was later acquitted of Razzak's murder and nobody else has ever been charged.\n\nOn 30 August 2003 55 shots were fired at Aouad's family home in Liverpool and 65 shots fired at Taleb's house in Liverpool. According to Taleb, Aouad said to him a few days later ''\"I know it was that cunt Hussein'' [Fahda]'', Gehad, Ziggy, and Mohammed for sure there's no doubt about it. They're going to cop it, they're gonna cop it, they're fuckin' dead, my parents nearly got hit.\"''\n\n===Stolen weapons: September/October 2003===\n\nMeanwhile, 31 Glock pistols were stolen from Obliging Security in Chester Hill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/04/1062548951407.html?from=storyrhs|title=Robbers steal 34 guns from Obliging Security|date=2003-09-04|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> (One of those weapons would later be found at the scene of a shootout involving El-Zeyat and Aouad.)\n\nZiad and Gehad Razzak went into hiding and stayed with a friend, Ali Hamka, who lived at 5 Lawford Street, Greenacre. Hamka's partner, Mervat Nemra, and their 2 young children went to stay with relatives.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 Adnan Darwiche allegedly purchased a rocket launcher from Taha Abdul Rahman for $15,000 and on 9 October 2003 allegedly purchased a further 6 rocket launchers from Rahman, on-selling 5 of them to Mohammad Ali Elomar, who was allegedly involved in a plot to blow up parliament house and/or the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights, saying ''\"Look what is happening overseas.

According to Taleb, he accompanied Darwiche on a drive past the house. A man later given the pseudonym \"Mr. W\" testified that Osman drove him past the house, saying ''\"Just drive past, I don't want the Razzaks to recognize the car or me.

He said ''\"I will see you at Erdt's at two o'clock in the morning. At three o'clock there are going to be fireworks.\"''\n\nAccording to Taleb, a Nissan Pulsar was stolen and driven to El-Zeyat's house. Present were Adnan Darwiche, Taleb, El-Zeyat, Aouad, Osman Darwiche, and Awad. There was a discussion about whether or not to use the rocket launcher in the assault. Osman told Adnan ''\"you can't just use that because like you are meant to put them things on your ears to block your ears. You cannot use it if you were to use it like that. It will blow your eardrums out.\"'' It was decided not to use the rocket launcher. Adnan outlined each man's role: Taleb was to have been the driver, but it was considered that due to his injuries, he would become a liability if there was trouble. Osman was assigned the role of driver. Adnan and Touma were to use the [[SKS]] rifles, Aouad was to use a [[Mac 10]]. El-Zeyat insisted that he wanted to be one of the shooters too, and he was drafted into the plans and assigned a Glock. Adnan instructed that the shooters should fire on the house in an \"S\" shape in case the occupants of the house dropped to the floor.\n\nAt 3:00 am Osman dropped the other men off near Lawford Street.

During this time, [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] and the Vedic peoples made way into the territory of India and made a set of religious texts known as the [[Vedas]], hence the time period known as [[Vedic period|the Vedic Age]] (1700 - 600 BC).<ref name=\":1\" /> With [[Hinduism]] also on the rise, it gave way to independent states where each had to maintain peace and order with other neighbouring independent states. Unlike most independent states, there were differences in power among those residing in India. This however did not last due to the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]] preventing sovereign states from acquiring power. The Mauryan Empire lasted from 272 BC to 231 BC in which the death of the last ruler [[Ashoka|Asoka]] allowed the next empire (the [[Mughal Empire]]) to reestablish new sovereign states.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=John F.|date=1997|title=Early Modern India and World History|journal=Journal of World History|volume=8|issue=2|pages=197\u2013209|jstor=20068593|doi=10.1353/jwh.2005.0071}}</ref>\n\n=== Inca ===\nThe [[Inca Empire]] (1430AD to 1530AD) had developed to become a territorial state. It is estimated that the rule was imposed through an administrative system of 8 to 12 million people. Territories were divided into 80 provinces that were ruled by the Inca government and that was divided by rulers. The formation of the provinces ever under the rule of small political groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Pakistan- An Archaeological History.

Inca rulers would have people live in open settled areas for the land to be used, worked and watched. Much of the agriculture formation of land was terracing. Many laborers would work on new agricultural land. Rulers were in control of all agricultural work as well as other man labor work such as llama herding, and pottery.\n\n== Rise of the territorial state ==\nThere are a few accepted theories on the emergence of territorial states and they both concern money and war with each stressing one over the other. The mainstream view of territorial state formation emerged around the 12th century as a consequence of the transfer of royal sovereign rights for a particular region to a feudal lord. This meant that within territories unrestrained feudal jurisdiction gave way to a larger central authority that maintained a more stable territory through bureaucracy, a skilled and qualified army, and taxation. This is unlike the medieval hierarchical structure of control and jurisdiction that was in a state of perpetual uncertainty threatened by a shift in the balance of power.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Herz|first=John H.|date=1957|title=Rise and Demise of The Territorial State|journal=World Politics|volume=9|issue=4|pages=473\u2013493|doi=10.2307/2009421|jstor=2009421}}</ref> The idea of sovereignty emerged from a struggle of power between authoritative institutions like \"emperors and popes, popes and kings, and kings and emperors.\"<ref>Herz (1957), pg. 475.</ref> The idea of a \"collective\" of nations that maintained a \"rule of law\" that offered a more stable security from the abuses typical of the medieval hierarchical authority and power structure.<ref name=\"Herz 1957, pg. 474\">Herz (1957), pg. 474.</ref> Within ancient rulers it was important that their state/empire foundation was constant with ethnic diversity, growth of population, economic and ecological diversity and an organized bureaucracy.\n\n=== Coercion ===\nIt has been debated amongst scholars that a main motivating factor in territorial state formation was the control and exploitation of the territorial resources by force, which was the main source of revenue for the state. It was important to maintain control over the areas resources because failure to do so resulted in a loss in revenue, which weakened the states authority.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jieli|date=2002|title=State Fragmentation: Toward a Theoretical Understanding of the Territorial Power of the State|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=20|issue=2|pages=139\u2013156|jstor=3108643|doi=10.1111/1467-9558.00156}}</ref> People will always recognise the authority of the political unit that offers protection and security.<ref name=\"Herz 1957, pg. 474\"/> It is widely considered that the only states to have emerged were the ones that could compete in war with other territorial states that resulted in states forming large military forces with technological and tactical advantages.<ref>Abramson (Winter 2017), pg. 107.</ref> Designated the military revolution, in Europe between 1500 and 1700 occurred a high frequency of wars that got bigger and lasted longer.

The spirit of \"exploration and commerce\" that began as maritime routes and destination points on a map eventually gave way to the idea of a bound world as a place of outlined territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Philip E.|date=2005|title=Insularity, Sovereignty and Statehood: The Representation of Islands on Portolan Charts and the Construction of the Territorial State|journal=Geografiska Annaler.

Without any urban or commercial growth being found in a particular area, the chances of a large territorial rule happening increases. This can be seen with such nations like France or England in which monarchs forcibly took control of these territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Scott F|date=2016-12-15|title=The Economic Origins of the Territorial State|journal=International Organization|volume=71|issue=1|pages=97\u2013130|doi=10.1017/s0020818316000308|issn=0020-8183}}</ref> As seen later on, the increase in prosperous cities correlated with the increase in consumer demand.

Even in the territories that had separate branches of power or semi-independent political units, it is necessary that these branches or political units adhered to a single executive entity. For Example, all of the counties that were part of the Bavarian branch of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] fell under  a single territorial state. Even though these counties were partially independent, they still fell under a common executive, which was the Bavarian branch of the Wittelsbach family.<ref>Abramson (2016), pg.103</ref> The Palestinian branch of the House of Wittelsbach was a different territorial state, because even though the executive of this state stems from the same family, the [[Treaty of Pavia (1329)|Treaty of Pavia]] separated the two branches, resulting in two separate territorial states. Through the recognition of a shared executive, the separate smaller political units are able to qualify as part of a single territorial state. Feudal territories also should not be treated as part of a territorial state, unless they are integrated into a larger political unit that falls under the rule of a common executive.<ref>Ambramson (2016), pg.104</ref>\n\nScholars state that it is important to analyze the power dynamics of the separate units that fall under a common executive to decide whether or not they form part of the territorial state. For instance, in situations where monarch divides their territory between their heirs, and these new executives develop separate political units, the territories no longer can be considered a single territorial state.<ref>Ambramson (2016), pg.104</ref> In other instances where the larger common executive does not have economic or militaristic control over the smaller semi-independent political unit, then the smaller political unit cannot be considered part of the territorial state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Cartography ===\n[[File:Petrus Roselli - Portolan Chart of the Mediterranean (1466).png|thumb|443x443px|Portolan Chart of the Mediterranean circa 1466]]\nAlthough it is not the mainstream view, the development of cartography alongside territorial expansion can also be linked to the development of  the territorial state. Cartography was a very important use of keep in order how owned land, land survey was also used by the state and landlords to keep track of land mostly for control. Indeed, it is a unit bound by lines on charts and maps. The practice itself easily supports the idea of creating a sovereign unit that is unified and bound by a single governmental authority.<ref>Steinberg (2005), pg. 253.</ref> The [[Treaty of Nerchinsk|treaty at Nerchinsk]] is an example of how mutual trade benefits from commercial markets encouraged peaceful negotiations between the Chinese Qing emperor and the Russian tsar that resulted in the defining and mapping the borders between the two states.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perdue|first=Peter C.|date=2010|title=Boundaries and Trade in the Early Modern World: Negotiations at Nerchinsk and Beijing|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=43|issue=3|pages=341\u2013356|jstor=25642205|doi=10.1353/ecs.0.0187}}</ref> [[Portolan chart]]s, which were used since the 13th century developed the technique of representing a unified political space with bounded lines. For example, typical of many portolan charts representing Great Britain had England bound separately from Scotland as two distinct political entities.<ref>Steinberg (2005), pg. 256-60.</ref> In the [[New World]] Spanish imperial cartography used the church as a symbol of a defined unified Catholic territory. The English colonies left their maps void of indigenous populations which left the lands mostly marked as empty and unoccupied. New World maps were created for the purpose of finding out where places and people were located in an ever expansive territory. In the Russian conquest and mapping of Siberia, maps were divided into regions where indigenous populations under certain jurisdiction were located to be contacted later.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The imperial map : cartography and the mastery of empire|last=Kivelson|first=Valerie|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Akerman, James R.|year=2009|isbn=9780226010762|location=Chicago|pages=50\u20136|oclc=191090324}}</ref> Centuries after their aspirations to map the extent of territorial states, lines or dotted lines on a map became the definition of a political units claim to an area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The cartographic state : maps, territory and the origins of sovereignty|last=Branch|first=Jordan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9781107497191|location=New York|pages=4|oclc=865078592}}</ref> This would result would occur from the significant cost to built an actual border in many areas.\n\n=== The Treaty of Westphalia ===\nIn 1648, two [[Westphalia]]n cities known as [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] located in [[Germany]] as well the [[Holy Roman Empire]] signed several peace treaties that ultimately gave end to the [[Thirty Years' War]].

Arquebuses first appeared in Ming China in the early 1540s with many pirates initially using them. However, Ming officials were eventually able to capture pirates with guns and thus began manufacturing those guns. The effort by the Ming to modernize their armies was spearheaded by Qi Jiguang, who only realized the power of the musket after being defeated in battle by Japanese pirates. Jiguang trained his soldiers to function in small, flexible units that could be composed of any type of weapon, including the new guns that had only so recently entered China. Jiguang also carefully drilled his troops in the use of this new weapon by having them memorize a song that would assist them in loading their muskets. However, even with Jiguang's efforts muskets were not fully or effectively incorporated into the Ming armies. When Jiguang was reassigned to the Northern frontier of China, he found that the soldiers were too entrenched in the old ways and refused to adopt the new weapons, even though the accuracy of the musket was far superior to that of the traditional weapons they used.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrade |first1=Tonio |title=The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0691178141 |page=172-180}}</ref>\n\nThe Ming were able to prove themselves against modern European armies in 1661 when the Ming dynasty launched an invasion of Taiwan which was under Dutch control at the time under the command of a Ming warlord named Zheng Chenggong. 10 years prior to this invasion, the Dutch had put down a peasant revolt in Taiwan with only 120 troops because the peasants were undisciplined and routed easily during their battle with the Dutch. Now, under Chenggong, the Chinese troops maintained their formation as they approached the Dutch forces, even though they were under fire from not only the Dutch land-based muskets but also by Dutch vessels which fired into Chenggong's troops at very close range. However, the highly trained and disciplined troops never broke ranks and when the Dutch realized this, along with the fact that they had been outflanked by a small force sent around them, they were the ones that fled the field of battle. After this point, the Dutch were never able to defeat Zheng's armies in a pitched battle. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrade |first1=Tonio |title=The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0691178141 |page=190-192}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the Ming dynasty though, the Qing dynasty which replaced the Ming was much more willing to adopt these new technologies and use them to conquer their neighbours, thus ushering in a new age of Chinese dominance in East Asia. Their adaptation and use of the new gunpowder technology can be best seen in their conflict with the Russian Empire for control over the Amur Valley, which today is still the border region between China and Russia. When the Russians and the Chinese, along with Korean allies, first engaged each other, about 370 Russian troops attempted to engage a Qing and Korean allied force of about 1,000 troops. Although the Qing troops didn't perform as well as their Korean counterparts, they still contributed during the battle, especially as the Russians were retreating. During the second and final battle between these two forces, the Russians fielded 500 musketeers while the combined Qing and Korean force was able to muster 1,400 soldiers, of which only 400 were using the new gunpowder technology. Again, the Russians were defeated by the Qing and Korean force with the Koreans especially playing a vital role in both battles. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrade |first1=Tonio |title=The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0691178141 |page=192-195}}</ref> Conflict between Russia and China would later cease due to the Treaty of Nerchinsk, which is a good example of diplomacy between two gunpowder empires, as the Russians also made use of gunpowder technologies to conquer their way across Eastern Europe and Central Asia to get to China in the first place.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perdue|first=Peter C.|date=2010|title=Boundaries and Trade in the Early Modern World: Negotiations at Nerchinsk and Beijing|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=43|issue=3|pages=341\u2013356|jstor=25642205|doi=10.1353/ecs.0.0187}}</ref>\n\n== Laws and decrees within a territorial state ==\nLaws authorized by the territorial prince were only valid within the defined region of his associated territorial state. These laws, which applied to the whole sovereign territory of the state, were also applicable to everyone living with the state, not just to its own [[citizen]]s. This was based on the principle of territoriality which stated that all people were subject to the sovereignty and laws of the state on whose soil they were located. As a result of agreements between territorial states, legal regulations could also apply abroad. In the [[European Union]] it can be seen that this principle has survived in the long run, even to the present day.\n\nDocuments dating back to the ancient states, have shown texts that have lists or descriptions of capitals, locations of tax stations and forts. The documents would also have alliances that were made through marriages, or treaties.\n\n== Rulers of territorial states ==\nThe aim of the respective territorial princes was to incorporate all the legal rights of a territory into their personal government and thus impose their personal claim to power over it. An early attempt at this was made by [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]] in the [[Stem Duchy of Saxony]], but his plans foundered due to resistance of competing rulers who had opposing rights within the same [[territory]]. An early successful example of the creation of a territorial lordship is the [[Archduchy of Austria]], which was able to be turned into a [[state lordship]] in 1359 through the forged ''[[privilegium maius]].'' Other personal claims of territories can be dated back to ancient rulers. Augustus had claimed to expand the Roman borders to Ethiopia, Arabia, Egypt and central Europe. Sargon II had also stated that he had captured the territory of his enemies with them becoming part of his new claimed land.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L.

Once rulers have conquered new land, it was viewed as expanding travels to their people. Another important intake of conquering land was the expansion of language, money and expanding political boundaries.\n\n== Characteristics of a territorial state ==\nThe territorial state prior to the French Revolution can be defined by three basic criteria. They are as follows:\n\n=== Direct military occupation. ===\nIf a people finds itself under military control it becomes part of that military's territorial state, whether or not it identifies with the occupiers. While there are often many political units within a territorial state they will be categorized as part of the larger territorial state with coercive military power.\n\n=== The capacity to tax. ===\nThe ability to enforce taxation is an important coercive power for states to possess. To be able to tax other smaller political units would show that the ruling territorial state maintains a [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] control with economically coercive means.\n\n=== A common executive. ===\nStates during this period were often composed of multiple semi-autonomous political entities. Despite this, these semi-autonomous entities were often headed by members of the ruling family and can thus be classified as sharing a common executive.<ref>Abramson (Winter 2017), pg. 103.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Territorialisation]]\n*[[Nation state|Nation State]]\n*[[Complex society|Complex societies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|}}\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n* Abramson, Scott F.

It is estimated that the rule was imposed through an administrative system of 8 to 12 million people. Territories were divided into 80 provinces that were ruled by the Inca government and that was divided by rulers. The formation of the provinces ever under the rule of small political groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Pakistan- An Archaeological History. Volume IV Harappan Civilization- Theortical and the Abstract|last=Ahmed|first=Mukhtar|publisher=Foursome Group|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Borders were watch to oversee who would enter and leave. Inca rulers would have people live in open settled areas for the land to be used, worked and watched. Much of the agriculture formation of land was terracing. Many laborers would work on new agricultural land. Rulers were in control of all agricultural work as well as other man labor work such as llama herding, and pottery.\n\n== Rise of the territorial state ==\nThere are a few accepted theories on the emergence of territorial states and they both concern money and war with each stressing one over the other. The mainstream view of territorial state formation emerged around the 12th century as a consequence of the transfer of royal sovereign rights for a particular region to a feudal lord. This meant that within territories unrestrained feudal jurisdiction gave way to a larger central authority that maintained a more stable territory through bureaucracy, a skilled and qualified army, and taxation. This is unlike the medieval hierarchical structure of control and jurisdiction that was in a state of perpetual uncertainty threatened by a shift in the balance of power.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Herz|first=John H.|date=1957|title=Rise and Demise of The Territorial State|journal=World Politics|volume=9|issue=4|pages=473\u2013493|doi=10.2307/2009421|jstor=2009421}}</ref> The idea of sovereignty emerged from a struggle of power between authoritative institutions like \"emperors and popes, popes and kings, and kings and emperors.\"<ref>Herz (1957), pg. 475.</ref> The idea of a \"collective\" of nations that maintained a \"rule of law\" that offered a more stable security from the abuses typical of the medieval hierarchical authority and power structure.<ref name=\"Herz 1957, pg. 474\">Herz (1957), pg. 474.</ref> Within ancient rulers it was important that their state/empire foundation was constant with ethnic diversity, growth of population, economic and ecological diversity and an organized bureaucracy.\n\n=== Coercion ===\nIt has been debated amongst scholars that a main motivating factor in territorial state formation was the control and exploitation of the territorial resources by force, which was the main source of revenue for the state. It was important to maintain control over the areas resources because failure to do so resulted in a loss in revenue, which weakened the states authority.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jieli|date=2002|title=State Fragmentation: Toward a Theoretical Understanding of the Territorial Power of the State|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=20|issue=2|pages=139\u2013156|jstor=3108643|doi=10.1111/1467-9558.00156}}</ref> People will always recognise the authority of the political unit that offers protection and security.<ref name=\"Herz 1957, pg. 474\"/> It is widely considered that the only states to have emerged were the ones that could compete in war with other territorial states that resulted in states forming large military forces with technological and tactical advantages.<ref>Abramson (Winter 2017), pg. 107.</ref> Designated the military revolution, in Europe between 1500 and 1700 occurred a high frequency of wars that got bigger and lasted longer.

The spirit of \"exploration and commerce\" that began as maritime routes and destination points on a map eventually gave way to the idea of a bound world as a place of outlined territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Philip E.|date=2005|title=Insularity, Sovereignty and Statehood: The Representation of Islands on Portolan Charts and the Construction of the Territorial State|journal=Geografiska Annaler.

Even in the territories that had separate branches of power or semi-independent political units, it is necessary that these branches or political units adhered to a single executive entity. For Example, all of the counties that were part of the Bavarian branch of the [[House of Wittelsbach]] fell under  a single territorial state. Even though these counties were partially independent, they still fell under a common executive, which was the Bavarian branch of the Wittelsbach family.<ref>Abramson (2016), pg.103</ref> The Palestinian branch of the House of Wittelsbach was a different territorial state, because even though the executive of this state stems from the same family, the [[Treaty of Pavia (1329)|Treaty of Pavia]] separated the two branches, resulting in two separate territorial states. Through the recognition of a shared executive, the separate smaller political units are able to qualify as part of a single territorial state. Feudal territories also should not be treated as part of a territorial state, unless they are integrated into a larger political unit that falls under the rule of a common executive.<ref>Ambramson (2016), pg.104</ref>\n\nScholars state that it is important to analyze the power dynamics of the separate units that fall under a common executive to decide whether or not they form part of the territorial state. For instance, in situations where monarch divides their territory between their heirs, and these new executives develop separate political units, the territories no longer can be considered a single territorial state.<ref>Ambramson (2016), pg.104</ref> In other instances where the larger common executive does not have economic or militaristic control over the smaller semi-independent political unit, then the smaller political unit cannot be considered part of the territorial state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Cartography ===\n[[File:Petrus Roselli - Portolan Chart of the Mediterranean (1466).png|thumb|443x443px|Portolan Chart of the Mediterranean circa 1466]]\nAlthough it is not the mainstream view, the development of cartography alongside territorial expansion can also be linked to the development of  the territorial state. Cartography was a very important use of keep in order how owned land, land survey was also used by the state and landlords to keep track of land mostly for control. Indeed, it is a unit bound by lines on charts and maps.

The English colonies left their maps void of indigenous populations which left the lands mostly marked as empty and unoccupied.

Arquebuses first appeared in Ming China in the early 1540s with many pirates initially using them. However, Ming officials were eventually able to capture pirates with guns and thus began manufacturing those guns. The effort by the Ming to modernize their armies was spearheaded by Qi Jiguang, who only realized the power of the musket after being defeated in battle by Japanese pirates. Jiguang trained his soldiers to function in small, flexible units that could be composed of any type of weapon, including the new guns that had only so recently entered China. Jiguang also carefully drilled his troops in the use of this new weapon by having them memorize a song that would assist them in loading their muskets. However, even with Jiguang's efforts muskets were not fully or effectively incorporated into the Ming armies. When Jiguang was reassigned to the Northern frontier of China, he found that the soldiers were too entrenched in the old ways and refused to adopt the new weapons, even though the accuracy of the musket was far superior to that of the traditional weapons they used.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrade |first1=Tonio |title=The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0691178141 |page=172-180}}</ref>\n\nThe Ming were able to prove themselves against modern European armies in 1661 when the Ming dynasty launched an invasion of Taiwan which was under Dutch control at the time under the command of a Ming warlord named Zheng Chenggong. 10 years prior to this invasion, the Dutch had put down a peasant revolt in Taiwan with only 120 troops because the peasants were undisciplined and routed easily during their battle with the Dutch. Now, under Chenggong, the Chinese troops maintained their formation as they approached the Dutch forces, even though they were under fire from not only the Dutch land-based muskets but also by Dutch vessels which fired into Chenggong's troops at very close range. However, the highly trained and disciplined troops never broke ranks and when the Dutch realized this, along with the fact that they had been outflanked by a small force sent around them, they were the ones that fled the field of battle. After this point, the Dutch were never able to defeat Zheng's armies in a pitched battle. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrade |first1=Tonio |title=The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0691178141 |page=190-192}}</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the Ming dynasty though, the Qing dynasty which replaced the Ming was much more willing to adopt these new technologies and use them to conquer their neighbours, thus ushering in a new age of Chinese dominance in East Asia. Their adaptation and use of the new gunpowder technology can be best seen in their conflict with the Russian Empire for control over the Amur Valley, which today is still the border region between China and Russia. When the Russians and the Chinese, along with Korean allies, first engaged each other, about 370 Russian troops attempted to engage a Qing and Korean allied force of about 1,000 troops. Although the Qing troops didn't perform as well as their Korean counterparts, they still contributed during the battle, especially as the Russians were retreating. During the second and final battle between these two forces, the Russians fielded 500 musketeers while the combined Qing and Korean force was able to muster 1,400 soldiers, of which only 400 were using the new gunpowder technology. Again, the Russians were defeated by the Qing and Korean force with the Koreans especially playing a vital role in both battles. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrade |first1=Tonio |title=The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0691178141 |page=192-195}}</ref> Conflict between Russia and China would later cease due to the Treaty of Nerchinsk, which is a good example of diplomacy between two gunpowder empires, as the Russians also made use of gunpowder technologies to conquer their way across Eastern Europe and Central Asia to get to China in the first place.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perdue|first=Peter C.|date=2010|title=Boundaries and Trade in the Early Modern World: Negotiations at Nerchinsk and Beijing|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=43|issue=3|pages=341\u2013356|jstor=25642205|doi=10.1353/ecs.0.0187}}</ref>\n\n== Laws and decrees within a territorial state ==\nLaws authorized by the territorial prince were only valid within the defined region of his associated territorial state. These laws, which applied to the whole sovereign territory of the state, were also applicable to everyone living with the state, not just to its own [[citizen]]s. This was based on the principle of territoriality which stated that all people were subject to the sovereignty and laws of the state on whose soil they were located. As a result of agreements between territorial states, legal regulations could also apply abroad. In the [[European Union]] it can be seen that this principle has survived in the long run, even to the present day.\n\nDocuments dating back to the ancient states, have shown texts that have lists or descriptions of capitals, locations of tax stations and forts. The documents would also have alliances that were made through marriages, or treaties.\n\n== Rulers of territorial states ==\nThe aim of the respective territorial princes was to incorporate all the legal rights of a territory into their personal government and thus impose their personal claim to power over it. An early attempt at this was made by [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]] in the [[Stem Duchy of Saxony]], but his plans foundered due to resistance of competing rulers who had opposing rights within the same [[territory]]. An early successful example of the creation of a territorial lordship is the [[Archduchy of Austria]], which was able to be turned into a [[state lordship]] in 1359 through the forged ''[[privilegium maius]].'' Other personal claims of territories can be dated back to ancient rulers. Augustus had claimed to expand the Roman borders to Ethiopia, Arabia, Egypt and central Europe. Sargon II had also stated that he had captured the territory of his enemies with them becoming part of his new claimed land.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Monica L.|authorlink1=Monica L.

Once rulers have conquered new land, it was viewed as expanding travels to their people. Another important intake of conquering land was the expansion of language, money and expanding political boundaries.\n\n== Characteristics of a territorial state ==\nThe territorial state prior to the French Revolution can be defined by three basic criteria. They are as follows:\n\n=== Direct military occupation. ===\nIf a people finds itself under military control it becomes part of that military's territorial state, whether or not it identifies with the occupiers. While there are often many political units within a territorial state they will be categorized as part of the larger territorial state with coercive military power.\n\n=== The capacity to tax. ===\nThe ability to enforce taxation is an important coercive power for states to possess. To be able to tax other smaller political units would show that the ruling territorial state maintains a [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] control with economically coercive means.\n\n=== A common executive. ===\nStates during this period were often composed of multiple semi-autonomous political entities. Despite this, these semi-autonomous entities were often headed by members of the ruling family and can thus be classified as sharing a common executive.<ref>Abramson (Winter 2017), pg. 103.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Territorialisation]]\n*[[Nation state|Nation State]]\n*[[Complex society|Complex societies]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|}}\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n* Abramson, Scott F.

The Liberal dominance ended in [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] as [[Brian Mulroney]], who is from this area, was able to gather Quebec nationalist support and sweep the region in 1984 and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]. With the advent of the nationalist [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] in 1993, nationalist support left the Tories, and this area became a traditional Bloc stronghold. This is true except for the [[Chicoutimi, Quebec|Chicoutimi]] area which has voted federalist with [[Andr\u00e9 Harvey]] running as a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and winning in 1997, and running as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and winning in 2000. The Bloc swept the region in 2004, but the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] picked up a seat here in [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and weakened the Bloc's grip on the remaining seats as Liberal support collapsed. In 2011, another regional sweep gave four of the five seats to the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrats]], shutting out the Bloc and leaving the Conservatives with one of their two seats. In the 2015 election, the NDP lost all but one of its seat in the region, while the Bloc managed a comeback in the C\u00f4te-Nord region, the Liberals won one seat in Chicoutimi and the Conservatives won one seat in the southwestern part of the region near Quebec City.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n!

The Liberal dominance ended in [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] as [[Brian Mulroney]], who is from this area, was able to gather Quebec nationalist support and sweep the region in 1984 and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]. With the advent of the nationalist [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] in 1993, nationalist support left the Tories, and this area became a traditional Bloc stronghold. This is true except for the [[Chicoutimi, Quebec|Chicoutimi]] area which has voted federalist with [[Andr\u00e9 Harvey]] running as a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and winning in 1997, and running as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and winning in 2000. The Bloc swept the region in 2004, but the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] picked up a seat here in [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and weakened the Bloc's grip on the remaining seats as Liberal support collapsed. In 2011, another regional sweep gave four of the five seats to the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrats]], shutting out the Bloc and leaving the Conservatives with one of their two seats. In the 2015 election, the NDP lost all but one of its seat in the region, while the Bloc managed a comeback in the C\u00f4te-Nord region, the Liberals won one seat in Chicoutimi and the Conservatives won one seat in the southwestern part of the region near Quebec City.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n!
