'''''Demon Detective Loki: RAGNAROK'''''}} is a [[manga]] by [[Sakura Kinoshita]] published from August 1999 to October 2004. A [[television]] [[anime]] based on the manga series ran for 26 episodes from April 5, 2003, to September 27, 2003, in Japan.\n\nThe series originally ran in the magazine ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan]]'' under the name {{nihongo|''The Mythical Detective Loki''|\u9b54\u63a2\u5075\u30ed\u30ad|Matantei Loki}}, but ''Ragnarok'' was added to the title when the series was purchased by publishing company [[MAG Garden]] and moved to ''[[Comic Blade]]'' magazine.  ''The Mythical Detective Loki'' was collected in 7 volumes by ''Gangan Comics'', which were later republished by ''Blade Comics''; it has not been officially licensed for US distribution. ''The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok'' ran for 5 more volumes, which were published in Japan by ''Blade Comics'', and picked up for translation and English release by [[ADV Manga]]. [[Chuang Yi]] has released an English version in [[Singapore]]. The anime has been licensed for English release by [[Section 23 Films]]. The anime series was broadcast in Mexico and South America by the anime television network, [[Animax]], under the name '''''Mythical Sleuth Loki'''''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nLoki, the Norse god of mischief, has been exiled to the human world by the god Odin for reasons that he doesn't understand. Along with being exiled, Loki is forced to take the form of a human child, and the only way he can return to the realm of the gods is by collecting the evil auras which take over human hearts. In order to do this, he starts a detective agency which specializes in the paranormal. Loki is assisted by his loyal companion Yamino and the pair are soon joined by a human girl named Mayura Daidouji who is manic for mysteries and often unwittingly assists him in catching the auras. As time passes, however, other Norse gods and characters appear; some befriend Loki and others are intent on assassinating him.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|[[Loki]]|\u30ed\u30ad|Loki}}\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Yuriko Fuchizaki]] (Japanese), [[Shannon Emerick]] (English)<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Voice Actors|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Mythical-Detective-Loki-Ragnarok/Loki-Child/}}</ref><br>Adult Form - [[Takahiro Sakurai]] (Japanese),<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Voice Actors|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Mythical-Detective-Loki-Ragnarok/Loki-Adult/}}</ref> [[Jose Diaz (voice actor)|Jose Diaz]] (English)\n:God of mischief (and in some versions chaos) in [[Norse mythology]]. Trapped in the body of a child, he seeks a way back to the realm of the gods and his original body. He is the father of Fenrir, Yamino ([[Jormungand]]), and Hel. He has red-brown hair and green eyes; he also has an aversion to deep water, as well as a possibly small case of amaxophobia, since he seems to hate riding in cars. (Or perhaps he simply becomes carsick.)\n:Loki has many romantic interests. In both series, [[Freyja]] loved him in the world of gods but he does not like her that way.  Although in the anime, Loki is shown to be happy about Freya's feelings for him (Episode 13), ever since their initial confrontation where Loki learned of Freya's loneliness because of him. The youngest [[Norns|Norn]] Sister, Skuld, is also attracted to him mostly because of his kindness and beauty. Mayura seems to have romantic feelings towards him because of his courage, intelligence and concern for her. However, Mayura is the only one of these three who doesn't know Loki is actually an age old god, thus, her affection is somewhat unclear. Another quality of Loki is that his sense of foresight is quite remarkable, as he can usually figure things out way before anyone else does (though Yamino, Fenrir, and Ecchan figured out who Spica really was long before Loki did). Loki is more wild and silly in the manga than he is in the anime (his personality more befitting his body in the manga); also his relationship with Mayura is seen more clearly. He's obviously in love with Mayura.\n;{{nihongo|Mayura Daidouji|\u5927\u5802\u5bfa\u7e6d\u826f|Daid\u014dji Mayura|\u307e\u3086\u3089 is used in place of \u7e6d\u826f after her introduction.}}\n:The main human character of the series: a pink-haired, red-eyed, 16-year-old, high school student obsessed with mysteries and the occult.  Despite her love of mysteries, she never manages to find out who Loki is - partly because she has absolutely no [[Extra-sensory perception|sixth sense]], despite being the daughter of a [[Shinto]] [[priest]]. Mayura also seems to have romantic feelings towards Loki near the end of the anime series. However it is shown unclearly in the manga, since she only knows him as a child.  She does not believe in God because her mother died despite countless prayers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Matantei Loki Ragnarok Episode 26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHRAe4DlitY&index=26&list=PLik6BS3JIsrh3ee_3Uih918QOeotJr2dC}}</ref> There are significant differences in her personality in the manga and anime. In the manga, Mayura is calmer, not shouting \"Fushigi mystery!\" (strange mystery) as often as she does in the anime and seems to have a sharper sense (being able to know Loki is \"different\" and wanting to ask him who or what he was in the seventeenth chapter).\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Yui Horie]] (Japanese), [[Kira Vincent-Davis]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|Yamino Ryusuke|\u95c7\u91ce\u7adc\u4ecb|Yamino Ry\u016bsuke|in the manga, various characters also address and refer to him as \u30e1\u30ac\u30cd Megane, i.e. \"glasses\" or \"four-eyes\"''}}\n:Loki's second son takes the form of a polite, [[glasses|bespectacled]] boy in his late teens, and serves as his housekeeper, cook, and assistant.  He enjoys cooking, cleaning and other domestic activities, and in the anime, he also has an amusing addiction to ordering useless items from [[mail-order catalog]]s. His real name is [[Jormungand]], also known as the [[Midgard serpent]], since his true form is that of a giant serpent that encircles the Earth.  Loki rescued Yamino from the bottom of the sea by casting a spell on him (thus giving him a human form) so that he could accompany his father on Earth;<ref>{{cite web|title=Matantei Loki Ragnarok Episode 8|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTUx1n1iBpU&list=PLik6BS3JIsrh3ee_3Uih918QOeotJr2dC&index=8}}</ref> for this, he is eternally grateful.  The revelation of Yamino's true identity occurs earlier in the manga than the anime, and seems to play more of a part in his characterization for the first manga series.  He probably wears glasses as a reference to the [[Indian cobra]] (\u773c\u93e1\u86c7 ''meganehebi'', or \"glasses snake\", in Japanese).\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Shinichiro Miki]] (Japanese), [[Illich Guardiola]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|[[Fenrir]]|\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ea\u30eb|Fenriru}}\n:Loki's first son takes the form of a small black [[dog]]. His real identity is that of the Fenrisulfr, a giant wolf bound by the gods.  Fenrir enjoys food and taunting Yamino.  A [[running gag]] in both the anime and manga is how Fenrir can be very bossy and intentionally crude around Yamino, then instantly become the most affectionate and harmless puppy-son possible the moment \"Daddy\" walks in<ref>{{cite web|title=Matantei Loki Ragnarok Episode 14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERRemjl13G4&list=PLik6BS3JIsrh3ee_3Uih918QOeotJr2dC&index=14}}</ref> (during the series, he has an almost scary Father Complex. He's very outwardly protective of Loki, spouting threats when Loki may be in danger). While the gods can understand his words, it would appear that when a human hears him talk all they hear is a regular dog (though his barking sounds like he's singing).\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Hirofumi Nojima]] (Japanese), [[John Swasey]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|[[Hel (goddess)|Hel]]|\u30d8\u30eb|Heru}}\n:Loki's only daughter, Hel is the goddess of the [[underworld]]. Portrayed as an [[adolescent]] girl with wavy pink hair, green eyes and glasses, and a strong obsession with her father, though the nature of it differs between the manga and anime. In the anime, she is seen to be trying to kill Loki at first as Odin told her that Loki and her brothers no longer care for her and hated her, thus, making her wanting to make Loki experience the same kind of pain she experienced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Matantei Loki Ragnarok Episode 25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jojxhmIKl4&index=25&list=PLik6BS3JIsrh3ee_3Uih918QOeotJr2dC}}</ref> In the manga, she wishes to kill her father so that he will always be with her in the underworld.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Omi Minami]] (Japanese), [[Rozie Curtis]] (English, ep 14), [[Taylor Hannah]] (English, eps 22+)\n;{{nihongo|Narugami|\u9cf4\u795e|Narugami}}\n:Actually the Norse God of thunder, [[Thor]], in the form of a teenage boy with brown hair and eyes.  He was sent to [[Earth]] from the realm of gods to kill Loki; in the manga, he doesn't remember this at first, while in the anime, he chooses not to kill Loki because he sees no reason to. Unfortunately, he forgot how to return to the realm of the gods, so he is forced to work a wide array of part-time jobs to support himself, which becomes another one of the series' recurring jokes.  He always carries around a [[bokken|wooden sword]], which is actually Thor's hammer [[Mjollnir]] in disguise.  Loki addresses him as Narukami, itself a double pun on [[god]] (\u795e ''kami'') and [[lightning]] (\u96f7 ''kaminari''), as clarified by Kinoshita in the second series.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Shotaro Morikubo]] (Japanese), [[Chris Patton]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|Reiya Ohshima|\u5927\u5cf6\u73b2\u4e5f|\u014cshima Reiya, usually called \u30ec\u30a4\u30e4 Reiya; \"Reya\" is a spelling adopted by ADV Manga''}}\n:Reiya is a young girl with blue-violet eyes, brown hair and a cute crush on young Loki.  In the anime, she is the sole survivor of a rich family killed in a car accident, and she hires Loki to solve a mystery about her mansion. In the manga, she hires Loki because she has been having unsettling dreams about her deceased sister Lisa; she lives with her aunt, uncle, and two older cousins. Reiya's true identity is the [[reincarnation|transmigrated]] Norse goddess Freyja\u2014unlike Loki, however, Reiya's memory was wiped by Odin, so she has no memory of her past life.  Reiya becomes Freyja when the necklace [[Brisingamen]] is put around her neck, but reverts to Reiya when the necklace is removed, with no memory of what happens while wearing it. Freyja, just like her alter ego, is enamored with Loki, though she's far more aggressive about it than Reiya. Reiya is also capable of becoming Freyja when extremely jealous or threatened, as well as other circumstances.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Rika Komatsu]] (Japanese), [[Brittney Karbowski]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|[[Freyja]]|\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4|Fureiya}}\n:[[Freyja]] is the goddess of love and beauty. She loves Loki, but Loki does not return the feelings. Despite this, Freya refuses to give up and does everything she can to put Loki into situations where she can take advantage of him.  When Loki was banished from the world of gods, Freyja begged Odin to let him return thus making Odin furious. Odin turned her into a child, Reiya, erased all her memories and sent her to the world of the mortals.  She initially hated Loki for ignoring her and not reciprocating her feelings for him, and that she was lonely because of it.  However, she learned to accept it and still refuses to give up on him.  Thus, whenever she takes over Reiya, she aggressively pursues Loki and keeps others away from him, in particular Skuld.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Junko Asami]] (Japanese), [[Shelley Calene-Black]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|Kazumi Higashiyama (Heimdall)|\u6771\u5c71\u548c\u5b9f|Higashiyama Kazumi}}\n:Heimdall is the god of light and the Guardian of the bridge that leads to Asgard (The Bifrost Bridge), sent by [[Odin]] to assassinate Loki, the watchman [[Heimdall]] takes the form of a young boy as a disguise.  However, due to the theft of his right eye, he is forced to have neck-length purple hair that completely covers the right side of his face.  His nails are actually long, sharp [[claws]], so he wears bulky [[gloves]] to hide them. Because he is the god of strategy, he devises clever plans, such as control over other beings or even mirages to taunt the opponent. It's believed that if he and Loki clashed they would both die as the myth in Ragnarok portrayed it, so a serious confrontation is avoided until the end of the series, in which Loki convinces him that he may have lost his eye but gained a friend, the falcon that accompanied him. He believes Loki to be the thief that stole his eye, so in addition to carrying out the assassination order, he intends to retrieve his eye or avenge its loss by any means necessary. Although he is one of the more serious characters in the series, Heimdall is also the butt of many jokes.  The manga frequently makes fun of his serious personality and his obsession with Loki, and even though \"Kazumi Higashiyama\" doesn't attend school, Heimdall still has a daily schedule consisting of [[piano]] [[lessons]], [[singing]] [[lessons]], and [[cram school]]. In the anime, Heimdall usually gets dragged along on [[shopping]] sprees by his [[roommate]] Freyr, much to his own dismay.\n:His name is very similar to Kinoshita's co-author in [[Tactics (manga)|Tactics]], Kazuko Higashiyama.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Romi Park]] (Japanese), [[Greg Ayres]] (English)<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Voice Actors|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Mythical-Detective-Loki-Ragnarok/Heimdall/}}</ref>\n;{{nihongo|Mysterious Thief [[Freyr]]|\u602a\u76d7\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4|Kait\u014d Furei|sometimes translated as \"Phantom Thief Freyr\" and other variants.}}\n:[[Freyr]] is Freyja's older brother and the god of fertility.  He was brought to Earth to aid Heimdall in the destruction of Loki, but quickly drops that mission to search for Freyja once he realizes she is there, too.  Somewhere along the line, he decides to get Loki's attention by becoming a master jewel thief; the natural enemy of any great detective. Impulsive and [[Quixotism|quixotic]], Freyr seems to think of everything in terms of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romantic]] [[clich\u00e9]], dramatic [[stereotypes]], and absurd [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s.  His primary agenda is to find Freyja, or at least ensure that Loki isn't corrupting her.  However, in the course of his plans, Freyr runs into Mayura, falls in [[Romantic love|love at first sight]], and renames her Yamato Nadeshiko (\u5927\u548c\u64ab\u5b50 ''[[Yamato Nadeshiko]]'', a name for the prototypical ideal woman; a sort of Japanese [[Dulcinea]]), and in the English anime, his \"Classic Japanese Beauty.\"\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Takehito Koyasu]] (Japanese), [[Jason Douglas]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|The [[Norns|Norn]] Sisters|\u30ce\u30eb\u30f3|Norun}}\n:[[Verdandi]], [[Urd (Norse Mythology)|Urd]] and [[Skuld (Norse Mythology)|Skuld]] are the goddesses of fate. In the manga, they are a bit ambiguous in their loyalties. Though they help Loki often, such as by giving him the magical ring [[Draupnir]] (which can be used to store evil spirits), they have plans of their own, separate from those of [[Odin]] and the other gods. Urd, in particular, is implied to be manipulating events on her own. In the anime, they have been sent to earth by [[Odin]] to kill Loki. Most of their attempts fall into the \"Monster of the Week\" pattern familiar to [[Super Sentai]] shows and [[magical girl]]/[[magical boy]] anime.\n:In the anime, there are many strong hints that Loki had an affair with Skuld in Asgard\u2014an entire episode is even dedicated to this question\u2014which could be the Norns' fuel for 'hating' and helping him. It is not known for sure though. In the manga, Skuld certainly has a crush on Loki, but there are no hints of anything more serious.\n:''Voiced by:'' Verdandi - [[Mamiko Noto]] (Japanese), [[Tamara Levine]] (English)<br>Urd - [[Mariko Suzuki]] (Japanese), [[Kaytha Coker]] (English)<br>Skuld - [[Mai Nakahara]] (Japanese), [[Melissa Davis]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|[[Odin]]|\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|\u014cdin}}\n:Odin is the King of the Gods. Odin is only referred to, never seen or interacted with, in the first series of the manga.  In the second series, he is hinted at for a while with [[silhouette]]s and frames containing parts of his clothing, but eventually is seen unobscured. In the anime, he is only shown as a red eye, but also referred to with the emergence of two ravens that, if they appear together, stand for [[Huginn and Muninn]], Odin's two messengers (see episode 1).  Odin seeks to kill Loki, but is somehow unable to do so himself, so he sends assassins instead.  He was the one who commanded Loki to take Heimdall's eye. Ironically, he is portrayed as an eye, the very part he gave to get ultimate knowledge.\n;{{nihongo|[[Spica]]|\u30b9\u30d4\u30ab|Supika}}\n:Spica is the reincarnation of [[Angrboda]], the [[giantess]] who bore three of Loki's children (the ones that were a precursor to [[Ragnarok]]). She is the mother of [[Fenrir]], [[Jormungand]], and [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. In her human form, Spica is a normally mute girl with a HUGE appetite. In the anime she only appears briefly in the final episode.\n;{{nihongo|Utgard-Loki|\u30a6\u30c8\u30ac\u30eb\u30c9\u30ed\u30ad|Utogarudo Roki}}\n:Utgard Loki is the \"other\" Loki, who held half of Loki's power\u2014 Loki identifies Utgard as his past self. He is the King of Utgard, Land of the Giants. When Urd killed Utgard Loki in the manga, Loki got his power back. He seems to have a strange obsession over Spica.\n;Koutaro\n:A rich school boy and friend of Loki. In the anime he's a classmate of Mayura. He only appears in few episodes and is shown to be a ladies man, going after almost every pretty girl he sees.\n;Misao Daidouji\n:Misao Daidouji is the father of Mayura.

'''''Demon Detective Loki: RAGNAROK'''''}} is a [[manga]] by [[Sakura Kinoshita]] published from August 1999 to October 2004. A [[television]] [[anime]] based on the manga series ran for 26 episodes from April 5, 2003, to September 27, 2003, in Japan.\n\nThe series originally ran in the magazine ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan]]'' under the name {{nihongo|''The Mythical Detective Loki''|\u9b54\u63a2\u5075\u30ed\u30ad|Matantei Loki}}, but ''Ragnarok'' was added to the title when the series was purchased by publishing company [[MAG Garden]] and moved to ''[[Comic Blade]]'' magazine.  ''The Mythical Detective Loki'' was collected in 7 volumes by ''Gangan Comics'', which were later republished by ''Blade Comics''; it has not been officially licensed for US distribution. ''The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok'' ran for 5 more volumes, which were published in Japan by ''Blade Comics'', and picked up for translation and English release by [[ADV Manga]]. [[Chuang Yi]] has released an English version in [[Singapore]]. The anime has been licensed for English release by [[Section 23 Films]]. The anime series was broadcast in Mexico and South America by the anime television network, [[Animax]], under the name '''''Mythical Sleuth Loki'''''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nLoki, the Norse god of mischief, has been exiled to the human world by the god Odin for reasons that he doesn't understand. Along with being exiled, Loki is forced to take the form of a human child, and the only way he can return to the realm of the gods is by collecting the evil auras which take over human hearts. In order to do this, he starts a detective agency which specializes in the paranormal. Loki is assisted by his loyal companion Yamino and the pair are soon joined by a human girl named Mayura Daidouji who is manic for mysteries and often unwittingly assists him in catching the auras. As time passes, however, other Norse gods and characters appear; some befriend Loki and others are intent on assassinating him.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|[[Loki]]|\u30ed\u30ad|Loki}}\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Yuriko Fuchizaki]] (Japanese), [[Shannon Emerick]] (English)<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Voice Actors|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Mythical-Detective-Loki-Ragnarok/Loki-Child/}}</ref><br>Adult Form - [[Takahiro Sakurai]] (Japanese),<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Voice Actors|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Mythical-Detective-Loki-Ragnarok/Loki-Adult/}}</ref> [[Jose Diaz (voice actor)|Jose Diaz]] (English)\n:God of mischief (and in some versions chaos) in [[Norse mythology]]. Trapped in the body of a child, he seeks a way back to the realm of the gods and his original body. He is the father of Fenrir, Yamino ([[Jormungand]]), and Hel. He has red-brown hair and green eyes; he also has an aversion to deep water, as well as a possibly small case of amaxophobia, since he seems to hate riding in cars. (Or perhaps he simply becomes carsick.)\n:Loki has many romantic interests. In both series, [[Freyja]] loved him in the world of gods but he does not like her that way.  Although in the anime, Loki is shown to be happy about Freya's feelings for him (Episode 13), ever since their initial confrontation where Loki learned of Freya's loneliness because of him. The youngest [[Norns|Norn]] Sister, Skuld, is also attracted to him mostly because of his kindness and beauty. Mayura seems to have romantic feelings towards him because of his courage, intelligence and concern for her. However, Mayura is the only one of these three who doesn't know Loki is actually an age old god, thus, her affection is somewhat unclear. Another quality of Loki is that his sense of foresight is quite remarkable, as he can usually figure things out way before anyone else does (though Yamino, Fenrir, and Ecchan figured out who Spica really was long before Loki did). Loki is more wild and silly in the manga than he is in the anime (his personality more befitting his body in the manga); also his relationship with Mayura is seen more clearly. He's obviously in love with Mayura.\n;{{nihongo|Mayura Daidouji|\u5927\u5802\u5bfa\u7e6d\u826f|Daid\u014dji Mayura|\u307e\u3086\u3089 is used in place of \u7e6d\u826f after her introduction.}}\n:The main human character of the series: a pink-haired, red-eyed, 16-year-old, high school student obsessed with mysteries and the occult.  Despite her love of mysteries, she never manages to find out who Loki is - partly because she has absolutely no [[Extra-sensory perception|sixth sense]], despite being the daughter of a [[Shinto]] [[priest]]. Mayura also seems to have romantic feelings towards Loki near the end of the anime series. However it is shown unclearly in the manga, since she only knows him as a child.  She does not believe in God because her mother died despite countless prayers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Matantei Loki Ragnarok Episode 26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHRAe4DlitY&index=26&list=PLik6BS3JIsrh3ee_3Uih918QOeotJr2dC}}</ref> There are significant differences in her personality in the manga and anime. In the manga, Mayura is calmer, not shouting \"Fushigi mystery!\" (strange mystery) as often as she does in the anime and seems to have a sharper sense (being able to know Loki is \"different\" and wanting to ask him who or what he was in the seventeenth chapter).\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Yui Horie]] (Japanese), [[Kira Vincent-Davis]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|Yamino Ryusuke|\u95c7\u91ce\u7adc\u4ecb|Yamino Ry\u016bsuke|in the manga, various characters also address and refer to him as \u30e1\u30ac\u30cd Megane, i.e. \"glasses\" or \"four-eyes\"''}}\n:Loki's second son takes the form of a polite, [[glasses|bespectacled]] boy in his late teens, and serves as his housekeeper, cook, and assistant.  He enjoys cooking, cleaning and other domestic activities, and in the anime, he also has an amusing addiction to ordering useless items from [[mail-order catalog]]s. His real name is [[Jormungand]], also known as the [[Midgard serpent]], since his true form is that of a giant serpent that encircles the Earth.  Loki rescued Yamino from the bottom of the sea by casting a spell on him (thus giving him a human form) so that he could accompany his father on Earth;<ref>{{cite web|title=Matantei Loki Ragnarok Episode 8|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTUx1n1iBpU&list=PLik6BS3JIsrh3ee_3Uih918QOeotJr2dC&index=8}}</ref> for this, he is eternally grateful.  The revelation of Yamino's true identity occurs earlier in the manga than the anime, and seems to play more of a part in his characterization for the first manga series.  He probably wears glasses as a reference to the [[Indian cobra]] (\u773c\u93e1\u86c7 ''meganehebi'', or \"glasses snake\", in Japanese).\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Shinichiro Miki]] (Japanese), [[Illich Guardiola]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|[[Fenrir]]|\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ea\u30eb|Fenriru}}\n:Loki's first son takes the form of a small black [[dog]]. His real identity is that of the Fenrisulfr, a giant wolf bound by the gods.  Fenrir enjoys food and taunting Yamino.  A [[running gag]] in both the anime and manga is how Fenrir can be very bossy and intentionally crude around Yamino, then instantly become the most affectionate and harmless puppy-son possible the moment \"Daddy\" walks in<ref>{{cite web|title=Matantei Loki Ragnarok Episode 14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERRemjl13G4&list=PLik6BS3JIsrh3ee_3Uih918QOeotJr2dC&index=14}}</ref> (during the series, he has an almost scary Father Complex. He's very outwardly protective of Loki, spouting threats when Loki may be in danger).

Portrayed as an [[adolescent]] girl with wavy pink hair, green eyes and glasses, and a strong obsession with her father, though the nature of it differs between the manga and anime.

Unfortunately, he forgot how to return to the realm of the gods, so he is forced to work a wide array of part-time jobs to support himself, which becomes another one of the series' recurring jokes.  He always carries around a [[bokken|wooden sword]], which is actually Thor's hammer [[Mjollnir]] in disguise.  Loki addresses him as Narukami, itself a double pun on [[god]] (\u795e ''kami'') and [[lightning]] (\u96f7 ''kaminari''), as clarified by Kinoshita in the second series.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Shotaro Morikubo]] (Japanese), [[Chris Patton]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|Reiya Ohshima|\u5927\u5cf6\u73b2\u4e5f|\u014cshima Reiya, usually called \u30ec\u30a4\u30e4 Reiya; \"Reya\" is a spelling adopted by ADV Manga''}}\n:Reiya is a young girl with blue-violet eyes, brown hair and a cute crush on young Loki.  In the anime, she is the sole survivor of a rich family killed in a car accident, and she hires Loki to solve a mystery about her mansion. In the manga, she hires Loki because she has been having unsettling dreams about her deceased sister Lisa; she lives with her aunt, uncle, and two older cousins. Reiya's true identity is the [[reincarnation|transmigrated]] Norse goddess Freyja\u2014unlike Loki, however, Reiya's memory was wiped by Odin, so she has no memory of her past life.  Reiya becomes Freyja when the necklace [[Brisingamen]] is put around her neck, but reverts to Reiya when the necklace is removed, with no memory of what happens while wearing it. Freyja, just like her alter ego, is enamored with Loki, though she's far more aggressive about it than Reiya. Reiya is also capable of becoming Freyja when extremely jealous or threatened, as well as other circumstances.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Rika Komatsu]] (Japanese), [[Brittney Karbowski]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|[[Freyja]]|\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4|Fureiya}}\n:[[Freyja]] is the goddess of love and beauty. She loves Loki, but Loki does not return the feelings. Despite this, Freya refuses to give up and does everything she can to put Loki into situations where she can take advantage of him.  When Loki was banished from the world of gods, Freyja begged Odin to let him return thus making Odin furious. Odin turned her into a child, Reiya, erased all her memories and sent her to the world of the mortals.  She initially hated Loki for ignoring her and not reciprocating her feelings for him, and that she was lonely because of it.  However, she learned to accept it and still refuses to give up on him.  Thus, whenever she takes over Reiya, she aggressively pursues Loki and keeps others away from him, in particular Skuld.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Junko Asami]] (Japanese), [[Shelley Calene-Black]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|Kazumi Higashiyama (Heimdall)|\u6771\u5c71\u548c\u5b9f|Higashiyama Kazumi}}\n:Heimdall is the god of light and the Guardian of the bridge that leads to Asgard (The Bifrost Bridge), sent by [[Odin]] to assassinate Loki, the watchman [[Heimdall]] takes the form of a young boy as a disguise.  However, due to the theft of his right eye, he is forced to have neck-length purple hair that completely covers the right side of his face.  His nails are actually long, sharp [[claws]], so he wears bulky [[gloves]] to hide them. Because he is the god of strategy, he devises clever plans, such as control over other beings or even mirages to taunt the opponent. It's believed that if he and Loki clashed they would both die as the myth in Ragnarok portrayed it, so a serious confrontation is avoided until the end of the series, in which Loki convinces him that he may have lost his eye but gained a friend, the falcon that accompanied him. He believes Loki to be the thief that stole his eye, so in addition to carrying out the assassination order, he intends to retrieve his eye or avenge its loss by any means necessary. Although he is one of the more serious characters in the series, Heimdall is also the butt of many jokes.  The manga frequently makes fun of his serious personality and his obsession with Loki, and even though \"Kazumi Higashiyama\" doesn't attend school, Heimdall still has a daily schedule consisting of [[piano]] [[lessons]], [[singing]] [[lessons]], and [[cram school]]. In the anime, Heimdall usually gets dragged along on [[shopping]] sprees by his [[roommate]] Freyr, much to his own dismay.\n:His name is very similar to Kinoshita's co-author in [[Tactics (manga)|Tactics]], Kazuko Higashiyama.\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Romi Park]] (Japanese), [[Greg Ayres]] (English)<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Voice Actors|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Mythical-Detective-Loki-Ragnarok/Heimdall/}}</ref>\n;{{nihongo|Mysterious Thief [[Freyr]]|\u602a\u76d7\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4|Kait\u014d Furei|sometimes translated as \"Phantom Thief Freyr\" and other variants.}}\n:[[Freyr]] is Freyja's older brother and the god of fertility.  He was brought to Earth to aid Heimdall in the destruction of Loki, but quickly drops that mission to search for Freyja once he realizes she is there, too.  Somewhere along the line, he decides to get Loki's attention by becoming a master jewel thief; the natural enemy of any great detective. Impulsive and [[Quixotism|quixotic]], Freyr seems to think of everything in terms of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romantic]] [[clich\u00e9]], dramatic [[stereotypes]], and absurd [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s.  His primary agenda is to find Freyja, or at least ensure that Loki isn't corrupting her.  However, in the course of his plans, Freyr runs into Mayura, falls in [[Romantic love|love at first sight]], and renames her Yamato Nadeshiko (\u5927\u548c\u64ab\u5b50 ''[[Yamato Nadeshiko]]'', a name for the prototypical ideal woman; a sort of Japanese [[Dulcinea]]), and in the English anime, his \"Classic Japanese Beauty.\"\n:''Voiced by:'' [[Takehito Koyasu]] (Japanese), [[Jason Douglas]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|The [[Norns|Norn]] Sisters|\u30ce\u30eb\u30f3|Norun}}\n:[[Verdandi]], [[Urd (Norse Mythology)|Urd]] and [[Skuld (Norse Mythology)|Skuld]] are the goddesses of fate. In the manga, they are a bit ambiguous in their loyalties. Though they help Loki often, such as by giving him the magical ring [[Draupnir]] (which can be used to store evil spirits), they have plans of their own, separate from those of [[Odin]] and the other gods. Urd, in particular, is implied to be manipulating events on her own. In the anime, they have been sent to earth by [[Odin]] to kill Loki. Most of their attempts fall into the \"Monster of the Week\" pattern familiar to [[Super Sentai]] shows and [[magical girl]]/[[magical boy]] anime.\n:In the anime, there are many strong hints that Loki had an affair with Skuld in Asgard\u2014an entire episode is even dedicated to this question\u2014which could be the Norns' fuel for 'hating' and helping him. It is not known for sure though. In the manga, Skuld certainly has a crush on Loki, but there are no hints of anything more serious.\n:''Voiced by:'' Verdandi - [[Mamiko Noto]] (Japanese), [[Tamara Levine]] (English)<br>Urd - [[Mariko Suzuki]] (Japanese), [[Kaytha Coker]] (English)<br>Skuld - [[Mai Nakahara]] (Japanese), [[Melissa Davis]] (English)\n;{{nihongo|[[Odin]]|\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3|\u014cdin}}\n:Odin is the King of the Gods. Odin is only referred to, never seen or interacted with, in the first series of the manga.  In the second series, he is hinted at for a while with [[silhouette]]s and frames containing parts of his clothing, but eventually is seen unobscured. In the anime, he is only shown as a red eye, but also referred to with the emergence of two ravens that, if they appear together, stand for [[Huginn and Muninn]], Odin's two messengers (see episode 1).  Odin seeks to kill Loki, but is somehow unable to do so himself, so he sends assassins instead.  He was the one who commanded Loki to take Heimdall's eye. Ironically, he is portrayed as an eye, the very part he gave to get ultimate knowledge.\n;{{nihongo|[[Spica]]|\u30b9\u30d4\u30ab|Supika}}\n:Spica is the reincarnation of [[Angrboda]], the [[giantess]] who bore three of Loki's children (the ones that were a precursor to [[Ragnarok]]). She is the mother of [[Fenrir]], [[Jormungand]], and [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. In her human form, Spica is a normally mute girl with a HUGE appetite. In the anime she only appears briefly in the final episode.\n;{{nihongo|Utgard-Loki|\u30a6\u30c8\u30ac\u30eb\u30c9\u30ed\u30ad|Utogarudo Roki}}\n:Utgard Loki is the \"other\" Loki, who held half of Loki's power\u2014 Loki identifies Utgard as his past self. He is the King of Utgard, Land of the Giants. When Urd killed Utgard Loki in the manga, Loki got his power back. He seems to have a strange obsession over Spica.\n;Koutaro\n:A rich school boy and friend of Loki. In the anime he's a classmate of Mayura. He only appears in few episodes and is shown to be a ladies man, going after almost every pretty girl he sees.\n;Misao Daidouji\n:Misao Daidouji is the father of Mayura. He hates mystery and Loki but unlike his daughter, he can see some of the things that Loki summons. He is a minor character, except on episode four; My Dad's a Great Detective!?\n;Inspector Masumi Niiyama\n:Masumi Niiyamais a police investigator who occasionally runs into Loki & the gang while on a case.

There are also two works written by Burroughs especially for children that are not considered part of the main series. The series is considered a classic of literature and is the author's best-known work. [[Tarzan]] has been called one of the best-known literary characters in the world. ''Tarzan'' has been adapted many times, complete or in part, for radio, television, stage, and cinema. (It has been adapted for the cinema more times than any book.)\n\nThe copyright on ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' has expired in the United States in the early 1960s, though the name Tarzan is still protected as a [[trademark]] of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]] <ref>https://www.edgarriceburroughs.com/</ref> The work also remains under copyright in some other countries where copyright terms are longer.{{which?|date=July 2019}}\n\n==The twenty four main books==\n\n===''Tarzan of the Apes'' (1912)===\n{{main article|Tarzan of the Apes}}\nThe novel tells the story of John Clayton II.<ref>In \"Tarzan of the Apes,\" Chapter XXV (1914), John Clayton, father of Tarzan writes in his diary, \"Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world\u2014the second John Clayton\u2014and bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.\"</ref> John and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Lord and Lady Greystoke of [[England]], are marooned in the western coastal [[jungle]]s of equatorial [[Africa]] in 1888. After an unstated amount of time later, their son John Clayton II is born. At one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape [[Kerchak]]. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]].\n\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the [[Mangani|ape language]]) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.\n\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.\n\nUpon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as \"king\" of the apes.\n\nLater, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them. They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.\n\nA few years later when Tarzan is 18 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen. Tarzan's cousin, William Cecil Clayton, unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.\n\nAmong the party was French naval officer Paul D'Arnot. While rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men. In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English as well.\n\nUltimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in [[Wisconsin]], USA. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton the Earl of Greystoke. Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.\n\n===''The Return of Tarzan'' (1913)===\n{{main article|The Return of Tarzan}}\nThe novel picks up soon after where ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' left off. The ape man, feeling rootless in the wake of his noble sacrifice of his prospects of wedding '''[[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]]''', leaves [[United States|America]] for [[Europe]] to visit his friend '''Paul d'Arnot'''. On the ship he becomes embroiled in the affairs of '''Countess Olga de Coude''', her husband, '''Count Raoul de Coude''', and two shady characters attempting to prey on them, '''Nikolas Rokoff''' and his henchman '''Alexis Paulvitch'''. Rokoff, it turns out, is also the countess's brother. Tarzan thwarts the villains' scheme, making them his deadly enemies.\n\nLater, in France, Rokoff tries time and again to eliminate the ape man, finally engineering a duel between him and the count by making it appear that he is the countess's lover. Tarzan deliberately refuses to defend himself in the duel, even offering the count his own weapon after the latter fails to kill him with his own, a grand gesture that convinces his antagonist of his innocence. In return, Count Raoul finds him a job as a special agent in the French ministry of war. Tarzan is assigned to service in [[Algeria]].\n\nA sequence of adventures among the local [[Arab]]s ensues, including another brush with Rokoff. Afterward Tarzan sails for [[Cape Town]] and strikes up a shipboard acquaintance with '''Hazel Strong''', a friend of Jane's. But Rokoff and Paulovitch are also aboard, and manage to ambush him and throw him overboard.\n\nMiraculously, Tarzan manages to reach shore in a lifeboat he finds from a derelict ship. He finds himself in the coastal jungle where he was brought up by the apes. He soon rescues and befriends a native warrior, '''Busuli''' of the '''[[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]]''', and is adopted into the Waziri tribe. After defeating a raid on their village by ivory raiders, Tarzan becomes their chief.\n\nThe Waziri know of a lost city deep in the jungle, from which they have obtained their golden ornaments. Tarzan has them take him there, but is captured by its inhabitants, a race of ape-like men, and is condemned to be sacrificed to their sun god. To Tarzan's surprise, the priestess to perform the sacrifice is a beautiful woman who speaks the ape language he learned as a child. She tells him she is '''[[La (Tarzan)|La]]''', high priestess of the lost city of '''[[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]]'''. When the sacrificial ceremony is fortuitously interrupted, she hides Tarzan and promises to lead him to freedom. But the ape man escapes on his own, locates a treasure chamber, and manages to rejoin the Waziri.\n\nMeanwhile, Hazel Strong has reached Cape Town where she meets Jane and her father, '''Professor Porter''', together with Jane's fianc\u00e9, Tarzan's cousin '''William Cecil Clayton'''. They are all invited on a cruise up the west coast of [[Africa]] aboard the ''Lady Alice'', the yacht of another friend, '''Lord Tennington'''. Rokoff, now using the alias of M. Thuran, ingratiates himself with the party and is also invited along. The ''Lady Alice'' crashes into the same derelict ship Tarzan found, and it sinks, forcing the passengers and crew into the lifeboats. The one containing Jane, Clayton and \"Thuran\" is separated from the others and suffers terrible privations. Coincidentally, the boat finally makes shore in the same general area that Tarzan did. Unknown to the three, it is but a few miles from the landing site of the other life boats.\n\nThe three construct a rude shelter and eke out an existence of near starvation. After some weeks, Jane and William Clayton are surprised in the forest by a lion. Clayton loses Jane's respect by cowering in fear before the beast instead of defending her. But, they are saved from attack when the lion is suddenly speared and killed by an unknown hand. Their hidden savior is in fact Tarzan, who leaves without revealing himself due to seeing Jane in the arms of Clayton. Jane breaks off her engagement to Clayton, finally gathering the courage to follow her heart and not marry a man she does not love. \n\nLater Jane is kidnapped and taken to Opar by a party of the Oparian ape-men who were pursuing their escaped sacrifice, Tarzan. The ape man learns of her capture and tracks them, managing to save her from being sacrificed by La. La is crushed by Tarzan's spurning of her for Jane.\n\nTarzan and Jane make their way up the coast to the former's boyhood cabin, where they encounter the remainder of the castaways of the ''Lady Alice,'' except for Clayton. D'Arnot is there with his naval ship and is preparing to rescue and return the party to civilization.  \"Thuran\" is exposed as Rokoff and arrested. The missing Clayton had been very ill and was abandoned by Rokoff at the location where he, Rokoff and Jane's boat had landed. Jane and Tarzan go to find him, but he dies in spite of Tarzan and Jane's efforts to help him. \n\nTarzan weds Jane and Tennington weds Hazel in a double ceremony performed by Professor Porter, who had been ordained a minister in his youth. Then they all set sail for civilization, taking along the treasure Tarzan had found in Opar.\n\n===''The Beasts of Tarzan'' (1914)===\n{{main article|The Beasts of Tarzan}}\nThe story begins a year after the conclusion the previous book, [[Tarzan]] (Lord Greystoke) and [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]] have had a son they named [[Korak (character)|Jack]]. Tarzan has spent much time building an estate home on the Waziri lands in Uziri, Africa, but has returned to his ancestral estate in London for the rainy season.\n\nTarzan's adversaries from the previous novel, '''Nikolas Rokoff''' and '''Alexis Paulvitch''', escape prison and kidnap the Greystoke heir. But the trap is elaborate and insidious, leading both Tarzan and Jane to be kidnapped as well. Rokoff exiles Tarzan on a jungle island, informing him that Jack will be left with a cannibal tribe to be raised as one of their own, while Jane's fate was to be left to his imagination.\n\nUsing his jungle skill and primal intelligence, Tarzan wins the help of Sheeta, the vicious panther, a tribe of great apes led by the moderately intelligent Akut, and a native warrior, Mugambi. With their aid, Tarzan reaches the mainland and begins a lengthy pursuit to find Jane (who is actively engineering her own extrication) and Jack.\n\nBy the end of the story Rokoff is dead, while Paulvitch, his cohort, is presumed dead but manages to escape into the jungle.  The Tarzan family returned to London along with Mugambi, who is offered a place at Tarzan's Waziri estate.\n\n===''The Son of Tarzan'' (1915/16)===\n{{main article|The Son of Tarzan}}\nThe story begins 10 years after the conclusion of the previous novel. During the past decade, Alexis Paulvitch, who had escaped Tarzan at the end of the last novel, has lived a hideous life of abuse and disease among tribal people in Africa. Now he is discovered by a European ship and taken aboard. In the months that followed, Paulvitch encounters the ape, Akut, (whom Tarzan had befriended in that previous story) at one of the ship's stops. Because of Akut's interactions with Tarzan, he was unafraid of white men, and Paulvitch, unaware of the previous relationship, saw an opportunity to make some money.  He took Akut to London and began displaying him publicly.\n\nAfter the trauma of the kidnappings ten years earlier, Jane had refused to return to Africa or to allow Jack to know anything about his father's past for fear that he might somehow try to relive it. Perhaps she instinctively knew that Jack was somehow very connected to Tarzan's old life, for Jack did have an avid interest in wildlife and he was extremely athletic. When the Claytons heard about the displayed ape, John decided to take Jack to see him. Tarzan was surprised to find the ape was his old friend, Akut, and began conversing with him. Jack was amazed to see that his father could do so. John then told Jack of his life as Tarzan.\n\nJack started sneaking away to see Akut and began learning the language of the apes. Jack began to form a plan to take Akut back to the jungle. Paulvitch saw an opportunity for revenge, and agreed to help Jack. They escape to an African port where Paulvitch attacks Jack. Jack (probably now 12), like his father, was man-sized as a teen. Paulvitch is killed, and  Jack, terrified, escapes into the jungle with Akut, thinking he will have to run for the rest of his life.\n\nLike Tarzan before him, Jack learns survival in the jungle and encounters the Mangani apes, who he can speak with because of his dialogue with Akut. The nearest they can manage of his name \"Jack\" in the ape tongue is \"Korak\". This means \"killer\" which seems appropriate since Jack has proven himself to be such.\n\nBy around the age of 13 Jack finds an abused girl of about 11 named [[Meriem, wife of Korak|Meriem]] and rescues her. He begins teaching her to survive the jungle and they begin a sibling type relationship and live adventurously in the jungle for several years.\n\nIn the interim, Tarzan and Jane have begun living at their Wahiri estate in Africa again, not having any idea what became of their son. After about six years Tarzan and Jane encounter Korak (now about 18) and Meriem (now 16) and reunite with them and are returned to London and married. Arguably, the book is as much about Meriem as it is about Tarzan's son.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar'' (1916)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar}}\nAt the end of the previous novel (#4) Tarzan (John Clayton) and [[Jane (Tarzan)|Jane]]'s son, Jack a.k.a. Korak, has come into adulthood. John (Tarzan) and Jane Clayton have left London and returned to their Waziri ranch, some distance from Tarzan's original stomping grounds in Africa (where Jack will find them in novel #4).\n\nJohn Clayton finds that his fortunes have been embezzled, so he decides to return to the lost city of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], where he procured a large supply of [[gold]] from their forgotten vaults and reinforced his family fortune (in novel #2).\n\nDuring this return trip Tarzan is injured in an earthquake and loses all memories of his adult, civilized life and about Jane. [[La (Tarzan)|La]], the high priestess of the Flaming god of Opar, takes advantage of his [[amnesia]].  She had fallen in lust with the ape man during their first encounter. But while La hopes his amnesia opens the door for her lustful advances, her priests are not going to allow Tarzan to escape their sacrificial knives this time. In the meanwhile, Jane is in trouble and wonders what is keeping her husband from coming to her rescue.\n\n===''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' (1919)===\n{{main article|Jungle Tales of Tarzan}}\nA collection of twelve loosely connected short stories of Tarzan's late teenage years, within a year or two before Tarzan first sees white people including Jane Porter.\n\n#\"Tarzan's First Love\"\n#\"The Capture of Tarzan\"\n#\"The Fight for the Balu\"\n#\"The God of Tarzan\"\n#\"Tarzan and the Black Boy\"\n#\"The Witch-Doctor Seeks Vengeance\"\n#\"The End of Bukawai\"\n#\"The Lion\"\n#\"The Nightmare\"\n#\"The Battle for Teeka\"\n#\"A Jungle Joke\"\n#\"Tarzan Rescues the Moon\"\n\n===''Tarzan the Untamed'' (1920)===\n{{main article|Tarzan the Untamed}}\n\nIn the year 1914, while '''John Clayton, Lord Greystoke (Tarzan)''' is away from his plantation home in [[British East Africa]], it is destroyed by invading [[Germany|German]] troops from [[Tanganyika]]. On his return he discovers among many burned bodies one that appears to be the corpse of his wife, '''[[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter Clayton]]'''. Another fatality is the '''[[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]]''' warrior '''Wasimbu''', left crucified by the Germans. (Wasimbu's father '''[[Muviro]]''', first mentioned in this story, goes on to play a prominent role in later Tarzan novels.)\n\nMaddened, the ape-man seeks revenge not only on the perpetrators of the tragedy but upon all Germans, and sets out for the battle front of the war in west Africa. On the way he has a run-in with a [[lion]] (or ''Numa'', as it is called by the apes among whom Tarzan was raised), which he traps in a gulch by blocking the entrance. Upon reaching the front he infiltrates the German headquarters and seizes '''Major Schneider''', the officer he believes led the raid on his estate. Returning to the gulch, he throws Schneider to the lion. Tarzan goes on to help the British forces in various ways, including setting the lion loose in the enemy trenches. Tarzan later kills '''von Goss''', another German officer involved in the attack on the Greystoke estate.\n\nHe then becomes embroiled in the affairs of '''Bertha Kircher''', a woman he has seen in both the German and British camps, and believes to be a German spy, particularly after he learns she possesses his mother's locket, which he had given as a gift to Jane. His efforts to retrieve it lead him to a rendezvous between Kircher and '''Captain Fritz Schneider''', brother of the Major Schneider Tarzan previously threw to the lion, and the actual commander of the force that burned his estate. Killing Schneider, Tarzan believes his vengeance complete. Abandoning his vendetta against the Germans he departs for the jungle, swearing off all company with mankind.\n\nSeeking a band of ''[[Mangani]]'', the species of apes among whom he had been raised, Tarzan crosses a desert, undergoing great privations. Indeed, the desert is almost his undoing. He only survives by feigning death to lure a [[vulture]] (''Ska'' in the ape language) into his reach. He then catches and devours the vulture, which gives him the strength to go on. The scene is a powerful one, a highlight both of the novel and of the Tarzan series as a whole.\n\nOn the other side of the desert Tarzan locates an ape band. While with them he once again encounters Bertha Kircher, who has just escaped from '''Sergeant Usanga''', leader of a troop of native deserters from the German army, by whom she had been taken captive. Despite his suspicion of Bertha, Tarzan's natural chivalry leads him to grant her shelter and protection among the apes. Later he himself falls captive to the tribe of cannibals the deserters have sheltered among, along with '''Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick''', a British aviator who has been forced down in the jungle. Learning of Tarzan's plight, Bertha heroically leads the apes against the natives and frees them both.\n\nSmith-Oldwick becomes infatuated with Bertha, and they search for his downed plane. They find it, but are captured again by Usanga, who attempts to fly off in it with Bertha. Tarzan arrives in time to pull Usanga from the plane. Smith-Oldwick and Bertha Kircher then try to pilot it back across the desert to civilization, but fail to make it. Seeing the plane go down, Tarzan once more sets out to rescue them. On the way he encounters another ''Numa'', this one an unusual black lion caught in a pit trap, and frees it.\n\nHe, the two lovers and the lion are soon reunited, but attacked by warriors from the lost city of '''Xuja''', hidden in a secret desert valley. Tarzan is left for dead and Bertha and Smith-Oldwick taken prisoner. The Xujans are masters of the local lions and worshippers of parrots and monkeys. They are also completely insane as a consequence of long inbreeding. Recovering, Tarzan once more comes to the rescue of his companions, aided by the lion he had saved earlier. But the Xujans pursue them and they turn at bay to make one last stand. The day is saved by a search party from Smith-Oldwick's unit, who turn the tide.\n\nAfterward, Tarzan and Smith-Oldwick find out that Bertha is a double agent who has actually been working for the British. Tarzan also learns from the diary of the deceased Fritz Schneider that Jane might still be alive.\n\n===''Tarzan the Terrible'' (1921)===\n{{main article|Tarzan the Terrible}}\nTwo months have passed since the conclusion of the previous novel (#7) in which '''Tarzan''' spent many months wandering about Africa wreaking vengeance upon those whom he believed brutally murdered '''[[Jane (Tarzan)|Jane]]'''. At the end of that novel Tarzan learns that her death was a ruse, that she had not been killed at all.\n\nIn attempting to track Jane, Tarzan has come to a hidden valley called '''Pal-ul-don''' filled with [[dinosaur]]s, notably the savage [[Triceratops]]-like '''Gryfs''', which, unlike their prehistoric counterparts, are carnivorous and stand 20 feet tall at the shoulder. The lost valley is also home to two different adversarial races of tailed human-looking creatures: the hairless and white skinned, city-dwelling '''Ho-don''' and the hairy and black-skinned, hill-dwelling '''Waz-don'''. Tarzan befriends a Ho-don warrior, and the Waz-don chief, actuating some uncustomary relations. In this new world Tarzan becomes a captive but so impresses his captors with his accomplishments and skills that they name him '''Tarzan-Jad-Guru''' (Tarzan the Terrible).\n\nHaving been brought there by her German captor, it turns out Jane is also being held captive in Pal-ul-don. She becomes a center-piece in a religious power struggle that consumes much of the novel until she escapes, after which her German captor becomes dependent on her due to his own lack of jungle survival skills.\n\nWith the aid of his native allies, Tarzan continues to pursue his beloved, going through an extended series of fights and escapes to do so. In the end success seems beyond even his ability to achieve, until in the final chapter he and Jane are saved by their son '''[[Korak (character)|Korak]]''', who has been searching for Tarzan just as Tarzan has been searching for Jane.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Golden Lion'' (1922/23)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Golden Lion}}\nThe story picks up with the Clayton family, '''Tarzan''', '''[[Jane (Tarzan)|Jane]]''' and their son '''[[Korak (character)|Korak]]''', returning from their adventures in the previous novel (#8). Along the way they find an orphaned lion cub, which Tarzan takes home and trains.\n\nFlora Hawkes, a previous housemaid of the Claytons, had overheard of Tarzan's discovery of the treasure chamber in the lost city of '''[[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]]''' ('''''[[The Return of Tarzan]]''''', '''''[[Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar]]''''') and had managed to copy his map to it.  She concocted a plan to lead an expedition to collect the gold. As a contingency to discourage any local denizens from questioning them, she sought out and found a Tarzan look-alike to accompany them.\n\nTwo years passed since the Clayton family picked up their lion cub, and the Greystoke estate had become financially depleted due his support of the Allies war efforts, and he concluded it was time to return to Opar for another withdrawal.\n\nTarzan encountered Hawkes' party, where he was drugged and ended up in the hands of the Oparians. Queen La, who had come into disfavor with the high priest, felt she had nothing to lose by escaping with Tarzan through the only unguarded route\u2014a path to the legendary valley of diamonds, from which no one had ever returned. There, Tarzan found a race of humans who were little better than animals in intelligence, being enslaved by a race of intelligent gorillas. With the help of his golden lion, Tarzan used the natives to restore La to power. Before leaving he accepted a bag of diamonds for a reward.\n\nMeanwhile, the fake Tarzan convinced Tarzan's Waziri party to take the gold from Hawkes' party while most of them were out hunting. He then buried the gold so he could retain it later.  The real Tarzan eventually confronted the fake, who managed to pilfer Tarzan's bag of diamonds. The fake was then chased by Tarzan's golden lion, but escaped into a river. He was later captured and permanently imprisoned by a local tribe. Tarzan lost the diamonds, but was able to attain the gold and return with it.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Ant Men'' (1924)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Ant Men}}\nTarzan, the king of the jungle, enters an isolated country called Minuni, inhabited by a people four times smaller than himself. The Minunians live in magnificent city-states which frequently wage war against each other. Tarzan befriends the king, Adendrohahkis, and the prince, Komodoflorensal, of one such city-state, called Trohanadalmakus, and joins them in war against the onslaught of the army of Veltopismakus, their warlike neighbours. Tarzan is captured on the battle-ground and taken prisoner by the Veltopismakusians. The Veltopismakusian scientist Zoanthrohago conducts an experiment reducing Tarzan to the size of a Minunian, and the ape-man is imprisoned and enslaved among other Trohanadalmakusian prisoners of war. He meets, though, Komodoflorensal in the dungeons of Veltopismakus, and together they are able to make a daring escape.\n\n===''Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle'' (1927/28)===\n{{main article|Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (novel)}}\nTarzan finds an outpost of European knights and crusaders from a \"forbidden valley\" hidden in the mountains.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Lost Empire'' (1928)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Lost Empire}}\nTarzan and a young German find a lost remnant of the Roman empire hidden in the mountains of Africa. This novel is notable for the introduction of [[Nkima]], who serves as Tarzan's monkey companion in it and a number of later Tarzan stories. It also reintroduces [[Muviro]], first seen in ''[[Tarzan and the Golden Lion]]'', as sub-chief of Tarzan's [[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]] warriors.\n\n===''Tarzan at the Earth's Core'' (1929)===\n{{main article|Tarzan at the Earth's Core}}\nIn response to a radio plea from Abner Perry, a scientist who with his friend [[David Innes]] has discovered the interior world of [[Pellucidar]] at the Earth's core, Jason Gridley launches an expedition to rescue Innes from the Korsars (corsairs), the scourge of the internal seas. He enlists Tarzan, and a fabulous airship is constructed to penetrate Pellucidar via the natural polar opening connecting the outer and inner worlds.

Gridley wins the love of the native cave-woman Jana, the Red Flower of Zoram.

This novel is perhaps best known for two scenes; in the first, Tarzan is forced to fight Cathne's strongest man in its arena. While an ordinary man might have been in trouble, Tarzan easily overpowers his antagonist.  The second scene, in which Tarzan is forced to fight a lion, starts with the ape man being forced to run away from a hunting lion, Belthar, which will hunt him down and kill him.  Tarzan at first believes he can outrun the beast (lions tire after the first 100 yards at top speed).  This lion, however, is of a breed specifically selected for endurance, and ultimately Tarzan must turn to face him, though aware that without a knife he can do little but delay the inevitable.  Fortunately his own lion ally, [[Jad-bal-ja]], whom he had raised from a cub, arrives and intervenes, killing Belthar and saving Tarzan.  Nemone, who believes her life is linked to that of her pet, kills herself when it dies.\n\nUnusually for lost cities in the Tarzan series, which are typically visited but once, Cathne and Athne reappear in a later Tarzan adventure, ''[[Tarzan the Magnificent (novel)|Tarzan the Magnificent]]''.

The characters are often said to be two-dimensional, the dialogue wooden, and the storytelling devices (such as excessive reliance on [[coincidence]]) strain credulity. While Burroughs is not a polished novelist, he is a vivid storyteller, and many of his novels are still in print. In 1963, author [[Gore Vidal]] wrote a piece on the Tarzan series that, while pointing out several of the deficiencies that the Tarzan books have as works of literature, praises Edgar Rice Burroughs for creating a compelling \"daydream figure.\"\n\nDespite critical panning, the Tarzan stories have been amazingly popular. Fans love his [[melodrama]]tic situations and the elaborate details he works into his fictional world, such as his construction of a partial language for his great apes.\n\n[[Image:Harikalar Diyari Tarzan 06014 nevit.jpg|thumb|left|Tarzan walking, in this display from an Ankara amusement park.]]\nSince the beginning of the 1970s, Tarzan books and movies have often been criticized as being blatantly [[racism|racist]]. The early books often give a negative and [[Stereotypes of Africans|stereotypical portrayal of native Africans]], both [[Arab]] and [[Black people|black]]. In ''The Return of Tarzan'', Arabs are \"surly looking\" and say things like \"dog of a Christian,\" while blacks are \"lithe, ebon warriors, gesticulating and jabbering.\" He used every ploy for the purpose of painting his antagonists in simple unflattering colors.  While he commonly uses racial stereotypes of black people, his later books also contain black characters that are good-hearted, generous, and intelligent.  At the end of ''Tarzan And The Jewels Of Opar'' (1918), the fifth book in the twenty-four book series, Burroughs writes, \"Lord and Lady Greystoke with Basuli and Mugambi rode together at the head of the column, laughing and talking together in that easy familiarity which common interests and mutual respect breed between honest and intelligent men of any races.\"  Burroughs explains somewhat Tarzan\u2019s attitudes toward people in general in ''Tarzan And The City Of Gold'' (1933), where he writes, \"Ordinarily, Tarzan was no more concerned by the fate of a white man than by that of a black man or any other created thing to which he was not bound by ties of friendship; the life of a man meant less to Tarzan of the Apes than the life of an ape.\"\n\nOther ethnic groups and social classes are likewise rendered as stereotypes; this was the custom in popular fiction of the time. A Swede has \"a long yellow moustache, an unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails\" and Russians cheat at cards. The aristocracy (excepting the House of Greystoke) and royalty are invariably effete.\n\nIn later books, there is an attempt to portray Africans in a more realistic light. For example, in ''[[Tarzan's Quest]]'', while the hero is still Tarzan, and the black Africans relatively primitive, they are portrayed as individuals, with good and bad traits, and the main villains have white skins. Burroughs never does get over his distaste for European royalty, though.\n\nBurroughs' opinions, made known mainly through the narrative voice in the stories, reflect attitudes widely held in his time, which in a 21st-century context would be considered racist and [[sexist]]. The author is not especially mean-spirited in his attitudes. His heroes do not engage in [[violence against women]] or in [[Ethnic hatred|racially motivated violence]]. Still, a superior-inferior relationship between races is plain and occasionally explicit.  According to [[James Loewen]]'s ''Sundown Towns'', this may be a vestige of Burroughs having been from [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a former [[Sundown town]] (a town that forbids non-whites from living within it)--or it may very well be the fact these were common attitudes at the turn of the century.\n\nSome defenders of the Tarzan series argue that some of the words Burroughs uses to describe Africans, such as \"savage,\" were generally understood to have a different and less offensive meaning in the early 20th century than they do today.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Unauthorized works==\nAfter Burroughs' death a number of writers produced new Tarzan stories without the permission of his estate. In some instances, the estate managed to prevent publication of such unauthorized pastiches. The most notable exception in the United States was a series of five novels by the pseudonymous \"Barton Werper\" that appeared 1964-65 by [[Charlton Comics|Gold Star Books]]. As a result of legal action by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]], they were taken off the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/werper_barton|title=Authors : Werper, Barton : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|website=www.sf-encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\nThe five novels in this series included:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?24225|title=Series: Unauthorized Tarzan|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\n*''Tarzan and the Silver Globe'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1964)\n*''Tarzan and the Cave City'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1964)\n*''Tarzan and the Snake People'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1964)\n*''Tarzan and the Abominable Snowmen'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1965)\n*''Tarzan and the Winged Invaders'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1965)\n\n=== Unauthorized works in Israel and the Arab world  ===\n\nIn Israel in the 1950s and early 1960s there was a thriving industry of locally produced Tarzan adventures published weekly in 24-page brochures by several competing publishing houses, none of which bothered to get any authorization from the Burroughs estate. The stories featured Tarzan in contemporary Africa, a popular theme being his fighting against the [[Mau Mau]] in 1950s [[Kenya]] and single-handedly crushing their revolt several times over. He also fought a great variety of monsters, [[vampires]] and invaders from outer space infesting the African jungles, and discovered several more lost cities and cultures in addition to the ones depicted in the Burroughs canon. Some brochures had him meet with Israelis and take Israel's side against her [[Arab]] enemies, especially [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s [[Egypt]]. None of the brochures ever bore a writer's name, and the various publishers - \"Elephant Publishing\" ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc}}), \"Rhino Publishing\" ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05e0\u05e3}}) and several similar names - provided no more of an address than POB numbers in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. These Tarzan brochures were extremely popular among Israeli youths of the time, successfully competing with the numerous Hebrew translations of the original Tarzan novels. The Tarzan brochures faded out by the middle 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag9/0991.html|title=ERBzine 0991: Tarzan in the Holy Land II|last=Hillman|first=Bill and Sue-On|website=www.erbzine.com|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Tarzan in Israel had some effect on the spoken Hebrew language. As it happens, \"tarzan\" ({{lang-he|\u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05df}}) is a long-established Hebrew word, translatable as \"dandy, fop, coxcomb\" (according to R. Alcalay's ''Complete Hebrew-English Dictionary'' of 1990). However, a word could not survive with that meaning while being identical with the name of a popular fictional character usually depicted as wearing a loincloth and jumping from tree to tree in the jungle. Since the 1950s the word in its original meaning has completely disappeared from the spoken language, and is virtually unknown to Hebrew speakers at present - though still duly appearing in dictionaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}<ref>[http://www.violetbooks.com/tarzan-israel.html Violet Books: Tarzan in Israel<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206010919/http://www.violetbooks.com/tarzan-israel.html |date=February 6, 2014 }}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s new Tarzan stories were also published in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].

There are also two works written by Burroughs especially for children that are not considered part of the main series. The series is considered a classic of literature and is the author's best-known work. [[Tarzan]] has been called one of the best-known literary characters in the world. ''Tarzan'' has been adapted many times, complete or in part, for radio, television, stage, and cinema. (It has been adapted for the cinema more times than any book.)\n\nThe copyright on ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' has expired in the United States in the early 1960s, though the name Tarzan is still protected as a [[trademark]] of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]] <ref>https://www.edgarriceburroughs.com/</ref> The work also remains under copyright in some other countries where copyright terms are longer.{{which?|date=July 2019}}\n\n==The twenty four main books==\n\n===''Tarzan of the Apes'' (1912)===\n{{main article|Tarzan of the Apes}}\nThe novel tells the story of John Clayton II.<ref>In \"Tarzan of the Apes,\" Chapter XXV (1914), John Clayton, father of Tarzan writes in his diary, \"Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world\u2014the second John Clayton\u2014and bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.\"</ref> John and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Lord and Lady Greystoke of [[England]], are marooned in the western coastal [[jungle]]s of equatorial [[Africa]] in 1888. After an unstated amount of time later, their son John Clayton II is born. At one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape [[Kerchak]]. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]].\n\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the [[Mangani|ape language]]) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.\n\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.\n\nUpon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as \"king\" of the apes.\n\nLater, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them. They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.\n\nA few years later when Tarzan is 18 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen. Tarzan's cousin, William Cecil Clayton, unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.\n\nAmong the party was French naval officer Paul D'Arnot. While rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men. In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English as well.\n\nUltimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in [[Wisconsin]], USA. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton the Earl of Greystoke. Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.\n\n===''The Return of Tarzan'' (1913)===\n{{main article|The Return of Tarzan}}\nThe novel picks up soon after where ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' left off. The ape man, feeling rootless in the wake of his noble sacrifice of his prospects of wedding '''[[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]]''', leaves [[United States|America]] for [[Europe]] to visit his friend '''Paul d'Arnot'''. On the ship he becomes embroiled in the affairs of '''Countess Olga de Coude''', her husband, '''Count Raoul de Coude''', and two shady characters attempting to prey on them, '''Nikolas Rokoff''' and his henchman '''Alexis Paulvitch'''. Rokoff, it turns out, is also the countess's brother. Tarzan thwarts the villains' scheme, making them his deadly enemies.\n\nLater, in France, Rokoff tries time and again to eliminate the ape man, finally engineering a duel between him and the count by making it appear that he is the countess's lover. Tarzan deliberately refuses to defend himself in the duel, even offering the count his own weapon after the latter fails to kill him with his own, a grand gesture that convinces his antagonist of his innocence. In return, Count Raoul finds him a job as a special agent in the French ministry of war. Tarzan is assigned to service in [[Algeria]].\n\nA sequence of adventures among the local [[Arab]]s ensues, including another brush with Rokoff. Afterward Tarzan sails for [[Cape Town]] and strikes up a shipboard acquaintance with '''Hazel Strong''', a friend of Jane's. But Rokoff and Paulovitch are also aboard, and manage to ambush him and throw him overboard.\n\nMiraculously, Tarzan manages to reach shore in a lifeboat he finds from a derelict ship. He finds himself in the coastal jungle where he was brought up by the apes. He soon rescues and befriends a native warrior, '''Busuli''' of the '''[[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]]''', and is adopted into the Waziri tribe. After defeating a raid on their village by ivory raiders, Tarzan becomes their chief.\n\nThe Waziri know of a lost city deep in the jungle, from which they have obtained their golden ornaments. Tarzan has them take him there, but is captured by its inhabitants, a race of ape-like men, and is condemned to be sacrificed to their sun god. To Tarzan's surprise, the priestess to perform the sacrifice is a beautiful woman who speaks the ape language he learned as a child. She tells him she is '''[[La (Tarzan)|La]]''', high priestess of the lost city of '''[[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]]'''. When the sacrificial ceremony is fortuitously interrupted, she hides Tarzan and promises to lead him to freedom. But the ape man escapes on his own, locates a treasure chamber, and manages to rejoin the Waziri.\n\nMeanwhile, Hazel Strong has reached Cape Town where she meets Jane and her father, '''Professor Porter''', together with Jane's fianc\u00e9, Tarzan's cousin '''William Cecil Clayton'''. They are all invited on a cruise up the west coast of [[Africa]] aboard the ''Lady Alice'', the yacht of another friend, '''Lord Tennington'''. Rokoff, now using the alias of M. Thuran, ingratiates himself with the party and is also invited along. The ''Lady Alice'' crashes into the same derelict ship Tarzan found, and it sinks, forcing the passengers and crew into the lifeboats. The one containing Jane, Clayton and \"Thuran\" is separated from the others and suffers terrible privations. Coincidentally, the boat finally makes shore in the same general area that Tarzan did. Unknown to the three, it is but a few miles from the landing site of the other life boats.\n\nThe three construct a rude shelter and eke out an existence of near starvation. After some weeks, Jane and William Clayton are surprised in the forest by a lion. Clayton loses Jane's respect by cowering in fear before the beast instead of defending her. But, they are saved from attack when the lion is suddenly speared and killed by an unknown hand. Their hidden savior is in fact Tarzan, who leaves without revealing himself due to seeing Jane in the arms of Clayton. Jane breaks off her engagement to Clayton, finally gathering the courage to follow her heart and not marry a man she does not love. \n\nLater Jane is kidnapped and taken to Opar by a party of the Oparian ape-men who were pursuing their escaped sacrifice, Tarzan. The ape man learns of her capture and tracks them, managing to save her from being sacrificed by La. La is crushed by Tarzan's spurning of her for Jane.\n\nTarzan and Jane make their way up the coast to the former's boyhood cabin, where they encounter the remainder of the castaways of the ''Lady Alice,'' except for Clayton. D'Arnot is there with his naval ship and is preparing to rescue and return the party to civilization.  \"Thuran\" is exposed as Rokoff and arrested. The missing Clayton had been very ill and was abandoned by Rokoff at the location where he, Rokoff and Jane's boat had landed. Jane and Tarzan go to find him, but he dies in spite of Tarzan and Jane's efforts to help him. \n\nTarzan weds Jane and Tennington weds Hazel in a double ceremony performed by Professor Porter, who had been ordained a minister in his youth. Then they all set sail for civilization, taking along the treasure Tarzan had found in Opar.\n\n===''The Beasts of Tarzan'' (1914)===\n{{main article|The Beasts of Tarzan}}\nThe story begins a year after the conclusion the previous book, [[Tarzan]] (Lord Greystoke) and [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]] have had a son they named [[Korak (character)|Jack]]. Tarzan has spent much time building an estate home on the Waziri lands in Uziri, Africa, but has returned to his ancestral estate in London for the rainy season.\n\nTarzan's adversaries from the previous novel, '''Nikolas Rokoff''' and '''Alexis Paulvitch''', escape prison and kidnap the Greystoke heir. But the trap is elaborate and insidious, leading both Tarzan and Jane to be kidnapped as well. Rokoff exiles Tarzan on a jungle island, informing him that Jack will be left with a cannibal tribe to be raised as one of their own, while Jane's fate was to be left to his imagination.\n\nUsing his jungle skill and primal intelligence, Tarzan wins the help of Sheeta, the vicious panther, a tribe of great apes led by the moderately intelligent Akut, and a native warrior, Mugambi. With their aid, Tarzan reaches the mainland and begins a lengthy pursuit to find Jane (who is actively engineering her own extrication) and Jack.\n\nBy the end of the story Rokoff is dead, while Paulvitch, his cohort, is presumed dead but manages to escape into the jungle.  The Tarzan family returned to London along with Mugambi, who is offered a place at Tarzan's Waziri estate.\n\n===''The Son of Tarzan'' (1915/16)===\n{{main article|The Son of Tarzan}}\nThe story begins 10 years after the conclusion of the previous novel. During the past decade, Alexis Paulvitch, who had escaped Tarzan at the end of the last novel, has lived a hideous life of abuse and disease among tribal people in Africa. Now he is discovered by a European ship and taken aboard. In the months that followed, Paulvitch encounters the ape, Akut, (whom Tarzan had befriended in that previous story) at one of the ship's stops. Because of Akut's interactions with Tarzan, he was unafraid of white men, and Paulvitch, unaware of the previous relationship, saw an opportunity to make some money.  He took Akut to London and began displaying him publicly.\n\nAfter the trauma of the kidnappings ten years earlier, Jane had refused to return to Africa or to allow Jack to know anything about his father's past for fear that he might somehow try to relive it. Perhaps she instinctively knew that Jack was somehow very connected to Tarzan's old life, for Jack did have an avid interest in wildlife and he was extremely athletic. When the Claytons heard about the displayed ape, John decided to take Jack to see him. Tarzan was surprised to find the ape was his old friend, Akut, and began conversing with him. Jack was amazed to see that his father could do so. John then told Jack of his life as Tarzan.\n\nJack started sneaking away to see Akut and began learning the language of the apes. Jack began to form a plan to take Akut back to the jungle. Paulvitch saw an opportunity for revenge, and agreed to help Jack. They escape to an African port where Paulvitch attacks Jack. Jack (probably now 12), like his father, was man-sized as a teen. Paulvitch is killed, and  Jack, terrified, escapes into the jungle with Akut, thinking he will have to run for the rest of his life.\n\nLike Tarzan before him, Jack learns survival in the jungle and encounters the Mangani apes, who he can speak with because of his dialogue with Akut. The nearest they can manage of his name \"Jack\" in the ape tongue is \"Korak\". This means \"killer\" which seems appropriate since Jack has proven himself to be such.\n\nBy around the age of 13 Jack finds an abused girl of about 11 named [[Meriem, wife of Korak|Meriem]] and rescues her. He begins teaching her to survive the jungle and they begin a sibling type relationship and live adventurously in the jungle for several years.\n\nIn the interim, Tarzan and Jane have begun living at their Wahiri estate in Africa again, not having any idea what became of their son. After about six years Tarzan and Jane encounter Korak (now about 18) and Meriem (now 16) and reunite with them and are returned to London and married. Arguably, the book is as much about Meriem as it is about Tarzan's son.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar'' (1916)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar}}\nAt the end of the previous novel (#4) Tarzan (John Clayton) and [[Jane (Tarzan)|Jane]]'s son, Jack a.k.a. Korak, has come into adulthood. John (Tarzan) and Jane Clayton have left London and returned to their Waziri ranch, some distance from Tarzan's original stomping grounds in Africa (where Jack will find them in novel #4).\n\nJohn Clayton finds that his fortunes have been embezzled, so he decides to return to the lost city of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], where he procured a large supply of [[gold]] from their forgotten vaults and reinforced his family fortune (in novel #2).\n\nDuring this return trip Tarzan is injured in an earthquake and loses all memories of his adult, civilized life and about Jane. [[La (Tarzan)|La]], the high priestess of the Flaming god of Opar, takes advantage of his [[amnesia]].  She had fallen in lust with the ape man during their first encounter. But while La hopes his amnesia opens the door for her lustful advances, her priests are not going to allow Tarzan to escape their sacrificial knives this time. In the meanwhile, Jane is in trouble and wonders what is keeping her husband from coming to her rescue.\n\n===''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' (1919)===\n{{main article|Jungle Tales of Tarzan}}\nA collection of twelve loosely connected short stories of Tarzan's late teenage years, within a year or two before Tarzan first sees white people including Jane Porter.\n\n#\"Tarzan's First Love\"\n#\"The Capture of Tarzan\"\n#\"The Fight for the Balu\"\n#\"The God of Tarzan\"\n#\"Tarzan and the Black Boy\"\n#\"The Witch-Doctor Seeks Vengeance\"\n#\"The End of Bukawai\"\n#\"The Lion\"\n#\"The Nightmare\"\n#\"The Battle for Teeka\"\n#\"A Jungle Joke\"\n#\"Tarzan Rescues the Moon\"\n\n===''Tarzan the Untamed'' (1920)===\n{{main article|Tarzan the Untamed}}\n\nIn the year 1914, while '''John Clayton, Lord Greystoke (Tarzan)''' is away from his plantation home in [[British East Africa]], it is destroyed by invading [[Germany|German]] troops from [[Tanganyika]]. On his return he discovers among many burned bodies one that appears to be the corpse of his wife, '''[[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter Clayton]]'''. Another fatality is the '''[[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]]''' warrior '''Wasimbu''', left crucified by the Germans. (Wasimbu's father '''[[Muviro]]''', first mentioned in this story, goes on to play a prominent role in later Tarzan novels.)\n\nMaddened, the ape-man seeks revenge not only on the perpetrators of the tragedy but upon all Germans, and sets out for the battle front of the war in west Africa. On the way he has a run-in with a [[lion]] (or ''Numa'', as it is called by the apes among whom Tarzan was raised), which he traps in a gulch by blocking the entrance. Upon reaching the front he infiltrates the German headquarters and seizes '''Major Schneider''', the officer he believes led the raid on his estate. Returning to the gulch, he throws Schneider to the lion. Tarzan goes on to help the British forces in various ways, including setting the lion loose in the enemy trenches. Tarzan later kills '''von Goss''', another German officer involved in the attack on the Greystoke estate.\n\nHe then becomes embroiled in the affairs of '''Bertha Kircher''', a woman he has seen in both the German and British camps, and believes to be a German spy, particularly after he learns she possesses his mother's locket, which he had given as a gift to Jane. His efforts to retrieve it lead him to a rendezvous between Kircher and '''Captain Fritz Schneider''', brother of the Major Schneider Tarzan previously threw to the lion, and the actual commander of the force that burned his estate. Killing Schneider, Tarzan believes his vengeance complete. Abandoning his vendetta against the Germans he departs for the jungle, swearing off all company with mankind.\n\nSeeking a band of ''[[Mangani]]'', the species of apes among whom he had been raised, Tarzan crosses a desert, undergoing great privations. Indeed, the desert is almost his undoing. He only survives by feigning death to lure a [[vulture]] (''Ska'' in the ape language) into his reach. He then catches and devours the vulture, which gives him the strength to go on. The scene is a powerful one, a highlight both of the novel and of the Tarzan series as a whole.\n\nOn the other side of the desert Tarzan locates an ape band. While with them he once again encounters Bertha Kircher, who has just escaped from '''Sergeant Usanga''', leader of a troop of native deserters from the German army, by whom she had been taken captive. Despite his suspicion of Bertha, Tarzan's natural chivalry leads him to grant her shelter and protection among the apes. Later he himself falls captive to the tribe of cannibals the deserters have sheltered among, along with '''Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick''', a British aviator who has been forced down in the jungle. Learning of Tarzan's plight, Bertha heroically leads the apes against the natives and frees them both.\n\nSmith-Oldwick becomes infatuated with Bertha, and they search for his downed plane. They find it, but are captured again by Usanga, who attempts to fly off in it with Bertha. Tarzan arrives in time to pull Usanga from the plane. Smith-Oldwick and Bertha Kircher then try to pilot it back across the desert to civilization, but fail to make it. Seeing the plane go down, Tarzan once more sets out to rescue them. On the way he encounters another ''Numa'', this one an unusual black lion caught in a pit trap, and frees it.\n\nHe, the two lovers and the lion are soon reunited, but attacked by warriors from the lost city of '''Xuja''', hidden in a secret desert valley. Tarzan is left for dead and Bertha and Smith-Oldwick taken prisoner. The Xujans are masters of the local lions and worshippers of parrots and monkeys. They are also completely insane as a consequence of long inbreeding. Recovering, Tarzan once more comes to the rescue of his companions, aided by the lion he had saved earlier. But the Xujans pursue them and they turn at bay to make one last stand. The day is saved by a search party from Smith-Oldwick's unit, who turn the tide.\n\nAfterward, Tarzan and Smith-Oldwick find out that Bertha is a double agent who has actually been working for the British. Tarzan also learns from the diary of the deceased Fritz Schneider that Jane might still be alive.\n\n===''Tarzan the Terrible'' (1921)===\n{{main article|Tarzan the Terrible}}\nTwo months have passed since the conclusion of the previous novel (#7) in which '''Tarzan''' spent many months wandering about Africa wreaking vengeance upon those whom he believed brutally murdered '''[[Jane (Tarzan)|Jane]]'''. At the end of that novel Tarzan learns that her death was a ruse, that she had not been killed at all.\n\nIn attempting to track Jane, Tarzan has come to a hidden valley called '''Pal-ul-don''' filled with [[dinosaur]]s, notably the savage [[Triceratops]]-like '''Gryfs''', which, unlike their prehistoric counterparts, are carnivorous and stand 20 feet tall at the shoulder. The lost valley is also home to two different adversarial races of tailed human-looking creatures: the hairless and white skinned, city-dwelling '''Ho-don''' and the hairy and black-skinned, hill-dwelling '''Waz-don'''. Tarzan befriends a Ho-don warrior, and the Waz-don chief, actuating some uncustomary relations. In this new world Tarzan becomes a captive but so impresses his captors with his accomplishments and skills that they name him '''Tarzan-Jad-Guru''' (Tarzan the Terrible).\n\nHaving been brought there by her German captor, it turns out Jane is also being held captive in Pal-ul-don. She becomes a center-piece in a religious power struggle that consumes much of the novel until she escapes, after which her German captor becomes dependent on her due to his own lack of jungle survival skills.\n\nWith the aid of his native allies, Tarzan continues to pursue his beloved, going through an extended series of fights and escapes to do so. In the end success seems beyond even his ability to achieve, until in the final chapter he and Jane are saved by their son '''[[Korak (character)|Korak]]''', who has been searching for Tarzan just as Tarzan has been searching for Jane.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Golden Lion'' (1922/23)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Golden Lion}}\nThe story picks up with the Clayton family, '''Tarzan''', '''[[Jane (Tarzan)|Jane]]''' and their son '''[[Korak (character)|Korak]]''', returning from their adventures in the previous novel (#8). Along the way they find an orphaned lion cub, which Tarzan takes home and trains.\n\nFlora Hawkes, a previous housemaid of the Claytons, had overheard of Tarzan's discovery of the treasure chamber in the lost city of '''[[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]]''' ('''''[[The Return of Tarzan]]''''', '''''[[Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar]]''''') and had managed to copy his map to it.  She concocted a plan to lead an expedition to collect the gold. As a contingency to discourage any local denizens from questioning them, she sought out and found a Tarzan look-alike to accompany them.\n\nTwo years passed since the Clayton family picked up their lion cub, and the Greystoke estate had become financially depleted due his support of the Allies war efforts, and he concluded it was time to return to Opar for another withdrawal.\n\nTarzan encountered Hawkes' party, where he was drugged and ended up in the hands of the Oparians. Queen La, who had come into disfavor with the high priest, felt she had nothing to lose by escaping with Tarzan through the only unguarded route\u2014a path to the legendary valley of diamonds, from which no one had ever returned. There, Tarzan found a race of humans who were little better than animals in intelligence, being enslaved by a race of intelligent gorillas. With the help of his golden lion, Tarzan used the natives to restore La to power. Before leaving he accepted a bag of diamonds for a reward.\n\nMeanwhile, the fake Tarzan convinced Tarzan's Waziri party to take the gold from Hawkes' party while most of them were out hunting. He then buried the gold so he could retain it later.  The real Tarzan eventually confronted the fake, who managed to pilfer Tarzan's bag of diamonds. The fake was then chased by Tarzan's golden lion, but escaped into a river. He was later captured and permanently imprisoned by a local tribe. Tarzan lost the diamonds, but was able to attain the gold and return with it.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Ant Men'' (1924)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Ant Men}}\nTarzan, the king of the jungle, enters an isolated country called Minuni, inhabited by a people four times smaller than himself. The Minunians live in magnificent city-states which frequently wage war against each other. Tarzan befriends the king, Adendrohahkis, and the prince, Komodoflorensal, of one such city-state, called Trohanadalmakus, and joins them in war against the onslaught of the army of Veltopismakus, their warlike neighbours. Tarzan is captured on the battle-ground and taken prisoner by the Veltopismakusians. The Veltopismakusian scientist Zoanthrohago conducts an experiment reducing Tarzan to the size of a Minunian, and the ape-man is imprisoned and enslaved among other Trohanadalmakusian prisoners of war. He meets, though, Komodoflorensal in the dungeons of Veltopismakus, and together they are able to make a daring escape.\n\n===''Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle'' (1927/28)===\n{{main article|Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (novel)}}\nTarzan finds an outpost of European knights and crusaders from a \"forbidden valley\" hidden in the mountains.\n\n===''Tarzan and the Lost Empire'' (1928)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the Lost Empire}}\nTarzan and a young German find a lost remnant of the Roman empire hidden in the mountains of Africa. This novel is notable for the introduction of [[Nkima]], who serves as Tarzan's monkey companion in it and a number of later Tarzan stories. It also reintroduces [[Muviro]], first seen in ''[[Tarzan and the Golden Lion]]'', as sub-chief of Tarzan's [[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]] warriors.\n\n===''Tarzan at the Earth's Core'' (1929)===\n{{main article|Tarzan at the Earth's Core}}\nIn response to a radio plea from Abner Perry, a scientist who with his friend [[David Innes]] has discovered the interior world of [[Pellucidar]] at the Earth's core, Jason Gridley launches an expedition to rescue Innes from the Korsars (corsairs), the scourge of the internal seas. He enlists Tarzan, and a fabulous airship is constructed to penetrate Pellucidar via the natural polar opening connecting the outer and inner worlds. The airship is crewed primarily by Germans, with Tarzan's [[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]] warriors under their chief [[Muviro]] also along for the expedition.\n\nIn Pellucidar Tarzan and Gridley are each separated from the main force of the expedition and must struggle for survival against the prehistoric creatures and peoples of the inner world. Gridley wins the love of the native cave-woman Jana, the Red Flower of Zoram. Eventually everyone is reunited, and the party succeeds in rescuing Innes.\n\nAs Tarzan and the others prepare to return home, Gridley decides to stay to search for Frederich Wilhelm Eric von Mendeldorf und von Horst, one last member of the expedition who remains lost (The missing Von Horst's adventures are told in a sequel, ''[[Back to the Stone Age]]'', which event does not involve either Gridley or Tarzan).\n\n===''Tarzan the Invincible'' (1930/31)===\n{{main article|Tarzan the Invincible}}\nTarzan, his monkey friend [[Nkima]], and Chief [[Muviro]] and his faithful [[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]] warriors prevent [[Soviet Union|Russian]] [[communists]] from [[looting]] the [[Lost city (fiction)|lost city]] of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]].\n\n===''Tarzan Triumphant'' (1931)===\n{{main article|Tarzan Triumphant}}\nBacked by Chief [[Muviro]] and his faithful [[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Waziri]] warriors, Tarzan faces Soviet agents seeking revenge and a lost tribe descended from early Christians practicing a bizarre and debased religious cult.\n\n===''Tarzan and the City of Gold'' (1932)===\n{{main article|Tarzan and the City of Gold}}\nAfter encountering and befriending Valthor, a warrior of the lost city of Athne (whom he rescues from a group of bandits known as ''shiftas''), the City of Ivory and capital of the land of Thenar, Tarzan is captured by the insane yet beautiful queen Nemone of its hereditary enemy, Cathne, the City of Gold, capital of the land of Onthar.  This novel is perhaps best known for two scenes; in the first, Tarzan is forced to fight Cathne's strongest man in its arena. While an ordinary man might have been in trouble, Tarzan easily overpowers his antagonist.  The second scene, in which Tarzan is forced to fight a lion, starts with the ape man being forced to run away from a hunting lion, Belthar, which will hunt him down and kill him.  Tarzan at first believes he can outrun the beast (lions tire after the first 100 yards at top speed).  This lion, however, is of a breed specifically selected for endurance, and ultimately Tarzan must turn to face him, though aware that without a knife he can do little but delay the inevitable.

The characters are often said to be two-dimensional, the dialogue wooden, and the storytelling devices (such as excessive reliance on [[coincidence]]) strain credulity. While Burroughs is not a polished novelist, he is a vivid storyteller, and many of his novels are still in print. In 1963, author [[Gore Vidal]] wrote a piece on the Tarzan series that, while pointing out several of the deficiencies that the Tarzan books have as works of literature, praises Edgar Rice Burroughs for creating a compelling \"daydream figure.\"\n\nDespite critical panning, the Tarzan stories have been amazingly popular. Fans love his [[melodrama]]tic situations and the elaborate details he works into his fictional world, such as his construction of a partial language for his great apes.\n\n[[Image:Harikalar Diyari Tarzan 06014 nevit.jpg|thumb|left|Tarzan walking, in this display from an Ankara amusement park.]]\nSince the beginning of the 1970s, Tarzan books and movies have often been criticized as being blatantly [[racism|racist]]. The early books often give a negative and [[Stereotypes of Africans|stereotypical portrayal of native Africans]], both [[Arab]] and [[Black people|black]]. In ''The Return of Tarzan'', Arabs are \"surly looking\" and say things like \"dog of a Christian,\" while blacks are \"lithe, ebon warriors, gesticulating and jabbering.\" He used every ploy for the purpose of painting his antagonists in simple unflattering colors.  While he commonly uses racial stereotypes of black people, his later books also contain black characters that are good-hearted, generous, and intelligent.  At the end of ''Tarzan And The Jewels Of Opar'' (1918), the fifth book in the twenty-four book series, Burroughs writes, \"Lord and Lady Greystoke with Basuli and Mugambi rode together at the head of the column, laughing and talking together in that easy familiarity which common interests and mutual respect breed between honest and intelligent men of any races.\"  Burroughs explains somewhat Tarzan\u2019s attitudes toward people in general in ''Tarzan And The City Of Gold'' (1933), where he writes, \"Ordinarily, Tarzan was no more concerned by the fate of a white man than by that of a black man or any other created thing to which he was not bound by ties of friendship; the life of a man meant less to Tarzan of the Apes than the life of an ape.\"\n\nOther ethnic groups and social classes are likewise rendered as stereotypes; this was the custom in popular fiction of the time. A Swede has \"a long yellow moustache, an unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails\" and Russians cheat at cards. The aristocracy (excepting the House of Greystoke) and royalty are invariably effete.\n\nIn later books, there is an attempt to portray Africans in a more realistic light. For example, in ''[[Tarzan's Quest]]'', while the hero is still Tarzan, and the black Africans relatively primitive, they are portrayed as individuals, with good and bad traits, and the main villains have white skins. Burroughs never does get over his distaste for European royalty, though.\n\nBurroughs' opinions, made known mainly through the narrative voice in the stories, reflect attitudes widely held in his time, which in a 21st-century context would be considered racist and [[sexist]]. The author is not especially mean-spirited in his attitudes. His heroes do not engage in [[violence against women]] or in [[Ethnic hatred|racially motivated violence]]. Still, a superior-inferior relationship between races is plain and occasionally explicit.  According to [[James Loewen]]'s ''Sundown Towns'', this may be a vestige of Burroughs having been from [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a former [[Sundown town]] (a town that forbids non-whites from living within it)--or it may very well be the fact these were common attitudes at the turn of the century.\n\nSome defenders of the Tarzan series argue that some of the words Burroughs uses to describe Africans, such as \"savage,\" were generally understood to have a different and less offensive meaning in the early 20th century than they do today.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Unauthorized works==\nAfter Burroughs' death a number of writers produced new Tarzan stories without the permission of his estate. In some instances, the estate managed to prevent publication of such unauthorized pastiches. The most notable exception in the United States was a series of five novels by the pseudonymous \"Barton Werper\" that appeared 1964-65 by [[Charlton Comics|Gold Star Books]]. As a result of legal action by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]], they were taken off the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/werper_barton|title=Authors : Werper, Barton : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|website=www.sf-encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\nThe five novels in this series included:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?24225|title=Series: Unauthorized Tarzan|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\n*''Tarzan and the Silver Globe'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1964)\n*''Tarzan and the Cave City'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1964)\n*''Tarzan and the Snake People'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1964)\n*''Tarzan and the Abominable Snowmen'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1965)\n*''Tarzan and the Winged Invaders'' (Derby: Connecticut: New International Library/Gold Star Books, 1965)\n\n=== Unauthorized works in Israel and the Arab world  ===\n\nIn Israel in the 1950s and early 1960s there was a thriving industry of locally produced Tarzan adventures published weekly in 24-page brochures by several competing publishing houses, none of which bothered to get any authorization from the Burroughs estate. The stories featured Tarzan in contemporary Africa, a popular theme being his fighting against the [[Mau Mau]] in 1950s [[Kenya]] and single-handedly crushing their revolt several times over. He also fought a great variety of monsters, [[vampires]] and invaders from outer space infesting the African jungles, and discovered several more lost cities and cultures in addition to the ones depicted in the Burroughs canon. Some brochures had him meet with Israelis and take Israel's side against her [[Arab]] enemies, especially [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]'s [[Egypt]]. None of the brochures ever bore a writer's name, and the various publishers - \"Elephant Publishing\" ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc}}), \"Rhino Publishing\" ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05e0\u05e3}}) and several similar names - provided no more of an address than POB numbers in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. These Tarzan brochures were extremely popular among Israeli youths of the time, successfully competing with the numerous Hebrew translations of the original Tarzan novels. The Tarzan brochures faded out by the middle 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag9/0991.html|title=ERBzine 0991: Tarzan in the Holy Land II|last=Hillman|first=Bill and Sue-On|website=www.erbzine.com|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Tarzan in Israel had some effect on the spoken Hebrew language. As it happens, \"tarzan\" ({{lang-he|\u05d8\u05e8\u05d6\u05df}}) is a long-established Hebrew word, translatable as \"dandy, fop, coxcomb\" (according to R. Alcalay's ''Complete Hebrew-English Dictionary'' of 1990). However, a word could not survive with that meaning while being identical with the name of a popular fictional character usually depicted as wearing a loincloth and jumping from tree to tree in the jungle. Since the 1950s the word in its original meaning has completely disappeared from the spoken language, and is virtually unknown to Hebrew speakers at present - though still duly appearing in dictionaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}<ref>[http://www.violetbooks.com/tarzan-israel.html Violet Books: Tarzan in Israel<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206010919/http://www.violetbooks.com/tarzan-israel.html |date=February 6, 2014 }}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s new Tarzan stories were also published in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].

The location shooting for the film took place near [[Tripoli]], Libya.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Timbuktu]], experienced guide Joe January ([[John Wayne]]) reluctantly joins a Saharan treasure hunting expedition led by Paul Bonnard ([[Rossano Brazzi]]), a man obsessed with confirming his dead father's claim to have found a lost city. Dita ([[Sophia Loren]]), a woman of dubious reputation, becomes infatuated with Paul and his willingness to overlook her past. She invites herself along, despite Joe's protests. During the tough dry ordeal, Joe and Dita become attracted to each other, raising tensions.\n\nJust as they run out of water, they stumble upon the ancient city and a well. There, they find three human skeletons, a woman and two men. It becomes evident that Paul's father found his woman in the arms of his guide, killed them and then himself. There is also no obvious treasure to be found. Paul's faith in his father is shattered and he becomes drunk.\n\nHowever; they find the treasure after Joe deciphers the clues left by Paul's father in his bible.

It was a subject of controversy for its violent content. Fourteen years following the end of the series, the series was revived for an eighth season airing from October 27 to December 29, 2011. A theatrical feature-length film based on the series titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\n==Premise==\n{{See also|List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters}}\n\nThe series centers on two socially-incompetent, dimwitted, [[Juvenile delinquency|teenage delinquent]] [[Sedentary lifestyle|couch potatoes]] named [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] (both voiced by Judge). They go to school at Highland High located in Highland, Texas. If they are not at school or out causing mayhem, they will be in front of the TV. Beavis and Butt-head have no adult supervision at home and are barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples even when it regards to each other. They will usually deem their encounters as \"cool\" if they are associated with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], violence, sex, destruction, or [[macabre]]. While inexperienced with females, they both share an obsession with sex and tend to chuckle whenever they hear words or phrases that could be even [[Throat-clear|vaguely]] interpreted as sexual, [[Carnal knowledge|carnal]] or [[scatological]].\n\nEach episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique [[music video]]s using commentary improvised by Judge (much in the same way as ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''; in season eight, they also commented on clips from other MTV shows such as ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and ''[[True Life]]'', plus shows from other [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]-owned networks such as [[Paramount Network|Spike]]) The remainder of the episodes depict the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-08-02/features/1997214087_1_beavis-and-butt-head-butt-head-do-america-groupie|title=Goodbye, cool world TV: Beavis and Butt-head, nasty, dumb, hysterical little boogers, are going off the air.

It was later revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant that Settle did not have cable TV, nor did he watch the show.\n\nIn \"Lightning Strikes\", the show parodies the desire to blame things on youth culture. When a reporter asks the duo why they had been flying a kite in a thunderstorm, they explain that they had been [[Kite experiment|inspired]] by a documentary about [[Benjamin Franklin|\"some old dude with long hair and glasses\"]]. The interview continues until they mention having watched rock music videos earlier in the day; the reporter concludes (on the air) that the videos are to blame for their actions.\n\nMTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00&nbsp;p.m., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:\n<blockquote>Beavis and Butt-Head are not real.

For example, one character on the show, Tom Anderson, originally called them \"Butthole\" and \"Joe\", and believed the two to be of Asian ethnicity. (describing them to the police as \"[[Oriental]]\") In later episodes, Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as \"Penis and Butt-Munch\". [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] called them \"Beavis and Bum-head\" in \"Citizen Butt-head\", as well as in the [[Beavis and Butt-head Do America|movie]], where an old lady (voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]]) consistently calls them \"Travis\" and \"Bob-head\". In \"Incognito\", when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named \"Crevis and Bung-Head\". The bully, seeing through the disguises, calls them \"Beaver and Butt-Plug\". In \"Right On!\", when the duo appear on the ''Gus Baker Show'', host Gus Baker (a caricature of [[Rush Limbaugh]]) introduces them as \"Beavis and Buffcoat\".\n\nBeavis and Butt-Head have been compared to [[Savant syndrome|idiot savants]] because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by [[Mike Judge]]. With regard to criticisms of the two as \"idiots\", Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.\n\n== Satire ==\n{{Fanpov|date=January 2020}}\nBeavis and Butt-head are satirical devices. The show offers viewers an irreverent perspective reminiscent of [[Mad (magazine)|Mad magazine]] or \"[[Saturday Night Live]]\", combining juvenile scatology with more insightful observations.

The volumes ''The Final Judgment'' and ''Beavis & Butt-head Do Christmas'' were also released on [[DVD]] during the early days of the format.\n\n===Time Life===\n\nAll of the U.S. VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two-disc sets through the [[Time Life]] organization. The DVD releases were titled ''The Best of Beavis and Butt-Head''. The third DVD release of Beavis and Butt-Head was two series of three-disc sets released by Time-Life in December 2002.\n\nThe first set in the series contained the same program content of six of the Beavis and Butt-Head VHS compilations previously released by Sony Music Video from 1994 to 1999: Butt-O-Ween, Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas, Innocence Lost, Chicks 'n' Stuff, Feel Our Pain, and Troubled Youth, with two VHS compilations combined into a single disc. The set was advertised considerably on networks such as Comedy Central and on the Time-Life website.\n\nSometime after the first release, a second set of Time-Life Beavis and Butt-Head DVDs was released. This set contained the programs of the remaining SMV VHS compilations: Work Sucks, There Goes the Neighborhood, The Final Judgement, Law-Abiding Citizens, and Hard Cash. Two of the discs in the set once again contained the program content of two of the VHS tapes, while the last disc (Hard Cash) contained only the content of the final VHS program, but did additionally include four of the music video segments from the original broadcasts with Beavis and Butt-Head commentating. The second Time-Life set was not advertised, and subsequently became rarer. They also released VHS version of the Time Life collection.\n\n===''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head''===\n\nParamount announced the release of a two-disc DVD set titled ''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head'' which was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. According to Judge, the ''History'' set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.<ref>{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=https://avclub.com/content/node/23060 |title=Mike Judge |newspaper=The A.V.

It was a subject of controversy for its violent content. Fourteen years following the end of the series, the series was revived for an eighth season airing from October 27 to December 29, 2011. A theatrical feature-length film based on the series titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\n==Premise==\n{{See also|List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters}}\n\nThe series centers on two socially-incompetent, dimwitted, [[Juvenile delinquency|teenage delinquent]] [[Sedentary lifestyle|couch potatoes]] named [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] (both voiced by Judge). They go to school at Highland High located in Highland, Texas. If they are not at school or out causing mayhem, they will be in front of the TV. Beavis and Butt-head have no adult supervision at home and are barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples even when it regards to each other. They will usually deem their encounters as \"cool\" if they are associated with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], violence, sex, destruction, or [[macabre]]. While inexperienced with females, they both share an obsession with sex and tend to chuckle whenever they hear words or phrases that could be even [[Throat-clear|vaguely]] interpreted as sexual, [[Carnal knowledge|carnal]] or [[scatological]].\n\nEach episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique [[music video]]s using commentary improvised by Judge (much in the same way as ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''; in season eight, they also commented on clips from other MTV shows such as ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and ''[[True Life]]'', plus shows from other [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]-owned networks such as [[Paramount Network|Spike]]) The remainder of the episodes depict the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-08-02/features/1997214087_1_beavis-and-butt-head-butt-head-do-america-groupie|title=Goodbye, cool world TV: Beavis and Butt-head, nasty, dumb, hysterical little boogers, are going off the air.

There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion (\"California\" by [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say \"fire\". However, MTV eventually removed the episode entirely.

The interview continues until they mention having watched rock music videos earlier in the day; the reporter concludes (on the air) that the videos are to blame for their actions.\n\nMTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00&nbsp;p.m., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:\n<blockquote>Beavis and Butt-Head are not real.

But for some reason, the little wienerheads make us laugh.</blockquote>\nThis was later changed to:\n<blockquote>Beavis and Butt-Head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do would cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly [[deported]]. To put it another way: don't try this at home.</blockquote>\nThis disclaimer also appears before the opening of their [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games as well as their [[Windows]] game ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beavis and Butt-Head (TV Series 1993\u20132011) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105950/crazycredits|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThey were famously lambasted by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[South Carolina]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] as \"Buffcoat and Beaver\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/08/15/end-beavis-and-butt-head/|title=Dude...

For example, one character on the show, Tom Anderson, originally called them \"Butthole\" and \"Joe\", and believed the two to be of Asian ethnicity. (describing them to the police as \"[[Oriental]]\") In later episodes, Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as \"Penis and Butt-Munch\". [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] called them \"Beavis and Bum-head\" in \"Citizen Butt-head\", as well as in the [[Beavis and Butt-head Do America|movie]], where an old lady (voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]]) consistently calls them \"Travis\" and \"Bob-head\". In \"Incognito\", when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named \"Crevis and Bung-Head\". The bully, seeing through the disguises, calls them \"Beaver and Butt-Plug\". In \"Right On!\", when the duo appear on the ''Gus Baker Show'', host Gus Baker (a caricature of [[Rush Limbaugh]]) introduces them as \"Beavis and Buffcoat\".\n\nBeavis and Butt-Head have been compared to [[Savant syndrome|idiot savants]] because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by [[Mike Judge]]. With regard to criticisms of the two as \"idiots\", Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.\n\n== Satire ==\n{{Fanpov|date=January 2020}}\nBeavis and Butt-head are satirical devices.

The third DVD release of Beavis and Butt-Head was two series of three-disc sets released by Time-Life in December 2002.\n\nThe first set in the series contained the same program content of six of the Beavis and Butt-Head VHS compilations previously released by Sony Music Video from 1994 to 1999: Butt-O-Ween, Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas, Innocence Lost, Chicks 'n' Stuff, Feel Our Pain, and Troubled Youth, with two VHS compilations combined into a single disc. The set was advertised considerably on networks such as Comedy Central and on the Time-Life website.\n\nSometime after the first release, a second set of Time-Life Beavis and Butt-Head DVDs was released. This set contained the programs of the remaining SMV VHS compilations: Work Sucks, There Goes the Neighborhood, The Final Judgement, Law-Abiding Citizens, and Hard Cash. Two of the discs in the set once again contained the program content of two of the VHS tapes, while the last disc (Hard Cash) contained only the content of the final VHS program, but did additionally include four of the music video segments from the original broadcasts with Beavis and Butt-Head commentating. The second Time-Life set was not advertised, and subsequently became rarer. They also released VHS version of the Time Life collection.\n\n===''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head''===\n\nParamount announced the release of a two-disc DVD set titled ''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head'' which was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. According to Judge, the ''History'' set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.<ref>{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=https://avclub.com/content/node/23060 |title=Mike Judge |newspaper=The A.V.

Most of these techniques can be summarized into two main families: \u201cCurved Mirror\u201d (or Curved Combiner) based and \u201cWaveguide\u201d or \"Light-guide\" based. The mirror technique has been used in [[EyeTap]]s, by [[Meta (company)|Meta]] in their [[Meta 1]], by [[Vuzix]] in their Star 1200 product, by [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], and by [[Laster Technologies]].\n\nVarious waveguide techniques have existed for some time. These techniques include diffraction optics, holographic optics, polarized optics, reflective optics, and projection:\n* Diffractive waveguide \u2013 slanted diffraction grating elements (nanometric 10E-9). [[Nokia]] technique now licensed to Vuzix.\n* Holographic waveguide \u2013 3 [[holographic optical element]]s (HOE) sandwiched together (RGB). Used by [[Sony]] and [[Konica Minolta]].\n* Reflective waveguide \u2013 thick light guide with single semi-reflective mirror. This technique is used by [[Epson]] in their Moverio product.\n*[[Virtual retinal display]] (VRD) \u2013 Also known as a retinal scan display (RSD) or retinal projector (RP), is a display technology that draws a [[raster graphics|raster]] display (like a [[television]]) directly onto the [[retina]] of the eye - developed by [[MicroVision, Inc]]..\n\nThe [[Technical Illusions]] [[Technical Illusions#castAR|castAR]] uses a different technique with clear glass.  The glasses have a projector, and the image is returned to the eye by a reflective surface.\n\n== Smart sunglasses ==\nSmart sunglasses which are able to change their light filtering properties at runtime generally use liquid crystal technology. As lighting conditions change, for example when the user goes from indoors to outdoors, the brightness ratio also changes and can cause undesirable vision impairment. An attractive solution for overcoming this issue is to incorporate dimming filters into smart sunglasses which control the amount of ambient light reaching the eye. An innovative liquid crystal based component for use in the lenses of smart sunglasses is PolarView<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lc-tec.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PolarView%C2%AE-ND14-F-product-description-1705.pdf|title=Polar View by LC-Tec|last=|first=|date=|website=LC-Tec|access-date=}}</ref> by LC-Tec.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=35907086|title=LC-TEC Displays AB: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> PolarView offers analog dimming control, with the level of dimming being adjusted by an applied drive voltage.\n\nAnother type of smart sunglasses uses adaptive polarization filtering (ADF). ADF-type smart sunglasses can change their polarization filtering characteristics at runtime. For example, ADF-type smart sunglasses can change from horizontal polarization filtering to vertical polarization filtering at the touch of a button.\n\nThe lenses of smart sunglasses can be manufactured out of multiple adaptive cells, therefore different parts of the lens can exhibit different optical properties. For example the top of the lens can be electronically configured to have different polarization filter characteristics and different opacity than the lower part of the lens.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-05-19|title=Patent US20160282639 - Apparatus and method for augmenting human vision by means of adaptive polarization filter grids|url=https://encrypted.google.com/patents/US20160282639|journal=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n== Human Computer Interface (HCI) control input ==\nHead-mounted displays are not designed to be workstations, and traditional input devices such as keyboard and mouse do not support the concept of smartglasses.

In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Google Glass and posted in the Google Glass community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://korrespondent.net/lifestyle/gadgets/1521949-ukraincy-ne-smogut-legalno-kupit-ochki-google-glass-iz-za-zapreta-na-shpionskie-gadzhety|title=\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0446\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 Google Glass \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \"\u0448\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435\" \u0433\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0442\u044b|language=Russian|publisher=Korrespondent.net|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref> Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Google Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the governmental committee, Google stated in early July that is working on a locking system and raising awareness of the ability of users to remotely reset Google Glass from the web interface in the event of loss. Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities.

Most of these techniques can be summarized into two main families: \u201cCurved Mirror\u201d (or Curved Combiner) based and \u201cWaveguide\u201d or \"Light-guide\" based. The mirror technique has been used in [[EyeTap]]s, by [[Meta (company)|Meta]] in their [[Meta 1]], by [[Vuzix]] in their Star 1200 product, by [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], and by [[Laster Technologies]].\n\nVarious waveguide techniques have existed for some time. These techniques include diffraction optics, holographic optics, polarized optics, reflective optics, and projection:\n* Diffractive waveguide \u2013 slanted diffraction grating elements (nanometric 10E-9). [[Nokia]] technique now licensed to Vuzix.\n* Holographic waveguide \u2013 3 [[holographic optical element]]s (HOE) sandwiched together (RGB). Used by [[Sony]] and [[Konica Minolta]].\n* Reflective waveguide \u2013 thick light guide with single semi-reflective mirror. This technique is used by [[Epson]] in their Moverio product.\n*[[Virtual retinal display]] (VRD) \u2013 Also known as a retinal scan display (RSD) or retinal projector (RP), is a display technology that draws a [[raster graphics|raster]] display (like a [[television]]) directly onto the [[retina]] of the eye - developed by [[MicroVision, Inc]]..\n\nThe [[Technical Illusions]] [[Technical Illusions#castAR|castAR]] uses a different technique with clear glass.  The glasses have a projector, and the image is returned to the eye by a reflective surface.\n\n== Smart sunglasses ==\nSmart sunglasses which are able to change their light filtering properties at runtime generally use liquid crystal technology. As lighting conditions change, for example when the user goes from indoors to outdoors, the brightness ratio also changes and can cause undesirable vision impairment. An attractive solution for overcoming this issue is to incorporate dimming filters into smart sunglasses which control the amount of ambient light reaching the eye. An innovative liquid crystal based component for use in the lenses of smart sunglasses is PolarView<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lc-tec.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PolarView%C2%AE-ND14-F-product-description-1705.pdf|title=Polar View by LC-Tec|last=|first=|date=|website=LC-Tec|access-date=}}</ref> by LC-Tec.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=35907086|title=LC-TEC Displays AB: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> PolarView offers analog dimming control, with the level of dimming being adjusted by an applied drive voltage.\n\nAnother type of smart sunglasses uses adaptive polarization filtering (ADF). ADF-type smart sunglasses can change their polarization filtering characteristics at runtime. For example, ADF-type smart sunglasses can change from horizontal polarization filtering to vertical polarization filtering at the touch of a button.\n\nThe lenses of smart sunglasses can be manufactured out of multiple adaptive cells, therefore different parts of the lens can exhibit different optical properties. For example the top of the lens can be electronically configured to have different polarization filter characteristics and different opacity than the lower part of the lens.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-05-19|title=Patent US20160282639 - Apparatus and method for augmenting human vision by means of adaptive polarization filter grids|url=https://encrypted.google.com/patents/US20160282639|journal=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n== Human Computer Interface (HCI) control input ==\nHead-mounted displays are not designed to be workstations, and traditional input devices such as keyboard and mouse do not support the concept of smartglasses.

In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Google Glass and posted in the Google Glass community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://korrespondent.net/lifestyle/gadgets/1521949-ukraincy-ne-smogut-legalno-kupit-ochki-google-glass-iz-za-zapreta-na-shpionskie-gadzhety|title=\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0446\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 Google Glass \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \"\u0448\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435\" \u0433\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0442\u044b|language=Russian|publisher=Korrespondent.net|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref> Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Google Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the governmental committee, Google stated in early July that is working on a locking system and raising awareness of the ability of users to remotely reset Google Glass from the web interface in the event of loss. Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such as [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations which ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas.<ref name=\"Caesars\">{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Matt|title=Google Glass Violates Nevada Law, Says Caesars Palace|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|publisher=IGN|accessdate=1 June 2013|date=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Safety considerations ====\nConcerns have also been raised on operating motor vehicles while wearing the device.

In 2015, 30.7 percent of Baltimore households lacked a car, which decreased slightly to 28.9 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016.

The first [[limited-access highway]] serving Baltimore was the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway]], which opened in stages between 1950 and 1954. Maintenance of it is split: the half closest to Baltimore is maintained by the state of Maryland, and the half closest to Washington by the [[National Park Service]]. Trucks are only permitted to use the northern part of the parkway. Trucks (tractor-trailers) continued to use [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) until [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] (I-95) between Baltimore and Washington opened in 1971.\n\nThe Interstate highways serving Baltimore are [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]], I-83 (the Jones Falls Expressway), I-95, [[Interstate 395 (Maryland)|I-395]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] (the Baltimore Beltway), [[Interstate 795 (Maryland)|I-795]] (the Northwest Expressway), [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]] (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway), and [[Interstate 97|I-97]]. The city's mainline Interstate highways\u2014I-95, I-83, and I-70\u2014do not directly connect to each other, and in the case of I-70 end at a park and ride lot just inside the city limits, because of [[highway revolts|freeway revolts]] in Baltimore. These revolts were led primarily by [[Barbara Mikulski]], a former [[United States senator]] for Maryland, which resulted in the abandonment of the original plan. There are two tunnels traversing Baltimore Harbor within the city limits: the four-bore [[Fort McHenry Tunnel]] (opened in 1985 and serving I-95) and the two-bore [[Baltimore Harbor Tunnel|Harbor Tunnel]] (opened in 1957 and serving I-895). The Baltimore Beltway crosses south of Baltimore Harbor over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore)|Francis Scott Key Bridge]].\n\n[[File:2019-07-15 13 34 07 View south along Interstate 395 (Cal Ripken Way) at its junction with Interstate 95 from the overpass for the ramp from Interstate 395 southbound to Interstate 95 northbound in Baltimore City, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-95 from the ramp from I-395 to I-95 northbound in Baltimore]]\nThe first interstate highway built in Baltimore was I-83, called the Jones Falls Expressway (first portion built in the early 1960s). Running from the downtown toward the northwest (NNW), it was built through a natural corridor, which meant that no residents or housing were directly affected. A planned section from what is now its southern terminus to I-95 was abandoned. Its route through parkland received criticism.\n\nPlanning for the Baltimore Beltway antedates the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The first portion completed was a small strip connecting the two sections of I-83, the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway and the Jones Falls Expressway.\n\nThe only [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]] in the city are US 1, which bypasses downtown, and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]], which crosses downtown from east to west. Both run along major surface streets; however, US 40 utilizes a small section of a freeway cancelled in the 1970s in the west side of the city originally intended for [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|Interstate 170]]. State routes in the city also travel along surface streets, with the exception of [[Maryland Route 295]], which carries the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway.\n\nThe Baltimore City Department of Transportation (BCDOT) is responsible for several functions of the road transportation system in Baltimore, including repairing roads, sidewalks, and alleys; road signs; street lights; and managing the flow of transportation systems.<ref name=bcdot>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation.aspx| title=Home| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref> In addition, the agency is in charge of vehicle towing and [[traffic camera]]s.<ref name=bcdot2>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/VehicleTowing.aspx| title=Vehicle Towing| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name=bcdot3>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| title=Traffic Cameras| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation|access-date=January 21, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110127061625/http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| archive-date= January 27, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> BCDOT maintains all streets within the city of Baltimore.

There are also many pedestrian hiking trails traversing the park. The [[Jones Falls Trail]] currently runs from the Inner Harbor to the Cylburn Arboretum; however, it is currently undergoing expansion. Long-term plans call for it to extend to the [[Mount Washington (Baltimore Light Rail station)|Mount Washington Light Rail Stop]], and possibly as far north as the Falls Road stop to connect to the Robert E. Lee boardwalk north of the city. It will also incorporate a spur alongside Western Run. The two aforementioned trails carry sections of the [[East Coast Greenway]] through the city. There is also the Herring Run Trail, which runs from [[Maryland Route 147|Harford Road]] east to its end beyond Sinclair Lane, utilizing Herring Run Park; long-term plans also call for its extension to Morgan State University and north to points beyond. Other major bicycle projects include a protected cycle track installed on both Maryland Avenue and Mount Royal Avenue, expected to become the backbone of a downtown bicycle network. Installation for the cycletracks is expected in 2014 and 2016, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the bicycle trails and cycletracks, Baltimore has the Stony Run Trail, a walking path that will eventually connect from the Jones Falls north to Northern Parkway, utilizing much of the old Ma and Pa Railroad corridor inside the city. In 2011, the city undertook a campaign to reconstruct many sidewalk ramps in the city, coinciding with mass resurfacing of the city's streets.

The Colts advanced to the [[NFL Championship]] twice (1958 & 1959) and [[Super Bowl]] twice (1969 & 1971), winning all except [[Super Bowl III]] in 1969.

The BCFD operates out of 37 fire stations located throughout the city and has a long history and sets of traditions in its various houses and divisions.\n\n===State government===\n{{update|date=December 2019}}\n{{See also|Baltimore City Delegation}}\n\nSince the legislative [[redistricting]] in 2002, Baltimore has had six legislative districts located entirely within its boundaries, giving the city six seats in the 47-member [[Maryland Senate]] and 18 in the 141-member [[Maryland House of Delegates]].<ref name=\"Delegation\">{{cite web| url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/html/gacobcit.html| title=General Assembly Members by County: Baltimore City| work=Maryland Manual On-Line| publisher=Maryland State Archives| date=January 27, 2011| access-date=March 30, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110331203017/http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/html/gacobcit.html| archive-date= March 31, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"2002 Plan\">{{cite web| url=http://planning.maryland.gov/PDF/OurProducts/Redistrict/2002ld_courtappeals_62102_MD_map_web.pdf| title=2002 Legislative District Plan| publisher=Maryland Department of Planning| access-date=March 30, 2011}}</ref> During the previous 10-year period, Baltimore had four legislative districts within the city limits, but four others overlapped the Baltimore County line.<ref name=\"1992 Plan\">{{cite web| url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/map/html/bcm.html| title=Legislative Election Districts 1992\u20132000| work=Maryland Manual On-Line| publisher=Maryland State Archives| date=June 17, 2004| access-date=March 31, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110331203617/http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/map/html/bcm.html| archive-date= March 31, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> {{as of|2011|January|}}, all of Baltimore's state senators and delegates were Democrats.<ref name=\"Delegation\" /> Approval of the next redistricting plan is expected to become effective in time for Maryland's 2012 congressional primary election on February 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://planning.maryland.gov/OurProducts/redistrictingFAQ.shtml| title=Congressional and Legislative Redistricting| publisher=Maryland Department of Planning| access-date=March 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====State agencies====\n{{See also|List of state agencies headquartered in Baltimore}}\n\n===Federal government===\n{{Further|Maryland's 2nd congressional district|Maryland's 3rd congressional district|Maryland's 7th congressional district}}\n{{See also|United States Senate election in Maryland, 2006}}\nThree of the state's eight [[congressional district]]s include portions of Baltimore: the [[Maryland's 2nd congressional district|2nd]], represented by [[Dutch Ruppersberger]]; the [[Maryland's 3rd congressional district|3rd]], represented by [[John Sarbanes]]; and the [[Maryland's 7th congressional district|7th]], represented by [[Elijah Cummings]].

In 2015, 30.7 percent of Baltimore households lacked a car, which decreased slightly to 28.9 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016.

The first [[limited-access highway]] serving Baltimore was the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway]], which opened in stages between 1950 and 1954. Maintenance of it is split: the half closest to Baltimore is maintained by the state of Maryland, and the half closest to Washington by the [[National Park Service]]. Trucks are only permitted to use the northern part of the parkway. Trucks (tractor-trailers) continued to use [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) until [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] (I-95) between Baltimore and Washington opened in 1971.\n\nThe Interstate highways serving Baltimore are [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]], I-83 (the Jones Falls Expressway), I-95, [[Interstate 395 (Maryland)|I-395]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] (the Baltimore Beltway), [[Interstate 795 (Maryland)|I-795]] (the Northwest Expressway), [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]] (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway), and [[Interstate 97|I-97]]. The city's mainline Interstate highways\u2014I-95, I-83, and I-70\u2014do not directly connect to each other, and in the case of I-70 end at a park and ride lot just inside the city limits, because of [[highway revolts|freeway revolts]] in Baltimore. These revolts were led primarily by [[Barbara Mikulski]], a former [[United States senator]] for Maryland, which resulted in the abandonment of the original plan. There are two tunnels traversing Baltimore Harbor within the city limits: the four-bore [[Fort McHenry Tunnel]] (opened in 1985 and serving I-95) and the two-bore [[Baltimore Harbor Tunnel|Harbor Tunnel]] (opened in 1957 and serving I-895).

Running from the downtown toward the northwest (NNW), it was built through a natural corridor, which meant that no residents or housing were directly affected. A planned section from what is now its southern terminus to I-95 was abandoned. Its route through parkland received criticism.\n\nPlanning for the Baltimore Beltway antedates the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The first portion completed was a small strip connecting the two sections of I-83, the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway and the Jones Falls Expressway.\n\nThe only [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]] in the city are US 1, which bypasses downtown, and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US 40]], which crosses downtown from east to west. Both run along major surface streets; however, US 40 utilizes a small section of a freeway cancelled in the 1970s in the west side of the city originally intended for [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|Interstate 170]]. State routes in the city also travel along surface streets, with the exception of [[Maryland Route 295]], which carries the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway.\n\nThe Baltimore City Department of Transportation (BCDOT) is responsible for several functions of the road transportation system in Baltimore, including repairing roads, sidewalks, and alleys; road signs; street lights; and managing the flow of transportation systems.<ref name=bcdot>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation.aspx| title=Home| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref> In addition, the agency is in charge of vehicle towing and [[traffic camera]]s.<ref name=bcdot2>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/VehicleTowing.aspx| title=Vehicle Towing| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation| access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref><ref name=bcdot3>{{cite web| url=http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| title=Traffic Cameras| publisher=Baltimore City Department of Transportation|access-date=January 21, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110127061625/http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/TrafficCameras.aspx| archive-date= January 27, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> BCDOT maintains all streets within the city of Baltimore.

There are also many pedestrian hiking trails traversing the park. The [[Jones Falls Trail]] currently runs from the Inner Harbor to the Cylburn Arboretum; however, it is currently undergoing expansion. Long-term plans call for it to extend to the [[Mount Washington (Baltimore Light Rail station)|Mount Washington Light Rail Stop]], and possibly as far north as the Falls Road stop to connect to the Robert E. Lee boardwalk north of the city. It will also incorporate a spur alongside Western Run. The two aforementioned trails carry sections of the [[East Coast Greenway]] through the city. There is also the Herring Run Trail, which runs from [[Maryland Route 147|Harford Road]] east to its end beyond Sinclair Lane, utilizing Herring Run Park; long-term plans also call for its extension to Morgan State University and north to points beyond. Other major bicycle projects include a protected cycle track installed on both Maryland Avenue and Mount Royal Avenue, expected to become the backbone of a downtown bicycle network. Installation for the cycletracks is expected in 2014 and 2016, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the bicycle trails and cycletracks, Baltimore has the Stony Run Trail, a walking path that will eventually connect from the Jones Falls north to Northern Parkway, utilizing much of the old Ma and Pa Railroad corridor inside the city. In 2011, the city undertook a campaign to reconstruct many sidewalk ramps in the city, coinciding with mass resurfacing of the city's streets.

In 1745 the Company departed for the new territories, newly acquired from the French, in Canada and commenced garrison duties. From 1751 to 1758, the Company was commanded by Captain Charles Brome.\n\n===Seven Years' War===\nIt was in 1758 that the second [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Battle of Louisbourg]] took place, and the Company, commanded by Captain T Ord from 23 May 1758, played a pivotal role in securing the town. The [[honour title]] \"Louisburg\" commemorates the first stage of the campaign in Canada against the French in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Siege of Louisbourg]]; it was first launched from [[City of Halifax|Halifax (Nova Scotia)]]. The Company's contribution to the siege was an integral part of the sea-borne assault to capture the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] which would allow the [[Royal Navy]] to sail down the [[St. Lawrence River]] for an attack on [[Quebec]] unmolested. The ground around Louisburg did not lend itself well to artillery, being composed mainly of swamp and marsh.\n\nIn honour of the Company Commander during the battle, Captain T Ord, the Battery HQ Troop is called \"Ord\u2019s\" Troop.  \"A\" Troop is named after Captain J Anderson who commanded the Company in 1858 during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and \"B\" Troop after Captain N S K Bayliss who was Company Commander in 1855 during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]]. The Company served in Canada until 1766 and then spent the rest of the eighteenth century in various theatres of the [[British Empire]] including the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\nThe Company bombarded the French invasion fleet in Dieppe in 1801 and taking part in the [[Siege of Copenhagen]] in 1807.  The Company then spent a long deployment in Ireland from 1811 until 1849 when it took up coastal defence duties. At that time, all Batteries in the Royal Artillery were called \"companies\" and named after their Company Commander. In 1859, batteries were formed and the practice of naming the sub-units after their Commanders ceased and all new batteries were given either a letter or number. 53 (Louisburg) Battery is the second senior numbered Battery in the Royal Regiment of Artillery with 19/5 Gibraltar Battery being the senior. In recognition of the tremendous achievement of the Company during the Siege of Louisburg it was awarded the honour title 'Louisburg' on 3 May 1937. For the remainder of the nineteenth century the Battery, served around the British Empire in [[Aden]], India, [[Burma]] and Britain.  Notable achievements during this time included the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and [[Afghanistan]]. In the Crimea, the Company took part in the Siege of Sebastopol, and the relief of Kandahar Garrison, Afghanistan in 1880.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nBy the early 1900s, the battery returned to Britain and became part of the coastal defence forces until 1926.  The battery then re-roled as a 'Heavy Gun' Battery until 1947. In 1947, the battery was reformed and armed with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L60 Mk 3]]. It became part of 22nd [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Light Anti Aircraft]] Regiment Royal Artillery based in Germany. It was later reequipped with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L70]] and [[List of radars|FCE (Fire Control Equipment) No 7 Radars]]. During the period of the Emergency in Eastern Pacific, the Battery deployed to [[Changi]], Singapore in 1964. The Battery then undertook a further tour to ensure stability in the region in 1966 to [[Tampin]] and [[Kuching]], [[Borneo]]. In 1969, the Battery title finally becomes recognisable as 53 (Louisburg) Light [[Air Defence]] Battery Royal Artillery.\n\nThe outbreak of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland led to the Battery deploying in an infantry role in 1972 to [[Derry]]. It then undertook further tours to Northern Ireland in the following years: 1973, 1974, 1978, 1987, 1993, 1997, and 1999. The Battery also re-roled several times over this period with equipment changing from Bofors to the introduction of [[Rapier missile|Rapier]], Tracked Rapier, and finally Towed Rapier FSB2 (Field Standard B2). Elements from the Battery deployed in 1990 in support of the first Gulf War and the 1990s the Battery also deployed twice to Cyprus.\n\n22nd AD Regiment Royal Artillery was placed in suspended animation in April 2004 and the battery was assigned to 5th Regiment Royal Artillery in Marne Barracks, Catterick on 21 July 2004.

In 1745 the Company departed for the new territories, newly acquired from the French, in Canada and commenced garrison duties. From 1751 to 1758, the Company was commanded by Captain Charles Brome.\n\n===Seven Years' War===\nIt was in 1758 that the second [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Battle of Louisbourg]] took place, and the Company, commanded by Captain T Ord from 23 May 1758, played a pivotal role in securing the town. The [[honour title]] \"Louisburg\" commemorates the first stage of the campaign in Canada against the French in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Siege of Louisbourg]]; it was first launched from [[City of Halifax|Halifax (Nova Scotia)]]. The Company's contribution to the siege was an integral part of the sea-borne assault to capture the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] which would allow the [[Royal Navy]] to sail down the [[St. Lawrence River]] for an attack on [[Quebec]] unmolested. The ground around Louisburg did not lend itself well to artillery, being composed mainly of swamp and marsh.\n\nIn honour of the Company Commander during the battle, Captain T Ord, the Battery HQ Troop is called \"Ord\u2019s\" Troop.  \"A\" Troop is named after Captain J Anderson who commanded the Company in 1858 during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and \"B\" Troop after Captain N S K Bayliss who was Company Commander in 1855 during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]]. The Company served in Canada until 1766 and then spent the rest of the eighteenth century in various theatres of the [[British Empire]] including the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\nThe Company bombarded the French invasion fleet in Dieppe in 1801 and taking part in the [[Siege of Copenhagen]] in 1807.  The Company then spent a long deployment in Ireland from 1811 until 1849 when it took up coastal defence duties. At that time, all Batteries in the Royal Artillery were called \"companies\" and named after their Company Commander. In 1859, batteries were formed and the practice of naming the sub-units after their Commanders ceased and all new batteries were given either a letter or number. 53 (Louisburg) Battery is the second senior numbered Battery in the Royal Regiment of Artillery with 19/5 Gibraltar Battery being the senior. In recognition of the tremendous achievement of the Company during the Siege of Louisburg it was awarded the honour title 'Louisburg' on 3 May 1937. For the remainder of the nineteenth century the Battery, served around the British Empire in [[Aden]], India, [[Burma]] and Britain.  Notable achievements during this time included the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and [[Afghanistan]]. In the Crimea, the Company took part in the Siege of Sebastopol, and the relief of Kandahar Garrison, Afghanistan in 1880.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nBy the early 1900s, the battery returned to Britain and became part of the coastal defence forces until 1926.  The battery then re-roled as a 'Heavy Gun' Battery until 1947. In 1947, the battery was reformed and armed with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L60 Mk 3]]. It became part of 22nd [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Light Anti Aircraft]] Regiment Royal Artillery based in Germany. It was later reequipped with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L70]] and [[List of radars|FCE (Fire Control Equipment) No 7 Radars]]. During the period of the Emergency in Eastern Pacific, the Battery deployed to [[Changi]], Singapore in 1964. The Battery then undertook a further tour to ensure stability in the region in 1966 to [[Tampin]] and [[Kuching]], [[Borneo]]. In 1969, the Battery title finally becomes recognisable as 53 (Louisburg) Light [[Air Defence]] Battery Royal Artillery.\n\nThe outbreak of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland led to the Battery deploying in an infantry role in 1972 to [[Derry]]. It then undertook further tours to Northern Ireland in the following years: 1973, 1974, 1978, 1987, 1993, 1997, and 1999. The Battery also re-roled several times over this period with equipment changing from Bofors to the introduction of [[Rapier missile|Rapier]], Tracked Rapier, and finally Towed Rapier FSB2 (Field Standard B2). Elements from the Battery deployed in 1990 in support of the first Gulf War and the 1990s the Battery also deployed twice to Cyprus.\n\n22nd AD Regiment Royal Artillery was placed in suspended animation in April 2004 and the battery was assigned to 5th Regiment Royal Artillery in Marne Barracks, Catterick on 21 July 2004.

An example of didactism in music is the chant ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', which was used by [[Guido of Arezzo]] to teach [[Solf\u00e8ge|solfege]] syllables.\n\nAround the 19th century the term ''didactic'' came to also be used as a criticism for work that appears to be overburdened with instructive, factual, or otherwise educational information, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the reader (a meaning that was quite foreign to Greek thought).
