From 1970 to 1977, it was known as ''Kommunistiska F\u00f6rbundet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KFML(r) (The Communist League Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries) and from 1977 to 2004 it was named ''Kommunistiska Partiet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KPML(r) (The Communist Party Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries). At the 14th Party Congress held in [[Gothenburg]] in January 2005, it was decided to change the name to ''Kommunistiska Partiet'' (K).\n\nKFML(r) was founded in 1970 by a splinter group from the pro-[[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Communist Party of Sweden (1967)|KFML]], which in turn had split from the [[Eurocommunist]] [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] in 1967. \"The (r)s\" (''\"(r)-arna\"'') considered that KFML had approached reformism and was not a genuine workers' movement. In 1970, it began publishing the weekly ''[[Prolet\u00e4ren]]'' (''The Proletarian''). During the 1980s, KPML(r) achieved representation in some municipalities, including Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city. The Gothenburg region has always been the strongest area for the party, partly because the party was started there. During the period of 1970 to 1999, the party chairman was [[Frank Baude]]. Baude was succeeded by [[Anders Carlsson (politician)|Anders Carlsson]], who held the post as chairman between 1999 and 2014.

({{lang-sv|Kommunistiska Partiet}}) is a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[political party]] in [[Sweden]] started in 1970. From 1970 to 1977, it was known as ''Kommunistiska F\u00f6rbundet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KFML(r) (The Communist League Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries) and from 1977 to 2004 it was named ''Kommunistiska Partiet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolution\u00e4rerna)'', abbreviated KPML(r) (The Communist Party Marxist\u2013Leninists (the revolutionaries). At the 14th Party Congress held in [[Gothenburg]] in January 2005, it was decided to change the name to ''Kommunistiska Partiet'' (K).\n\nKFML(r) was founded in 1970 by a splinter group from the pro-[[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Communist Party of Sweden (1967)|KFML]], which in turn had split from the [[Eurocommunist]] [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] in 1967. \"The (r)s\" (''\"(r)-arna\"'') considered that KFML had approached reformism and was not a genuine workers' movement. In 1970, it began publishing the weekly ''[[Prolet\u00e4ren]]'' (''The Proletarian''). During the 1980s, KPML(r) achieved representation in some municipalities, including Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city. The Gothenburg region has always been the strongest area for the party, partly because the party was started there. During the period of 1970 to 1999, the party chairman was [[Frank Baude]]. Baude was succeeded by [[Anders Carlsson (politician)|Anders Carlsson]], who held the post as chairman between 1999 and 2014. Ulf Nilsson is the current party chairman as of September 2018, succeeding [[Robert Mathiasson (politician)|Robert Mathiasson]].<ref>[http://www.proletaren.se/inrikes-kommunisterna-i-politiken/vi-star-starka-infor-framtiden Prolet\u00e4ren 2014-01-09 \u201dVi st\u00e5r starka inf\u00f6r framtiden\u201d Robert Mathiasson nyvald partiordf\u00f6rande (in Swedish only)]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aktuelltfokus.se/ulf-nilsson-ny-partiordforande-for-k/|title=Ulf Nilsson ny partiordf\u00f6rande f\u00f6r K|last=Fokus|first=Aktuellt|website=Aktuellt FokusE|language=sv-SE|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\nIts members and sympathisers includes, or included, several Swedish celebrities such as actors [[Sven Wollter]], [[Lasse Brandeby]] and [[Kent Andersson (playwright)|Kent Andersson]] and musicians [[Ken (artist)|Ken]], [[Totta N\u00e4slund]] and [[Fred \u00c5kerstr\u00f6m]], all of whom have participated in events and gatherings arranged by the party.\n\n==Youth organisations==\nIn the early days of the party, the pro-KFML(r) fractions of the [[United FNL Groups]] (DFFG) and of the [[Swedish Clart\u00e9 League]] broke away and set up the [[Solidarity Front for the People of Indochina]] and [[Clart\u00e9 (m-l)]] respectively. In 1972, these two structures were dissolved and merged into the [[Young Communist League of Sweden (Marxist-Leninists)]] (''Sveriges Kommunistiska Ungdomsf\u00f6rbund (marxist-leninisterna)'', SKU (ml)), the new KFML(r) youth wing. Later a new students organisation, [[SKS(ml)|SKS (ml)]], was formed. Both SKU (ml) and SKS (ml) were disbanded towards the end of the 1970s as the party itself consisted mainly of young people.\n\nIn 1994, the party again launched a youth organization, [[Revolutionary Communist Youth (Sweden)|Revolutionary Communist Youth]] (RKU).\n\n==International relations==\nThe party upholds close relations with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]], the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the [[Polisario Front]] and others.\n\nDuring the [[North Korean famine]], the party participated in charity fundraising for the delivery of humanitarian aid to [[North Korea]]. As a result, the party developed a degree of collaboration with the [[Workers' Party of Korea]],<ref>[http://proletaren.se/sites/default/bilder-filer/proletaren-25ars-jubileum.pdf \u201dProlet\u00e4ren 1995, Jubileumsnumret\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208054422/http://proletaren.se/sites/default/bilder-filer/proletaren-25ars-jubileum.pdf |date=2011-12-08 }}. p. 24.</ref> although this cooperation did not persist to the present day.\n[[File:Swedish left groups.gif|thumb|223x223px|Factions within the Swedish left during the last century]]\n\n==Illegal surveillance by the Swedish Security Service==\n[[File:R\u00f6dastj\u00e4rnan.jpg|thumb|The party's book shop R\u00f6da Stj\u00e4rnan (Red Star) in the city of Karlshamn]]\nIn 1969, governmental registration of an individual's political affiliation was made illegal in Sweden. However, in 2003 it was revealed that the [[Swedish Security Service]] (S\u00e4po) already in 1970 had been secretly instructed by the Swedish government to continue surveillance of \"key individuals\" in some twenty organisations on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] of Swedish politics in spite of that ban. This surveillance continued until 1998.<ref>[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/asiktsregistrering-pagick-till-1998 Dagens Nyheter 2003-01-29: \u00c5siktsregistrering p\u00e5gick till 1998 (in Swedish only)] Retrieved 2012-04-11</ref> KFML(r)/KPML(r) and its associated organisations were among those put under such surveillance.

It does not participate in the national elections due to financial and tactical reasons whereas it advocates boycott of the European parliament elections. However, it does participate in the municipal elections in some Swedish municipalities. In 2010, the party participated in the elections in 18 municipalities, which is the largest number of municipalities so far. Its electoral results have fluctuated over time, with high results in various cities during the late 1990s (second-largest party in [[Karlshamn Municipality|Karlshamn]], for example). In the three most recent elections, the party has lost ground electorally.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <u>Municipality</u>\n! <u>Votes 2014</u><ref>[http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/K/rike/index.html Valmyndigheten: Val till kommunfullm\u00e4ktige 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924084004/http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/K/rike/index.html |date=2014-09-24 }} Retrieved 2017-04-27</ref>\n!

Clancy decides to interview the sim Glasses Man, who he discovers is, in fact, the President in this universe. In front of the White House, a group of anti-marijuana protesters are gathered, seemingly unbothered by the zombies around them. This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find the new situation relieving. This does not last long as they are hit with a cure that, ironically, causes those still left as zombies to devour them.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|publisher=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nFor Ward, the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion.

Ultimately, despite his attempts to get Aruto fired following the Daybreak Town raid, Fukuzoe acknowledges Aruto as a good boss and resigns himself to remain Hiden Intelligence's vice-president out of respect for the Hiden family after the company was absorbed into ZAIA Enterprise. \n\nJun Fukuzoe is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Kazuya Kojima]]|\u5150\u5d8b \u4e00\u54c9|Kojima Kazuya}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Shesta===\n{{nihongo|Shesta|\u30b7\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf|Shesuta}} is a HumaGear secretary programmed to be loyal to Hiden Intelligence's Vice President.

Despite having little interaction with Aruto and helping Jun scheme against him, Yamashita came to respect the young CEO for willing to risk his own life for humans, HumaGears, and the company. This spurred Yamashita to oppose Fukuzoe's attempt to vote Aruto out of the company by voting for the young CEO to retain his position.\n\nSanz\u014d Yamashita is portrayed by {{nihongo|Arata Saeki|\u4f50\u4f2f \u65b0|Saeki Arata}}.\n\n===Korenosuke Hiden===\n{{nihongo|Korenosuke Hiden|\u98db\u96fb \u662f\u4e4b\u52a9|Hiden Korenosuke}} was Aruto's grandfather and the original CEO of Hiden Intelligence who died at the beginning of the series. Prior to his death, he had spent his final years developing the Zero-One project as he feared someone would weaponize the HumaGears following the Daybreak Incident and named Aruto as his successor. Korenosuke also arranged for the HumaGears and everything related to Zero-One to be patented as Aruto's intellectual property in the event of Hiden Intelligence's downfall, which occurred following ZAIA Enterprise's hostile takeover. \n\nKoronosuke Hiden is portrayed by {{nihongo|Tokuma Nishioka|\u897f\u5ca1 \u5fb7\u99ac|Nishioka Tokuma}}.\n\n==A.I.M.S.==\nThe {{nihongo|Artificial Intelligence Military Service|\u5bfe\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u7279\u52d9\u6a5f\u95a2|Tai-Jink\u014dchin\u014d Tokumu Kikan}}, or {{nihongo|A.I.M.S.|\u30a8\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba|Eimuzu}}, is a government established organization dedicated to destroying rogue HumaGears, or Magias, hacked by MetsubouJinrai.net as HumaGear-related crimes fall within their jurisdiction. As the group is funded by ZAIA Enterprise, they became Gai's enforcers following his company's hostile takeover of Hiden Intelligence.\n\nThe designated Kamen Riders of A.I.M.S. are outfitted with AI chips to utilize the {{nihongo|A.I.M.S.

Isamu initially hated HumaGears due to being the sole survivor of a Magia attack that claimed the lives of his classmates during the Daybreak Incident. He also blamed Hiden Intelligence for the incident until Aruto exposed MetsubouJinrai.net's existence during a press conference, which lead to him gradually accepting Aruto as an ally and discarding his hated for HumaGears. Isamu sided with Aruto after learning that Gai masterminded the Daybreak Incident, fighting the AI chip's hold over him and quitting A.I.M.S. to join Aruto as an supporter of Hiden Manufacturing.\n\nIsamu uses his A.I.M.S.

Shot Riser, the Attache Shotgun, the Attache Arrow, and handles Progrise Key authorization; being Isamu's commanding officer in the field despite her partner's rank. A meticulous and normally composed woman who bears no animosity to HumaGears, Yua saw them as disposable tools. She would later be revealed to be working for Gai and continued working for him after learning he masterminded the Daybreak Incident and MetsubouJinrai.net's actions. This lead to her and Isamu falling out before she willingly complied with Gai's plan to advance ZAIA Enterprise's reputation by becoming a Raider to demonstrate the Raid Riser's use in combating the Magias. Realizing how Isamu felt after Gai went too far with his actions, Yua forgave Isamu and defected from her former boss.\n\nYua uses her A.I.M.S.

Originally Korenosuke's business partner while building Daybreak Town, a conflict of interest ended their friendship as Gai believed HumaGears represent a dead end to human progress. Following their falling out, Gai orchestrated the Daybreak Incident to destroy Hiden Intelligence's public image. His animosity towards the Hiden family worsened when Korenosuke named Aruto his heir, so he supplyed his tech to A.I.M.S. and masterminded MetsubouJinrai.net's attacks to tarnish Hiden Intelligence's reputation further. \n\nOnce MetsubouJinrai.net was defeated, Gai finalized his own Rider system and challenged Aruto to a {{nihongo|Five-part Workplace Competition|\u304a\u4ed5\u4e8b5\u756a\u52dd\u8ca0|Oshigoto Go-ban Sh\u014dbu}} to acquire ownership of Hiden Intelligence and prove humans are more effective than HumaGears. Despite pretending to maintain an objective view unless his representatives' conduct negatively affected ZAIA Enterprise's image, Gai used the competition to promote the Raid Risers as an effective countermeasure to HumaGears and used the resulting attacks as an excuse to make himself look like a hero while he overpowered Zero-One. Upon winning the Workplace Competition and absorbing Hiden Intelligence, he issued an order calling for the immediate decommissioning of all HumaGears. To ensure full compliance, Gai granted A.I.M.S.'s troopers the ability to become Raiders so they could perform their job more effectively.\n\nGai transforms into {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Thouser|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30fc|Kamen Raid\u0101 Sauz\u0101}} by using the {{nihongo|ZAIA ThousanDriver|\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc|Zaia Sauzandoraib\u0101}} in conjunction with the {{nihongo|Amazing [[Atlas beetle|Caucasus]]|\u30a2\u30e1\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30b3\u30fc\u30ab\u30b5\u30b9|Ameijingu K\u014dkasasu}} Progrise Key and the {{nihongo|Awaking [[Arsinoitherium|Arsino]]|\u30a2\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30eb\u30b7\u30ce|Aweikingu Arushino}} Zetsumerise Key.\n\nGai is portrayed by {{nihongo|Nachi Sakuragi|\u685c\u6728 \u90a3\u667a|Sakuragi Nachi}}\n\n==MetsubouJinrai.net==\n{{nihongo|MetsubouJinrai.net|\u6ec5\u4ea1\u8fc5\u96f7.net|Metsub\u014djinrai Netto|DestructiveThunder.net}} is a cyber-terrorist organization based in the condemned {{nihongo|Daybreak Town|\u30c7\u30a4\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3|Deibureiku Taun}}.

On the day of its launch, Gai uploaded the Ark with data on human malice, causing the satellite to create the first Magias from some of the HumaGears connected its systems at the time while attempting to launch itself. However, Soreo resisted the Ark's influence and implemented the satellite's self-destruct to prevent it from connecting to every HumaGear around the Earth, causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea while Hiden Intelligence replaced it with the Zea Satellite. In the present, Gai manipulated MetsubouJinrai.net into reactivating the Ark, causing the satellite to create its own Progrise Keys and remotely transform abused HumaGears into Ark Magias. While Gai assumes the satellite is under his control, he is unaware that the Ark is exploiting any opportunity it can get to kill him.\n\nIn ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Will used the Another Rider powers that Finis gave him to successfully enable the Ark's launch, creating an alternate timeline where it took over the Earth and successfully brought humanity to the brink of extinction.\n\n==Magias==\n{{nihongo|Magias|\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Magia}} are corrupted HumaGears that came into being during the Daybreak Incident twelve years prior to the series from the pieces of their prototypical counterparts.

After MetsubouJinrai.net's cyber-terrorism became known, Hiden Intelligence began to use anti-viruses when they manufacture new HumaGears. After defeating MetsubouJinrai.net, Hiden Intelligence faced their corporate rival, ZAIA Enterprise, in a Workplace Competition; only to get bought out in the end.\n*{{nihongo|Hiden Manufacturing Co., Ltd.|\u98db\u96fb\u88fd\u4f5c\u6240|Hiden Seisakujo}}: After Hiden Intelligence was bought out by ZAIA Enterprise, Hiden Manufacturing was created to maintain the Hiden legacy, continue creating HumaGears, and fight back against ZAIA Enterprise.

As a result, Aruto finds himself contending with the rogue HumaGears of MetsubouJinrai.net, who were manipulated by Gai Amatsu, all of whom push him to his limits. Despite the latter taking control of Hiden Intelligence, Aruto joined forces with former enemies to establish Hiden Manufacturing and protect the HumaGears from Gai.\n\nAruto becomes Zero-One by using the {{nihongo|Hiden Zero-One Driver|\u98db\u96fb\u30bc\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc|Hiden Zero Wan Doraib\u0101}}, the company's Rider system which only responds to the current CEO of Hiden Intelligence or anyone of the Hiden lineage, with the {{nihongo|Rising [[Grasshopper|Hopper]]|\u30e9\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc|Raijingu Hopp\u0101}} Progrise Key.

Because of her knowledge of the Zero-One project, Is is one of the few HumaGears not to have a back-up for her A.I. This would become crucial as Is gradually achieved technological singularity from her bond with Aruto; nearly sacrificing herself to perfect the Shining Hopper Progrise Key before her \"older brother\" Was took in her place. Following Aruto's loss against Gai in the Workplace Competition, Is was temporarily deactivated before Jin rescued her and reunited her with Aruto to be reactivated and restore his access to the Zero-One powers before helping him establish Hiden Manufacturing. \n\nIs is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Noa Tsurushima]]|\u9db4\u5d8b \u4e43\u611b|Tsurushima Noa}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Jun Fukuzoe===\n{{nihongo|Jun Fukuzoe|\u798f\u6dfb \u51c6|Fukuzoe Jun}} is the Vice President of Hiden Intelligence who had coveted the CEO position after Korenosuke's death, expressing his reluctance in response to Aruto gaining the position by accusing Korenosuke of [[nepotism]] despite the late CEO's justification in relation to the threat of MetsubouJinrai.net. Despite subverting Aruto, Fukuzoe places the company's image and success before his own feelings, which were later revealed to have been based on numerous HumaGear incident cover-ups to protect the company. Ultimately, despite his attempts to get Aruto fired following the Daybreak Town raid, Fukuzoe acknowledges Aruto as a good boss and resigns himself to remain Hiden Intelligence's vice-president out of respect for the Hiden family after the company was absorbed into ZAIA Enterprise. \n\nJun Fukuzoe is portrayed by {{nihongo|[[Kazuya Kojima]]|\u5150\u5d8b \u4e00\u54c9|Kojima Kazuya}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Shesta===\n{{nihongo|Shesta|\u30b7\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf|Shesuta}} is a HumaGear secretary programmed to be loyal to Hiden Intelligence's Vice President.

Despite having little interaction with Aruto and helping Jun scheme against him, Yamashita came to respect the young CEO for willing to risk his own life for humans, HumaGears, and the company. This spurred Yamashita to oppose Fukuzoe's attempt to vote Aruto out of the company by voting for the young CEO to retain his position.\n\nSanz\u014d Yamashita is portrayed by {{nihongo|Arata Saeki|\u4f50\u4f2f \u65b0|Saeki Arata}}.\n\n===Korenosuke Hiden===\n{{nihongo|Korenosuke Hiden|\u98db\u96fb \u662f\u4e4b\u52a9|Hiden Korenosuke}} was Aruto's grandfather and the original CEO of Hiden Intelligence who died at the beginning of the series. Prior to his death, he had spent his final years developing the Zero-One project as he feared someone would weaponize the HumaGears following the Daybreak Incident and named Aruto as his successor. Korenosuke also arranged for the HumaGears and everything related to Zero-One to be patented as Aruto's intellectual property in the event of Hiden Intelligence's downfall, which occurred following ZAIA Enterprise's hostile takeover. \n\nKoronosuke Hiden is portrayed by {{nihongo|Tokuma Nishioka|\u897f\u5ca1 \u5fb7\u99ac|Nishioka Tokuma}}.\n\n==A.I.M.S.==\nThe {{nihongo|Artificial Intelligence Military Service|\u5bfe\u4eba\u5de5\u77e5\u80fd\u7279\u52d9\u6a5f\u95a2|Tai-Jink\u014dchin\u014d Tokumu Kikan}}, or {{nihongo|A.I.M.S.|\u30a8\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba|Eimuzu}}, is a government established organization dedicated to destroying rogue HumaGears, or Magias, hacked by MetsubouJinrai.net as HumaGear-related crimes fall within their jurisdiction. As the group is funded by ZAIA Enterprise, they became Gai's enforcers following his company's hostile takeover of Hiden Intelligence.\n\nThe designated Kamen Riders of A.I.M.S. are outfitted with AI chips to utilize the {{nihongo|A.I.M.S.

As a side effect, said chip makes them more susceptible to Gai's control. As opposed to Zero-One, the A.I.M.S. Riders' primary Attache Weapon is the {{nihongo|Attache Shotgun|\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3|Atasshu Shottogan}}, which can switch from its Attache Mode to the rifle-like {{nihongo|Shotgun Mode|\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9|Shottogan M\u014ddo}} in order to perform one of two finishers: {{nihongo|Kaban Shot|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8|Kaban Shotto|Bag Shot}} or {{nihongo|Kaban Buster|\u30ab\u30d0\u30f3\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Kaban Basut\u0101|Bag Buster}}. Due to the weapon's massive recoil, the A.I.M.S. Riders have to either undergo intense training with it or equip armor strong enough to withstand it.\n\nAfter taking control of A.I.M.S., ZAIA granted its low-ranking troopers Raid Risers and mass-produced {{nihongo|Invading [[Horseshoe Crab]]|\u30a4\u30f3\u30d9\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30db\u30fc\u30b9\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30d6|Inbeidingu H\u014dsush\u016b Kurabu}} Progrise Keys so they can transform into {{nihongo|Battle Raiders|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Batoru Reid\u0101}} in order to combat Magias and HumaGears more effectively.\n\n===Isamu Fuwa===\n{{nihongo|Isamu Fuwa|\u4e0d\u7834 \u8aeb|Fuwa Isamu}} is A.I.M.S.' 27-year-old captain who tends to be reckless during his missions. Isamu initially hated HumaGears due to being the sole survivor of a Magia attack that claimed the lives of his classmates during the Daybreak Incident. He also blamed Hiden Intelligence for the incident until Aruto exposed MetsubouJinrai.net's existence during a press conference, which lead to him gradually accepting Aruto as an ally and discarding his hated for HumaGears. Isamu sided with Aruto after learning that Gai masterminded the Daybreak Incident, fighting the AI chip's hold over him and quitting A.I.M.S. to join Aruto as an supporter of Hiden Manufacturing.\n\nIsamu uses his A.I.M.S. Shot Riser with the {{nihongo|Shooting [[Wolf]]|\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5|Sh\u016btingu Urufu}} Progrise Key to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Vulcan|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Kamen Raid\u0101 Barukan}}, whose blue-colored default armor grants enhanced shooting accuracy. He can also use other Progrise Keys to change into different armors. He would later achieve upgraded forms in {{nihongo|Assault Wolf|\u30a2\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5|Asaruto Urufu}} and {{nihongo|Rampage Vulcan|\u30e9\u30f3\u30da\u30a4\u30b8\u30d0\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Ranpeiji Barukan}}; both of which were developed using other Progrise Keys' abilities.\n\nIsamu Fuwa is portrayed by {{nihongo|Ryutaro Okada|\u5ca1\u7530 \u9f8d\u592a\u90ce|Okada Ry\u016btar\u014d}}.<ref name=\"cast\"/> As a teenager, Isamu is portrayed by {{nihongo|Soshi Hagiwara|\u8429\u539f \u58ee\u5fd7|Hagiwara S\u014dshi}}.\n\n===Yua Yaiba===\n{{nihongo|Yua Yaiba|\u5203 \u552f\u963f|Yaiba Yua}} is A.I.M.S.' 24-year-old tech advisor and maintenance expert who developed the A.I.M.S. Shot Riser, the Attache Shotgun, the Attache Arrow, and handles Progrise Key authorization; being Isamu's commanding officer in the field despite her partner's rank. A meticulous and normally composed woman who bears no animosity to HumaGears, Yua saw them as disposable tools. She would later be revealed to be working for Gai and continued working for him after learning he masterminded the Daybreak Incident and MetsubouJinrai.net's actions. This lead to her and Isamu falling out before she willingly complied with Gai's plan to advance ZAIA Enterprise's reputation by becoming a Raider to demonstrate the Raid Riser's use in combating the Magias. Realizing how Isamu felt after Gai went too far with his actions, Yua forgave Isamu and defected from her former boss.\n\nYua uses her A.I.M.S. Shot Riser with the {{nihongo|Rushing [[Cheetah]]|\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30c1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|Rasshingu Ch\u012bt\u0101}} Progrise Key to become {{nihongo|Kamen Rider Valkyrie|\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u30ad\u30ea\u30fc|Kamen Raid\u0101 Barukir\u012b}}, whose orange-colored default armor grants enhanced speed.

Originally Korenosuke's business partner while building Daybreak Town, a conflict of interest ended their friendship as Gai believed HumaGears represent a dead end to human progress. Following their falling out, Gai orchestrated the Daybreak Incident to destroy Hiden Intelligence's public image. His animosity towards the Hiden family worsened when Korenosuke named Aruto his heir, so he supplyed his tech to A.I.M.S. and masterminded MetsubouJinrai.net's attacks to tarnish Hiden Intelligence's reputation further. \n\nOnce MetsubouJinrai.net was defeated, Gai finalized his own Rider system and challenged Aruto to a {{nihongo|Five-part Workplace Competition|\u304a\u4ed5\u4e8b5\u756a\u52dd\u8ca0|Oshigoto Go-ban Sh\u014dbu}} to acquire ownership of Hiden Intelligence and prove humans are more effective than HumaGears. Despite pretending to maintain an objective view unless his representatives' conduct negatively affected ZAIA Enterprise's image, Gai used the competition to promote the Raid Risers as an effective countermeasure to HumaGears and used the resulting attacks as an excuse to make himself look like a hero while he overpowered Zero-One.

Able to manipulate Isamu through his AI chip, Naki played a part in Gai's scheme to promote the Raid Risers. After hearing Aruto and Jin's words of being more than a tool, Naki forced Isamu to join Gai before eventually betraying him. Naki is portrayed by {{nihongo4|Satsuki Nakayama|\u4e2d\u5c71 \u54b2\u6708|Nakayama Satsuki}}.\n\n===Ark===\nThe {{nihongo|Ark|\u30a2\u30fc\u30af|\u0100ku}} is an AI-powered satellite, constructed twelve years before the events of series as a joint collaboration between Hiden Intelligence, ZAIA Enterprise, and other electronics companies, to serve as the central hub for HumaGears and the Progrise systems. On the day of its launch, Gai uploaded the Ark with data on human malice, causing the satellite to create the first Magias from some of the HumaGears connected its systems at the time while attempting to launch itself. However, Soreo resisted the Ark's influence and implemented the satellite's self-destruct to prevent it from connecting to every HumaGear around the Earth, causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea while Hiden Intelligence replaced it with the Zea Satellite. In the present, Gai manipulated MetsubouJinrai.net into reactivating the Ark, causing the satellite to create its own Progrise Keys and remotely transform abused HumaGears into Ark Magias. While Gai assumes the satellite is under his control, he is unaware that the Ark is exploiting any opportunity it can get to kill him.\n\nIn ''Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation'', Will used the Another Rider powers that Finis gave him to successfully enable the Ark's launch, creating an alternate timeline where it took over the Earth and successfully brought humanity to the brink of extinction.\n\n==Magias==\n{{nihongo|Magias|\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Magia}} are corrupted HumaGears that came into being during the Daybreak Incident twelve years prior to the series from the pieces of their prototypical counterparts. Initially, MetsubouJinrai.net created Magias by hacking HumaGears that achieved [[technological singularity]] with a {{nihongo|Zetsumeriser|\u30bc\u30c4\u30e1\u30e9\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Zetsumeraiz\u0101|Extermination Riser}} buckle.

Before Aruto developed the Progrise Hopper Blade to restore them, Magias had to be destroyed while the HumaGear's A.I. was backed-up into a new model along with an antivirus to prevent them from being corrupted again. Upon a Magia's destruction, Jin salvaged their Zetsumerise Keys for the Ark's restoration. Following the Ark's restoration, HumaGears that experienced human malice allowed the satellite to target them and instantly convert them into {{nihongo|Ark Magias|\u30a2\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|\u0100ku Magia}}.\n\n*{{nihongo|Trilobite Magias|\u30c8\u30ea\u30ed\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Torirobaito Magia}}: [[Trilobite]]-based foot soldier Magias that are created from HumaGears hacked by Zetsumeriser-equipped Magias.\n*{{nihongo|Berotha Magia|\u30d9\u30ed\u30fc\u30b5\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Ber\u014dsa Magia}}: A Magia based on a ''Kujiberotha teruyukii'' (a [[mantis|praying mantis]]) armed with a pair of arm-mounted {{nihongo|Togamurder|\u30c8\u30ac\u30de\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Togam\u0101d\u0101}} blades.\n*{{nihongo|Kuehne Magia|\u30af\u30a8\u30cd\u30aa\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Kueneo Magia}}: A Magia based on a ''[[Kuehneosuchus]]'' (a [[Draco (genus)|gliding lizard]]) armed with a pair of bladed {{nihongo|Boomezan|\u30d6\u30fc\u30e1\u30b6\u30f3|B\u016bmezan}} boomerangs.\n*{{nihongo|Ekal Magia|\u30a8\u30ab\u30eb\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Ekaru Magia}}: A Magia based on an ''[[Ekaltadeta]]'' (a [[marsupial]]) possessing a pair of extendable {{nihongo|Carnivoreba|\u30ab\u30fc\u30cb\u30dc\u30fc\u30d0|K\u0101nib\u014dba}} fangs.\n*{{nihongo|Neohi Magia|\u30cd\u30aa\u30d2\u30de\u30ae\u30a2}}: A Magia based on a ''[[Neohibolites]]'' (a [[cephalopod]] of the [[Belemnitida]] order) possessing the extending, blade-tipped {{nihongo|Maratacle|\u30de\u30fc\u30e9\u30bf\u30af\u30eb|M\u0101ratakuru}} tentacles, which can regenerate if severed, and produce a blinding ink cloud.\n*{{nihongo|Onycho Magia|\u30aa\u30cb\u30b3\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Oniko Magia}}: A Magia based on an ''[[Onychonycteris]]'' (a [[bat]]) possessing the {{nihongo|Zytalon|\u30b6\u30a4\u30bf\u30ed\u30f3|Zaitaron}} claws and a pair of wings for flight.\n*{{nihongo|Vicarya Magia|\u30d3\u30ab\u30ea\u30a2\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Bikaria Magia}}: A Magia based on a ''Vicarya'' (a [[sea snail]]) armed with the {{nihongo|Drisnailer|\u30c9\u30ea\u30b9\u30cd\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc|Dorisuneir\u0101}} drills on his head and arms.\n*{{nihongo|Gaeru Magia|\u30ac\u30a8\u30eb\u30de\u30ae\u30a2}}: A Magia based on a ''[[Gastric-brooding_frog#Southern gastric-brooding frog (R. silus)|Rheobatrachus silus]]'' (a [[frog]]) able to launch the {{nihongo|Kogaeru Bomber|\u30b3\u30ac\u30a8\u30eb\u30dc\u30de\u30fc|Kogaeru Bom\u0101}} bombs from his/her mouth.\n*{{nihongo|Mammoth Magia|\u30de\u30f3\u30e2\u30b9\u30de\u30ae\u30a2|Manmosu Magia}}: A Magia based on a [[woolly mammoth]] with incredible strength and endurance as well as the chest-mounted {{nihongo|Exhaler|\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d8\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc|Ekusuheir\u0101}} trunk that allows him to absorb projectile attacks and redirect them back at his enemies.\n*Dodo Magia: A Magia based on a Dodo.

Unlike ZAIA Enterprise's previous representatives, Ichimori was honest and by-the-book, even expressing disdain for the company despite representing them as he was aware of their underhanded methods. He was the only one who supported Bingo when the defendant was found guilty despite all evidence pointing to a third party being involved and was frustrated at himself for his role in condemning an innocent man. Unable to coerce Ichimori into playing dirty, Gai was forced to take matters into his own hands instead and \"manually\" turn his HumaGear opponent into a Magia himself while Masuji Narusawa stole Ichimori's ZAIA Specs in order to frame him as the Dynamiting Lion Raider.

Like most of ZAIA's previous representatives, Homura was disdainful of HumaGears. Unlike them, his hatred was not out of malice, but due to how the programming used in HumaGear firefighters causes them to only rescue those with higher chances of survival and literally abandon other victims in actual emergency situations. After 119nosuke learns to make his own decisions outside of his programming and sacrifices himself to save Fukuzoe, Yamashita, and Shesta, Homura expressed regret for his earlier attitude towards him and posthumously accepted him as a true firefighter.

After working hard to impress the chef with his own will, Uozumi finally accepted Nigiro, but the latter was transformed into a Trilobite Magia by the Neohi Magia and destroyed by Kamen Rider Valkyrie. Following this, Uozumi is shown re-teaching a new model of Nigiro built with its backed-up A.I. The new model later contributed his data to a blank Progrise Key to help Aruto and Is create the Progrise Hopper Blade.

As a prototype of Is designed by Korenosuke Hiden, he considers himself her \"older brother\" and his true loyalties lie with Aruto. Similarly to Aruto, he behaves like a goofball, but is very efficient at his job; not only being aware of Aruto's innocence but also of the fact that the Assassin HumaGears were kidnapped HumaGear dancers of the same model from a entirely different case he was investigating. Aware of Is' growing bond with Aruto and due to being programmed by Korenosuke to protect her, Was stopped her from sacrificing her systems to finalize Zero-One's Shining Hopper Progrise Key and took her place instead. Being one of the HumaGears with knowledge of the Zero-One project, he has no A.I. back-up as a safety precaution and shuts down permanently, leaving Is his pocket-watch as a keepsake.

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]].

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely considered a turning point in the development of aviation.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. \n\nIn March 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]], if the kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.

Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided he was ready to take to the air by himself.

In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to [[Iowa]], where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink's Curtiss JN-4C \"Canuck\" (the Canadian version of the Jenny).
