He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song.

Thus, before an accused is sentenced to ''Rajm'' in Shia system, the witnesses may be four men, three men and two women, two men and four women, one man and six women, but witnesses must include at least one man.<ref name=nisrine/>  Furthermore, Shia jurists grant discretionary powers to the judge in cases of homosexuality, to sentence the accused to death by sword, ''Rajm'' (death by stoning), death by throwing from a high wall, or burning the accused to death.<ref name=nisrine/>\n\n==Views==\nThere is disagreement among modern Islamic thinkers as to the applicability of stoning for adultery.  While religious texts often give examples both with and without stoning, the [[Quran]] does not prescribe stoning as a punishment for any crime, mentioning only lashing as punishment for adultery.
