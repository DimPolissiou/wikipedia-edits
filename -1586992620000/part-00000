With a combine harvester, the tiger nut is pulled out of the ground. Immediately after harvesting, the tiger nuts are washed with water in order to remove sand and small stones. The drying occurs usually in the sun and can take up to three months.<ref name=month>Tigernuts Traders, S.L., ''Tigernuts Oil'', 2012, http://www.tigernut.com</ref> The temperatures and humidity levels have to be monitored very carefully during this period. The tiger nuts have to be turned every day to ensure uniform drying. The drying process ensures a longer shelf life. This prevents rot or other bacterial infections, securing quality and high nutrition levels.\nDisadvantages in the drying process are shrinkage, skin wrinkles and hard nut texture.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n===Storage===\nTiger nut loses a considerable amount of water during drying and storage. The starch content of the tiger nut tubers decreases and the reducing sugar (invert sugar) content increases during storage.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Physical and chemical properties of chufa (Cyperus esculentus L) tubers grown in the \u00c7ukurova region of Turkey |doi=10.1002/jsfa.1091 | volume=82 |issue= 6|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |pages=625\u2013631|year= 2002|last1= Co\u015fkuner|first1= Yal\u00e7\u0131n|last2= Ercan|first2= Recai|last3= Karababa|first3= Er\u015fan|last4= Nazl\u0131can|first4= Ahmet Nedim}}</ref> Tiger nut can be stored dry and rehydrated by soaking without losing the crisp texture.

The nuts have to be prepared in a prescribed manner to prevent harm to the fish. The nuts are soaked in water for 24 hours, and then boiled for 20 minutes or longer until fully expanded. Some anglers then leave the boiled nuts to ferment for 24\u201348 hours, which can enhance their effectiveness. If the nuts are not properly prepared, they can be  toxic to carp. This was originally thought to have been the cause of death of [[Benson (fish)|Benson]], a large, well-known female carp weighing {{Convert|54|lb|kg|abbr=on}} found floating dead in a fishing lake, with a bag of unprepared tiger nuts lying nearby, empty, on the bank. An examination of the fish by a [[taxidermist]] concluded tiger nut poisoning was not the cause of death, but rather the fish had died naturally.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bailey |first=John |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125051804649836945 |title=The extraordinary life and suspicious death of Benson the giant carp |publisher=The Guardian |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Compatibility with other crops==\n[[File:Cyperus esculentus NRCS-1.jpg|thumb|160px|The seed head of a ''Cyperus esculentus'' plant]]\n''C. esculentus'' is extremely difficult to remove completely once established. This is due to the plant having a stratified and layered root system, with tubers and roots being interconnected to a depth of 36&nbsp;cm or more.<ref name=Factsheet/> The tubers are connected by fragile roots that are prone to snapping when pulled, making the root system difficult to remove intact. Intermediate rhizomes can potentially reach a length of 60&nbsp;cm. The plant can quickly regenerate if a single tuber is left in place. By competing for light, water and nutrients it can reduce the vigour of neighbouring plants. It can develop into a dense colony. Patch boundaries can increase by more than one meter per year. Tubers and seed disperse with agricultural activities, soil movement or by water and wind. They are often known as a contaminant in crop seeds. When plants are small they are hard to distinguish from other weeds such as ''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'' and ''[[Elytrigia repens]]''. Thus it is hard to discover in an early stage and therefore hard to counteract. Once it is detected, mechanical removal, hand removal, grazing, damping, and herbicides can be used to inhibit ''C. esculentus''.\n\n===Similar native or non-native species that can confuse identification===\n* [[Sedges]] (''Cyperus'') have grass-like leaves and resemble each other in the appearance. They can mainly be distinguished from grasses by their triangular stems.\n* Purple nutsedge (''[[Cyperus rotundus|C. rotundus]]'') is another weedy sedge that is similar to the yellow nutsedge (''C. esculentus''). These two sedges are difficult to distinguish from each other and can be found growing on the same site. Some differences are the purple spikelets and the tubers formed by ''C. rotundus'' are often multiple instead of just one at the tip. In addition the tubers have a bitter taste instead of the mild almond-like flavour of ''C. esculentus''.<ref name=Factsheet/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WestAfricanPlants|Cyperus esculentus}}\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1165724}}\n\n[[Category:Flora of North America]]\n[[Category:Flora of Europe]]\n[[Category:Flora of Asia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Africa]]\n[[Category:Flora of South America]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Cyperus|esculentus]]\n[[Category:Valencian Community]]\n[[Category:Root vegetables]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n|name = Chufa sedge\n|image = Cyperus esculentus L.

''C. esculentus'' is wind pollinated and requires [[cross pollination]] as it is self\u2013incompatible.\n\n==Invasiveness==\n''C. esculentus'' is a highly invasive species in [[Oceania]], [[Mexico]], some United States, and the [[Caribbean]], mainly by seed dispersion.<ref name=cabi/> It is readily transported internationally, and is adaptable to re-establish in varied climate and soil environments.<ref name=cabi/> In Japan, it is an exotic [[cloning|clonal]] weed favorable to establish in wet habitats.<ref name=cabi/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Proc\u00e9s de cultiu de la xufa.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Cultivation and growing of the ''xufa'' in the [[Land of Valencia]], file by [[Valencian Museum of Ethnology]]]]\n\n===Climate requirements===\n''Cyperus esculentus'' cultivation requires a mild climate. Low temperature, shade, and light intensity can inhibit flowering.<ref name=Factsheet/> Tuber initiation is inhibited by high levels of nitrogen, long photoperiods, and high levels of [[gibberellic acid]]. Flower initiation occurs under photoperiods of 12 to 14 hours per day.\n\n===Soil requirements===\nTubers can develop in soil depths  around 30&nbsp;cm (1-foot), but most occur in the top or upper part. They tolerate many adverse soil conditions including periods of drought and flooding and survive soil temperatures around {{convert|-5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. They grow best on sandy, moist soils at a pH between 5.0 \u2013 7.5.<ref name=Factsheet/> The densest populations of ''C. esculentus'' are often found in low-lying wetlands.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Merrill A.|last2=Lembi|first2=Carole A.|title=Applied Weed Science|publisher=Prentice Hall|edition=3|year=2008|page=322|isbn=978-0135028148}}</ref> They do not tolerate salinity.<ref name=Factsheet/>\n\n==Agronomy==\n\n===Cultivation===\nPlanting is normally done on flat soils where ridges to favour the coming irrigations have previously been done. The separation between ridges is approximately {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} and seeds are planted manually. Distances between seeds may vary from {{convert|15|to|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} and seeding depth is around {{convert|8|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}}. A typical seeding rate for chufa is about 120&nbsp;kg of tubers/ha (107&nbsp;lbs/acre).<ref>N. Pascual-Seva, et al., ''Furrow-irrigated chufa crops in Valencia (Spain)'' Spanish Journal of Agricultural Research 2013 11(1), 258-267.  http://revistas.inia.es/index.php/sjar/article/view/3385/1803</ref>\n\nThey are planted between April and May and must be irrigated every week until they are harvested in November and December. Tubers develop about 6 \u2013 8 weeks after seedling emergence and grow quickly during July and August. The maturing is around 90 \u2013 110 days. The average yield can approach between 10 and 19 t/ha.<ref>Pascual-Seva, N., San Bautista, A., L\u00f3pez Galarza, S., Maroto, J.V. and Pascual, B. 2012.

With a combine harvester, the tiger nut is pulled out of the ground. Immediately after harvesting, the tiger nuts are washed with water in order to remove sand and small stones. The drying occurs usually in the sun and can take up to three months.<ref name=month>Tigernuts Traders, S.L., ''Tigernuts Oil'', 2012, http://www.tigernut.com</ref> The temperatures and humidity levels have to be monitored very carefully during this period. The tiger nuts have to be turned every day to ensure uniform drying. The drying process ensures a longer shelf life. This prevents rot or other bacterial infections, securing quality and high nutrition levels.\nDisadvantages in the drying process are shrinkage, skin wrinkles and hard nut texture.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n===Storage===\nTiger nut loses a considerable amount of water during drying and storage. The starch content of the tiger nut tubers decreases and the reducing sugar (invert sugar) content increases during storage.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Physical and chemical properties of chufa (Cyperus esculentus L) tubers grown in the \u00c7ukurova region of Turkey |doi=10.1002/jsfa.1091 | volume=82 |issue= 6|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |pages=625\u2013631|year= 2002|last1= Co\u015fkuner|first1= Yal\u00e7\u0131n|last2= Ercan|first2= Recai|last3= Karababa|first3= Er\u015fan|last4= Nazl\u0131can|first4= Ahmet Nedim}}</ref> Tiger nut can be stored dry and rehydrated by soaking without losing the crisp texture.

It is also used for the production of nougat, jam, beer, and as a flavoring agent in ice cream and in the preparation of [[kunnu]] (a local beverage in Nigeria).{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  Kunnu is a nonalcoholic beverage prepared mainly from cereals (such as millet or sorghum) by heating and mixing with spices (dandelion, alligator pepper, ginger, licorice) and sugar. To make up for the poor nutritional value of kunnu prepared from cereals, tiger nut was found to be a good substitute for cereal grains. Tiger nut oil can be used naturally with salads or for deep frying. It is considered to be a high quality oil. Tiger nut \u201cmilk\u201d has been tried as an alternative source of milk in fermented products, such as yogurt production, and other fermented products common in some African countries and can thus be useful replacing [[milk]] in the diet of people intolerant to [[lactose]] to a certain extent.<ref name=tiger />\n\n===Nutrition===\nDespite its name, tiger nutsedge is a tuber. However, its chemical composition shares characteristics with tubers and with nuts. This tuber is rich in energy content (starch, fat, sugar, and protein), and [[dietary mineral]]s (mainly [[phosphorus]] and [[potassium]]).

The nuts have to be prepared in a prescribed manner to prevent harm to the fish. The nuts are soaked in water for 24 hours, and then boiled for 20 minutes or longer until fully expanded. Some anglers then leave the boiled nuts to ferment for 24\u201348 hours, which can enhance their effectiveness. If the nuts are not properly prepared, they can be  toxic to carp. This was originally thought to have been the cause of death of [[Benson (fish)|Benson]], a large, well-known female carp weighing {{Convert|54|lb|kg|abbr=on}} found floating dead in a fishing lake, with a bag of unprepared tiger nuts lying nearby, empty, on the bank. An examination of the fish by a [[taxidermist]] concluded tiger nut poisoning was not the cause of death, but rather the fish had died naturally.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bailey |first=John |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125051804649836945 |title=The extraordinary life and suspicious death of Benson the giant carp |publisher=The Guardian |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Compatibility with other crops==\n[[File:Cyperus esculentus NRCS-1.jpg|thumb|160px|The seed head of a ''Cyperus esculentus'' plant]]\n''C. esculentus'' is extremely difficult to remove completely once established. This is due to the plant having a stratified and layered root system, with tubers and roots being interconnected to a depth of 36&nbsp;cm or more.<ref name=Factsheet/> The tubers are connected by fragile roots that are prone to snapping when pulled, making the root system difficult to remove intact. Intermediate rhizomes can potentially reach a length of 60&nbsp;cm. The plant can quickly regenerate if a single tuber is left in place. By competing for light, water and nutrients it can reduce the vigour of neighbouring plants. It can develop into a dense colony. Patch boundaries can increase by more than one meter per year. Tubers and seed disperse with agricultural activities, soil movement or by water and wind. They are often known as a contaminant in crop seeds. When plants are small they are hard to distinguish from other weeds such as ''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'' and ''[[Elytrigia repens]]''. Thus it is hard to discover in an early stage and therefore hard to counteract. Once it is detected, mechanical removal, hand removal, grazing, damping, and herbicides can be used to inhibit ''C. esculentus''.\n\n===Similar native or non-native species that can confuse identification===\n* [[Sedges]] (''Cyperus'') have grass-like leaves and resemble each other in the appearance. They can mainly be distinguished from grasses by their triangular stems.\n* Purple nutsedge (''[[Cyperus rotundus|C. rotundus]]'') is another weedy sedge that is similar to the yellow nutsedge (''C. esculentus''). These two sedges are difficult to distinguish from each other and can be found growing on the same site. Some differences are the purple spikelets and the tubers formed by ''C. rotundus'' are often multiple instead of just one at the tip. In addition the tubers have a bitter taste instead of the mild almond-like flavour of ''C. esculentus''.<ref name=Factsheet/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WestAfricanPlants|Cyperus esculentus}}\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1165724}}\n\n[[Category:Flora of North America]]\n[[Category:Flora of Europe]]\n[[Category:Flora of Asia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Africa]]\n[[Category:Flora of South America]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Cyperus|esculentus]]\n[[Category:Valencian Community]]\n[[Category:Root vegetables]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperus_esculentus"}

[[Ma'at]], a female personification, considered to be both maternal and a delivering force, is an Ancient Egyptian personification of physical and moral law, order, and truth. In the judgment scene described in the Egyptian and the Book of Pass (the [[Book of the Dead]], which evolved from the [[Coffin Texts]] and the [[Pyramid Texts]]), there are 42 questions personifying the analysis of [[Ma'at]]. If the departed reasonably can give answers to the 42 questions, they have the potential to either be reincarnate, or if completely successful, reach the ultimate goal of becoming a Star, whereon, they can continue to give Light, and fuel Universal growth. These 42 questions correspond to the \"42 Negative Confessions\" from funerary texts such as the [[Maat#42_Negative_Confessions_(Papyrus_of_Ani) | Papyrus of Ani]].\n** There are 42 [[Stations of the Exodus]] which are the locations visited by the [[Israelite|Israelites]] following their [[The Exodus|exodus from Egypt]], recorded in [https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0433.htm#1 Numbers 33], with variations also recorded in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]].\n**42 is the number with which God creates the Universe in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic tradition]]. In Kabbalah, the most significant name is that of the En Sof (also known as \"[[Ein Sof]]\", \"Infinite\" or \"Endless\"), who is above the Sefirot (sometimes spelled \"[[Sephirot]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.ucsc.edu/cosmo/primack_abrams/InABeginningTikkun1995.pdf|title=In A Beginning...Quantum Cosmology and Kabbalah|accessdate=2008-03-14|author1=Joel Primack|author2=Nancy E.

While there are obvious links between the Forty-Two Lettered Name of the Babylonian Talmud and the Kabbalah's Forty-Two Lettered Name, they are probably not identical because of the Kabbalah's emphasis on numbers. The Kabbalah also contains a Forty-Five Lettered Name and a Seventy-Two Lettered Name.\n** The number 42 appears in various contexts in [[Christianity]]. There are 42 generations (names) in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]'s version of the [[Genealogy of Jesus]]; it is prophesied that for 42 months the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast]] will hold dominion over the Earth ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13:5); 42 men of Beth-azmaveth were counted in the [[census]] of men of [[Israel]] upon return from exile ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:24); [[God in Christianity|God]] sent bears to maul 42 of the teenage boys who mocked [[Elisha]] for his baldness ([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 2:23), etc.\n** In [[Judaism]], the number (in the ''Babylonian Talmud'', compiled 375&nbsp;AD to 499&nbsp;AD) of the \"Forty-Two Lettered Name\" ascribed to God.

[[Ma'at]], a female personification, considered to be both maternal and a delivering force, is an Ancient Egyptian personification of physical and moral law, order, and truth. In the judgment scene described in the Egyptian and the Book of Pass (the [[Book of the Dead]], which evolved from the [[Coffin Texts]] and the [[Pyramid Texts]]), there are 42 questions personifying the analysis of [[Ma'at]]. If the departed reasonably can give answers to the 42 questions, they have the potential to either be reincarnate, or if completely successful, reach the ultimate goal of becoming a Star, whereon, they can continue to give Light, and fuel Universal growth. These 42 questions correspond to the \"42 Negative Confessions\" from funerary texts such as the [[Maat#42_Negative_Confessions_(Papyrus_of_Ani) | Papyrus of Ani]].\n** There are 42 [[Stations of the Exodus]] which are the locations visited by the [[Israelite|Israelites]] following their [[The Exodus|exodus from Egypt]], recorded in [https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0433.htm#1 Numbers 33], with variations also recorded in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]].\n**42 is the number with which God creates the Universe in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic tradition]].

The Kabbalah also contains a Forty-Five Lettered Name and a Seventy-Two Lettered Name.\n** The number 42 appears in various contexts in [[Christianity]].

He is known for his unique voice and [[music style]] that no other singer from Afghanistan has been able to surpass. Sarban's songs are unrivalled for their choice of poetry, originality of composition, and sophisticated orchestration. He is known as the [[Frank Sinatra]] of Afghanistan and was also the first Afghan artist to break away from the prevalent musical forms in Afghanistan at the time, namely the Indian inspired pure classical tradition (epitomized by [[Ustad Sarahang]], [[Rahim Bakhsh]] and others), and the 'Mohali' (regional & folk) musical traditions exemplified by the Pashto music, logari, qataghani, qarsak etc.  In partnership with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast, Sarban's music fused elements, rhythms and orchestration of the western musical traditions of jazz and \"Belle Chanson\" with the prevalent Afghan musical tradition to create a unique and lasting style which became an inspiration for all ensuing artists including the great [[Ahmad Zahir]].\n\nBorn 1930 in Kabul, Afghanistan. Sarban sang predominantly in Dari as well as Pashto, possessing a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Persian poetic tradition (ranging from the poetry of Hafiz, Rumi, Khayyam to Khusro and Bedil).  Apart from his first few songs, Sarban chose the poems (lyrics) to all his songs, based on his own personal knowledge of the Persian literary canon. During the early stages of his career, Sarban worked with many musicians and composers such as Nainawaz and Taranasaz. However, during the middle and late stages of his career, he worked almost exclusively with the composer Salim Sarmast.  Sarban's songs Ahesta Bero, Khorsheede Man<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kZlYFy4zms</ref> Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Biya ke Borem ba Mazar, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Ay Shakhe Gul, Biya Ta Gul Beyafshanem, Ya Maula Dilam Tang Amada, Take Nabashi Hamdame Jani, Suraya Chara Am Kun, Tu Aftabi Wo Man, and many others are rank among the highest in the Afghan musical repertoire and are admired for their depth, refinement, and beauty.\n\nSarban's legacy permanently altered the Persian (Dari) musical tradition in Afghanistan. Almost every great artist that came after him including Ahmad Zahir & Farhad Darya considered him their primary source of inspiration and they ranked his musical repertoire as their main model of emulation.  A national icon and celebrity in Afghanistan, Sarban is also widely admired in other Persian-speaking countries like [[Iran]] and [[Tajikistan]], where he gave live performances at the height of his career.\n\nSarban's artistic greatness, due to his eccentric and mysticist temperament, did not translate into financial prosperity for himself.  He was famed for refusing to do home (majlisi) shows for pay, and for giving the proceeds from his highly successful concerts to the beggars and the needy, without regard for his own or his family's financial well-being.  Sarban stopped producing songs in the 1960s. During the 1970s he was mainly involved in concerts & in re-recording his earlier music for audiocassettes (his original recordings at Radio Kabul at the time could not be converted to audio cassette form due to lack of high quality sound equipment in Afghanistan). In 1984, Sarban suffered from a stroke which left him paralyzed and unable to speak.  This effectively ended his musical career.  During the civil war and unrest of 1990s in Kabul, Sarban left Afghanistan and migrated to Peshawar, Pakistan.   He lived in Pakistan until 1994 when he died in abject poverty.  12 years after his death, his remains were taken back to Afghanistan for reburial.<ref name=farhaddarya>[http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html Farhad Darya website: Bringing Sarban's remains from Pakistan to Afghanistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084131/http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html |date=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> to Kabul Afghanistan where he was reburied with pomp and honour as a national hero of Afghanistan for his contributions to furthering the art and culture of the country.\n\n== Career ==\nSarban gained popularity due to his music style, which was highly unconventional for its time, but it went on to become the gold standard of Afghan musical style. The legendary Afghan singer [[Ahmad Zahir]] was a huge fan of Sarban and incorporated his original songs and musical style into Zahir's own collection. Sarban's popularity is mainly with the elite and educated classes in Afghanistan where appreciation of his music is considered the height of sophistication, learning, and elegance.\n\nSarban's path to art and his immortality was purely accidental. Being born in a highly educated and accomplished family, Sarban was the only male family members who had not gone to university.  Sarban's career in art began when the director and \"father\" of the Afghan National Theatre, Ustad Abdul Rashid Latifi overheard him hum a song in a hamaam (communal baths customary in Kabul at the time). Ustad Latifi, however, did not conceive of Sarban as a singer since singing, at that time in Afghanistan, was a profession chosen very early in life and required years of work and training. Instead, Latifi asked Sarban to join his theatre troupe as a lead heroic actor, mainly due to his elegant & erudite elucidation and accent in Dari, which Sarban had naturally learned in his family upbringing. Sarban accepted the offer to work as an actor because, according to him, thing was tough and he had no prospects of employment and of feeding his young family.  While acting in the theatre, Sarban was rediscovered by the composers Nainawaz and Taranasaz for his extraordinary and evocative baritone voice. Thus, without any artistic, musical, or vocal training in voice or singing, Sarban was offered the opportunity to become a singer.  His first recorded song was \"Man Akher Az Ghamat Ay Mahro,\" and \"Tu Aftabi Wo Man.\"  The songs, played in Kabul Radio, generated a great degree of interest and enthusiasm among the public in Sarban's voice.\n\nUnlike any other great Afghan artist, Sarban stands alone in that he had no previous musical training in either playing instruments or using his voice.  He, however, had an acute ear for musical sound, and more importantly, a broad and profound understanding of Persian poetry. It is, perhaps, because of his lack of training and background in the predominant musical traditions in Afghanistan that Sarban became the artist who would free Afghan music from subservience to the Indian, Iranian, and folkloric musical traditions which dominated at the time.  In cooperation with composers, mainly Salim Sarmast, Sarban managed to create a musical language that was unique to Afghanistan.  Although his first few songs \"Tu Aftabi wo man,\" and \"Man akher az ghamat,\" were made strictly in the Indian classical model, his immediately ensuing songs \"Rahm kon ram kon,\" \"Saqi dile ma,\" \"ya maula dilam tang amada,\" \"shod abro para para,\" and the super hit songs, \"az bas ke nazanini,\" \"asare shikanje maujam,\" \"Man nainawaz am,\" and \"Harja ke safer karma,\" [the latter two songs covered by Ahmad Zahir] became models of a new sound that broke away from the traditional musical vocabulary in Afghanistan at the time.  This new sound was made immortal by the creation of a slew of songs in later years (such as Ahesta Bero, Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Khorsheede Man, Ay Shakhe Gul, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Dosh Az Masjid, Deshab ba khoda, Nameporsi Naame man, Sobhe Keshaare Maiwar, Take nabashad ham dame jani, Ta ba kai ay mah liqa, Een ghame be haya mara, haal ke deewana shodam merawi, Aye shake gul) which defined Afghan music (especially the Persian musical genre) for decades to come.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarban's personal life, especially his numerous family troubles, constantly hindered his complete devotion to his musical career.  Sarban was never able to fully commit himself to his art because of many family tragedies and difficulties that befell him persistently throughout his life.  He routinely fell into deep clinical depression due to the numerous concerns in his personal and family life such as the loss of his close relatives and family members including his beloved brothers (for their political activities).  Consequently, he took to heavy drinking to deal with his many personal problems. This took a heavy toll on his career, as he failed to produce any original music after the mid 1970s.  Nevertheless, his musical legacy and influence remain unparalleled in Afghanistan.\n\n== Contributions ==\nSarban's greatest contribution to Afghan music was the creation of a unique Afghan sound\u2014distinct from the Indian, Iranian, regional (folkloric), western traditions.  His songs set an example for all pursuing Afghan artists to compose & perform in a style that was distinctly identifiable as Afghan, as opposed to mere imitation of other musical traditions.  His work with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast led to the creation of a rhythm, melody line, harmony, and texture which became the essence of the Dari (Persian) sound.  This sound was a major influence on many later musicians including Nainawaz, Ahmad Zahir, Ustad Zaland, Ahmad Wali, & later Farhad Darya.\n\nBesides a unique and new musical sound, Sarban was the first artist to choose poems & lyrics for his songs which were not primarily about romantic love.  The vast majority of songs in Afghanistan up to that point chose poems/lyrics about romance, love, longing, and the trials and tribulations related to love.  Sarban considered this trend to be frivolous and glib.  He, therefore, made a sharp departure from this tradition, and chose social, political, economic, spiritual, and even religious matters as subject matter for his songs.  An astute student of Dari/Persian literature, he personally picked poems  which were considered by many to be not only unconventional but unsuitable for being turned into songs.  For instance, Een Ghame Be Haya, Ay Sarban, and Dar Damane Sahra, Ay Shakhe Gul, Harja Ke Safar Kardam, Beya Ta Gal Beyafshanem, were considered too erudite, abstract, and gloomy to be composed into songs. Almost all composers declined to consider them for composition.  Salim Sarmast was the only composer who offered to do the task.  Today, these are among the best songs of Afghan musical tradition.  Sometimes, if he did not get his way & was pressured by his employer (Kabul Radio) to sing more conventional love songs, he would pick a completely unrelated verse or two from another poem & insert it in the romantic song composed for him.  For instance, in his song \"Soraya chara Am kon,\" which contains a traditional romantic subject matter, he violently inserted a completely unrelated verse:\n\nAgar Dastam Rasad Ba Charkhe Gardoon\n(If my hands could reach/grab the one who runs the universe)\nAzo Porsam Ke Een Chook Auto Aan Choon\n(I shall demand of him, how is this so?)\nYaki Ra Dadayi Sad Nazo Nehmat\n(One person you lavish with a hundred gifts & prides)\nYaki Ra Qorse Jawr alooda Bar Khoon\n(But another you torture with the yoke of blood & misery)\n\nSarban was the first person to put lyrics to the iconic \"[[Ahesta Boro]]\" (Step softly) anthem played for all brides on their wedding day. These lyrics, along with the composition, have become an expected and celebrated feature of Afghan weddings, with the composition also having been sung by many popular Afghan artists. Muslim singer [[Sami Yusuf]] used the tune of a Sarban composition, \"Beyake Berem Ba Mazaar\" (Come, Lets Go to Mazaar), in his song \"Hasbi Rasbi\". Many others have covered the song and composition as well, both within Afghanistan and in other Persian cultures.\n\nSarban's \"Moshke Taza Mebarad\" (based on an obscure poem glorifying the city of his birth, Kabul) became one of the models for patriotic and national songs, and is still one of the most evocative and emotionally stirring Patriotic songs of Afghanistan due to its original and moving composition and evocative singing by Sarban.  It is said that many composers laughed at Sarban when he suggested the poem for composition into a national song due to the poem's complex vocabulary and imagery, but once again, his main artistic collaborator Salim Sarmast came to the rescue and set the lyrics to a sublime composition which moves Afghans to this day with the words\nMoshke Taza Mebarad Abre Bhmand kabul\n(Fresh Musk Scatter the silky Clouds of Kabul)\nMauje Sabza mekarad Koyo barzane Kabul\n(Waves & waves of greenery grow the mountains and rocks of Kabul)\n\nIn addition to the various compositions and lyrics he contributed, Sarban was also arguably symbolic and typical of Afghanistan's culture in his day, reflected in his singing of the beautiful poetry of many famous poets from ages past, such as Hafiz Shirazi, to whom he paid tribute with the song \"Dozh as Masjid (Soye Maykhanaa Aamad Peer e Ma)\" (Last night, upon departing the Mosque, our Master headed towards the Tavern). Sarban's cover is a cut down version of the original poem, retaining 3 of the 10 verses composed by Shirazi.\n\nSarban's compositions, like \"Dozh as Masjid\", feature various styles of Sufi or mystical poetry, which use the metaphorical language of romantic love, to describe the author's relationship with God.  Often such poems use words such as \"beloved\" figuratively in reference to God, and it could be argued that Sarban was part of a musical movement in Afghanistan which sought to enlighten the audience as much as it entertained them. Certainly, in his own personal life, Sarban was highly influenced by the Sufi tradition of mysticism.  This is evident not only in his choice of poetry, but also in his mannerisms, such as his constant raising of his forefinger when speaking or singing (the raised forefinger is the mystic's gesture denoting not only the oneness of God, but also the oneness of all creation and being.\n\nArguably, the most highly acclaimed song in Persian Language in Afghanistan is Sarban's Khorsheede Man Kojayee, which has been covered by numerous Afghan Artists.  The song, considered by critics as the greatest Afghan Persian song, was based on a poem by the Kurdish Persian poet Abolqasem Lahouti and composed by Salim Sarmast.  The song exemplifies the highest tradition of Afghan music in which sublime poetry is fused with hypnotizing melody & music, and extraordinarily emotive elocution.  Furthermore, Sarban's songs \"Ay Sarban\" (based on a poem by Saadi), Dar Damane Sahra are considered among the most accomplished examples of the Afghan musical repertoire.\n\nAlmost all of Sarban's songs were recorded in the first decade of his career\u20141960s.  Sadly, the vast majority of his original repertoire, which was recorded with a full orchestra, is not available to us. Except for a few songs from the original recordings (Khorsheede Man, Asare Shikanje Maujam, Az Bas Ke Nazanini), the overwhelming majority of Sarban's songs are re-recordings which were done in the late 1970s and released in audio cassettes.  These later versions lack the full orchestra and chorus and rely on only a few instruments.  Furthermore, Sarban's vocal gifts were past their prime at that point. Most of originals recordings which were held at Kabul Radio, were destroyed by the Taliban in the late 1990s when the Taliban captured Kabul & destroyed a large number of original recordings of the Afghan musical repertoire in Kabul Radio, and Afghan Television.  As a result, it is possible the some of his most memorable recordings are permanently lost.  Recently, however, a few vintage and rare recordings of Sarban's records (for instance the original of his song Khorsheede Man, and Asare Shikanje Moujam) were uploaded by some good samaritans on YouTube.\n\nSarban's songs have been covered both live and in recording by a vast number of Persian singes in countries ranging from Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, to Uzbekistan.  In Afghanistan, his song \"Ahesta Bero\" is played in every Persian wedding as the bride walks to the aisle, in the same manner as Wagner's Bridal Chorus \"Here Comes the Bride\" is played each time a bride in the west walks the aisle.  His song such as Ay Sarban is covered by hugely popular singers such as Googoosh (from Iran) and Ahmad Zahir from Afghanistan.  Every successful musician from Ahmad Zahir to Farhad Darya cite him as one of their main influences.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSarban was born in Saragy, an old area of Kabul to the prominent and highly respected Mahmoody family.  His father was a well educated, highly respected, and prosperous rice merchant.  The Mahmoodys were a family of illustrious doctors and surgeons highly respected among the educated elite of Kabul.  However, The Mahmoody family had been at the forefront of social agitation and political activism for decades.  As a result, his family was continuously persecuted by the monarchy at first, and then by successive governments which came after the monarchy.  This persecution resulted in a huge diminishment of the family's wealth to the point that by the time Sarban was in his teens, they were virtually penniless.  Furthermore, the majority of the most prominent and successful family members (including Sarban's only two brothers, and almost all of his first cousins) had been either executed or exiled by the time Sarban had begun his musical career.\n\nThese were the conditions under which Sarban lived.  Added to this was immense financial hardships, exacerbated by his familial background because most doors to work had been closed to him.  These conditions profoundly influenced his choice of poetry and his music.  For instance, he chose the poem \"Een Ghame Be Haya,\" for composition when his first cousin Engineer Latif Mahmoody had been arrested and executed.\n\nSarban was shy and reclusive throughout his life. He seemed indifferent to fame, celebrity, and wealth for his entire life, even when through the prime of his career, which began peaking in the 1960s <ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/399319/afghans-sing-again-of-love-and-war/ AFP / ''The Express Tribune'': Afghans sing again -- of love and war]</ref> At the peak of his celebrity, he polarized the Afghan intellectual class between those who loved and referred him for his art and those who criticized him for his personal life (i.e. his eccentric behaviour, his fondness for alcohol etc., rather than his artistic accomplishments).  Speculations said he had a constant problem with alcohol with claims he couldn't sing live on [[Kabul Radio]] without having a drink first. There are apocryphal stories that he had deep depression because he fell in love with one of his cousins, but reportedly she or her father did not accept his proposal, and that as a result Sarban was heartbroken and never married. However, these are mere rumours.  Sarban did fight with severe bouts of depression throughout his life, but this was not because of unrequited love.  Many of his close relatives (including his younger brother) were arrested for their political activities and executed by the communist regime at the time, and many others were imprisoned or forced to flee in exile.  This and the financial difficulties of raising a family without any reliable source of income were the main reasons for his depressive bouts.  As regards to his failed love with his cousin, these are mere rumours.  His close friends and family all dismiss this as urban legend.  Sarban was indeed married to one of his cousins, and he has four children (three daughters and a son).  HIs son Abdulrab Sarban also recorded an album covering some of Sarban's famous songs.  Sarban suffered a stroke in 1984 which incapacitated him & rendered him speechless.  Due to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, he and his family emigrated to Pakistan where he died in poverty. But after 12 years of his death, the Afghan Government made arrangements with his family to relocate his remains to Kabul.\n\nDiscography & Songs:\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarban, Abdul Rahim}}\n[[Category:Afghan singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan musicians]]\n[[Category:Afghan Tajik people]]\n[[Category:Tajik singers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan emigrants to Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Afghan male singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2013}}\n{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist\n|name         = Sarban\n|native_name  = {{nq|\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646}}\n|background   = solo_singer\n|image        = \n|caption      = \n|birth_name   = Abdul Rahim\n|birth_date   = {{birth year|1930}}\n|birth_place  = [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]\n|death_date   = {{death-date and age|April 2, 1993|1930}}\n|death_place  = [[Peshawar, Pakistan]]\n|genre        = [[Soft rock]]<br>[[Classical music]]\n|occupation   = Singer\n|instrument   = [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]\n|years_active = 1950s-1986\n}}\n'''Abdul-Rahim Mahmoodi S\u0101rb\u0101n''' ({{lang-fa|\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0645 \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646}}), known simply as '''Sarban''', was an [[Afghan singer]] (1930 \u2013 April 2, 1993) \nwas born in [[Kabul, Afghanistan]].

Sarban considered this trend to be frivolous and glib.  He, therefore, made a sharp departure from this tradition, and chose social, political, economic, spiritual, and even religious matters as subject matter for his songs.  An astute student of Dari/Persian literature, he personally picked poems  which were considered by many to be not only unconventional but unsuitable for being turned into songs.  For instance, Een Ghame Be Haya, Ay Sarban, and Dar Damane Sahra, Ay Shakhe Gul, Harja Ke Safar Kardam, Beya Ta Gal Beyafshanem, were considered too erudite, abstract, and gloomy to be composed into songs.  Almost all composers declined to consider them for composition.  Salim Sarmast was the only composer who offered to do the task.  Today, these are among the best songs of Afghan musical tradition.  Sometimes, if he did not get his way & was pressured by his employer (Kabul Radio) to sing more conventional love songs, he would pick a completely unrelated verse or two from another poem & insert it in the romantic song composed for him.  For instance, in his song \"Soraya chara Am kon,\" which contains a traditional romantic subject matter, he violently inserted a completely unrelated verse:\n\nAgar Dastam Rasad Ba Charkhe Gardoon\n(If my hands could reach/grab the one who runs the universe)\nAzo Porsam Ke Een Chook Auto Aan Choon\n(I shall demand of him, how is this so?)\nYaki Ra Dadayi Sad Nazo Nehmat\n(One person you lavish with a hundred gifts & prides)\nYaki Ra Qorse Jawr alooda Bar Khoon\n(But another you torture with the yoke of blood & misery)\n\nSarban was the first person to put lyrics to the iconic \"[[Ahesta Boro]]\" (Step softly) anthem played for all brides on their wedding day. These lyrics, along with the composition, have become an expected and celebrated feature of Afghan weddings, with the composition also having been sung by many popular Afghan artists. Muslim singer [[Sami Yusuf]] used the tune of a Sarban composition, \"Beyake Berem Ba Mazaar\" (Come, Lets Go to Mazaar), in his song \"Hasbi Rasbi\". Many others have covered the song and composition as well, both within Afghanistan and in other Persian cultures.\n\nSarban's \"Moshke Taza Mebarad\" (based on an obscure poem glorifying the city of his birth, Kabul) became one of the models for patriotic and national songs, and is still one of the most evocative and emotionally stirring Patriotic songs of Afghanistan due to its original and moving composition and evocative singing by Sarban.  It is said that many composers laughed at Sarban when he suggested the poem for composition into a national song due to the poem's complex vocabulary and imagery, but once again, his main artistic collaborator Salim Sarmast came to the rescue and set the lyrics to a sublime composition which moves Afghans to this day with the words\nMoshke Taza Mebarad Abre Bhmand kabul\n(Fresh Musk Scatter the silky Clouds of Kabul)\nMauje Sabza mekarad Koyo barzane Kabul\n(Waves & waves of greenery grow the mountains and rocks of Kabul)\n\nIn addition to the various compositions and lyrics he contributed, Sarban was also arguably symbolic and typical of Afghanistan's culture in his day, reflected in his singing of the beautiful poetry of many famous poets from ages past, such as Hafiz Shirazi, to whom he paid tribute with the song \"Dozh as Masjid (Soye Maykhanaa Aamad Peer e Ma)\" (Last night, upon departing the Mosque, our Master headed towards the Tavern). Sarban's cover is a cut down version of the original poem, retaining 3 of the 10 verses composed by Shirazi.\n\nSarban's compositions, like \"Dozh as Masjid\", feature various styles of Sufi or mystical poetry, which use the metaphorical language of romantic love, to describe the author's relationship with God.  Often such poems use words such as \"beloved\" figuratively in reference to God, and it could be argued that Sarban was part of a musical movement in Afghanistan which sought to enlighten the audience as much as it entertained them.  Certainly, in his own personal life, Sarban was highly influenced by the Sufi tradition of mysticism.  This is evident not only in his choice of poetry, but also in his mannerisms, such as his constant raising of his forefinger when speaking or singing (the raised forefinger is the mystic's gesture denoting not only the oneness of God, but also the oneness of all creation and being.\n\nArguably, the most highly acclaimed song in Persian Language in Afghanistan is Sarban's Khorsheede Man Kojayee, which has been covered by numerous Afghan Artists.  The song, considered by critics as the greatest Afghan Persian song, was based on a poem by the Kurdish Persian poet Abolqasem Lahouti and composed by Salim Sarmast.  The song exemplifies the highest tradition of Afghan music in which sublime poetry is fused with hypnotizing melody & music, and extraordinarily emotive elocution.  Furthermore, Sarban's songs \"Ay Sarban\" (based on a poem by Saadi), Dar Damane Sahra are considered among the most accomplished examples of the Afghan musical repertoire.\n\nAlmost all of Sarban's songs were recorded in the first decade of his career\u20141960s.  Sadly, the vast majority of his original repertoire, which was recorded with a full orchestra, is not available to us. Except for a few songs from the original recordings (Khorsheede Man, Asare Shikanje Maujam, Az Bas Ke Nazanini), the overwhelming majority of Sarban's songs are re-recordings which were done in late 1970s and released in audio cassettes.  These later versions lack the full orchestra and chorus and rely only a few instruments.  Furthermore, Sarban's vocal gifts were past their prime at that point.  Most of originals recordings which were held at Kabul Radio, were destroyed by the Taliban in late 1990s when the Taliban captured Kabul & destroyed a large number of original recordings of the Afghan musical repertoire in Kabul Radio, and Afghan Television.  As a result, it is possible the some of his most memorable recordings are permanently lost.  Recently, however, a few vintage and rare recordings of Sarban's records (for instance the original of his song Khorsheede Man, and Asare Shikanje Moujam) were uploaded by some good samaritans on YouTube.\n\nSarban's songs have been covered both live and in recording by a vast number of Persian singes in countries ranging from Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, to Uzbekistan.  In Afghanistan, his song \"Ahesta Bero\" is played in every Persian wedding as the bride walks to the aisle, in the same manner as Wagner's Bridal Chorus \"Here Comes the Bride\" is played each time a bride in the west walks the aisle.  His song such as Ay Sarban is covered by hugely popular singers such as Googoosh (from Iran) and Ahmad Zahir from Afghanistan.  Every successful musician from Ahmad Zahir to Farhad Darya cite him as one of their main influences.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSarban was born in Saragy, an old area of Kabul to the prominent and highly respected Mahmoody family.  His father was a well educated, highly respected, and prosperous rice merchant.  The Mahmoodys were a family of illustrious doctors and surgeons highly respected among the educated elite of Kabul.  However, The Mahmoody family had been at the forefront of social agitation and political activism for decades.  As a result, his family was continuously persecuted by the monarchy at first, and then by successive governments which came after the monarchy.  This persecution resulted in a huge diminishment of the family's wealth to the point that by the time Sarban was in his teens, they were virtually penniless.  Furthermore, the majority of the most prominent and successful family members (including Sarban's only two brothers, and almost all of his first cousins) had been either executed or exiled by the time Sarban had begun his musical career.\n\nThese were the conditions under which Sarban lived.  Added to this was immense financial hardships, exacerbated by his familial background because most doors to work had been closed to him.  These conditions profoundly influenced his choice of poetry and his music.  For instance, he chose the poem \"Een Ghame Be Haya,\" for composition when his first cousin Engineer Latif Mahmoody had been arrested and executed.\n\nSarban was shy and reclusive throughout his life. He seemed indifferent to fame, celebrity, and wealth for his entire life, even when through the prime of his career, which began peaking in the 1960s <ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/399319/afghans-sing-again-of-love-and-war/ AFP / ''The Express Tribune'': Afghans sing again -- of love and war]</ref> At the peak of his celebrity, he polarized the Afghan intellectual class between those who loved and referred him for his art and those who criticized him for his personal life (i.e. his eccentric behaviour, his fondness for alcohol etc., rather than his artistic accomplishments).  Speculations said he had a constant problem with alcohol with claims he couldn't sing live on [[Kabul Radio]] without having a drink first. There are apocryphal stories that he had deep depression because he fell in love with one of his cousins, but reportedly she or her father did not accept his proposal, and that as a result Sarban was heartbroken and never married. However, these are mere rumours.  Sarban did fight with severe bouts of depression throughout his life, but this was not because of unrequited love.  Many of his close relatives (including his younger brother) were arrested for their political activities and executed by the communist regime at the time, and many others were imprisoned or forced to flee in exile.  This and the financial difficulties of raising a family without any reliable source of income were the main reasons for his depressive bouts.  As regards to his failed love with his cousin, these are mere rumours.  His close friends and family all dismiss this as urban legend.  Sarban was indeed married to one of his cousins, and he has four children (three daughters and a son).  HIs son Abdulrab Sarban also recorded an album covering some of Sarban's famous songs.  Sarban suffered a stroke in 1984 which incapacitated him & rendered him speechless.  Due to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, he and his family emigrated to Pakistan where he died in poverty. But after 12 years of his death, the Afghan Government made arrangements with his family to relocate his remains to Kabul.\n\nDiscography & Songs:\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarban, Abdul Rahim}}\n[[Category:Afghan singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan musicians]]\n[[Category:Afghan Tajik people]]\n[[Category:Tajik singers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan emigrants to Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Afghan male singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "name_user": "Chirag.Saluja", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor punctuation & grammer", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahim_Sarban"}

This type of injury may result in damage to the brainstem, which could initiate or worsen the symptoms of the Cushing reflex]]\nWhenever a Cushing reflex occurs, there is a high probability of death in seconds to minutes. As a result, a Cushing reflex indicates a need for immediate care. Since its presence is a good detector of high ICP, it is often useful in the medical field, particularly during surgery.<ref name=\"ayling\"/> During any neurosurgery being performed on the brain, there is always a likelihood that raised intracranial pressure may occur. Early recognition of this is crucial to the well being of the patient. Although direct measurement of ICP is possible, it is not always accurate. In the past, physicians and nurses have relied on [[hemodynamics|hemodynamic changes]] or bradycardia, the late phase of the reflex, to identify the ICP increase. Once the initial stage of the Cushing reflex (bradycardia combined with hypertension) was discovered, it offered a much more reliable and swift warning sign of high ICP.<ref name=Wan /> It was found that hypertension and bradycardia occurred 93% of the time when [[cerebral perfusion pressure]] (CPP) dropped below 15 mmHg due to raised ICP. Also, the Cushing reflex is known to arise only from acute prolonged raises in ICP. Thus, it can be used as a tool by physicians to differentiate [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] rises in ICP.<ref name=JonesJV>{{cite journal | last = Jones| first = JV| title = Differentiation and investigation of primary versus secondary hypertension (Cushing reflex)| journal = Am.

It is widely accepted that the Cushing reflex acts as a [[baroreflex]], or homeostatic mechanism for the maintenance of blood pressure, in the cranial region.<ref name=Wan /> Specifically, the reflex mechanism can maintain normal cerebral blood flow and pressure under stressful situations such as ischemia or subarachnoid hemorrhages.

Cushing began his research in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]] studying abroad with [[Emil Theodor Kocher]]. A month into his trip, Cushing received a formal proposition from [[Kocher|Emil Theodor Kocher]] to begin testing how compression of the brain affected blood vessels. Cushing also enlisted the aid of [[Hugo Kronecker]], a known blood pressure researcher. Utilizing [[Hugo Kronecker|Kroenecker's]] assistance and resources, Cushing began his research. Cushing left [[Bern]] in 1901 to work in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] with [[Angelo Mosso]], a previous student of [[Hugo Kronecker|Kroenecker]]. He continued to work on the same research project, while also simultaneously improving his methods of recording coincidence of [[blood pressure]] and [[Intracranial pressure|ICP]]. In June 1901 Cushing published his first paper through Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin entitled \"Concerning a definite regulatory mechanism of the vasomotor centre which controls blood pressure during cerebral compression\".<ref name=Cushing /> Between 1901 and 1903, Cushing published five papers pertaining to his research on the vasopressor response.

As a result, a Cushing reflex indicates a need for immediate care. Since its presence is a good detector of high ICP, it is often useful in the medical field, particularly during surgery.<ref name=\"ayling\"/> During any neurosurgery being performed on the brain, there is always a likelihood that raised intracranial pressure may occur. Early recognition of this is crucial to the well being of the patient. Although direct measurement of ICP is possible, it is not always accurate. In the past, physicians and nurses have relied on [[hemodynamics|hemodynamic changes]] or bradycardia, the late phase of the reflex, to identify the ICP increase. Once the initial stage of the Cushing reflex (bradycardia combined with hypertension) was discovered, it offered a much more reliable and swift warning sign of high ICP.<ref name=Wan /> It was found that hypertension and bradycardia occurred 93% of the time when [[cerebral perfusion pressure]] (CPP) dropped below 15 mmHg due to raised ICP. Also, the Cushing reflex is known to arise only from acute prolonged raises in ICP. Thus, it can be used as a tool by physicians to differentiate [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] rises in ICP.<ref name=JonesJV>{{cite journal | last = Jones| first = JV| title = Differentiation and investigation of primary versus secondary hypertension (Cushing reflex)| journal = Am.

If the increase in blood pressure is not sufficient to compensate for the compression on the artery, [[infarction]] occurs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |type=Book |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-0-7216-0240-0 |page=213  |chapter=Chapter 18: Nervous Regulation of Circulation, and a Rapid Control of Arterial Pressure}}</ref>\n\nRaised ICP, tachycardia, or some other endogenous stimulus can result in distortion and/or increased pressure on the [[brainstem]].

In most normal pressure responses the chemoreceptors and baroreceptors work together to increase or decrease blood pressure. In the Cushing reflex, the central chemoreceptors are likely involved in the detection of ischemia, contributing to the sympathetic surge and hypertension in the first phase of the reflex, and work in opposition to the baroreceptors, contributing to the combined high sympathetic and parasympathetic activation<ref>{{Citation|last=Hall|first=John|title=Nervous Regulation of the Circulation and Rapid Control of Arterial Pressure|date=2012|url=https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/book/3-s2.0-B9781455770052000184?scrollTo=%23hl0000379|work=Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology|volume=|pages=215-255|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781455770052|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>.\n\n===Function===\n\nRaised intracranial pressure can ultimately result in the shifting or crushing of [[brain tissue]], which is detrimental to the physiological well-being of patients. As a result, the Cushing reflex is a last-ditch effort by the body to maintain [[homeostasis]] in the [[brain]]. It is widely accepted that the Cushing reflex acts as a [[baroreflex]], or homeostatic mechanism for the maintenance of blood pressure, in the cranial region.<ref name=Wan /> Specifically, the reflex mechanism can maintain normal cerebral blood flow and pressure under stressful situations such as ischemia or subarachnoid hemorrhages. A case report of a patient who underwent a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated that the Cushing reflex played a part in maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow.<ref name=Wan>{{cite journal | last = Wan| first = WH|author2=BT Ang |author3=E Wang | title = The cushing response: A case for a review of its role as a physiological reflex.| journal = J Clin Neurosci| volume = 15| issue = 3| pages = 223\u20138| date = Jan 7, 2008| url = | doi = 10.1016/j.jocn.2007.05.025| pmid = 18182296}}</ref> Eventually, the ICP drops to a level range where a state of induced hypertension in the form of the Cushing reflex is no longer required. The Cushing reflex was then aborted, and CPP was maintained. It has also been shown that an increase in mean arterial pressure due to hypertension, characteristic of the reflex, can cause the normalization of CPP.<ref name=Dickinson /> This effect is protective, especially during increased intracranial pressure, which creates a drop in CPP.\n\n==Cushing's triad{{anchor|Cushing's_Triad}}==\n'''Cushing's triad''' is a clinical triad variably defined as having:\n*Irregular, decreased respirations (caused by impaired brainstem function)\n*Bradycardia\n*Systolic hypertension (widening pulse pressure)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caroline|first1=Nancy|title=Emergency Care in the Streets|date=2013|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-4496-4151-1|page=1665|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Harvey Cushing, Doris Ulmann 1920s.jpg|thumb|[[Harvey Cushing]], Doris Ulmann 1920s]]\nCushing's reflex is named after [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] (1869\u20131939), an [[United States|American]] [[neurosurgeon]]. Cushing began his research in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]] studying abroad with [[Emil Theodor Kocher]]. A month into his trip, Cushing received a formal proposition from [[Kocher|Emil Theodor Kocher]] to begin testing how compression of the brain affected blood vessels. Cushing also enlisted the aid of [[Hugo Kronecker]], a known blood pressure researcher. Utilizing [[Hugo Kronecker|Kroenecker's]] assistance and resources, Cushing began his research. Cushing left [[Bern]] in 1901 to work in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] with [[Angelo Mosso]], a previous student of [[Hugo Kronecker|Kroenecker]]. He continued to work on the same research project, while also simultaneously improving his methods of recording coincidence of [[blood pressure]] and [[Intracranial pressure|ICP]]. In June 1901 Cushing published his first paper through Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin entitled \"Concerning a definite regulatory mechanism of the vasomotor centre which controls blood pressure during cerebral compression\".<ref name=Cushing /> Between 1901 and 1903, Cushing published five papers pertaining to his research on the vasopressor response. These papers were published in [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]], and one was authored by [[Kocher|Emil Theodor Kocher]].<ref name=Fodstad>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fodstad H, Kelly PJ, Buchfelder M |title=History of the cushing reflex |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1132\u20137; discussion 1137 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17143247 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000245582.08532.7C |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Experimental setup and results===\nCushing began experimenting once he obtained approval from Kocher.

To begin, Cushing monitored the caliber and color of cortical vessels by fitting a glass window into the skull of the dog. Intracranial pressure was raised by filling an intracranial, soft, rubber bag with mercury. Cushing recorded the intracranial pressure along with [[blood pressure]], [[pulse rate]], and [[respiratory rate]] simultaneously. This three part effect is commonly referred to as [[Cushing's triad]]. In later experiments performed by [[Angelo Mosso|Mosso]], intracranial pressure was induced by injecting physiological saline into the [[subarachnoid space]] rather than increasing mercury content of an intracranial bag.<ref name=Fodstad />\n\nThis research clearly displayed the cause and effect relationship between intracranial pressure and cerebral compression.<ref name=FinkM>{{cite book |author1=Mitchell Fink |author2=Michelle Hayes |author3=Neil Soni |title= Classic Papers in Critical Care.  |publisher= Springer |location=London, England |year=2008 |pages= 89\u201390 |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Cushing noted this relationship in his subsequent publications.
