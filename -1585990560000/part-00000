His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

The Bushati started to settle permanently in the 15th century and this process had been completed in the late 16th century. Their settlement includes the village of [[Bushat]] in Shkod\u00ebr in the [[Zadrima|Zadrima plain]] from where the Bushati family came. Another part settled with the tribe of [[Bukumiri]] in the would-be territory of the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribe, where they gradually became part of the new, larger tribe in the late 16th century. In the defter of 1497 they appear as ''katun Bushat'' in Piperi with 35 households.<ref name=\"Pulaha2\">{{cite journal |last1=Pulaha |first1=Selami |title=Kontribut p\u00ebr studimin e ngulitjes s\u00eb katuneve dhe krijimin e fiseve n\u00eb Shqipe \u0308rine \u0308 e veriut shekujt XV-XVI' [Contribution to the Study of Village Settlements and the Formation of the Tribes of Northern Albania in the 15th century] |journal=Studime Historike |date=1975 |volume=12 |page=87-89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4khAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=30 January 2020 |ref=Pulaha2}}</ref>\n\nThe Bushati family traces their origin the Begaj brotherhood of Bushati that had converted to Islam possibly in the early 17th century. To promote their status and political goals statesmen, commanders and leaders from that family put forward different theories about their origins. [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] in his time recorded a story about them being descendants of a Jusuf Bey Plaku, who traced his origin and status to the era of [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]. In the period of the [[Pashalik of Shkodra]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] sought to expand northwards in the old lands of [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] of the Middle Ages.

The Bushati started to settle permanently in the 15th century and this process had been completed in the late 16th century. Their settlement includes the village of [[Bushat]] in Shkod\u00ebr in the [[Zadrima|Zadrima plain]] from where the Bushati family came. Another part settled with the tribe of [[Bukumiri]] in the would-be territory of the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribe, where they gradually became part of the new, larger tribe in the late 16th century.

To promote their status and political goals statesmen, commanders and leaders from that family put forward different theories about their origins. [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] in his time recorded a story about them being descendants of a Jusuf Bey Plaku, who traced his origin and status to the era of [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]. In the period of the [[Pashalik of Shkodra]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] sought to expand northwards in the old lands of [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] of the Middle Ages.

[[Michael Madsen]], [[Bruno Kirby]], [[James Russo]], and [[Anne Heche]] appeared in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of [[Joseph D. Pistone]] (Depp), an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] undercover agent who infiltrated the [[Bonanno crime family]] in [[New York City]] during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco. Brasco maneuvers his way into the confidence of an aging Mafia [[hitman]], [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Lefty Ruggiero]] (Pacino), who vouches for him. As Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.\n\n''Donnie Brasco'' was released on February 28, 1997 by [[TriStar Pictures]]. The film was a box office success, earning $124 million against its $35 million budget, and received positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The adaptation of [[Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia|the book]] by Joseph D. Pistone and Richard Woodley was by screenwriter [[Paul Attanasio]].<ref name=\"oscar\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1990-1999/70nominees.html\n | title = Nominees & Winners for the 70th Academy Awards &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences\n | website = Oscars.org\n | access-date = May 6, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1970s New York City, an aging gangster in the [[Bonanno crime family]], [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]], is introduced to a jewel thief named [[Donnie Brasco|Donnie]]. Donnie impresses Lefty by threatening a diamond dealer whom Donnie suspects of selling Lefty a fake ring. Lefty teaches Donnie the rules of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] and introduces him to several [[made men]], including [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]], Nicky, and [[caporegime]] [[Alphonse Indelicato|Sonny Red]].\n\nDonnie Brasco is revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone, an [[undercover]] FBI agent. His wife, Maggie, is not fond of the circumstances surrounding his undercover operation.\n\nAfter the Bonanno family's street boss is killed, Sonny Red assumes the new position. Sonny is promoted to captain, angering Lefty, as he provided for Sonny's crew while he was in prison. As the crew runs a series of successful shakedowns and hijackings in Brooklyn, Donnie collects more information for the FBI via [[wiretap]].\n\nDue to Pistone's success at infiltrating the Mafia, an FBI supervisor from Washington, Dean Blanford, takes an interest in the case. He asks Pistone to incorporate a Miami-based FBI agent, Richie Gazzo, into the Bonanno's operation. Though reluctant, Pistone convinces Sonny and the crew to meet Gazzo in Miami.\n\nIn Miami, Donnie and Lefty plan to run Richie's nightclub on their own, and attempt to impress Florida mob boss, Trafficante, with a yacht party. However, Sonny reaches out to Trafficante first, angering Lefty, especially when Sonny Black tells Donnie to work for him and run the club as an unofficial made man. Donnie reconciles with Lefty when Lefty's son nearly dies of a drug overdose.\n\nOn its opening day, Sonny's club is raided by Miami police on orders from Trafficante, who was colluding with Sonny Red. Suspecting Sonny Red to be responsible, the crew, without Donnie, kill Sonny Red and two rival caporegimes after calling a meeting. The crew also kills Nicky, who was found to have been carrying out a narcotics deal without Sonny's knowledge and without making payments \"up the chain.\" Donnie helps with the clean up of the bodies. With Sonny becoming the new street boss, Donnie is tasked with finding and killing Sonny Red's son, Bruno.\n\nAt home, Pistone's behavior increasingly becomes like that of the criminal he pretends to be. One last dispute between Donnie and his wife becomes physical.\n\nWith increasing pressure from the FBI to end the operation and make arrests, Donnie tries convincing Lefty to escape his criminal life. However, Bruno is tracked down and Lefty discovers that the yacht Donnie had previously arranged was federally owned. Outside the location where Bruno is hiding, Lefty confronts Donnie about his loyalties. At gunpoint, Lefty forces Donnie out to kill Bruno to confirm his loyalties, but before either murder can be committed, FBI agents arrive and apprehend them.\n\nFBI agents visit Sonny's hangout, and reveal Donnie's true identity to him and his crew by showing them photographs of Pistone in FBI uniform. Later, Lefty is summoned to a meeting; he leaves behind his valuables and tells his girlfriend that if Donnie calls to tell him that \"if it was going to be anyone, I'm glad it was him,\" as he goes to his implied death. With his family in attendance, Pistone attends a small private ceremony for his service, being awarded a $500 check and a medal.\n\nThe end title cards state that the evidence collected by \"Donnie Brasco\" led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. Pistone lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location, with a $500,000 open contract on his head.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]]\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Donnie Brasco|Donnie]]\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]]\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Nicky\n* [[James Russo]] as Paulie\n* [[Anne Heche]]  as Maggie\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Tim Curley\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Dean Blandford FBI\n* [[Robert Miano]] as [[Al Indelicato|Sonny Red]]\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Bruno\n* [[Rocco Sisto]] as Richie Gazzo\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Dr. Berger\n* [[Walt MacPherson]] as Sheriff\n* Ronnie Farer as Annette\n* [[Terry Serpico]] as Strip club owner\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Sonny's girlfriend\n* [[Tony Lip]] as Philly Lucky\n* George Angelica as Big Trin\n* [[Val Avery]] as Trafficante\n* Madison Arnold as Jilly\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nLouis DiGiaimo, who worked as a casting director for Barry Levinson, was a childhood acquaintance of Joseph D. Pistone, and served as a consultant for his book ''Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia''. Once the book came out, Levinson's company, Baltimore Pictures, purchased the rights, with screenwriter Paul Attanasio set to write the script. [[Stephen Frears]] would direct and [[Tom Cruise]] would play Pistone/Brasco. In 1991, the film was postponed due to the release of ''[[Goodfellas]]'', as the producers felt there was not enough room for two hyperrealistic Mafia films. When the project was resurrected in 1996, Frears was replaced with Mike Newell, and Johnny Depp was cast as Pistone/Brasco. Al Pacino was the only actor kept from the first attempt to make the film. Pistone was hired as a consultant, helping Depp and Pacino develop their characters.<ref name=\"dvd\">\"Donnie Brasco: Out from the Shadows\", featurette appearing on ''Donnie Brasco'' DVD\n</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Reception ==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 88% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 57 reviews, with an average score of 7.81/10.

[[Michael Madsen]], [[Bruno Kirby]], [[James Russo]], and [[Anne Heche]] appeared in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of [[Joseph D. Pistone]] (Depp), an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] undercover agent who infiltrated the [[Bonanno crime family]] in [[New York City]] during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco. Brasco maneuvers his way into the confidence of an aging Mafia [[hitman]], [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Lefty Ruggiero]] (Pacino), who vouches for him. As Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.\n\n''Donnie Brasco'' was released on February 28, 1997, by [[TriStar Pictures]]. The film was a box office success, earning $124 million against its $35 million budget, and received positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The adaptation of [[Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia|the book]] by Joseph D. Pistone and Richard Woodley was by screenwriter [[Paul Attanasio]].<ref name=\"oscar\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1990-1999/70nominees.html\n | title = Nominees & Winners for the 70th Academy Awards &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences\n | website = Oscars.org\n | access-date = May 6, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1970s New York City, an aging gangster in the [[Bonanno crime family]], [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]], is introduced to a jewel thief named [[Donnie Brasco|Donnie]]. Donnie impresses Lefty by threatening a diamond dealer whom Donnie suspects of selling Lefty a fake ring. Lefty teaches Donnie the rules of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] and introduces him to several [[made men]], including [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]], Nicky, and [[caporegime]] [[Alphonse Indelicato|Sonny Red]].\n\nDonnie Brasco is revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone, an [[undercover]] FBI agent. His wife, Maggie, is not fond of the circumstances surrounding his undercover operation.\n\nAfter the Bonanno family's street boss is killed, Sonny Red assumes the new position. Sonny is promoted to captain, angering Lefty, as he provided for Sonny's crew while he was in prison. As the crew runs a series of successful shakedowns and hijackings in Brooklyn, Donnie collects more information for the FBI via [[wiretap]].\n\nDue to Pistone's success at infiltrating the Mafia, an FBI supervisor from Washington, Dean Blanford, takes an interest in the case. He asks Pistone to incorporate a Miami-based FBI agent, Richie Gazzo, into the Bonanno's operation. Though reluctant, Pistone convinces Sonny and the crew to meet Gazzo in Miami.\n\nIn Miami, Donnie and Lefty plan to run Richie's nightclub on their own, and attempt to impress Florida mob boss, Trafficante, with a yacht party. However, Sonny reaches out to Trafficante first, angering Lefty, especially when Sonny Black tells Donnie to work for him and run the club as an unofficial made man. Donnie reconciles with Lefty when Lefty's son nearly dies of a drug overdose.\n\nOn its opening day, Sonny's club is raided by Miami police on orders from Trafficante, who was colluding with Sonny Red. Suspecting Sonny Red to be responsible, the crew, without Donnie, kill Sonny Red and two rival caporegimes after calling a meeting. The crew also kills Nicky, who was found to have been carrying out a narcotics deal without Sonny's knowledge and without making payments \"up the chain.\" Donnie helps with the clean up of the bodies. With Sonny becoming the new street boss, Donnie is tasked with finding and killing Sonny Red's son, Bruno.\n\nAt home, Pistone's behavior increasingly becomes like that of the criminal he pretends to be. One last dispute between Donnie and his wife becomes physical.\n\nWith increasing pressure from the FBI to end the operation and make arrests, Donnie tries convincing Lefty to escape his criminal life. However, Bruno is tracked down and Lefty discovers that the yacht Donnie had previously arranged was federally owned. Outside the location where Bruno is hiding, Lefty confronts Donnie about his loyalties. At gunpoint, Lefty forces Donnie out to kill Bruno to confirm his loyalties, but before either murder can be committed, FBI agents arrive and apprehend them.\n\nFBI agents visit Sonny's hangout, and reveal Donnie's true identity to him and his crew by showing them photographs of Pistone in FBI uniform. Later, Lefty is summoned to a meeting; he leaves behind his valuables and tells his girlfriend that if Donnie calls to tell him that \"if it was going to be anyone, I'm glad it was him,\" as he goes to his implied death. With his family in attendance, Pistone attends a small private ceremony for his service, being awarded a $500 check and a medal.\n\nThe end title cards state that the evidence collected by \"Donnie Brasco\" led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. Pistone lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location, with a $500,000 open contract on his head.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lefty Ruggiero|Lefty]]\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Donnie Brasco|Donnie]]\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Dominick Napolitano|Sonny]]\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Nicky\n* [[James Russo]] as Paulie\n* [[Anne Heche]]  as Maggie\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Tim Curley\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Dean Blandford FBI\n* [[Robert Miano]] as [[Al Indelicato|Sonny Red]]\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Bruno\n* [[Rocco Sisto]] as Richie Gazzo\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Dr. Berger\n* [[Walt MacPherson]] as Sheriff\n* Ronnie Farer as Annette\n* [[Terry Serpico]] as Strip club owner\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Sonny's girlfriend\n* [[Tony Lip]] as Philly Lucky\n* George Angelica as Big Trin\n* [[Val Avery]] as Trafficante\n* Madison Arnold as Jilly\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nLouis DiGiaimo, who worked as a casting director for Barry Levinson, was a childhood acquaintance of Joseph D. Pistone, and served as a consultant for his book ''Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia''. Once the book came out, Levinson's company, Baltimore Pictures, purchased the rights, with screenwriter Paul Attanasio set to write the script. [[Stephen Frears]] would direct and [[Tom Cruise]] would play Pistone/Brasco. In 1991, the film was postponed due to the release of ''[[Goodfellas]]'', as the producers felt there was not enough room for two hyperrealistic Mafia films. When the project was resurrected in 1996, Frears was replaced with Mike Newell, and Johnny Depp was cast as Pistone/Brasco. Al Pacino was the only actor kept from the first attempt to make the film. Pistone was hired as a consultant, helping Depp and Pacino develop their characters.<ref name=\"dvd\">\"Donnie Brasco: Out from the Shadows\", featurette appearing on ''Donnie Brasco'' DVD\n</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Reception ==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 88% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 57 reviews, with an average score of 7.81/10.

The [[batting (cricket)|batting]] side scores [[run (cricket)|runs]] by striking the [[cricket ball|ball]] bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]] side tries to prevent this and [[dismissal (cricket)|dismiss]] each player (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include being [[bowled]], when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the [[innings]] ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]], aided by a [[third umpire]] and [[match referee]] in international matches. They communicate with two off-field [[Scoring (cricket)|scorers]] who record the match's [[Cricket statistics|statistical information]].\n\nThere are various [[forms of cricket|formats]] ranging from [[Twenty20]], played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 [[Over (cricket)|overs]], to [[Test cricket|Test matches]], played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white [[Cricket clothing and equipment|kit]], but in [[limited overs cricket]] they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear [[cricket clothing and equipment|protective gear]] to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed [[leather]] with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a [[cork (material)|cork]] core which is layered with tightly wound string.\n\n[[History of cricket|Historically]], cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in [[South East England|south-east England]] in the middle of the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the [[British Empire]], leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are [[List of International Cricket Council members|full members]] who play Test matches. The game's rules are held in a code called the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' which is owned and maintained by [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in [[London]]. The sport is followed primarily in the [[Indian subcontinent]], Australasia, the United Kingdom, [[southern Africa]] and the [[West Indies]], its globalisation occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and remaining popular into the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23920270/icc-survey-reveals-billion-fans-90-subcontinent|title=ICC survey reveals over a billion fans \u2013 90% in subcontinent}}</ref> [[Women's cricket]], which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard.

The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old [[coroner]], [[John Derrick]], who gave witness that:<ref name=\"HSA21\">Altham (1962), p. 21.</ref><ref name=\"DU3\">Underdown (2000), p. 3.</ref><ref name=\"JM19\">Major (2007), p. 19.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Being a scholler in the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|ffree schoole of Guldeford]] hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.</blockquote>\n\nGiven Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in [[Surrey]].<ref name=\"JM19\"/> The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun \"''crosse''{{-\"}} as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\" and the verb form \"''crosser''{{-\"}} as \"to play at cricket\".<ref name=\"HSA22\">Altham (1962), p. 22.</ref><ref name=\"JM31\">Major (2007), p. 31.</ref>\n\nOne possible source for the sport's name is the [[Old English language|Old English]] word \"''cryce''{{-\"}} (or \"''cricc''{{-\"}}) meaning a crutch or staff. In [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary'', he derived cricket from \"''cryce'', Saxon, a stick\".<ref name=\"HSA21\"/> In [[Old French]], the word \"''criquet''{{-\"}} seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.<ref name=\"DB3\">Birley (1999), p. 3.</ref> Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the [[County of Flanders]] when the latter belonged to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], the name may have been derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] (in use in [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] at the time) \"''krick''{{-\"}}(''-e''), meaning a stick (crook).<ref name=\"DB3\"/> Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"''krickstoel''{{-\"}}, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket.<ref>Bowen (1970), p. 33.</ref> According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of [[Bonn University]], \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for [[hockey]], ''met de (krik ket)sen'' (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").<ref name=\"17CGC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |last=Terry |first=David |title=The Seventeenth Century Game of Cricket: A Reconstruction of the Game |work=The Sports Historian, No. 20 |publisher=The British Society of Sports History |location=London |year=2000 |pages=33\u201343 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5laxwhCZO?url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2009 |df=}}</ref> Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.<ref name=\"17CGC\"/>\n\n===Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England===\n[[File:Historical cricket bat art.jpg|thumb|right|Evolution of the cricket bat.

If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]] after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score.

The ball has a \"seam\": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior.

During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable;  during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's [[swing bowling|swing through the air]], but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal [[ball tampering]].<ref name=Law5>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-5-the-ball/ |title=Law 5 \u2013 The ball |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Basic gameplay: bowler to batsman===\nDuring normal play, thirteen players and two [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] are on the field.

Many modern players use more defensive equipment than was available to Grace, notably helmets and arm guards.]]\nThe wicket-keeper and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than {{convert|145|km/h|mph}} and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includes [[batting pads|pads]] (designed to protect the knees and shins), [[batting gloves]] or [[wicket-keeper's gloves]] for the hands, a [[helmet (cricket)|safety helmet]] for the head and a [[box (cricket)|box]] for male players inside the trousers (to protect the [[crotch]] area).<ref name=AppD>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/appendix-d/ |title=Appendix D |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.<ref name=Law41/>\n\nSubject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); [[cricket cap]] (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead.<ref>Birley (1999), p. 343.</ref>\n\n===Innings===\n{{main|Innings}}\nThe innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is \"all out\", a term defined by the Laws: \"at the [[dismissal (cricket)|fall of a wicket]] or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in\".<ref name=inns/> In this situation, one of the batsmen has not been dismissed and is termed [[not out]]; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress.\n\nAn innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:<ref name=inns/>\n* the batting team's [[captain (cricket)|captain]] [[Declaration and forfeiture|may declare the innings closed]] even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings\n* the set number of [[over (cricket)|overs]] (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled\n* the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time\n* in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.\n\n===Overs===\n{{main|Over (cricket)}}\nThe Laws state that, throughout an innings, \"the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls\".<ref name=Law22>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-22-the-over/ |title=Law 22 \u2013 The over |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=4 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702061242/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-22-the-over/ |archive-date=2 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The name \"over\" came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a \"spell\". The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice-versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at \"square leg\" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice-versa.<ref name=Law22/>\n\n===Umpires and scorers===\n{{main|Umpire (cricket)|Scoring (cricket)|Cricket statistics}}\n[[File:Cricket Umpire.jpg|thumb|right|An umpire signals a decision to the scorers]]\nThe game on the field is regulated by the two [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]], one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called \"square leg\" which is about 15\u201320 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a [[no-ball]] or a [[wide (cricket)|wide]]); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must first [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]] to the umpire, usually with the phrase \"How's that?\" or \"Owzat?\"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.<ref name=Law3/>\n\nOff the field in televised matches, there is usually a [[third umpire]] who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[Limited Overs International]] matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have a [[match referee]] whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.<ref name=Law3/>\n\nThe match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official [[scoring (cricket)|scorers]], one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-4-the-scorers/ |title=Law 4 \u2013 The scorers |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=4 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702065817/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-4-the-scorers/ |archive-date=2 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA match's [[Cricket statistics|statistics]] are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on [[tally stick]]s and runs were originally called notches.<ref>Bowen (1970), p. 57.</ref> According to [[Rowland Bowen]], the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T.

They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.\n\nPrevious versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batsman is not out) but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies. The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship \u2013 or its absence.\n\n===Bowling and dismissal===\n{{main|Bowling (cricket)|Dismissal (cricket)}}\n[[File:Glenn McGrath 01 crop 2.jpg|right|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Glenn McGrath]] of [[Australian Cricket Team|Australia]] holds the world record for most wickets in the [[Cricket World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-wickets-taken-in-an-icc-world-cup-career-(male) |title=Most wickets taken in an ICC World Cup career (male)|work=[[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>]]\nMost bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally. The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively. If the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.<ref name=Law22/>\n\nA bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\" and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being \"in play\".<ref name=Law22/> Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over {{convert|145|km/h|mph}} and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly.<ref name=pace>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkcricket.co.uk/guides/types_of_fast_bowling.html |title=Types of fast bowling |work=TalkCricket |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball [[seam bowling|seam]] or [[swing bowling|swing]] (i.e. curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.<ref name=pace/> At the other end of the bowling scale is the [[Spin bowling|spin bowler]] who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often \"buy his wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, steeper [[Parabolic trajectory|parabolic]] path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be \"trapped\" into getting himself out.<ref name=spin>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkcricket.co.uk/guides/cricket_skills_spin_bowling.html |title=Spin bowling |work=TalkCricket |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.<ref name=pace/>\n\nThere are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed: five relatively common and five extremely rare.

The diagram for a [[left-handed]] batsman is a [[mirror image]] of this one.]]\nBatsmen take turns to bat via a [[batting order (cricket)|batting order]] which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.<ref name=Law1/> Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed,<ref name=Law2/> except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.<ref name=ICCTestPlayCond/>\n\nIn order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketweb.net/grip-stance-back-lift/ |title=Grip, Stance, Back-Lift |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nA skilled batsman can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an \"[[Edge (cricket)|edge]]\". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the [[wicketkeeper]]. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"[[List of cricket terms#Cut|cut]]\", \"drive\", \"hook\", \"pull\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkcricket.co.uk/guides/cricket_batting.html |title=Batting |work=TalkCricket |publisher= |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe batsman on strike (i.e. the \"striker\") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score [[Run (cricket)|runs]] by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.<ref name=Law18>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-18-scoring-runs/ |title=Law 18 \u2013 Scoring runs |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Master Blaster at work.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sachin Tendulkar]] is the only player to have scored one hundred international [[Century (cricket)|centuries]]]]\n\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually \"yes\", \"no\" or \"wait\". More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.<ref name=Law18/> To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground ''en route'' to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batsmen do not need to run.<ref name=Law19>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-19-boundaries/ |title=Law 19 \u2013 Boundaries |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.<ref name=Law18/>\n\nAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team as [[extra (cricket)|extras]] (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: [[no-ball]], a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules;<ref name=Law24>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-24-no-ball/ |title=Law 24 \u2013 No ball |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> [[wide (cricket)|wide]], a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach;<ref name=Law25a>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-25-wide-ball/ |title=Law 25 \u2013 Wide ball |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> [[bye (cricket)|bye]], an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way;<ref name=Law26>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-26-bye-and-leg-bye/ |title=Law 26 \u2013 Bye and Leg bye |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> [[leg bye]], as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman's body, though not his bat.<ref name=Law26/> If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.<ref name=Law24/><ref name=Law25a/>\n\n==Women's cricket==\n{{main|Women's cricket}}\n[[File:Mithali Raj Truro 2012.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mithali Raj]] of India, is the only player to surpass the 6,000 run mark in [[Women's One Day International cricket]].]]\n[[Women's cricket]] was first recorded in [[Surrey]] in 1745.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/cricket/history-of-cricket/early-cricket |title=ICC History of Cricket (pre-1799) |publisher=ICC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between [[Australia Women cricket team|Australia]] and [[England women's cricket team|England]] in December 1934.<ref name=ICC20C>{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/cricket/history-of-cricket/20th-century |title=ICC History of Cricket (20th century) |publisher=ICC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> The following year, [[New Zealand Womens cricket team|New Zealand]] women joined them, and in 2007 [[Netherlands women cricket team|Netherlands women]] became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against [[South Africa women cricket team|South Africa women]].

Although the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] in the [[1876-77 Australian cricket season|1876\u201377 Australian season]]; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as [[The Ashes]]. The term \"first-class\", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Cricket |last=Rundell |first=Michael |year=2006 |publisher=A&C Black Publishers Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-7136-7915-1 |page=336 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Vu9cih3u1kC&lpg=PT336&dq=%22dictionary%20of%20cricket%22%20test&pg=PT336#v=onepage&q=%22dictionary%20of%20cricket%22%20test |accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nLimited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day. There are two types: [[List A cricket|List A]] which normally allows fifty overs per team; and [[Twenty20]] in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as [[Limited Overs International]]s (LOI) and [[Twenty20 International]]s (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first [[Cricket World Cup]] took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The first [[Twenty20 World Championship]] was held in 2007. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a \"no result\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/255055.html |title=ICC clarification of limited overs |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/980687.html |title=The first official T20 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nSingle wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.<ref>Major (2007), pp. 155\u2013167 & 404\u2013410.</ref>\n\n==International competitions==\n{{main|International cricket}}\n\nMost international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a [[Test cricket#Perpetual trophies|perpetual trophy]] is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is [[The Ashes]].\n\nThe ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the [[Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC T20 World Cup]] and [[ICC Champions Trophy]]. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the [[ICC World Test Championship]], had been proposed several times, and its [[2019\u201321 ICC World Test Championship|first instance]] began in 2019. A league competition for ODIs, the [[2020\u201322 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League]], is planned to begin in 2020. The ICC maintains [[ICC Test Championship|Test rankings]], [[ICC ODI Championship|ODI rankings]] and [[ICC T20I Championship|T20 rankings]] systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.\n\nCompetitions for member nations of the ICC with [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate members|Associate status]] include the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], for first-class cricket matches, and the [[World Cricket League]] for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the [[ICC World Cup Qualifier]].\n\n==National competitions==\n{{see also|Category:Domestic cricket competitions}}\n[[File:Yorkshire-CCC-1895.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] in 1895.

The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old [[coroner]], [[John Derrick]], who gave witness that:<ref name=\"HSA21\">Altham (1962), p. 21.</ref><ref name=\"DU3\">Underdown (2000), p. 3.</ref><ref name=\"JM19\">Major (2007), p. 19.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Being a scholler in the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|ffree schoole of Guldeford]] hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.</blockquote>\n\nGiven Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in [[Surrey]].<ref name=\"JM19\"/> The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun \"''crosse''{{-\"}} as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\" and the verb form \"''crosser''{{-\"}} as \"to play at cricket\".<ref name=\"HSA22\">Altham (1962), p. 22.</ref><ref name=\"JM31\">Major (2007), p. 31.</ref>\n\nOne possible source for the sport's name is the [[Old English language|Old English]] word \"''cryce''{{-\"}} (or \"''cricc''{{-\"}}) meaning a crutch or staff. In [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary'', he derived cricket from \"''cryce'', Saxon, a stick\".<ref name=\"HSA21\"/> In [[Old French]], the word \"''criquet''{{-\"}} seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.<ref name=\"DB3\">Birley (1999), p. 3.</ref> Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the [[County of Flanders]] when the latter belonged to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], the name may have been derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] (in use in [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] at the time) \"''krick''{{-\"}}(''-e''), meaning a stick (crook).<ref name=\"DB3\"/> Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"''krickstoel''{{-\"}}, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket.<ref>Bowen (1970), p. 33.</ref> According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of [[Bonn University]], \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for [[hockey]], ''met de (krik ket)sen'' (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").<ref name=\"17CGC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |last=Terry |first=David |title=The Seventeenth Century Game of Cricket: A Reconstruction of the Game |work=The Sports Historian, No. 20 |publisher=The British Society of Sports History |location=London |year=2000 |pages=33\u201343 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5laxwhCZO?url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2009 |df=}}</ref> Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.<ref name=\"17CGC\"/>\n\n===Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England===\n[[File:Historical cricket bat art.jpg|thumb|right|Evolution of the cricket bat.

The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or, at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring [[run (cricket)|runs]].

Protective clothing includes [[batting pads|pads]] (designed to protect the knees and shins), [[batting gloves]] or [[wicket-keeper's gloves]] for the hands, a [[helmet (cricket)|safety helmet]] for the head and a [[box (cricket)|box]] for male players inside the trousers (to protect the [[crotch]] area).<ref name=AppD>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/appendix-d/ |title=Appendix D |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.<ref name=Law41/>\n\nSubject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); [[cricket cap]] (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead.<ref>Birley (1999), p. 343.</ref>\n\n===Innings===\n{{main|Innings}}\nThe innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is \"all out\", a term defined by the Laws: \"at the [[dismissal (cricket)|fall of a wicket]] or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in\".<ref name=inns/> In this situation, one of the batsmen has not been dismissed and is termed [[not out]]; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress.\n\nAn innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:<ref name=inns/>\n* the batting team's [[captain (cricket)|captain]] [[Declaration and forfeiture|may declare the innings closed]] even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings\n* the set number of [[over (cricket)|overs]] (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled\n* the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time\n* in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.\n\n===Overs===\n{{main|Over (cricket)}}\nThe Laws state that, throughout an innings, \"the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls\".<ref name=Law22>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-22-the-over/ |title=Law 22 \u2013 The over |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=4 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702061242/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-22-the-over/ |archive-date=2 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The name \"over\" came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a \"spell\". The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice-versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at \"square leg\" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice-versa.<ref name=Law22/>\n\n===Umpires and scorers===\n{{main|Umpire (cricket)|Scoring (cricket)|Cricket statistics}}\n[[File:Cricket Umpire.jpg|thumb|right|An umpire signals a decision to the scorers]]\nThe game on the field is regulated by the two [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]], one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called \"square leg\" which is about 15\u201320 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a [[no-ball]] or a [[wide (cricket)|wide]]); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must first [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]] to the umpire, usually with the phrase \"How's that?\" or \"Owzat?\"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.<ref name=Law3/>\n\nOff the field in televised matches, there is usually a [[third umpire]] who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[Limited Overs International]] matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have a [[match referee]] whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.<ref name=Law3/>\n\nThe match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official [[scoring (cricket)|scorers]], one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-4-the-scorers/ |title=Law 4 \u2013 The scorers |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=4 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702065817/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-4-the-scorers/ |archive-date=2 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA match's [[Cricket statistics|statistics]] are summarised on a scorecard.

A spinner will often \"buy his wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, steeper [[Parabolic trajectory|parabolic]] path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot.

The diagram for a [[left-handed]] batsman is a [[mirror image]] of this one.]]\nBatsmen take turns to bat via a [[batting order (cricket)|batting order]] which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.<ref name=Law1/> Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed,<ref name=Law2/> except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.<ref name=ICCTestPlayCond/>\n\nIn order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketweb.net/grip-stance-back-lift/ |title=Grip, Stance, Back-Lift |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nA skilled batsman can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an \"[[Edge (cricket)|edge]]\". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the [[wicketkeeper]]. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"[[List of cricket terms#Cut|cut]]\", \"drive\", \"hook\", \"pull\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkcricket.co.uk/guides/cricket_batting.html |title=Batting |work=TalkCricket |publisher= |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe batsman on strike (i.e. the \"striker\") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score [[Run (cricket)|runs]] by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.<ref name=Law18>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-18-scoring-runs/ |title=Law 18 \u2013 Scoring runs |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Master Blaster at work.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sachin Tendulkar]] is the only player to have scored one hundred international [[Century (cricket)|centuries]]]]\n\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually \"yes\", \"no\" or \"wait\". More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.<ref name=Law18/> To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground ''en route'' to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batsmen do not need to run.<ref name=Law19>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-19-boundaries/ |title=Law 19 \u2013 Boundaries |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.<ref name=Law18/>\n\nAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team as [[extra (cricket)|extras]] (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: [[no-ball]], a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules;<ref name=Law24>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-24-no-ball/ |title=Law 24 \u2013 No ball |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> [[wide (cricket)|wide]], a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach;<ref name=Law25a>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-25-wide-ball/ |title=Law 25 \u2013 Wide ball |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> [[bye (cricket)|bye]], an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way;<ref name=Law26>{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-26-bye-and-leg-bye/ |title=Law 26 \u2013 Bye and Leg bye |work=Laws of Cricket |publisher=MCC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> [[leg bye]], as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman's body, though not his bat.<ref name=Law26/> If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.<ref name=Law24/><ref name=Law25a/>\n\n==Women's cricket==\n{{main|Women's cricket}}\n[[File:Mithali Raj Truro 2012.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mithali Raj]] of India, is the only player to surpass the 6,000 run mark in [[Women's One Day International cricket]].]]\n[[Women's cricket]] was first recorded in [[Surrey]] in 1745.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/cricket/history-of-cricket/early-cricket |title=ICC History of Cricket (pre-1799) |publisher=ICC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between [[Australia Women cricket team|Australia]] and [[England women's cricket team|England]] in December 1934.<ref name=ICC20C>{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/cricket/history-of-cricket/20th-century |title=ICC History of Cricket (20th century) |publisher=ICC |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> The following year, [[New Zealand Womens cricket team|New Zealand]] women joined them, and in 2007 [[Netherlands women cricket team|Netherlands women]] became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against [[South Africa women cricket team|South Africa women]].

Teams in Test cricket, [[first-class cricket]] and [[club cricket]] wear traditional white uniforms and use red [[cricket ball]]s.]]\nCricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into [[first-class cricket]], [[limited overs cricket]] and, historically, [[single wicket cricket]]. The highest standard is [[Test cricket]] (always written with a capital \"T\") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above). Although the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] in the [[1876-77 Australian cricket season|1876\u201377 Australian season]]; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as [[The Ashes]]. The term \"first-class\", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Cricket |last=Rundell |first=Michael |year=2006 |publisher=A&C Black Publishers Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-7136-7915-1 |page=336 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Vu9cih3u1kC&lpg=PT336&dq=%22dictionary%20of%20cricket%22%20test&pg=PT336#v=onepage&q=%22dictionary%20of%20cricket%22%20test |accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nLimited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day. There are two types: [[List A cricket|List A]] which normally allows fifty overs per team; and [[Twenty20]] in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as [[Limited Overs International]]s (LOI) and [[Twenty20 International]]s (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first [[Cricket World Cup]] took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The first [[Twenty20 World Championship]] was held in 2007. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a \"no result\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/255055.html |title=ICC clarification of limited overs |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/980687.html |title=The first official T20 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nSingle wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.<ref>Major (2007), pp. 155\u2013167 & 404\u2013410.</ref>\n\n==International competitions==\n{{main|International cricket}}\n\nMost international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes a [[Test cricket#Perpetual trophies|perpetual trophy]] is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is [[The Ashes]].\n\nThe ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the [[Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC T20 World Cup]] and [[ICC Champions Trophy]]. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the [[ICC World Test Championship]], had been proposed several times, and its [[2019\u201321 ICC World Test Championship|first instance]] began in 2019. A league competition for ODIs, the [[2020\u201322 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League]], is planned to begin in 2020. The ICC maintains [[ICC Test Championship|Test rankings]], [[ICC ODI Championship|ODI rankings]] and [[ICC T20I Championship|T20 rankings]] systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.\n\nCompetitions for member nations of the ICC with [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate members|Associate status]] include the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], for first-class cricket matches, and the [[World Cricket League]] for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the [[ICC World Cup Qualifier]].\n\n==National competitions==\n{{see also|Category:Domestic cricket competitions}}\n[[File:Yorkshire-CCC-1895.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] in 1895.
