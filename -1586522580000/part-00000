In this episode, the show challenged the contestants to travel from [[Manila]] to [[Sagada]] using a 1973 [[Volkswagen]] combi [[Van (road vehicle)|van]]. The episode won 3rd place in the 38th US International Film and Video Festival Entertainment Category.\n\nThe P2M challenge, the celebration of Extra Challenge's second anniversary, was aired on September 2005.

According to the Islamic organization, Billah Islah, the show offended Muslims because the challengers, [[Ara Mina]], [[Aubrey Miles]], and [[Rufa Mae Quinto]], who are non-Muslims recited the Al-Fatiha, the first chapter in the [[Qur'an]], while being in a Land Cruiser and not wearing proper Muslim attire.\n\nFor this instance, Philippines' MTRCB ([[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]]) has issued the program a stern warning to screen its episodes very carefully before airing it. The incident also caused some of them who rallied to burn the names of the women contestants involved in that certain challenge done at Dubai.\n\nAfter hearing the complaint, Extra Challenge wrote an apology to the Office on Muslim Affairs Undersecretary Datu [[Zamzamin Ampatuan]]. They also clarified that their tour operator requested permission to the Dubai Tourism and Commerce Marketing for using the Qu'ran verse in the challenge.\n\nExtra challenge also issued a public apology, which read:\n\nin [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: {{Cquote|''Kami po sa Extra Challenge ay humihingi ng paumanhin sa mga kababayan nating Muslim tungkol sa episode na ipinalabas kagabi...Hindi po namin intensiyon na gamitin sa maling paraan ang nasabing dasal.
