He is currently signed to [[All Elite Wrestling]] (AEW), where he is part of [[the Dark Order]] stable. \n\nFormerly known as '''Player Uno''', he regularly [[tag team|teamed]] with [[Stu Grayson]] as the [[Super Smash Brothers]] for various [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]] across North America, including Alpha-1 Wrestling, Capital City Championship Combat (C*4), Inter Species Wrestling (ISW), and [[California]]-based [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] (PWG).

At the time, he went under the name \"El PoPo\". On an episode of [[Colt Cabana]]'s podcast, ''The Art of Wrestling'', he explained that the decision to change his name came, when [[El Generico]] wanted to be called Player 1. Uno changed it around and picked the name Uno. He originally planned to learn [[Spanish language|Spanish]] after choosing the name.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tsmradio.com/coltcabana/2012/08/08/aow-107-chicago-live/ | title=AOW 107: Chicago Live | date=2012-08-08 | accessdate=2013-02-23 | work=The Art of Wrestling | publisher=TSM Radio | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002073302/http://tsmradio.com/coltcabana/2012/08/08/aow-107-chicago-live/ | archivedate=2014-10-02 }}</ref>\n\n===International Wrestling Syndicate===\nUno made his debut in the Canadian wrestling promotion [[International Wrestling Syndicate]] (IWS).

The lights went out a second time and when they came back on, masked henchmen surrounded the ring. The Order then attacked all four men. After the attack, the lights went out again and they disappeared.\n\n==Professional wrestling style and persona==\nIn Chikara, Player Uno became popular for basing his gimmick, moveset, and attire around video games, specifically games for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] consoles. One of his former trademarks was his pants, which had an NES controller design on one side; if the \"Pause\" button was pressed, he would stop moving, and if his opponent hit him while he was \"paused\", Player Uno wouldn't react until getting \"unpaused\". He was also famous for wearing gear in the color schemes of characters such as [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], and [[Wario]]. In recent years, Player Uno has stopped using both distinctive traits. In 2015, Dansereau repackaged himself as Evil Uno.\n\n==Personal life==\nDansereau worked as a web specialist for the [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]].<ref name=\"Baines\"/>\n\n==In other media==\nOn December 24, 2012, Uno appeared on a new [[YouTube]] channel called, ''TheNerdSlam''.

The other is a food show called ''Stu's Kitchen'', hosted by Stupefied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlingguerrilla.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3992 | title=Player Uno here!

At the time, he went under the name \"El PoPo\". On an episode of [[Colt Cabana]]'s podcast, ''The Art of Wrestling'', he explained that the decision to change his name came, when [[El Generico]] wanted to be called Player 1. Uno changed it around and picked the name Uno. He originally planned to learn [[Spanish language|Spanish]] after choosing the name.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tsmradio.com/coltcabana/2012/08/08/aow-107-chicago-live/ | title=AOW 107: Chicago Live | date=2012-08-08 | accessdate=2013-02-23 | work=The Art of Wrestling | publisher=TSM Radio | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002073302/http://tsmradio.com/coltcabana/2012/08/08/aow-107-chicago-live/ | archivedate=2014-10-02 }}</ref>\n\n===International Wrestling Syndicate===\nUno made his debut in the Canadian wrestling promotion [[International Wrestling Syndicate]] (IWS).

One of his former trademarks was his pants, which had an NES controller design on one side; if the \"Pause\" button was pressed, he would stop moving, and if his opponent hit him while he was \"paused\", Player Uno wouldn't react until getting \"unpaused\". He was also famous for wearing gear in the color schemes of characters such as [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], and [[Wario]]. In recent years, Player Uno has stopped using both distinctive traits. In 2015, Dansereau repackaged himself as Evil Uno.\n\n==Personal life==\nDansereau worked as a web specialist for the [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]].<ref name=\"Baines\"/>\n\n==In other media==\nOn December 24, 2012, Uno appeared on a new [[YouTube]] channel called, ''TheNerdSlam''.

In that war, Atat\u00fcrk led the Turkish nationalists to defeat the combined armies of the signatories of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, including the remnants of the Ottoman Empire.

However, after the American Senate rejected the Armenian mandate, its only hope was its inclusion in the treaty by the influential Greek prime minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].<ref>{{Cite journal| first=Herbert Adams|last=Gibbons|title=Venizelos|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=36| issue=3|pages=519|doi=10.2307/2142304}}</ref>\n\n==Non-territorial provisions==\n[[File :WholeRegionSevres.gif|thumb|250px|An original map from 1920 illustrating the Treaty of S\u00e8vres region]]\n\nThe treaty imposed a number of territorial losses on Turkey.  It also had a number of provisions which applied to the territory recognised as belonging to Turkey.\n\n===Financial restrictions===\nThe Allied Powers were to control the Ottoman Empire's finances. The financial control included approving and supervising the national budget, implementing financial laws and regulations, and totally controlling the [[Ottoman Bank]]. The [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] (instituted in 1881) was redesigned to include only British, French and Italian bond holders. The Ottoman debt problem dated back to the time of the [[Crimean War]] (1854\u201356), during which the Ottoman Empire had borrowed money from abroad, mainly from France. Also the [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], which had been abolished in 1914 by [[Talaat Pasha]], were restored.\n\nThe Empire was required to grant freedom of transit to persons, goods, vessels, etc., passing through her territory; and goods in transit were to be free of all customs duties. Future changes within the tax system, the customs system, internal and external loans, import and export duties, and concessions could not be implemented without the consent of the financial commission of the Allied Powers. To forestall the economic re-penetration of Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Bulgaria the treaty demanded that the Empire liquidate the property of citizens of those countries living within its territories. This public liquidation was to be organized by the Reparations Commission. Property rights of the [[Baghdad Railway]] passed out of German control.\n\n===Military restrictions===\nThe [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Army]] was to be restricted to 50,700 men; the [[Ottoman Navy]] could only maintain seven [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]]s and six [[torpedo boat]]s; and the Ottoman State was prohibited from creating an air force. The treaty included an inter-allied commission of control and organisation to supervise the execution of the military clauses.\n\n===International trials===\n{{See also|Malta Tribunals}}\n\nThe treaty required determination of those responsible for the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Article 230 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres required that the Ottoman Empire \"hand over to the Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the Ottoman Empire on August 1, 1914.\" However, the [[inter-allied tribunal attempt]] to prosecute war criminals as demanded by the Treaty of S\u00e8vres was eventually suspended; and the men who orchestrated the genocide escaped prosecution and traveled relatively freely throughout [[Europe]] and [[Central Asia]].<ref name=samantha>[[Samantha Power|Power, Samantha]]. ''[[A Problem from Hell]]'', p. 16\u201317. Basic Books, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Foreign Zones of Influence in Turkey===\n\n====France (Zone of Influence)====\nWithin the territory retained by Turkey under the treaty, France received Syria and neighbouring parts of Southeastern [[Anatolia]], including [[Antep]], [[Urfa]] and [[Mardin]]. [[Cilicia]] including [[Adana]], [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] and large portions of East-Central Anatolia all the way up north to [[Sivas]] and [[Tokat]] were declared a zone of French influence.\n\n====Greece (Zone of Smyrna)====\n[[File: Greekhistory.GIF|thumb|200px|The expansion of Greece from 1832\u20131947, showing in yellow territories awarded to Greece by the Treaty of S\u00e8vres but lost in 1923]]\n\nThe Greek government administered the [[occupation of Smyrna]] from 21 May 1919.  A [[protectorate]] was established on 30 July 1922. The treaty transferred \"the exercise of her rights of sovereignty to a local parliament\" but left the region within the Ottoman Empire. According to the provisions of the treaty, Smyrna was to be administered by a local parliament, with a plebiscite after five years to vote on whether Smyrna's citizens wished to join Greece or remain in the Ottoman Empire. This plebiscite would be overseen by the League of Nations. The treaty accepted Greek administration of the Smyrna enclave, but the area remained under Turkish sovereignty. To protect the Christian population from attacks by the Turkish irregulars, the Greek army expanded its juridiction also to nearby cities creating the so called \"Smyrna zone\".\n\nTurkish nationalist leader [[Mustafa Kemal]] demanded that the Turks fight against the Greeks trying to take the land that had been held by the Ottoman Empire and given to Greece in this treaty. This started the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)]], which resulted in a Turkish victory.\n\n====Italy (Zone of Influence)====\n[[Italy]] was formally given possession of the [[Dodecanese Islands]] (already under Italian occupation since the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912). This was done despite the Treaty of [[Ouchy]] according to which Italy should have returned the islands to the Ottoman Empire. Large portions of Southern and West-Central [[Anatolia]], including the port city of [[Antalya]] and the historic Seljuk capital of [[Konya]], were declared an Italian zone of influence. Antalya Province had been promised by the Triple Entente to Italy in the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/london1915.htm|title=First World War.com - Primary Documents - Treaty of London, 26 April 1915|author=|date=|work=FirstWorldWar.com|access-date=25 January 2017}}</ref> and the Italian colonial authorities wished the zone to become an [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colony]] under the name of [[Lycia]].<ref>Franco Antonicelli, ''Trent'anni di storia italiana, 1915-1945'', Torino, Mondadori Editore, 1961. p. 25</ref>\n\n==Territorial provisions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!colspan=8| States <br/>Square miles (km\u00b2)\n|-\n|1914\n|colspan=8| Ottoman Empire {{convert|613,724|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|1918 (S\u00e8vres Treaty)  <br/>\n|Ottoman Empire <br/>{{convert|174,900|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|Wilsonian Armenia <br/>{{convert|60,000|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|Syria <br/>{{convert|136,000|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|Mesopotamia <br/>{{convert|143,000|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|Hejaz <br/>{{convert|100,000|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|Asir <br/>{{convert|35,000|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|Yemen <br/>{{convert|75,000|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|}\n\n===Zone of the Straits===\n[[File: StraitsSevres.gif|thumb|200px|1920 map of Western Turkey, showing the Zone of the Straits in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]\n\nA Zone of the Straits was proposed, to include the [[Bosphorus]], the Dardanelles and the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Navigation was to be open in the Dardanelles in times of peace and war alike to all vessels of commerce and war, no matter under what flag. This in effect would lead to internationalization of the waters. The waters were not to be subject to blockade, nor could any act of war be committed there, except in enforcing the decisions of the League of Nations.\n\n===Free Zones===\nCertain ports were to be declared to be of international importance. The League of Nations insisted on complete freedom and absolute equality in treatment at these ports, particularly regarding charges and facilities, to ensure that economic provisions in commercially strategic places were carried out. These regions were to be called \"free zones\". The ports were [[Istanbul]] from [[Ye\u015filk\u00f6y|San Stefano]] to [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace|Dolmabah\u00e7e]], [[Haydarpa\u015fa|Haidar-Pasha]], [[Izmir|Smyrna]], [[Iskanderun|Alexandretta]], [[Haifa]], [[Basra]], [[Trabzon]], and [[Batum]].\n\n===Thrace===\nEastern Thrace (up to the [[\u00c7atalca#Modern period|Chatalja line]]), the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, and the islands of the [[Sea of Marmara]] were ceded to Greece. The waters surrounding these islands were declared international territory and left to the administration of the \"Zone of the Straits\".\n\n===Kurdistan===\nThe [[Kurdistan]] region, including [[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul Province]], was scheduled to have a referendum to decide its fate.\n\nThere was no general agreement among Kurds on what the borders of Kurdistan should be, because of the disparity between the areas of Kurdish settlement and the political and administrative boundaries of the region.<ref>Hakan \u00d6zo\u011flu, ''Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries'' p. 38. SUNY Press, 2004</ref> The outlines of Kurdistan as an entity were proposed in 1919 by [[\u015eerif Pasha]], who represented the [[Society for the Ascension of Kurdistan]] (''K\u00fcrdistan Teali Cemiyeti'') at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. He defined the region's boundaries as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The frontiers of Turkish Kurdistan, from an ethnographical point of view, begin in the north at [[Ziven]], on the Caucasian frontier, and continue westwards to [[Erzurum]], [[Erzincan]], [[Kemah, Turkey|Kemah]], [[Arapgir]], [[Besni]] and Divick ([[Divri\u011fi|Divrik]]?); in the south they follow the line from [[Harran]], [[Sinjar Mountains]], Tel Asfar, [[Erbil]], [[Sulaymaniyah|S\u00fcleymaniye]], Akk-el-man, [[Sinne]]; in the east, Ravandiz, [[Ba\u015fkale]], [[Vezirkale]], that is to say the frontier of [[Persia]] as far as [[Mount Ararat]].<ref>\u015eerif Pasha, ''Memorandum on the Claims of the Kurd People'', 1919</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis caused controversy among other Kurdish nationalists, as it excluded the [[Van Province|Van region]] (possibly as a sop to [[Armenian people|Armenian]] claims to that region). [[Emin Ali Bedir Khan]] proposed an alternative map which included Van and an outlet to the sea via Turkey's present [[Hatay Province]].<ref>Hakan \u00d6zo\u011flu, ''ibid'' p. 40</ref> Amid a joint declaration by Kurdish and Armenian delegations, Kurdish claims to [[Erzurum vilayet]] and [[Sasun|Sassoun]] ([[Sason]]) were dropped, but arguments for sovereignty over A\u011fr\u0131 and Mu\u015f remained.<ref>M. Kalman, ''Bat\u0131 Ermenistan ve Jenosid'' p. 185, Istanbul, 1994.</ref>\n\nNeither of these proposals was endorsed by the treaty of S\u00e8vres, which outlined a truncated Kurdistan, located on what is now Turkish territory (leaving out the Kurds of [[Iran]], British-controlled [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]] and French-controlled [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria]]).<ref>[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3229m63b Arin, Kubilay Yado, ''Turkey and the Kurds \u2013 From War to Reconciliation?'' UC Berkeley Center for Right Wing Studies Working Paper Series, March 26, 2015.]</ref> However, no plan for an independent Kurdistan, truncated or otherwise, was ever implemented, since the Treaty of S\u00e8vres was replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]]. The current Iraq\u2013Turkey border was agreed upon in July 1926.\n\nArticle 63 granted explicitly full safeguard and protection to the [[Assyrian people|Assyro-Chaldean]] minority. This  proviso was dropped in the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\n===Armenia===\n[[File: First republic of Armenia-west borders by Woodrow Wilson.png|290px|thumb|right|The First Republic of Armenia, with the western borders defined by [[Woodrow Wilson]]]]\n\nArmenia was recognized as an established state. (Section VI \"Armenia\", articles 88-93).\n:''See also:'' [[Wilsonian Armenia]] and [[First Republic of Armenia]]\n\n===British Mandate of Iraq===\n{{main|Mandatory Iraq}}\n\nThe details in the treaty regarding the [[British Mandate of Iraq]] were completed on 25 April 1920 at the [[San Remo conference]]. The oil concession in this region was given to the British-controlled [[Turkish Petroleum Company]] (TPC) which had held concessionary rights to the [[Mosul Vilayet|Mosul Province]].  British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions over the new oil concession. The League of Nations voted on the disposition of Mosul, and the Iraqis feared that, without British support, Iraq would lose the area. In March 1925, the TPC was renamed the \"[[Iraq Petroleum Company]]\" (IPC), and granted a full and complete concession for a period of 75 years.\n\n===British Mandate for Palestine===\n{{Main|Mandatory Palestine}}\nThe three principles of the British [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] regarding [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were adopted in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres:\n\n:ARTICLE 95: The High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on 2 November 1917 by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\n\n===French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon===\n{{Main|French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon}}\n\nThe French Mandate was settled at the San Remo Conference. Comprising the region between the [[Euphrates River]] and the [[Syrian Desert]] on the east, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on the west, and extending from the [[Alma-Dag|Nur]] Mountains in the north to Egypt in the south; comprising an area of territory about {{convert|60000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size with a population of about 3,000,000, including the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]] and an enlarged [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]], which were later reassigned under a [[League of Nations Mandate]]. The region was divided under the French into four governments as follows: Government of Aleppo from the Euphrates region to the Mediterranean; Great Lebanon extending from Tripoli to Palestine; Damascus, including Damascus, Hama, Hems, and the Hauran; and the country of Mount Arisarieh. [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal ibn Husayn]], who had been proclaimed [[king of Syria]] by a [[Syrian National Congress]] in Damascus in March 1920, was [[Franco-Syrian War|ejected by the French in July]] of the same year. The following year he became king of Iraq.\n\n===Kingdom of Hejaz===\nThe [[Kingdom of Hejaz]] on the Arabian Peninsula was granted international recognition. It had an estimated area of {{convert|100000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, and a population of about 750,000. The biggest cities were the Holy Places of Makka, with a population of 80,000, and Medina, with a population of 40,000. Under the Ottomans it had been the [[vilayet of Hejaz]], but during the war became an independent kingdom under British influence.\n\n==Fate of the Treaty==<!-- the section is linked in the intro-->\nThe terms of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres imposed on the Ottoman Empire were far more severe than those imposed on the German Empire by the Treaty of Versailles.<ref>Isaiah Friedman: ''British Miscalculations: The Rise of Muslim Nationalism, 1918\u20131925'', Transaction Publishers, 2012, {{ISBN|1412847494}}, page 217.</ref><ref>Michael Mandelbaum: ''The Fate of Nations: The Search for National Security in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|9780521357906}}, page 61 (footnote 55).</ref> France, Italy, and Great Britain had secretly begun planning the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] as early as 1915. The open negotiations covered a period of more than fifteen months, beginning at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. They continued at the [[Conference of London (February 1920)|Conference of London]], and took definite shape only after the premiers' meeting at the [[San Remo conference]] in April 1920. The delay occurred because the powers could not come to an agreement which, in turn, hinged on the outcome of the [[Turkish national movement]]. The Treaty of S\u00e8vres was annulled in the course of the Turkish War of Independence, and the parties signed and ratified the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 and 1924. Not all signatories of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres were parties to the Treaty of Lausanne, nor was there a valid international act of annulment of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Therefore, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres remains a valid instrument of international law, although the Lausanne signatories have chosen not to implement it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhile the treaty was under discussion, the Turkish national movement under [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] split with the monarchy based in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]],<ref>Finkel, Caroline, ''Osman's Dream'', (Basic Books, 2005), 57; \"Istanbul was only adopted as the city's official name in 1930.\".</ref> and set up a [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] in Ankara in April 1920.\n\nOn 18 October, the government of [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] was replaced by a provisional one under [[Ahmed Tevfik Pasha]] as [[Grand Vizier]], who announced an intention to convene the Senate to ratify the Treaty, provided that national unity was achieved. This required seeking the cooperation of Mustafa Kemal. The latter expressed disdain for the Treaty and started a military assault. As a result, the Turkish Government issued a note to the Entente that the ratification of the Treaty was impossible at that time.<ref>''Current History'', Volume 13, New York Times Co., 1921, \"Dividing the Former Turkish Empire\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=jbcqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA443 pp. 441-444] (retrieved October 26, 2010)</ref>\n\nEventually, Mustafa Kemal succeeded in his [[Turkish War of Independence|fight for Turkish independence]] and forced the former wartime Allies to return to the negotiating table.\n\nAside from Mustafa Kemal's armed opposition to the treaty in Anatolia, Arabs in Syria were unwilling to accept French rule, the Turks around Mosul attacked the British, and Arabs were up in arms against British rule in Baghdad. There was also disorder in Egypt.\n\n==Subsequent Treaties==\n{{Main|Turkish War of Independence|Treaty of Kars|Treaty of Lausanne}}\n\nIn the course of the Turkish War of Independence, the [[Turkish Army]] successfully fought [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greek]], [[Turkish-Armenian War|Armenian]], and French forces and secured the independence of a territory similar to that of present-day Turkey, as was aimed at by the [[Misak-\u0131 Milli]].\n\nThe Turkish national movement developed its own international relations with the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] with [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] on 16 March 1921, the [[Accord of Ankara]] with [[France]] putting an end to the [[Franco-Turkish War]], the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] with the Armenians, and the [[Treaty of Kars]] which fixed the Eastern borders.\n\nHostilities with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] over the neutral zone of the Straits were narrowly avoided in the [[Chanak Crisis]] of September 1922, when the [[Armistice of Mudanya]] was concluded on 11 October, leading the former [[Allies of World War I]] to return to the negotiating table with the Turks in November 1922.  This culminated in 1923 in the Treaty of Lausanne, which replaced the Treaty of S\u00e8vres and restored a large territory in Anatolia and Thrace to the Turks. Under the Treaty of Lausanne France and Italy only had areas of economic interaction rather than zones of influence. Constantinople was not made an international city. And a demilitarized zone between Turkey and Bulgaria was established.<ref>Bendeck, Whitney. \"Pyrrhic Victory Achieved.\" Lecture, Europe in the Total Age of War, Florida State University, Tallahassee, October 11, 2016.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|1920s|Turkey|Europe|Politics|Law|World War I}}\n\n* [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]\n* [[Treaty of Versailles]]\n* [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]\n* [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]\n* [[Treaty of Trianon]]\n* [[Minority Treaties]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1920/TS0011.pdf Treaty of Peace between the British Empire and Allied Powers and Turkey]{{dead link|date=May 2019}} UK Treaty Series No. 11 of 1920; [[Command paper]] Cmd.964\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David | authorlink = David Fromkin |year=1989 |title=[[A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East, 1914\u20131922]] |location=New York |publisher=H.

It also had a number of provisions which applied to the territory recognised as belonging to Turkey.\n\n===Financial restrictions===\nThe Allied Powers were to control the Ottoman Empire's finances. The financial control included approving and supervising the national budget, implementing financial laws and regulations, and totally controlling the [[Ottoman Bank]]. The [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] (instituted in 1881) was redesigned to include only British, French and Italian bond holders. The Ottoman debt problem dated back to the time of the [[Crimean War]] (1854\u201356), during which the Ottoman Empire had borrowed money from abroad, mainly from France. Also the [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], which had been abolished in 1914 by [[Talaat Pasha]], were restored.\n\nThe Empire was required to grant freedom of transit to persons, goods, vessels, etc., passing through her territory; and goods in transit were to be free of all customs duties. Future changes within the tax system, the customs system, internal and external loans, import and export duties, and concessions could not be implemented without the consent of the financial commission of the Allied Powers. To forestall the economic re-penetration of Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Bulgaria the treaty demanded that the Empire liquidate the property of citizens of those countries living within its territories. This public liquidation was to be organized by the Reparations Commission. Property rights of the [[Baghdad Railway]] passed out of German control.\n\n===Military restrictions===\nThe [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Army]] was to be restricted to 50,700 men; the [[Ottoman Navy]] could only maintain seven [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]]s and six [[torpedo boat]]s; and the Ottoman State was prohibited from creating an air force. The treaty included an inter-allied commission of control and organisation to supervise the execution of the military clauses.\n\n===International trials===\n{{See also|Malta Tribunals}}\n\nThe treaty required determination of those responsible for the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Article 230 of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres required that the Ottoman Empire \"hand over to the Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the Ottoman Empire on August 1, 1914.\" However, the [[inter-allied tribunal attempt]] to prosecute war criminals as demanded by the Treaty of S\u00e8vres was eventually suspended; and the men who orchestrated the genocide escaped prosecution and traveled relatively freely throughout [[Europe]] and [[Central Asia]].<ref name=samantha>[[Samantha Power|Power, Samantha]]. ''[[A Problem from Hell]]'', p. 16\u201317. Basic Books, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Foreign Zones of Influence in Turkey===\n\n====France (Zone of Influence)====\nWithin the territory retained by Turkey under the treaty, France received Syria and neighbouring parts of Southeastern [[Anatolia]], including [[Antep]], [[Urfa]] and [[Mardin]]. [[Cilicia]] including [[Adana]], [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] and large portions of East-Central Anatolia all the way up north to [[Sivas]] and [[Tokat]] were declared a zone of French influence.\n\n====Greece (Zone of Smyrna)====\n[[File: Greekhistory.GIF|thumb|200px|The expansion of Greece from 1832\u20131947, showing in yellow territories awarded to Greece by the Treaty of S\u00e8vres but lost in 1923]]\n\nThe Greek government administered the [[occupation of Smyrna]] from 21 May 1919.  A [[protectorate]] was established on 30 July 1922. The treaty transferred \"the exercise of her rights of sovereignty to a local parliament\" but left the region within the Ottoman Empire. According to the provisions of the treaty, Smyrna was to be administered by a local parliament, with a plebiscite after five years to vote on whether Smyrna's citizens wished to join Greece or remain in the Ottoman Empire. This plebiscite would be overseen by the League of Nations. The treaty accepted Greek administration of the Smyrna enclave, but the area remained under Turkish sovereignty. To protect the Christian population from attacks by the Turkish irregulars, the Greek army expanded its juridiction also to nearby cities creating the so called \"Smyrna zone\".\n\nTurkish nationalist leader [[Mustafa Kemal]] demanded that the Turks fight against the Greeks trying to take the land that had been held by the Ottoman Empire and given to Greece in this treaty. This started the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)]], which resulted in a Turkish victory.\n\n====Italy (Zone of Influence)====\n[[Italy]] was formally given possession of the [[Dodecanese Islands]] (already under Italian occupation since the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912). This was done despite the Treaty of [[Ouchy]] according to which Italy should have returned the islands to the Ottoman Empire. Large portions of Southern and West-Central [[Anatolia]], including the port city of [[Antalya]] and the historic Seljuk capital of [[Konya]], were declared an Italian zone of influence.

Navigation was to be open in the Dardanelles in times of peace and war alike to all vessels of commerce and war, no matter under what flag. This in effect would lead to internationalization of the waters. The waters were not to be subject to blockade, nor could any act of war be committed there, except in enforcing the decisions of the League of Nations.\n\n===Free Zones===\nCertain ports were to be declared to be of international importance. The League of Nations insisted on complete freedom and absolute equality in treatment at these ports, particularly regarding charges and facilities, to ensure that economic provisions in commercially strategic places were carried out. These regions were to be called \"free zones\". The ports were [[Istanbul]] from [[Ye\u015filk\u00f6y|San Stefano]] to [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace|Dolmabah\u00e7e]], [[Haydarpa\u015fa|Haidar-Pasha]], [[Izmir|Smyrna]], [[Iskanderun|Alexandretta]], [[Haifa]], [[Basra]], [[Trabzon]], and [[Batum]].\n\n===Thrace===\nEastern Thrace (up to the [[\u00c7atalca#Modern period|Chatalja line]]), the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, and the islands of the [[Sea of Marmara]] were ceded to Greece. The waters surrounding these islands were declared international territory and left to the administration of the \"Zone of the Straits\".\n\n===Kurdistan===\nThe [[Kurdistan]] region, including [[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul Province]], was scheduled to have a referendum to decide its fate.\n\nThere was no general agreement among Kurds on what the borders of Kurdistan should be, because of the disparity between the areas of Kurdish settlement and the political and administrative boundaries of the region.<ref>Hakan \u00d6zo\u011flu, ''Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries'' p. 38. SUNY Press, 2004</ref> The outlines of Kurdistan as an entity were proposed in 1919 by [[\u015eerif Pasha]], who represented the [[Society for the Ascension of Kurdistan]] (''K\u00fcrdistan Teali Cemiyeti'') at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. He defined the region's boundaries as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The frontiers of Turkish Kurdistan, from an ethnographical point of view, begin in the north at [[Ziven]], on the Caucasian frontier, and continue westwards to [[Erzurum]], [[Erzincan]], [[Kemah, Turkey|Kemah]], [[Arapgir]], [[Besni]] and Divick ([[Divri\u011fi|Divrik]]?); in the south they follow the line from [[Harran]], [[Sinjar Mountains]], Tel Asfar, [[Erbil]], [[Sulaymaniyah|S\u00fcleymaniye]], Akk-el-man, [[Sinne]]; in the east, Ravandiz, [[Ba\u015fkale]], [[Vezirkale]], that is to say the frontier of [[Persia]] as far as [[Mount Ararat]].<ref>\u015eerif Pasha, ''Memorandum on the Claims of the Kurd People'', 1919</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis caused controversy among other Kurdish nationalists, as it excluded the [[Van Province|Van region]] (possibly as a sop to [[Armenian people|Armenian]] claims to that region). [[Emin Ali Bedir Khan]] proposed an alternative map which included Van and an outlet to the sea via Turkey's present [[Hatay Province]].<ref>Hakan \u00d6zo\u011flu, ''ibid'' p. 40</ref> Amid a joint declaration by Kurdish and Armenian delegations, Kurdish claims to [[Erzurum vilayet]] and [[Sasun|Sassoun]] ([[Sason]]) were dropped, but arguments for sovereignty over A\u011fr\u0131 and Mu\u015f remained.<ref>M. Kalman, ''Bat\u0131 Ermenistan ve Jenosid'' p. 185, Istanbul, 1994.</ref>\n\nNeither of these proposals was endorsed by the treaty of S\u00e8vres, which outlined a truncated Kurdistan, located on what is now Turkish territory (leaving out the Kurds of [[Iran]], British-controlled [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]] and French-controlled [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria]]).<ref>[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3229m63b Arin, Kubilay Yado, ''Turkey and the Kurds \u2013 From War to Reconciliation?'' UC Berkeley Center for Right Wing Studies Working Paper Series, March 26, 2015.]</ref> However, no plan for an independent Kurdistan, truncated or otherwise, was ever implemented, since the Treaty of S\u00e8vres was replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]]. The current Iraq\u2013Turkey border was agreed upon in July 1926.\n\nArticle 63 granted explicitly full safeguard and protection to the [[Assyrian people|Assyro-Chaldean]] minority. This  proviso was dropped in the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\n===Armenia===\n[[File: First republic of Armenia-west borders by Woodrow Wilson.png|290px|thumb|right|The First Republic of Armenia, with the western borders defined by [[Woodrow Wilson]]]]\n\nArmenia was recognized as an established state. (Section VI \"Armenia\", articles 88-93).\n:''See also:'' [[Wilsonian Armenia]] and [[First Republic of Armenia]]\n\n===British Mandate of Iraq===\n{{main|Mandatory Iraq}}\n\nThe details in the treaty regarding the [[British Mandate of Iraq]] were completed on 25 April 1920 at the [[San Remo conference]]. The oil concession in this region was given to the British-controlled [[Turkish Petroleum Company]] (TPC) which had held concessionary rights to the [[Mosul Vilayet|Mosul Province]].  British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions over the new oil concession. The League of Nations voted on the disposition of Mosul, and the Iraqis feared that, without British support, Iraq would lose the area. In March 1925, the TPC was renamed the \"[[Iraq Petroleum Company]]\" (IPC), and granted a full and complete concession for a period of 75 years.\n\n===British Mandate for Palestine===\n{{Main|Mandatory Palestine}}\nThe three principles of the British [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] regarding [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were adopted in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres:\n\n:ARTICLE 95: The High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on 2 November 1917 by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\n\n===French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon===\n{{Main|French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon}}\n\nThe French Mandate was settled at the San Remo Conference. Comprising the region between the [[Euphrates River]] and the [[Syrian Desert]] on the east, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on the west, and extending from the [[Alma-Dag|Nur]] Mountains in the north to Egypt in the south; comprising an area of territory about {{convert|60000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size with a population of about 3,000,000, including the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]] and an enlarged [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]], which were later reassigned under a [[League of Nations Mandate]]. The region was divided under the French into four governments as follows: Government of Aleppo from the Euphrates region to the Mediterranean; Great Lebanon extending from Tripoli to Palestine; Damascus, including Damascus, Hama, Hems, and the Hauran; and the country of Mount Arisarieh. [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal ibn Husayn]], who had been proclaimed [[king of Syria]] by a [[Syrian National Congress]] in Damascus in March 1920, was [[Franco-Syrian War|ejected by the French in July]] of the same year. The following year he became king of Iraq.\n\n===Kingdom of Hejaz===\nThe [[Kingdom of Hejaz]] on the Arabian Peninsula was granted international recognition. It had an estimated area of {{convert|100000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, and a population of about 750,000. The biggest cities were the Holy Places of Makka, with a population of 80,000, and Medina, with a population of 40,000. Under the Ottomans it had been the [[vilayet of Hejaz]], but during the war became an independent kingdom under British influence.\n\n==Fate of the Treaty==<!-- the section is linked in the intro-->\nThe terms of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres imposed on the Ottoman Empire were far more severe than those imposed on the German Empire by the Treaty of Versailles.<ref>Isaiah Friedman: ''British Miscalculations: The Rise of Muslim Nationalism, 1918\u20131925'', Transaction Publishers, 2012, {{ISBN|1412847494}}, page 217.</ref><ref>Michael Mandelbaum: ''The Fate of Nations: The Search for National Security in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|9780521357906}}, page 61 (footnote 55).</ref> France, Italy, and Great Britain had secretly begun planning the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] as early as 1915. The open negotiations covered a period of more than fifteen months, beginning at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. They continued at the [[Conference of London (February 1920)|Conference of London]], and took definite shape only after the premiers' meeting at the [[San Remo conference]] in April 1920. The delay occurred because the powers could not come to an agreement which, in turn, hinged on the outcome of the [[Turkish national movement]]. The Treaty of S\u00e8vres was annulled in the course of the Turkish War of Independence, and the parties signed and ratified the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 and 1924. Not all signatories of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres were parties to the Treaty of Lausanne, nor was there a valid international act of annulment of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Therefore, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres remains a valid instrument of international law, although the Lausanne signatories have chosen not to implement it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhile the treaty was under discussion, the Turkish national movement under [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] split with the monarchy based in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]],<ref>Finkel, Caroline, ''Osman's Dream'', (Basic Books, 2005), 57; \"Istanbul was only adopted as the city's official name in 1930.\".</ref> and set up a [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] in Ankara in April 1920.\n\nOn 18 October, the government of [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] was replaced by a provisional one under [[Ahmed Tevfik Pasha]] as [[Grand Vizier]], who announced an intention to convene the Senate to ratify the Treaty, provided that national unity was achieved. This required seeking the cooperation of Mustafa Kemal. The latter expressed disdain for the Treaty and started a military assault. As a result, the Turkish Government issued a note to the Entente that the ratification of the Treaty was impossible at that time.<ref>''Current History'', Volume 13, New York Times Co., 1921, \"Dividing the Former Turkish Empire\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=jbcqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA443 pp. 441-444] (retrieved October 26, 2010)</ref>\n\nEventually, Mustafa Kemal succeeded in his [[Turkish War of Independence|fight for Turkish independence]] and forced the former wartime Allies to return to the negotiating table.\n\nAside from Mustafa Kemal's armed opposition to the treaty in Anatolia, Arabs in Syria were unwilling to accept French rule, the Turks around Mosul attacked the British, and Arabs were up in arms against British rule in Baghdad. There was also disorder in Egypt.\n\n==Subsequent Treaties==\n{{Main|Turkish War of Independence|Treaty of Kars|Treaty of Lausanne}}\n\nIn the course of the Turkish War of Independence, the [[Turkish Army]] successfully fought [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greek]], [[Turkish-Armenian War|Armenian]], and French forces and secured the independence of a territory similar to that of present-day Turkey, as was aimed at by the [[Misak-\u0131 Milli]].\n\nThe Turkish national movement developed its own international relations with the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] with [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] on 16 March 1921, the [[Accord of Ankara]] with [[France]] putting an end to the [[Franco-Turkish War]], the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] with the Armenians, and the [[Treaty of Kars]] which fixed the Eastern borders.\n\nHostilities with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] over the neutral zone of the Straits were narrowly avoided in the [[Chanak Crisis]] of September 1922, when the [[Armistice of Mudanya]] was concluded on 11 October, leading the former [[Allies of World War I]] to return to the negotiating table with the Turks in November 1922.  This culminated in 1923 in the Treaty of Lausanne, which replaced the Treaty of S\u00e8vres and restored a large territory in Anatolia and Thrace to the Turks. Under the Treaty of Lausanne France and Italy only had areas of economic interaction rather than zones of influence. Constantinople was not made an international city. And a demilitarized zone between Turkey and Bulgaria was established.<ref>Bendeck, Whitney. \"Pyrrhic Victory Achieved.\" Lecture, Europe in the Total Age of War, Florida State University, Tallahassee, October 11, 2016.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|1920s|Turkey|Europe|Politics|Law|World War I}}\n\n* [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]\n* [[Treaty of Versailles]]\n* [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]\n* [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]\n* [[Treaty of Trianon]]\n* [[Minority Treaties]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1920/TS0011.pdf Treaty of Peace between the British Empire and Allied Powers and Turkey]{{dead link|date=May 2019}} UK Treaty Series No. 11 of 1920; [[Command paper]] Cmd.964\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David | authorlink = David Fromkin |year=1989 |title=[[A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East, 1914\u20131922]] |location=New York |publisher=H.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells.\n\nCharacteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref>\n\nILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood. They are particularly abundant at mucosal surfaces, playing a key role in mucosal immunity and [[homeostasis]].\n\nBased on the difference in developmental pathways, phenotype, and signalling molecules produced, in 2013, ILCs were divided into three groups: 1, 2 and 3, however, after further investigation, we now appreciate five distinct subsets within these groups: [[natural killer cell|NK cells]], ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and LTi cells.<ref name=\"SpitsArtis2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Spits|first1=Hergen|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=Gerard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.

Once matured, the ILCs release cytokines. The classification of ILCs is therefore based on the differences in the transcription factor and cytokine profiles associated with the development and function of the different ILC subtypes.<ref name=\"KloseKiss2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Klose|first1=Christoph S.

ILC1s, are non- cytotoxic or weakly cytotoxic, tissue resident cells, functioning in the defence against infections with viruses and certain [[bacteria]]. \n\nDue to ILC1s and NK cells having both common and uncommon features, the classification of ILC1s has been problematic.

ILC1s and NK cells can also produce [[Tumour necrosis factor alpha|TNF- \u03b1]], depending on their molecule expression. \n\nILC1s and NK cells have some phenotypic markers in common, including: [[KLRB1|NK1.1]] in mice, and NCRs such as [[NCR2|NKp44]] and [[NCR1|NKp46]], in both humans and mice.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> <ref name=\"VivierArtis2018\"/> They also have differences in phenotypic markers, including expression of [[Interleukin-7 receptor-\u03b1|CD127]] in human ILC1s, which is not present on all NK cells.

They are a major early source of [[Interleukin 13|IL-13]], which can activate T cells and induce physiological responses that will help expel a parasite. These physiological responses include stimulating [[goblet cell]] mucus secretion and contraction of smooth muscle. In addition, they secrete signals that recruit and activate mast cells and [[eosinophils]], and which stimulate B cell proliferation. They also secrete [[Amphiregulin]], a member of the epidermal growth factor family, that stimulates tissue repair.

Their contribution to this signaling appears to be comparable to that of T cells. In response to [[allergen]] exposure in the lungs, ILC2s produce IL-13, a necessary cytokine in the pathogenesis of allergic reactions. This response appears to be independent of T and B cells. Further, allergic responses that resemble asthma-like symptoms have been induced in mice that lack T and B cells using IL-33.

Often these had dubious prospects, and turned out to be fraudulent schemes or run by people later accused of fraud. Sherman's associates felt he was often too generous and trusting with them, failing to do proper [[due diligence]]. \"He always saw the best in people,\" an unidentified longtime friend told ''[[MacLean's]]''. \"Which wasn't a great thing all the time.\"<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nA yacht-chartering company he put money into turned out to be a fraud that had never bought any yachts.

The two produced the Cheetah Power Surge [[energy drink]] and started [[Steelback Brewery]]; when D'Angelo Brands went [[bankruptcy in Canada|bankrupt]] in 2007, Sherman lost CAN$100 million. He put his son in charge of the company, and continued backing D'Angelo's next venture, filmmaking, even after D'Angelo was arrested on [[sexual assault]] and [[obstruction of justice]] charges, later dropped, in 2009. Sherman's money financed all eight films D'Angelo made through 2013.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nIn the late 2010s, Sherman worked with another man later convicted of fraud, Shaun Rootenberg. The two had been introduced by a mutual friend, Myron Gottlieb, cofounder of [[Cineplex Odeon]], who had met Rootenberg in prison following his conviction for fraud in the collapse of [[Livent]].

Under [[Taxation in Canada|Canadian tax law]], this entitled him to an equivalent tax credit. The foundations were then allowed to loan him back money, and did, loaning him almost the total of the $6 million he gave, an unusually high amount for Canadian private foundations that loaned out their money.

He sought to manipulate our system to enrich himself and impoverish Canadian patients who used his drugs\", he said.<ref name=comte /> He accused Sherman of crossing intellectual property rights ethical lines to \"fight as many as 100 battles at a time in court to challenge drug patents and make way for Apotex's generic prescriptions\" with little end benefit to consumers.<ref name=comte /><ref name=\"macleans.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/barry-and-honey-sherman-murders-whats-slowing-the-cops-down-at-apotex-headquarters/|title=Barry and Honey Sherman murders: What's slowing the cops down at Apotex headquarters - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca}}</ref> By contrast, Sherman saw Apotex as a force for good. \"If we're thieves, we're [[Robin Hood]]s\", he said.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nAs told in Jeffrey Robinson's 2001 book \"Prescription Games: Money, Ego and Power Inside the Pharmaceutical Industry\", Sherman himself acknowledged the long-running conflict between Apotex and the major pharmaceutical companies over drug patents, saying \"The branded drug companies hate us. They have private investigators on us all the time.

At the time of Sherman's death, his company had filed an estimated 1,200 cases against the government in [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]]; a spokesman for [[Health Canada]], named as a defendant in dozens of Apotex's suits, complained that the company's litigiousness had cost Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars in legal fees. \"It was intimidating to come back from lunch and find an urgent memo on your desk saying you\u2019ve got to get over to Federal Court because Sherman was at it again,\" recalled [[Michele Brill-Edwards]], former Healthcan head of drug regulation. \"He quickly demonstrated that in fact you can bully the government and you can intimidate.\" One of Apotex's lawsuits, over the company's application to make a generic version of the [[antidepressant]] [[Trazodone]], took 30 years until the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] ruled that the government had mishandled it.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nSherman himself once told employees that Apotex was primarily a legal company that sold medications on the side.  After his death, ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote: \"He was a billionaire driven to litigation less by money than something more primal: a sense of righteous certitude that propelled him to prevail at any cost.\"<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nCompetitors and the government were not the only targets of Apotex and Sherman's litigation. In the 1990s, following an extension of patents that made generic drugs less profitable to produce, the company began exploring making branded drugs of its own. One of them was [[deferiprone]], a potential treatment for the [[blood disorder]] [[thalassemia]].<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nTrials were overseen by U of T [[hematology|hematologist]] Dr. [[Nancy Olivieri]] at [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|The Hospital for Sick Children]] in Toronto. By 1998 she had serious concerns as to whether the drug was effective or safe, and broke a confidentiality agreement with Apotex to publish them. The company responded by attempting to damage her reputation and sue her; U of T took the company's side rather than risk the loss of a $20 million donation for a planned research center and removed Olivireri from her position as head of a research program on hemoglobin disorders. Eventually she regained it after years of her own litigation; the incident helped inspire [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s novel ''[[The Constant Gardener]]''.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />\n\nIn 2011, the Winter children (his cousins) sued Sherman alleging he never paid royalties and equity in Apotex, contending Sherman had used the proceeds from the 1972 sale of their late father's business Empire to buy Apotex in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/orphans-fight-rbcs-royal-trust-and-apotexs-barry-sherman-in-canadas-largest-lawsuits-1519397.htm|title=Orphans Fight RBC's Royal Trust and Apotex's Barry Sherman in Canada's Largest Lawsuits|date=May 26, 2011|publisher=[[Marketwired]]}}</ref> The cousins sought a 20 percent interest in Apotex or damages of $1 billion. Sherman responded by withdrawing millions of dollars in financial assistance to his cousins.

This caused some controversy when some of those donations were found to have come from minor children of the executives, although ultimately [[Elections Canada]] ruled that no laws were broken.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nAt the time of his death, Sherman, legally registered as a lobbyist, was under investigation because of a fundraiser he had held for [[Justin Trudeau]] in April 2015, allegedly contrary to Canada's [[lobbying]] rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/the-drug-company-embroiled-in-liberal-cash-for-access-controversy-is-still-lobbying-the-federal-government|title=Drug company embroiled in Liberal cash-for-access controversy is still lobbying the federal government|date=November 22, 2016|publisher=|access-date=December 21, 2017}}</ref> Sherman filed a lawsuit in May 2016, attempting to quash the investigation before it was finished, a legally unprecedented move in Canadian history.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" /> \"''There is basis to conclude that Mr. Sherman is in breach of&nbsp;... the Lobbyists' Code of Conduct as a consequence of his involvement in the organization of a fundraising event for the (Liberal Party),''\" according to Phil McIntosh, director of investigations at the Office of the Lobby Commissioner.

Honey, who according to Frank D'Angelo had initiated the move, had purchased a corner lot in November 2016; the Shermans planned to demolish the existing house on the site. Plans for a replacement on file with the city called for a {{convert|16000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} house with features such as a central swimming pool with {{convert|41|ft|adj=on}} retractable skylight and living quarters for staff. The 15 [[Variance (land use)|variances]] required, including the house's {{convert|47.6|m|ft|adj=on}} depth, more than twice that allowed in the city's [[zoning]], and a car stacker in the garage, were approved in June 2017.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nConstruction of the house, and Sherman's ultimately successful effort to recover legal fees from the Winters after their suit was decided in his favour, preoccupied the couple later in the year. They put the North York home on the market, asking almost $7 million, at the end of November, even though construction had not started on the Forest Hill house. On December 12, Honey missed a meeting of the [[Baycrest Health Sciences|Baycrest Centre Foundation]] board, without notifying them beforehand, which was unusual for her. Reached by email, she said she was \"dealing with some stuff\".<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nThe next day the couple met at Apotex headquarters late in the afternoon, where they went over some design changes to the new house in Barry's office. Honey was planning to leave for a holiday vacation in [[Miami]] a few days later; Barry was to join her a week later. It was the last time they were seen alive.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nLater that evening, after returning home, Sherman sent his Apotex staff a routine email about a drug the company was developing. He did not call anyone during that night, which they said was unusual because he frequently suffered from [[insomnia]]. The next day he did not show up at Apotex; again this was out of the ordinary for him.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />\n\nThe next morning, December 15, neither Barry nor Honey was expected to be at home in the morning. The cleaning staff had already let themselves in with a recently installed [[Real-estate lock box|lockbox]] when a pair of real estate agents arrived around mid-morning with a couple interested in the property. After showing them around the main story, the agents took the couple downstairs to the lap pool and hot tub.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />\n\nThere they discovered on the floor next to the pool Barry and Honey's bodies. Both of their necks were tied with leather belts to a metal railing slightly over a metre high around the pool. Barry was seated, his legs crossed, on the pool deck; Honey was on her side with a bruise on her face. Coats pulled down over their shoulders restraining their arms; they were facing away from the water and fully clothed.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" /> \n\nOn the second anniversary of the case, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that the positions the bodies were found in nearly matched those of two 1970s-era \"junk\" sculptures of human figures posed sitting on speakers in the basement. Barry's right leg was crossed over his left, just like one, however Honey's legs were not in front of her as those on the corresponding sculpture had been.<ref name=\"2019 CTV News story\">{{cite news|last=Dunham|first=Jackie|title=Murdered billionaire couple posed like 'creepy' life-sized figurines found in home: report|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/murdered-billionaire-couple-posed-like-creepy-life-sized-figurines-found-in-home-report-1.4727419|newspaper=[[CTV News]]|date=December 12, 2019|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Star'' also reported that Honey's cell phone was found in a bathroom that according to friends she never used, suggesting she might have gone there in an attempt to summon help but was overpowered in the process. Similarly, Barry's gloves, as well as paperwork related to an inspection of the house, were left on the floor just outside the garage door, on the way to the basement pool. A window had been left open to allow a recently painted room to air out, and a basement door was unlocked, as apparently the Shermans frequently left it.

After telling ''Bloomberg'' that he'd been informed he was a \"prime suspect\" and consulting with his lawyer, Kerry Winter allowed that he had not only the motive to kill his cousin but the opportunity, since he was working at the time as a construction supervisor and could set his own hours.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" /> He admitted to ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV series)|The Fifth Estate]]'' that he had imagined killing Sherman but says that he did not, and was watching ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'' on [[Netflix]], then attending a [[Cocaine Anonymous]] meeting that night.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />{{efn|Winter has also claimed in several interviews that at one point in the 1990s Barry, with whom he was then on good terms, was going through a difficult period with Honey and asked Kerry if he knew of someone who could kill her; he went as far as to make preliminary contact with some organized crime figures he was acquainted with. The Sherman children have called that doubtful and hurtful.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" /><ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />}}\n\nAlso mentioned as possibly having a motive to kill Sherman is Frank D'Angelo, given the long history between the two and the latter man's checkered legal history. In his interview with ''Bloomberg'', he said \"The worst thing that could have happened to Frank D'Angelo is Barry dying\" and expressed regret that he had not been able to save a man he regarded as a close friend.

This eventually led Sherman to form Apotex, where he earned a reputation among both competitors and government regulators for extreme combativeness, often including litigation. His four cousins, who were supposed to have received 5 percent stakes in Empire, later sued Sherman unsuccessfully over his sale of Empire.\n\nIn 1971 he married his wife Honey, who would later rise to prominence in Canadian philanthropy, serving on the boards of several prominent charities.

Often these had dubious prospects, and turned out to be fraudulent schemes or run by people later accused of fraud. Sherman's associates felt he was often too generous and trusting with them, failing to do proper [[due diligence]]. \"He always saw the best in people,\" an unidentified longtime friend told ''[[MacLean's]]''. \"Which wasn't a great thing all the time.\"<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nA yacht-chartering company he put money into turned out to be a fraud that had never bought any yachts.

The two produced the Cheetah Power Surge [[energy drink]] and started [[Steelback Brewery]]; when D'Angelo Brands went [[bankruptcy in Canada|bankrupt]] in 2007, Sherman lost CAN$100 million. He put his son in charge of the company, and continued backing D'Angelo's next venture, filmmaking, even after D'Angelo was arrested on [[sexual assault]] and [[obstruction of justice]] charges, later dropped, in 2009. Sherman's money financed all eight films D'Angelo made through 2013.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nIn the late 2010s, Sherman worked with another man later convicted of fraud, Shaun Rootenberg. The two had been introduced by a mutual friend, Myron Gottlieb, cofounder of [[Cineplex Odeon]], who had met Rootenberg in prison following his conviction for fraud in the collapse of [[Livent]].

Under [[Taxation in Canada|Canadian tax law]], this entitled him to an equivalent tax credit. The foundations were then allowed to loan him back money, and did, loaning him almost the total of the $6 million he gave, an unusually high amount for Canadian private foundations that loaned out their money.

He sought to manipulate our system to enrich himself and impoverish Canadian patients who used his drugs\", he said.<ref name=comte /> He accused Sherman of crossing intellectual property rights ethical lines to \"fight as many as 100 battles at a time in court to challenge drug patents and make way for Apotex's generic prescriptions\" with little end benefit to consumers.<ref name=comte /><ref name=\"macleans.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/barry-and-honey-sherman-murders-whats-slowing-the-cops-down-at-apotex-headquarters/|title=Barry and Honey Sherman murders: What's slowing the cops down at Apotex headquarters - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca}}</ref> By contrast, Sherman saw Apotex as a force for good. \"If we're thieves, we're [[Robin Hood]]s\", he said.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nAs told in Jeffrey Robinson's 2001 book \"Prescription Games: Money, Ego and Power Inside the Pharmaceutical Industry\", Sherman himself acknowledged the long-running conflict between Apotex and the major pharmaceutical companies over drug patents, saying \"The branded drug companies hate us. They have private investigators on us all the time.

At the time of Sherman's death, his company had filed an estimated 1,200 cases against the government in [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]]; a spokesman for [[Health Canada]], named as a defendant in dozens of Apotex's suits, complained that the company's litigiousness had cost Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars in legal fees. \"It was intimidating to come back from lunch and find an urgent memo on your desk saying you\u2019ve got to get over to Federal Court because Sherman was at it again,\" recalled [[Michele Brill-Edwards]], former Healthcan head of drug regulation. \"He quickly demonstrated that in fact you can bully the government and you can intimidate.\" One of Apotex's lawsuits, over the company's application to make a generic version of the [[antidepressant]] [[Trazodone]], took 30 years until the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] ruled that the government had mishandled it.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nSherman himself once told employees that Apotex was primarily a legal company that sold medications on the side.  After his death, ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote: \"He was a billionaire driven to litigation less by money than something more primal: a sense of righteous certitude that propelled him to prevail at any cost.\"<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nCompetitors and the government were not the only targets of Apotex and Sherman's litigation. In the 1990s, following an extension of patents that made generic drugs less profitable to produce, the company began exploring making branded drugs of its own. One of them was [[deferiprone]], a potential treatment for the [[blood disorder]] [[thalassemia]].<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nTrials were overseen by U of T [[hematology|hematologist]] Dr. [[Nancy Olivieri]] at [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|The Hospital for Sick Children]] in Toronto. By 1998 she had serious concerns as to whether the drug was effective or safe, and broke a confidentiality agreement with Apotex to publish them. The company responded by attempting to damage her reputation and sue her; U of T took the company's side rather than risk the loss of a $20 million donation for a planned research center and removed Olivireri from her position as head of a research program on hemoglobin disorders. Eventually she regained it after years of her own litigation; the incident helped inspire [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s novel ''[[The Constant Gardener]]''.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />\n\nIn 2011, the Winter children (his cousins) sued Sherman alleging he never paid royalties and equity in Apotex, contending Sherman had used the proceeds from the 1972 sale of their late father's business Empire to buy Apotex in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/orphans-fight-rbcs-royal-trust-and-apotexs-barry-sherman-in-canadas-largest-lawsuits-1519397.htm|title=Orphans Fight RBC's Royal Trust and Apotex's Barry Sherman in Canada's Largest Lawsuits|date=May 26, 2011|publisher=[[Marketwired]]}}</ref> The cousins sought a 20 percent interest in Apotex or damages of $1 billion. Sherman responded by withdrawing millions of dollars in financial assistance to his cousins.

This caused some controversy when some of those donations were found to have come from minor children of the executives, although ultimately [[Elections Canada]] ruled that no laws were broken.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nAt the time of his death, Sherman, legally registered as a lobbyist, was under investigation because of a fundraiser he had held for [[Justin Trudeau]] in April 2015, allegedly contrary to Canada's [[lobbying]] rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/the-drug-company-embroiled-in-liberal-cash-for-access-controversy-is-still-lobbying-the-federal-government|title=Drug company embroiled in Liberal cash-for-access controversy is still lobbying the federal government|date=November 22, 2016|publisher=|access-date=December 21, 2017}}</ref> Sherman filed a lawsuit in May 2016, attempting to quash the investigation before it was finished, a legally unprecedented move in Canadian history.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" /> \"''There is basis to conclude that Mr. Sherman is in breach of&nbsp;... the Lobbyists' Code of Conduct as a consequence of his involvement in the organization of a fundraising event for the (Liberal Party),''\" according to Phil McIntosh, director of investigations at the Office of the Lobby Commissioner.

Honey, who according to Frank D'Angelo had initiated the move, had purchased a corner lot in November 2016; the Shermans planned to demolish the existing house on the site. Plans for a replacement on file with the city called for a {{convert|16000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} house with features such as a central swimming pool with {{convert|41|ft|adj=on}} retractable skylight and living quarters for staff. The 15 [[Variance (land use)|variances]] required, including the house's {{convert|47.6|m|ft|adj=on}} depth, more than twice that allowed in the city's [[zoning]], and a car stacker in the garage, were approved in June 2017.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nConstruction of the house, and Sherman's ultimately successful effort to recover legal fees from the Winters after their suit was decided in his favour, preoccupied the couple later in the year. They put the North York home on the market, asking almost $7 million, at the end of November, even though construction had not started on the Forest Hill house. On December 12, Honey missed a meeting of the [[Baycrest Health Sciences|Baycrest Centre Foundation]] board, without notifying them beforehand, which was unusual for her. Reached by email, she said she was \"dealing with some stuff\".<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nThe next day the couple met at Apotex headquarters late in the afternoon, where they went over some design changes to the new house in Barry's office. Honey was planning to leave for a holiday vacation in [[Miami]] a few days later; Barry was to join her a week later. It was the last time they were seen alive.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />\n\nLater that evening, after returning home, Sherman sent his Apotex staff a routine email about a drug the company was developing. He did not call anyone during that night, which they said was unusual because he frequently suffered from [[insomnia]]. The next day he did not show up at Apotex; again this was out of the ordinary for him.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />\n\nThe next morning, December 15, neither Barry nor Honey was expected to be at home in the morning. The cleaning staff had already let themselves in with a recently installed [[Real-estate lock box|lockbox]] when a pair of real estate agents arrived around mid-morning with a couple interested in the property. After showing them around the main story, the agents took the couple downstairs to the lap pool and hot tub.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />\n\nThere they discovered on the floor next to the pool Barry and Honey's bodies. Both of their necks were tied with leather belts to a metal railing slightly over a metre high around the pool. Barry was seated, his legs crossed, on the pool deck; Honey was on her side with a bruise on her face. Coats pulled down over their shoulders restraining their arms; they were facing away from the water and fully clothed.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" /> \n\nOn the second anniversary of the case, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that the positions the bodies were found in nearly matched those of two 1970s-era \"junk\" sculptures of human figures posed sitting on speakers in the basement. Barry's right leg was crossed over his left, just like one, however Honey's legs were not in front of her as those on the corresponding sculpture had been.<ref name=\"2019 CTV News story\">{{cite news|last=Dunham|first=Jackie|title=Murdered billionaire couple posed like 'creepy' life-sized figurines found in home: report|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/murdered-billionaire-couple-posed-like-creepy-life-sized-figurines-found-in-home-report-1.4727419|newspaper=[[CTV News]]|date=December 12, 2019|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Star'' also reported that Honey's cell phone was found in a bathroom that according to friends she never used, suggesting she might have gone there in an attempt to summon help but was overpowered in the process. Similarly, Barry's gloves, as well as paperwork related to an inspection of the house, were left on the floor just outside the garage door, on the way to the basement pool. A window had been left open to allow a recently painted room to air out, and a basement door was unlocked, as apparently the Shermans frequently left it.

After telling ''Bloomberg'' that he'd been informed he was a \"prime suspect\" and consulting with his lawyer, Kerry Winter allowed that he had not only the motive to kill his cousin but the opportunity, since he was working at the time as a construction supervisor and could set his own hours.<ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" /> He admitted to ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV series)|The Fifth Estate]]'' that he had imagined killing Sherman but says that he did not, and was watching ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'' on [[Netflix]], then attending a [[Cocaine Anonymous]] meeting that night.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" />{{efn|Winter has also claimed in several interviews that at one point in the 1990s Barry, with whom he was then on good terms, was going through a difficult period with Honey and asked Kerry if he knew of someone who could kill her; he went as far as to make preliminary contact with some organized crime figures he was acquainted with. The Sherman children have called that doubtful and hurtful.<ref name=\"McLean's 2018 story\" /><ref name=\"Bloomberg murder story\" />}}\n\nAlso mentioned as possibly having a motive to kill Sherman is Frank D'Angelo, given the long history between the two and the latter man's checkered legal history.

Thirteen mixes of the track were commissioned and spread over various formats, several of them promotional-only. The single did not chart in the States, but following its success in the UK it became a major success all over Europe. (Curiously, despite the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] title, it was not a hit in [[Portugal]], nor in the other major [[Lusophone]] country, [[Brazil]].)\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for the single was shot at the [[Wet 'n Wild (United States)|Wet 'n Wild]] water theme park in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] and features the actress [[Eva Mendes]] in a small role as a teenager with her friends at the park. The video, directed by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], entered heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] that summer.\n\n==Translation==\nThe correct English translation of \"Se a vida \u00e9\" from Portuguese is actually \"If Life Is...\". (\"That's the way life is\" would be \"\u00c9 assim que a vida \u00e9...\" or \"A vida \u00e9 assim\".) The other Portuguese lyric is \"Essa vida \u00e9...\" (\"This life is...\"), which sounds very similar to \"Se a vida \u00e9\".\n\n==Track listing==\n\n'''7\": Parlophone / RLH 6443 (UK)'''\n# \"Se a

Thirteen mixes of the track were commissioned and spread over various formats, several of them promotional-only. The single did not chart in the States, but following its success in the UK it became a major success all over Europe. (Curiously, despite the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] title, it was not a hit in [[Portugal]], nor in the other major [[Lusophone]] country, [[Brazil]].)\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for the single was shot at the [[Wet 'n Wild (United States)|Wet 'n Wild]] water theme park in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] and features the actress [[Eva Mendes]] in a small role as a teenager with her friends at the park. The video, directed by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], entered heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] that summer.\n\n==Translation==\nThe correct English translation of \"Se a vida \u00e9\" from Portuguese is actually \"If Life Is...\". (\"That's the way life is\" would be \"\u00c9 assim que a vida \u00e9...\" or \"A vida \u00e9 assim\".) The other Portuguese lyric is \"Essa vida \u00e9...\" (\"This life is...\"), which sounds very similar to \"Se a vida \u00e9\".\n\n==Track listing==\n\n'''7\": Parlophone / RLH 6443 (UK)'''\n# \"Se a

{"title_page": "Axeman of New Orleans", "text_new": "{{About|the serial killer||Axeman (disambiguation){{!}}Axeman}}\n{{Infobox serial killer\n| name=The Axeman of New Orleans \n| image=Axeman Map New Orleans March 1919.jpg\n| caption=Illustrated map of scenes of the Axe murders, March 1999\n| birthname=\n| alias=\n| birth_date=\n| birth_place=\n| death_date=\n| cause=\n| victims= 6 dead, 6 injured\n| country=USA\n| states=[[Louisiana]]\n| beginyear= May 23, 1918 \n| endyear= October 27, 1919\n| conviction status=Never caught\n}}\n\nThe '''Axeman of New Orleans''' was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] active in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] (and surrounding communities, including [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]]), from May 1918 to October 1919. Press reports during the height of public panic about the killings mentioned similar murders as early as 1911, but recent researchers have called these reports into question.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=55}}</ref> The Axeman was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved.\n\n==Background==\nAs the killer's [[epithet]] implies, the victims usually were attacked with an [[axe]], which often belonged to the victims themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|pp=15\u201316}}</ref> In most cases, a panel on a back door of a home was removed by a [[chisel]], which along with the panel was left on the floor near the door. The intruder then attacked one or more of the residents with either an axe or straight razor. The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from his victims' homes.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of the Axeman's victims were [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants or [[Italian-American]]s, leading many to believe that the crimes were ethnically motivated. Many media outlets sensationalized this aspect of the crimes, even suggesting [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] involvement despite lack of evidence. Some crime analysts have suggested that the killings were related to sex, and that the murderer was perhaps a [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadist]] specifically seeking female victims. [[Criminology|Criminologist]]s Colin and Damon Wilson hypothesize that the Axeman killed male victims only when they obstructed his attempts to murder women, supported by cases in which the woman of the household was murdered but not the man. A less plausible theory is that the killer committed the murders in an attempt to promote [[jazz music]], suggested by a letter attributed to the killer in which he stated that he would spare the lives of those who played jazz in their homes.<ref name=gibson20>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|p=20}}</ref>\n\nThe Axeman was not caught or identified, and his crime spree stopped as mysteriously as it had started. The murderer's identity remains unknown to this day, although various possible identifications of varying plausibility have been proposed. On March 13, 1919, a letter purporting to be from the Axeman was published in newspapers saying that he would kill again at 15 minutes past midnight on the night of March 19, but would spare the occupants of any place where a jazz band was playing. That night all of New Orleans' dance halls were filled to capacity, and professional and amateur bands played jazz at parties at hundreds of houses around town. There were no murders that night.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=59}}</ref>\n\n===The Axeman's letter===\n\n<blockquote>Hottest Hell, March 13, 1919\n\nEsteemed Mortal of New Orleans: The Axeman\n\n\nThey have never caught me and they never will. They have never seen me, for I am invisible, even as the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] that surrounds your earth. I am not a human being, but a spirit and a demon from the hottest hell. I am what you Orleanians and your foolish police call the Axeman.\n\nWhen I see fit, I shall come and claim other victims. I alone know whom they shall be. I shall leave no clue except my bloody axe, besmeared with blood and brains of he whom I have sent below to keep me company.\n\nIf you wish you may tell the police to be careful not to rile me. Of course, I am a reasonable spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.\n\nUndoubtedly, you Orleanians think of me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but I could be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay thousands of your best citizens (and the worst), for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.\n\nNow, to be exact, at 12:15 (earthly time) on next Tuesday night, I am going to pass over New Orleans. In my infinite mercy, I am going to make a little proposition to you people. Here it is:\n\nI am very fond of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band is in full swing at the time I have just mentioned. If everyone has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.\n\nWell, as I am cold and crave the warmth of my native [[Tartarus]], and it is about time I leave your earthly home, I will cease my discourse.

Wilson's theory has been widely repeated in other true crime books and websites. However, true crime writer Michael Newton searched New Orleans and Los Angeles public, police and court records as well as newspaper archives, and failed to find any evidence of a man with the name \"Joseph Momfre\" (or a similar name) having been assaulted or killed in Los Angeles.<ref>{{harvnb|Newton|2004|p=340}}</ref>\n\nNewton was also not able to find any information that Mrs. Pepitone (identified in some sources as Esther Albano, and in others simply as a \"woman who claimed to be Pepitone's widow\") was arrested, tried or convicted for such a crime, or indeed had been in [[California]]. Newton notes that \"Momfre\" was not an unusual surname in New Orleans at the time of the crimes. It appears that there actually may have been an individual named Joseph Momfre or Mumfre in New Orleans who had a criminal history, and who may have been connected with organized crime; however, local records for the period are not extensive enough to allow confirmation of this, or to positively identify the individual. Wilson's explanation is an urban legend, and there is no more evidence now on the identity of the killer than there was at the time of the crimes.<ref>{{harvnb|Newton|2004|p=340}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the alleged \"early\" victims of the Axeman, an Italian couple named Schiambra, were shot by an intruder in their [[Lower Ninth Ward]] home in the early morning hours of May 16, 1912. The male Schiambra survived while his wife died. In newspaper accounts, the prime suspect is referred to by the name of \"Momfre\" more than once. While radically different than the Axeman's usual [[modus operandi]], if Joseph Momfre was indeed the Axeman, the Schiambras may well have been early victims of the future serial killer.<ref name=gibson20/>\n\nAccording to scholar Richard Warner,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aforteantinthearchives.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/fresh-light-on-the-axeman-of-new-orleans/|title=Fresh light on the axeman of New Orleans|website=A Fortean in the Archives|date=10 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> the chief suspect in the crimes was Frank \"Doc\" Mumphrey (1875\u20131921), who used the alias Leon Joseph Monfre/Manfre.\n\n==Victims==\n\n# '''Joseph Maggio''' was an Italian [[grocer]] who was attacked on May 23, 1918, while sleeping alongside his wife, Catherine, at their home on the corner of Upperline and Magnolia Streets where they conducted a barroom and grocery. The killer broke into the home, and then proceeded to cut the couple's throats with a straight razor. Upon leaving he bashed their heads with an axe, perhaps in order to conceal the real cause of [[death]]. Joseph survived the attack, but died minutes after being discovered by his brothers Jake and Andrew Maggio. Catherine died prior to the brothers' arrival.<ref name = razor>{{cite news|title=Brother's Razor Involves Him in Double Killing|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 3, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=May 24, 1918}}</ref> In the apartment, law enforcement agents found the bloody clothes of the murderer, as he had obviously changed into a clean set of clothes before fleeing the scene. A complete search of the premises was not completed by police after the bodies were removed, yet later the bloody razor was found on the lawn of a neighboring property.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloody Clothes Found on Scene of Maggio Crime|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=May 23, 1918}}</ref> Police ruled out robbery as motivation for the attacks, as money and valuables left in plain sight were not stolen by the intruder.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|p=18}}</ref> The razor used to kill the couple was found to belong to Andrew Maggio, the brother of the deceased who conducted a barber shop on Camp Street. His employee, Esteban Torres, told police that Maggio had removed the razor from his shop two days prior to the murder, explaining that he had wanted to have a nick honed from the blade.<ref name = razor /> Maggio, who lived in the adjoining apartment to his brother's residence, discovered his slain brother and sister-in-law roughly two hours after the gruesome attacks had occurred, upon hearing strange groaning noises through the wall. Maggio blamed his failure to hear any noise related to the attacks that had occurred in the early morning hours on his intoxicated state, as he had returned home after a night of celebration prior to his departure to join the navy; police, however, were nonetheless surprised that he failed to hear the intruder, as he made a forced entry into the home.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=54}}</ref>  Andrew Maggio became the police chief's prime suspect in the crime, yet was released after investigators were unable to break down his statement, as well as his account of an unknown man who was supposedly seen lurking near the residence prior to the murders.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andrew Maggio Released; Says He is Innocent|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=May 27, 1918}}</ref>\n# '''Catherine Maggio''' was the wife of Joseph Maggio. Her throat was cut so deeply that her head was nearly severed from her shoulders.\n# '''Louis Besumer''' and his mistress Harriet Lowe were attacked in the early morning hours of June 27, 1918, in the quarters at the back of his grocery which was located at the corner of Dorgenois and Laharpe Streets. Besumer was struck with a hatchet above his right temple, which resulted in a possible skull fracture. Lowe was hacked over the left ear, and found unconscious when police arrived at the scene. The couple was discovered shortly after 7 AM on the morning of the attack by John Zanca, a driver of a bakery wagon who had come to the grocery in order to make a routine delivery. Zanca found both Besumer and Lowe in a puddle of their own blood, both bleeding from their heads.<ref name = hatchet>{{cite news|title=Another Hatchet Mystery; Man and Wife Near Death|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=July 6, 1918}}</ref> The axe, which had belonged to Besumer himself, was found in the bathroom of the apartment. Besumer later stated to police that he had been sleeping when he was bashed with the hatchet.<ref name=katz56/> Almost immediately, police arrested potential suspect Lewis Oubicon, a then 41-year-old African American man who had been employed in Besumer's store just a week before the attacks. No evidence existed which could have proved the man guilty, yet police arrested him nonetheless, stating that Oubicon had offered conflicting accounts of his whereabouts on the morning of the attack. Shortly after the attempted murder Lowe stated that she remembered having been attacked by a [[mulatto]] man, yet her statement was discounted by police due to her disillusioned state. Robbery was said to be the only possible explanation for the attacks, yet no money or valuables were removed from the couple's home.<ref name = hatchet />  Oubicon was later released as police were unable to gather sufficient evidence to hold him accountable for the crimes. Media attention soon turned to Besumer himself, as a series of letters written in German, Russian, and Yiddish were discovered in a trunk at the man's home. Police suspected that Besumer was a German spy, and government officials began a full investigation of his potential espionage. Weeks later, after going in and out of consciousness, Harriet Lowe told police that she thought Besumer was in fact a German spy, which led to his immediate arrest. Two days later Besumer was released, and two lead investigators of the case were demoted due to unacceptable police work. Besumer was once again arrested in August 1918, after Harriet Lowe, who lay dying in Charity Hospital after a failed surgery, stated that it was he who had attacked her more than a month previously with his hatchet. He was charged with murder, and served nine months in prison before being acquitted on May 1, 1919, after a ten-minute jury deliberation.<ref name=katz56/>\n# '''Harriet Lowe''' was attacked while in bed with Louis Besumer. As is mentioned previously, Lowe was hacked above her left ear and found unconscious at the scene of the crime before she was rushed to Charity Hospital.<ref name = hatchet /> Lowe became the center of a media circus, as she continually made scandalous and often false statements relating to both the attacks and the character of Louis Besumer, some of which are described in the preceding description. The Times-Picayune sensationalized Lowe and her outspoken nature upon discovering that she was not the wife of Besumer, but his mistress. A Charity Hospital source discovered the scandal, when Besumer asked to be directed to the room of \"Mrs. Harriet Lowe,\" and was inevitably denied access as no woman by that name was a patient. Besumer's legal wife arrived from Cincinnati in the days immediately following the discovery, which further inflamed the ongoing drama.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mystery!|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=July 3, 1918}}</ref> Lowe further gained media attention as she repeatedly made statements which voiced her dislike of the New Orleans chief of police, as well as her reluctance to comply with police questioning. After the truth of her marital status was revealed publicly, Lowe told reporters from the Times-Picayune that she would no longer aid the police in their investigation, as she suspected that it had been Chief Mooney who first informed the press of the scandal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mate of Besemer Refuses to Tell Police Anything|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=July 9, 1918}}</ref> Despite the scandal, and her delirious statements which suggested that Besumer was a German spy, Lowe returned to the home she shared with Besumer weeks after the attack.

Just prior to her death, Lowe told authorities that she suspected it was Louis Besumer who had attacked her.<ref name=katz56/>\n# '''Anna Schneider''' was attacked in the early evening hours of August 5, 1918. The 8 months pregnant, 28-year-old of Elmira Street awoke to find a dark figure standing over her and was bashed in the face repeatedly. Her scalp had been cut open, and her face was completely covered in blood. Mrs. Schneider was discovered after midnight by her husband, Ed Schneider, who was returning late from work.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=57}}</ref> Schneider claimed that she remembered nothing of the attack, and gave birth to a healthy baby girl two days after the incident. Her husband told police that nothing was stolen from the home, besides six or seven dollars that had been in his wallet. The windows and doors of the apartment appear to have not been forced open, and authorities came to the conclusion that the woman was most likely attacked with a lamp that had been on a nearby table. James Gleason, who police said was an ex-convict, was arrested shortly after Schneider was found. Gleason was later released due to a complete lack of evidence, and stated that he originally ran from authorities because he had so often been arrested. Lead investigators began to publicly speculate that the attack was related to the previous incidents involving Besumer and Maggio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police Believe Ax-Man May be Active in the City|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=August 6, 1918}}</ref>\n# '''Joseph Romano''' was an elderly man living with his two nieces, Pauline and Mary Bruno. On August 10, 1918, Pauline and Mary awoke to the sound of a commotion in the adjoining room where their uncle resided. Upon entering the room, the sisters discovered that their uncle had taken a serious blow to his head, which resulted in two open cuts.  The assailant was fleeing the scene as they arrived, yet the girls were able to distinguish that he was a dark-skinned, heavy-set man, who wore a dark suit and slouched hat. Romano, although seriously injured, was able to walk to the ambulance once it arrived, yet died two days later due to severe head trauma. The home had been ransacked, yet no items were stolen from Romano. Authorities found a bloody axe in the back yard and discovered that a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. The Romano murder created a state of extreme chaos in the city, with residents living in constant fear of an axeman attack. Police received a slew of reports, in which citizens claimed to have seen an axeman lurking in New Orleans neighborhoods. A few men even called to report that they had found axes in their back yards.<ref name=katz56>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|page=56}}</ref> John Dantonio, a then-retired Italian detective, made public statements in which he hypothesized that the man who had committed the axeman murders was the same who had killed several individuals in 1911. The retired detective cited similarities in the manner by which the two sets of homicides had been committed, as reason to assume that they had been conducted by the same individual. Dantonio described the potential killer as an individual of dual personalities, who killed without motive. This type of individual, Dantonio stated, could very likely have been a normal, law-abiding citizen, who was often overcome by an overwhelming desire to kill.  He later went on to describe the killer as a real-life \"Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Is the Axe-Man Type of Jekyl-Hyde Concept?|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=August 13, 1918}}</ref>\n# '''Charles Cortimiglia''' was an immigrant who lived with his wife, Rosie, and infant daughter, Mary, on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in [[Gretna, Louisiana]], a New Orleans suburb across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife, and their daughter had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles lay on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away and a bloody axe was found on the back porch of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.<ref name=katz58>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|page=58}}</ref>\n# '''Rosie Cortimiglia''' was the wife of immigrant laborer Charles Cortimiglia.

Boca awoke during the night to find a dark figure looming over his bed. Upon regaining consciousness, Boca ran to the street to investigate the intrusion, and found that his head had been cracked open. The grocer ran to the home of his neighbor, Frank Genusa, where he lost consciousness and collapsed. Nothing had been taken from the home, yet, once again, a panel on the back door of the home had been chiseled away. Boca recovered from his injuries, but could not remember any details of the trauma. This attack took place after the emergence of the infamous axeman letter.<ref name=katz61>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|page=61}}</ref>\n# '''Sarah Laumann''' was attacked on the night of September 3, 1919. Neighbors came to check on the young woman, who had lived alone, and broke into the home when Laumann did not answer. They discovered the 19-year-old lying unconscious on her bed, suffering from a severe head injury and missing several teeth. The intruder had entered the apartment through an open window, and attacked the woman with a blunt object. A bloody axe was discovered on the front lawn of the building. Laumann recovered from her injuries, yet couldn't recall any details from the attack.<ref name=katz61/>\n# '''Mike Pepitone''' was attacked on the night of October 27, 1919. His wife was awakened by a noise and arrived at the door of his bedroom just as a large, axe-wielding man was fleeing the scene. Mike Pepitone had been struck in the head, and was covered in his own blood. Blood splatter covered the majority of the room, including a painting of the Virgin Mary. Mrs. Pepitone, the mother of six children, was unable to describe any characteristics of the killer.

Press reports during the height of public panic about the killings mentioned similar murders as early as 1911, but recent researchers have called these reports into question.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=55}}</ref> The Axeman was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved.\n\n==Background==\nAs the killer's [[epithet]] implies, the victims usually were attacked with an [[axe]], which often belonged to the victims themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|pp=15\u201316}}</ref> In most cases, a panel on a back door of a home was removed by a [[chisel]], which along with the panel was left on the floor near the door. The intruder then attacked one or more of the residents with either an axe or straight razor. The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from his victims' homes.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of the Axeman's victims were [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants or [[Italian-American]]s, leading many to believe that the crimes were ethnically motivated. Many media outlets sensationalized this aspect of the crimes, even suggesting [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] involvement despite lack of evidence. Some crime analysts have suggested that the killings were related to sex, and that the murderer was perhaps a [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadist]] specifically seeking female victims. [[Criminology|Criminologist]]s Colin and Damon Wilson hypothesize that the Axeman killed male victims only when they obstructed his attempts to murder women, supported by cases in which the woman of the household was murdered but not the man. A less plausible theory is that the killer committed the murders in an attempt to promote [[jazz music]], suggested by a letter attributed to the killer in which he stated that he would spare the lives of those who played jazz in their homes.<ref name=gibson20>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|p=20}}</ref>\n\nThe Axeman was not caught or identified, and his crime spree stopped as mysteriously as it had started. The murderer's identity remains unknown to this day, although various possible identifications of varying plausibility have been proposed. On March 13, 1919, a letter purporting to be from the Axeman was published in newspapers saying that he would kill again at 15 minutes past midnight on the night of March 19, but would spare the occupants of any place where a jazz band was playing. That night all of New Orleans' dance halls were filled to capacity, and professional and amateur bands played jazz at parties at hundreds of houses around town. There were no murders that night.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=59}}</ref>\n\n===The Axeman's letter===\n\n<blockquote>Hell, March 13, 1919\n\nEsteemed Mortal of New Orleans: The Axeman\n\n\nThey have never caught me and they never will. They have never seen me, for I am invisible, even as the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] that surrounds your earth. I am not a human being, but a spirit and a demon from the hottest hell. I am what you Orleanians and your foolish police call the Axeman.\n\nWhen I see fit, I shall come and claim other victims. I alone know whom they shall be. I shall leave no clue except my bloody axe, besmeared with blood and brains of he whom I have sent below to keep me company.\n\nIf you wish you may tell the police to be careful not to rile me. Of course, I am a reasonable spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.\n\nUndoubtedly, you Orleanians think of me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but I could be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay thousands of your best citizens (and the worst), for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.\n\nNow, to be exact, at 12:15 (earthly time) on next Tuesday night, I am going to pass over New Orleans. In my infinite mercy, I am going to make a little proposition to you people. Here it is:\n\nI am very fond of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band is in full swing at the time I have just mentioned. If everyone has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.\n\nWell, as I am cold and crave the warmth of my native [[Tartarus]], and it is about time I leave your earthly home, I will cease my discourse. Hoping that thou wilt publish this, that it may go well with thee, I have been, am and will be the worst spirit that ever existed either in fact or realm of fancy.\n\n\n--The Axeman<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=60}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Suspects==\n\n[[File:Manfre slaying article.jpg|thumb|200px|Dec. 1921 ''Los Angeles Times'' article on the killing of Manfre by the widow of Mike Pepitone]]\nCrime writer [[Colin Wilson]] speculates the Axeman could have been Joseph Momfre, a man shot to death in [[Los Angeles]] in December 1920 by the widow of Mike Pepitone, the Axeman's last known victim. Wilson's theory has been widely repeated in other true crime books and websites. However, true crime writer Michael Newton searched New Orleans and Los Angeles public, police and court records as well as newspaper archives, and failed to find any evidence of a man with the name \"Joseph Momfre\" (or a similar name) having been assaulted or killed in Los Angeles.<ref>{{harvnb|Newton|2004|p=340}}</ref>\n\nNewton was also not able to find any information that Mrs. Pepitone (identified in some sources as Esther Albano, and in others simply as a \"woman who claimed to be Pepitone's widow\") was arrested, tried or convicted for such a crime, or indeed had been in [[California]]. Newton notes that \"Momfre\" was not an unusual surname in New Orleans at the time of the crimes. It appears that there actually may have been an individual named Joseph Momfre or Mumfre in New Orleans who had a criminal history, and who may have been connected with organized crime; however, local records for the period are not extensive enough to allow confirmation of this, or to positively identify the individual. Wilson's explanation is an urban legend, and there is no more evidence now on the identity of the killer than there was at the time of the crimes.<ref>{{harvnb|Newton|2004|p=340}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the alleged \"early\" victims of the Axeman, an Italian couple named Schiambra, were shot by an intruder in their [[Lower Ninth Ward]] home in the early morning hours of May 16, 1912. The male Schiambra survived while his wife died. In newspaper accounts, the prime suspect is referred to by the name of \"Momfre\" more than once. While radically different than the Axeman's usual [[modus operandi]], if Joseph Momfre was indeed the Axeman, the Schiambras may well have been early victims of the future serial killer.<ref name=gibson20/>\n\nAccording to scholar Richard Warner,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aforteantinthearchives.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/fresh-light-on-the-axeman-of-new-orleans/|title=Fresh light on the axeman of New Orleans|website=A Fortean in the Archives|date=10 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> the chief suspect in the crimes was Frank \"Doc\" Mumphrey (1875\u20131921), who used the alias Leon Joseph Monfre/Manfre.\n\n==Victims==\n\n# '''Joseph Maggio''' was an Italian [[grocer]] who was attacked on May 23, 1918, while sleeping alongside his wife, Catherine, at their home on the corner of Upperline and Magnolia Streets where they conducted a barroom and grocery. The killer broke into the home, and then proceeded to cut the couple's throats with a straight razor. Upon leaving he bashed their heads with an axe, perhaps in order to conceal the real cause of [[death]]. Joseph survived the attack, but died minutes after being discovered by his brothers Jake and Andrew Maggio. Catherine died prior to the brothers' arrival.<ref name = razor>{{cite news|title=Brother's Razor Involves Him in Double Killing|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 3, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=May 24, 1918}}</ref> In the apartment, law enforcement agents found the bloody clothes of the murderer, as he had obviously changed into a clean set of clothes before fleeing the scene. A complete search of the premises was not completed by police after the bodies were removed, yet later the bloody razor was found on the lawn of a neighboring property.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloody Clothes Found on Scene of Maggio Crime|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=May 23, 1918}}</ref> Police ruled out robbery as motivation for the attacks, as money and valuables left in plain sight were not stolen by the intruder.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|2006|p=18}}</ref> The razor used to kill the couple was found to belong to Andrew Maggio, the brother of the deceased who conducted a barber shop on Camp Street. His employee, Esteban Torres, told police that Maggio had removed the razor from his shop two days prior to the murder, explaining that he had wanted to have a nick honed from the blade.<ref name = razor /> Maggio, who lived in the adjoining apartment to his brother's residence, discovered his slain brother and sister-in-law roughly two hours after the gruesome attacks had occurred, upon hearing strange groaning noises through the wall. Maggio blamed his failure to hear any noise related to the attacks that had occurred in the early morning hours on his intoxicated state, as he had returned home after a night of celebration prior to his departure to join the navy; police, however, were nonetheless surprised that he failed to hear the intruder, as he made a forced entry into the home.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=54}}</ref>  Andrew Maggio became the police chief's prime suspect in the crime, yet was released after investigators were unable to break down his statement, as well as his account of an unknown man who was supposedly seen lurking near the residence prior to the murders.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andrew Maggio Released; Says He is Innocent|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=May 27, 1918}}</ref>\n# '''Catherine Maggio''' was the wife of Joseph Maggio. Her throat was cut so deeply that her head was nearly severed from her shoulders.\n# '''Louis Besumer''' and his mistress Harriet Lowe were attacked in the early morning hours of June 27, 1918, in the quarters at the back of his grocery which was located at the corner of Dorgenois and Laharpe Streets. Besumer was struck with a hatchet above his right temple, which resulted in a possible skull fracture. Lowe was hacked over the left ear, and found unconscious when police arrived at the scene. The couple was discovered shortly after 7 AM on the morning of the attack by John Zanca, a driver of a bakery wagon who had come to the grocery in order to make a routine delivery. Zanca found both Besumer and Lowe in a puddle of their own blood, both bleeding from their heads.<ref name = hatchet>{{cite news|title=Another Hatchet Mystery; Man and Wife Near Death|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=July 6, 1918}}</ref> The axe, which had belonged to Besumer himself, was found in the bathroom of the apartment. Besumer later stated to police that he had been sleeping when he was bashed with the hatchet.<ref name=katz56/> Almost immediately, police arrested potential suspect Lewis Oubicon, a then 41-year-old African American man who had been employed in Besumer's store just a week before the attacks. No evidence existed which could have proved the man guilty, yet police arrested him nonetheless, stating that Oubicon had offered conflicting accounts of his whereabouts on the morning of the attack. Shortly after the attempted murder Lowe stated that she remembered having been attacked by a [[mulatto]] man, yet her statement was discounted by police due to her disillusioned state. Robbery was said to be the only possible explanation for the attacks, yet no money or valuables were removed from the couple's home.<ref name = hatchet />  Oubicon was later released as police were unable to gather sufficient evidence to hold him accountable for the crimes. Media attention soon turned to Besumer himself, as a series of letters written in German, Russian, and Yiddish were discovered in a trunk at the man's home. Police suspected that Besumer was a German spy, and government officials began a full investigation of his potential espionage. Weeks later, after going in and out of consciousness, Harriet Lowe told police that she thought Besumer was in fact a German spy, which led to his immediate arrest. Two days later Besumer was released, and two lead investigators of the case were demoted due to unacceptable police work. Besumer was once again arrested in August 1918, after Harriet Lowe, who lay dying in Charity Hospital after a failed surgery, stated that it was he who had attacked her more than a month previously with his hatchet. He was charged with murder, and served nine months in prison before being acquitted on May 1, 1919, after a ten-minute jury deliberation.<ref name=katz56/>\n# '''Harriet Lowe''' was attacked while in bed with Louis Besumer. As is mentioned previously, Lowe was hacked above her left ear and found unconscious at the scene of the crime before she was rushed to Charity Hospital.<ref name = hatchet /> Lowe became the center of a media circus, as she continually made scandalous and often false statements relating to both the attacks and the character of Louis Besumer, some of which are described in the preceding description. The Times-Picayune sensationalized Lowe and her outspoken nature upon discovering that she was not the wife of Besumer, but his mistress. A Charity Hospital source discovered the scandal, when Besumer asked to be directed to the room of \"Mrs. Harriet Lowe,\" and was inevitably denied access as no woman by that name was a patient. Besumer's legal wife arrived from Cincinnati in the days immediately following the discovery, which further inflamed the ongoing drama.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mystery!|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=July 3, 1918}}</ref> Lowe further gained media attention as she repeatedly made statements which voiced her dislike of the New Orleans chief of police, as well as her reluctance to comply with police questioning. After the truth of her marital status was revealed publicly, Lowe told reporters from the Times-Picayune that she would no longer aid the police in their investigation, as she suspected that it had been Chief Mooney who first informed the press of the scandal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mate of Besemer Refuses to Tell Police Anything|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=July 9, 1918}}</ref> Despite the scandal, and her delirious statements which suggested that Besumer was a German spy, Lowe returned to the home she shared with Besumer weeks after the attack. One side of her face was partially paralyzed due to the severity of the attack.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Lowe Removed to Besemer Home|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=July 15, 1918}}</ref> Lowe died August 5, 1918, just two days after doctors performed surgery in an effort to repair her partially paralyzed face. Just prior to her death, Lowe told authorities that she suspected it was Louis Besumer who had attacked her.<ref name=katz56/>\n# '''Anna Schneider''' was attacked in the early evening hours of August 5, 1918. The 8 months pregnant, 28-year-old of Elmira Street awoke to find a dark figure standing over her and was bashed in the face repeatedly. Her scalp had been cut open, and her face was completely covered in blood. Mrs. Schneider was discovered after midnight by her husband, Ed Schneider, who was returning late from work.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|p=57}}</ref> Schneider claimed that she remembered nothing of the attack, and gave birth to a healthy baby girl two days after the incident. Her husband told police that nothing was stolen from the home, besides six or seven dollars that had been in his wallet. The windows and doors of the apartment appear to have not been forced open, and authorities came to the conclusion that the woman was most likely attacked with a lamp that had been on a nearby table. James Gleason, who police said was an ex-convict, was arrested shortly after Schneider was found. Gleason was later released due to a complete lack of evidence, and stated that he originally ran from authorities because he had so often been arrested. Lead investigators began to publicly speculate that the attack was related to the previous incidents involving Besumer and Maggio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police Believe Ax-Man May be Active in the City|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=August 6, 1918}}</ref>\n# '''Joseph Romano''' was an elderly man living with his two nieces, Pauline and Mary Bruno. On August 10, 1918, Pauline and Mary awoke to the sound of a commotion in the adjoining room where their uncle resided. Upon entering the room, the sisters discovered that their uncle had taken a serious blow to his head, which resulted in two open cuts.  The assailant was fleeing the scene as they arrived, yet the girls were able to distinguish that he was a dark-skinned, heavy-set man, who wore a dark suit and slouched hat. Romano, although seriously injured, was able to walk to the ambulance once it arrived, yet died two days later due to severe head trauma. The home had been ransacked, yet no items were stolen from Romano. Authorities found a bloody axe in the back yard and discovered that a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. The Romano murder created a state of extreme chaos in the city, with residents living in constant fear of an axeman attack. Police received a slew of reports, in which citizens claimed to have seen an axeman lurking in New Orleans neighborhoods. A few men even called to report that they had found axes in their back yards.<ref name=katz56>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|page=56}}</ref> John Dantonio, a then-retired Italian detective, made public statements in which he hypothesized that the man who had committed the axeman murders was the same who had killed several individuals in 1911. The retired detective cited similarities in the manner by which the two sets of homicides had been committed, as reason to assume that they had been conducted by the same individual. Dantonio described the potential killer as an individual of dual personalities, who killed without motive. This type of individual, Dantonio stated, could very likely have been a normal, law-abiding citizen, who was often overcome by an overwhelming desire to kill.  He later went on to describe the killer as a real-life \"Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Is the Axe-Man Type of Jekyl-Hyde Concept?|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives|accessdate=May 2, 2012|newspaper=Times-Picayune|date=August 13, 1918}}</ref>\n# '''Charles Cortimiglia''' was an immigrant who lived with his wife, Rosie, and infant daughter, Mary, on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in [[Gretna, Louisiana]], a New Orleans suburb across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife, and their daughter had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles lay on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away and a bloody axe was found on the back porch of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.<ref name=katz58>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|page=58}}</ref>\n# '''Rosie Cortimiglia''' was the wife of immigrant laborer Charles Cortimiglia. She was attacked alongside her husband on March 10, 1919, while sleeping with her baby in her arms. She was badly wounded by the axeman, but survived the incident.<ref name=katz58/>\n# '''Mary Cortimiglia''' was the two-year-old daughter of Charles and Rosie Cortimiglia. She was killed while sleeping in her mother's arms with a single blow to the back of the neck when she and her parents were attacked on March 10, 1919.<ref name=katz58/>\n# '''Steve Boca''', a grocer, was attacked in his bedroom as he slept by an axe-wielding intruder on August 10, 1919. Boca awoke during the night to find a dark figure looming over his bed. Upon regaining consciousness, Boca ran to the street to investigate the intrusion, and found that his head had been cracked open. The grocer ran to the home of his neighbor, Frank Genusa, where he lost consciousness and collapsed. Nothing had been taken from the home, yet, once again, a panel on the back door of the home had been chiseled away. Boca recovered from his injuries, but could not remember any details of the trauma. This attack took place after the emergence of the infamous axeman letter.<ref name=katz61>{{harvnb|Katz|2010|page=61}}</ref>\n# '''Sarah Laumann''' was attacked on the night of September 3, 1919. Neighbors came to check on the young woman, who had lived alone, and broke into the home when Laumann did not answer. They discovered the 19-year-old lying unconscious on her bed, suffering from a severe head injury and missing several teeth. The intruder had entered the apartment through an open window, and attacked the woman with a blunt object. A bloody axe was discovered on the front lawn of the building. Laumann recovered from her injuries, yet couldn't recall any details from the attack.<ref name=katz61/>\n# '''Mike Pepitone''' was attacked on the night of October 27, 1919. His wife was awakened by a noise and arrived at the door of his bedroom just as a large, axe-wielding man was fleeing the scene. Mike Pepitone had been struck in the head, and was covered in his own blood. Blood splatter covered the majority of the room, including a painting of the Virgin Mary. Mrs. Pepitone, the mother of six children, was unable to describe any characteristics of the killer. The Pepitone murder was the last of the alleged axeman attacks.<ref name=katz61/>\n\n[[Image:Mysterious axman.gif|right|thumb|200px|Cover of the 1919 sheet music]]\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{rewrite section|date=October 2018}}\n*In 1919, local tune writer Joseph John Davilla wrote the song, \"The Mysterious Axman's Jazz (Don't Scare Me Papa)\".

RIBA]] (23 November 1878&nbsp;\u2013 7 November 1941) was a British transport administrator. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1902, he worked at the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]], before moving to the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL) in 1906. He was [[chief executive officer]] and vice-chairman of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] from its creation in 1933 until 1940.\n\nPick had a strong interest in design and its use in public life. He steered the development of the [[London Underground]]'s [[corporate identity]] by commissioning eye-catching [[commercial art]], [[graphic design]] and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and [[Johnston (typeface)|typeface]] still used today. \n\nUnder his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably, reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to his being likened to [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]] and [[Robert Moses]].\n\nPick's interest extended beyond his own organisation. He was a founding member and later served as President of the [[Design and Industries Association]]. He was also the first chairman of the Council for Art and Industry and regularly wrote and lectured on design and [[urban planning]] subjects. For the government, Pick prepared the transport plan for the mass [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuation of civilians]] from London at the outbreak of war and produced reports on the wartime use of canals and ports.\n\n==Early life==\nFrank Pick was born on 23 November 1878 at [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], [[Lincolnshire]]. He was the first child of five born to [[draper]] Francis Pick and his wife Fanny Pick (n\u00e9e Clarke).{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=13}}{{refn|The names of Pick's siblings were Ethel, Marion, Martin and Sisson.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=275}}|group=\"note\"}} Pick's paternal grandfather, Charles Pick, was a farmer in Spalding who died in his forties, leaving eight children. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Clarke, was a blacksmith and [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] [[laity|lay preacher]].{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=17}} As a child, Pick was bookish, preferring to read and build collections of moths and butterflies and objects found on the beach rather than take part in sports.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=14 & 16}}\n\nBefore becoming a draper, Pick's father had had an ambition to become a lawyer and he encouraged his son to follow this career.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=17\u201318}} Pick attended [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]] in [[York]] on a [[scholarship]],{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}} and was [[articled clerk|articled]] to a York solicitor, George Crombie, in March 1897.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=20}} He qualified in January 1902 and completed a law degree at the [[University of London]] in the same year, but did not apply to practice.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nIn 1902, Pick began working for the North Eastern Railway. He worked first in the company's traffic statistics department before becoming assistant to the company's general manager, Sir [[George Gibb]] in 1904.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=22}} In 1904, Pick married Mabel Mary Caroline Woodhouse. The couple had no children.{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}}\n\n==London's transport==\n[[File:Tube map 1908-2.jpg|thumb|The first [[Tube map|Underground branded map]] from 1908, showing the UERL's lines and those of the other tube companies and the [[Metropolitan Railway]]|alt=A map titled \"London Underground Railways\" showing each of the underground railway lines in a different colour with stations marked as blobs. Faint background detail shows the River Thames, roads and non-underground lines.]]\nIn 1906, Gibb was appointed managing director of the UERL. At Gibb's invitation, Pick also moved to the UERL to continue working as his assistant.{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}}{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=22}} The UERL controlled the [[District Railway]] and, during 1906 and 1907, opened three deep-level tube lines \u2013 the [[Baker Street and Waterloo Railway]] (Bakerloo tube), the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]] (Hampstead tube) and the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]] (Piccadilly tube).{{sfn|Rose|1999}}{{refn|A \"tube\" railway is an underground railway constructed in a cylindrical tunnel by the use of a [[tunnelling shield]], usually deep below ground level.|name=note1|group=note}}\n\nThe UERL had financial problems. Ticket prices were low and passenger numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates.{{refn|In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5&nbsp;million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35&nbsp;million predicted. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26&nbsp;million of a predicted 60&nbsp;million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25&nbsp;million of a predicted 50&nbsp;million. For the District Railway, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100&nbsp;million passengers after electrification, but achieved only 55&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=191}}|group=\"note\"}} The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly the result of competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=197}}\n\n===Branding \u2013 a clear identity===\nBy 1908, Pick had become publicity officer responsible for marketing and it was at this time that, working with the company's general manager [[Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield|Albert Stanley]], he began developing the strong corporate identity and visual style for which the [[London Underground]] later became famous, including the introduction of the \"UNDERGROUND\" brand.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=199}} Pick's philosophy on design was that \"the test of the goodness of a thing is its fitness for use. If it fails on this first test, no amount of ornamentation or finish will make it any better; it will only make it more expensive, more foolish.\"<ref>Pick, quoted in {{harvnb|Wolmar|2005|p=274}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Golders Green poster 1908.png|thumb|left|upright|A poster shows the well-kept garden of an early 20th century suburban house.

Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=29\u201331, 102}}{{refn|A double crown sheet was {{convert|30|x|20|in}}; Pick's scheme allowed for these to be grouped in sets of four, eight, 12 or 16 sheets.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=31}} A double royal sheet was {{convert|40|x|25|in}}.|group=\"note\"}} Pick described the process: \"after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be.

Studies were carried out for an extension of the Piccadilly tube on GNR tracks to [[New Barnet]] and [[Enfield Town|Enfield]] or on a new route to [[Wood Green]] and plans were developed for an extension of the CLR along GER tracks to [[Chingford]] and [[Chipping Ongar|Ongar]], but both mainline companies strongly opposed the Underground's encroachment into their territories.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=75\u201378}}\n\nWanting to make maximum use of the government's financial backing, which was only available for a limited period, Pick did not have time to press the Underground's case for these extensions. Instead he developed a plan for an extension of the C&SLR southwest from [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]] to [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] in Surrey. Pick still faced strong opposition from the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] and the [[London and South Western Railway]] which operated in the area, but the Underground had the advantage of already having an approval for the last few miles of the route as part of an unused prewar permission for a new [[Wimbledon and Sutton Railway|line from Wimbledon to Sutton]]. The railway companies challenged the need for a new service, claiming it would simply drain passengers from their own trains and that any extension should only run as far as [[Tooting]], but Pick was able to counter their arguments and negotiated a compromise settlement to extend the C&SLR as far as [[Morden tube station|Morden]].{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=80\u201384}}{{refn|The Wimbledon to Sutton line was constructed by the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] and was opened in 1930.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Jackson|first=Alan A.|date=December 1966|title=The Wimbledon & Sutton Railway \u2013 A late arrival on the South London suburban scene|magazine=The Railway Magazine|pages=675\u2013680 [679]|url=http://www.semgonline.com/RlyMag/WimbledonSuttonRly.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> \n\nIn conjunction with the C&SLR's southward extension, the C&SLR and Hampstead tube were linked between Charing Cross (now [[Embankment tube station|Embankment]]) and [[Kennington tube station|Kennington]] stations, creating the basis of what is now the Underground's [[Northern Line]].|group=\"note\"}}\n\nEven before the C&SLR extension had been completed in 1926, possibilities for the northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear. From 1922, a series of press campaigns called for the improvement of services at the GNR's [[Finsbury Park station]] where interchanges between tube lines, mainline trains, buses and trams were notoriously bad. In June 1923, a petition from 30,000 local residents was submitted to Parliament, and in 1925, the government called a [[public inquiry]] to review options.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=85}} Pick presented plans to relieve the congestion at Finsbury Park by extending the Piccadilly tube north to [[Southgate tube station|Southgate]]. \n\nOpposition from the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (successor to the GNR following the [[Railways Act 1921|1923 grouping of railway companies]]) was again considerable and based on claims that the new Underground line would take passengers from the mainline services.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=86\u201392}} Using data from the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead tube and C&SLR extensions, Pick demonstrated that the route planned for the new line would stimulate new residential development and increase passenger numbers for all rail operators in the area, increasing those on the Piccadilly tube by 50 million per year. {{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=88 & 92}}{{refn|In evidence to the parliamentary committee on Piccadilly tube passengers arriving at Finsbury Park, Pick commented that the GNR's steam train service from the station was so poor that \"it is extraordinary how small a proportion of this traffic changes to the mainline railway.

To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. \n\nPick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by [[Willem Marinus Dudok]] in [[Hilversum]].{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=132\u201335}} Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=137}}\n\nThe designs Pick commissioned from Holden (1931\u201333) established a new standard for the Underground, with the prototype station at [[Sudbury Town tube station|Sudbury Town]] being described by architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as a \"landmark\" and the start of \"the 'classic' phase of Underground architecture\".{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=136}} To ensure that the new stations achieved the complete and coherent design that he wanted, Pick instructed the engineering departments to provide Holden with full details of all equipment needed for the stations. After late equipment changes by the engineers at the first few new stations compromised the integrated design, Pick took personal charge of the coordination of the architectural and engineering elements.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=137\u201339}} \n\nIn the mid-1930s when the introduction of [[trolleybus]]es to replace trams required the installation of new street poles to support overhead wiring, Pick was keenly interested that the design of the poles was coordinated to accommodate all of the possible equipment and signage that might be needed. He also oversaw the designs of the new [[bus stop]]s and bus shelters that were installed when specified stopping points were introduced for bus services.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=236\u201340}}\n\n===London Passenger Transport Board===\n[[File:LPTA map.png|thumb|left|alt=An outline map of the area around London.

These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital. The [[London Traffic Act 1924]] granted their request by establishing the [[London Traffic Area]] to regulate road passenger traffic within London and the surrounding districts.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=142\u201344}} \n\nThroughout the 1920s, Pick led the Underground Group's efforts to coordinate its services with the municipal tram operators, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] and the suburban mainline rail services. The aim was to achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), a public corporation which was to take control of the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of the bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the [[County of London]] and [[Middlesex]] and parts of [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Kent]], [[Surrey]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=144\u201347}}{{refn|The mainline railways' suburban lines remained outside of the LPTB's control, but the railway companies did participate in the common fund to pool revenue for suburban passenger services.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=146\u201347}}|group=\"note\"}}\n\nPick had become joint managing director of the Underground Group in 1928, and when, on 1 July 1933, the group was taken over by the LPTB, he became [[chief executive officer]] and vice-chairman,{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}} on an annual salary of \u00a310,000 (approximately {{Inflation|UK|10000|1933|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}<!-- this template updates automatically to use the most recent data available -->).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1933/may/22/london-passenger-transport-board|title=London Passenger Transport Board \u2013 answers|date=22 May 1933|journal=[[Hansard]]|volume=278|accessdate=28 April 2011|ref=harv}}</ref>{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Ashfield was chairman.

On the Metropolitan Railway (renamed the [[Metropolitan line]]), Pick and Ashfield began to rationalise services. The barely used and loss-making [[Brill Tramway|Brill]] and [[Verney Junction railway station|Verney Junction]] branches beyond [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]] were closed in 1935 and 1936.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=120}} Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=56}} \n\nIn 1935, the availability of [[government-backed loan]]s to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Pick to promote system-wide improvements under the [[New Works Programme|New Works Programme for 1935\u20131940]], including the transfer of the Metropolitan line's [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]] services to the [[Bakerloo line]] in 1939, the [[Northern line]]'s [[Northern line#Northern Heights|Northern Heights]] project and extension of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] to [[Ongar railway station|Ongar]] in Essex and [[Denham railway station|Denham]] in Buckinghamshire.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2008|p=118}}<ref group=note>Much of the works were interrupted by [[World War II]].

The [[Railway Executive Committee]] was reconstituted in 1938 to act as a central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement with other members of the LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit the dividend that it could pay to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the board at the end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=254\u201359}}{{refn|The disagreement was over a matter of principle: whether the board should accept the government's plan to limit the LPTB's dividend payments to a fraction of the amount that it was statutorily required to pay. Ashfield and other board members were prepared to accept the proposal, but Pick believed that the board should not agree to the imposed limitation of its responsibility. The matter was somewhat technical, as the statutory dividend had not once been paid in full since the LPTB's creation in 1933.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=257\u201358}}|group=\"note\"}} \n\nPick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's senior management structure and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation in some sort of joint general manager position.

RIBA]] (23 November 1878&nbsp;\u2013 7 November 1941) was a British transport administrator. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1902, he worked at the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]], before moving to the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL) in 1906. He was [[chief executive officer]] and vice-chairman of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] from its creation in 1933 until 1940.\n\nPick had a strong interest in design and its use in public life. He steered the development of the [[London Underground]]'s [[corporate identity]] by commissioning eye-catching [[commercial art]], [[graphic design]] and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and [[Johnston (typeface)|typeface]] still used today. \n\nUnder his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to his being likened to [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]] and [[Robert Moses]].\n\nPick's interest extended beyond his own organisation. He was a founding member and later served as President of the [[Design and Industries Association]]. He was also the first chairman of the Council for Art and Industry and regularly wrote and lectured on design and [[urban planning]] subjects. For the government, Pick prepared the transport plan for the mass [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuation of civilians]] from London at the outbreak of war and produced reports on the wartime use of canals and ports.\n\n==Early life==\nFrank Pick was born on 23 November 1878 at [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], [[Lincolnshire]]. He was the first child of five born to [[draper]] Francis Pick and his wife Fanny Pick (n\u00e9e Clarke).{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=13}}{{refn|The names of Pick's siblings were Ethel, Marion, Martin and Sisson.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=275}}|group=\"note\"}} Pick's paternal grandfather, Charles Pick, was a farmer in Spalding who died in his forties, leaving eight children. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Clarke, was a blacksmith and [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] [[laity|lay preacher]].{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=17}} As a child, Pick was bookish, preferring to read and build collections of moths and butterflies and objects found on the beach rather than take part in sports.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=14 & 16}}\n\nBefore becoming a draper, Pick's father had had an ambition to become a lawyer and he encouraged his son to follow this career.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=17\u201318}} Pick attended [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]] in [[York]] on a [[scholarship]],{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}} and was [[articled clerk|articled]] to a York solicitor, George Crombie, in March 1897.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=20}} He qualified in January 1902 and completed a law degree at the [[University of London]] in the same year, but did not apply to practice.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nIn 1902, Pick began working for the North Eastern Railway. He worked first in the company's traffic statistics department before becoming assistant to the company's general manager, Sir [[George Gibb]] in 1904.{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=22}} In 1904, Pick married Mabel Mary Caroline Woodhouse. The couple had no children.{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}}\n\n==London's transport==\n[[File:Tube map 1908-2.jpg|thumb|The first [[Tube map|Underground branded map]] from 1908, showing the UERL's lines and those of the other tube companies and the [[Metropolitan Railway]]|alt=A map titled \"London Underground Railways\" showing each of the underground railway lines in a different colour with stations marked as blobs. Faint background detail shows the River Thames, roads and non-underground lines.]]\nIn 1906, Gibb was appointed managing director of the UERL. At Gibb's invitation, Pick also moved to the UERL to continue working as his assistant.{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}}{{sfn|Barman|1979|p=22}} The UERL controlled the [[District Railway]] and, during 1906 and 1907, opened three deep-level tube lines \u2013 the [[Baker Street and Waterloo Railway]] (Bakerloo tube), the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]] (Hampstead tube) and the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]] (Piccadilly tube).{{sfn|Rose|1999}}{{refn|A \"tube\" railway is an underground railway constructed in a cylindrical tunnel by the use of a [[tunnelling shield]], usually deep below ground level.|name=note1|group=note}}\n\nThe UERL had financial problems. Ticket prices were low and passenger numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates.{{refn|In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5&nbsp;million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35&nbsp;million predicted. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26&nbsp;million of a predicted 60&nbsp;million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25&nbsp;million of a predicted 50&nbsp;million. For the District Railway, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100&nbsp;million passengers after electrification, but achieved only 55&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=191}}|group=\"note\"}} The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly the result of competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=197}}\n\n===Branding \u2013 a clear identity===\nBy 1908, Pick had become publicity officer responsible for marketing and it was at this time that, working with the company's general manager [[Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield|Albert Stanley]], he began developing the strong corporate identity and visual style for which the [[London Underground]] later became famous, including the introduction of the \"UNDERGROUND\" brand.{{sfn|Wolmar|2005|p=199}} Pick's philosophy on design was that \"the test of the goodness of a thing is its fitness for use. If it fails on this first test, no amount of ornamentation or finish will make it any better; it will only make it more expensive, more foolish.\"<ref>Pick, quoted in {{harvnb|Wolmar|2005|p=274}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Golders Green poster 1908.png|thumb|left|upright|A poster shows the well-kept garden of an early 20th century suburban house.

Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen.

Instead he developed a plan for an extension of the C&SLR southwest from [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]] to [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] in Surrey. Pick still faced strong opposition from the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] and the [[London and South Western Railway]] which operated in the area, but the Underground had the advantage of already having an approval for the last few miles of the route as part of an unused prewar permission for a new [[Wimbledon and Sutton Railway|line from Wimbledon to Sutton]]. The railway companies challenged the need for a new service, claiming it would simply drain passengers from their own trains and that any extension should only run as far as [[Tooting]], but Pick was able to counter their arguments and negotiated a compromise settlement to extend the C&SLR as far as [[Morden tube station|Morden]].{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=80\u201384}}{{refn|The Wimbledon to Sutton line was constructed by the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] and was opened in 1930.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Jackson|first=Alan A.|date=December 1966|title=The Wimbledon & Sutton Railway \u2013 A late arrival on the South London suburban scene|magazine=The Railway Magazine|pages=675\u2013680 [679]|url=http://www.semgonline.com/RlyMag/WimbledonSuttonRly.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> \n\nIn conjunction with the C&SLR's southward extension, the C&SLR and Hampstead tube were linked between Charing Cross (now [[Embankment tube station|Embankment]]) and [[Kennington tube station|Kennington]] stations, creating the basis of what is now the Underground's [[Northern Line]].|group=\"note\"}}\n\nEven before the C&SLR extension had been completed in 1926, possibilities for the northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear.

These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital.

The aim was to achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), a public corporation which was to take control of the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of the bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the [[County of London]] and [[Middlesex]] and parts of [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Kent]], [[Surrey]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=144\u201347}}{{refn|The mainline railways' suburban lines remained outside of the LPTB's control, but the railway companies did participate in the common fund to pool revenue for suburban passenger services.{{sfn|Barman|1979|pp=146\u201347}}|group=\"note\"}}\n\nPick had become joint managing director of the Underground Group in 1928, and when, on 1 July 1933, the group was taken over by the LPTB, he became [[chief executive officer]] and vice-chairman,{{sfn|Elliot|Robbins|2008}} on an annual salary of \u00a310,000 (approximately {{Inflation|UK|10000|1933|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}<!-- this template updates automatically to use the most recent data available -->).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1933/may/22/london-passenger-transport-board|title=London Passenger Transport Board \u2013 answers|date=22 May 1933|journal=[[Hansard]]|volume=278|accessdate=28 April 2011|ref=harv}}</ref>{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Ashfield was chairman.

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time.

It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010.

In addition to increasing the primary proton beam power, the current in the [[magnetic horn|horns]] focusing secondary particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, etc.) with a chosen [[electric charge]] will also be increased from 250 kA to 320 kA. This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment.

It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water.

Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=April 2003 |volume=501 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(03)00425-X|bibcode=2003NIMPA.501..418F }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004.

The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010.

In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s.

Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\">{{cite news|url=http://www.j-parc.jp/c/en/topics/2020/02/12000416.html|title=The Hyper-Kamiokande project is officially approved.|date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a J-PARC neutrino beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |arxiv=1502.05199|bibcode=2015PTEP.2015e3C02A }}</ref>\n\n====Hyper-Kamiokande detector====\n\nThe Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a [[water]] [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector. It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Batmann", "label": "safe", "comment": "Get rid of wrong source", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}

An inbound call centre is operated by a [[company]] to administer incoming product or service support or information enquiries from consumers. Outbound call centres are operated for [[telemarketing]], for solicitation of charitable or political donations, debt collection, [[market research]], emergency notifications, and urgent/critical needs [[blood banks]].

It can be independently operated or networked with additional centres, often linked to a corporate [[computer network]], including [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[microcomputer/server]]s and [[local area network|LANs]]. Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the centre are linked through a set of new technologies called [[computer telephony integration]].\n\nThe contact centre is a central point from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of company's [[customer relationship management]] infrastructure. The majority of large companies use contact centres as a means of managing their customer interactions. These centres can be operated by either an in house department responsible or outsourcing customer interaction to a third party agency (known as Outsourcing Call Centres).\n\n==History==\n[[File:callcentre.jpg|thumb|A very large call centre in Lakeland, Florida (2006)]]\nAnswering services, as known in the 1960s through the 1980s, earlier and slightly later, involved a business that specifically provided the service. Primarily by the use of an [[off-premises extension]] (OPX) for each subscribing business, connected at a switchboard at the answering service business, the answering service would answer the otherwise unattended phones of the subscribing businesses with a live operator. The live operator could take messages or relay information, doing so with greater human interactivity than a mechanical answering machine. Although undoubtedly more costly (the human service, the cost of setting up and paying the phone company for the OPX on a monthly basis), it had the advantage of being more ready to respond to the unique needs of after-hours callers. The answering service operators also had the option of calling the client and alerting them to particularly important calls.\n\nThe origins of call centres dates back to the 1960s with the UK-based Birmingham Press and Mail, which installed Private Automated Business Exchanges (PABX) to have rows of agents handling customer contacts.<ref>[[Science and invention in Birmingham#cite note-45]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.callcentrehelper.com/the-history-of-the-call-centre-15085.htm |title=The history of the call centre |publisher=Call Centre Helper Magazine |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> By 1973, call centres received mainstream attention after Rockwell International patented its Galaxy Automatic Call Distributor (GACD) for a telephone booking system as well as the popularization of telephone headsets as seen on televised [[Christopher C.

The term \"call centre\" was first published and recognised by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 1983. The 1980s experienced the development of [[toll-free telephone number]]s to increase the efficiency of agents and overall call volume. Call centres increased with the deregulation of [[long-distance calling]] and growth in information dependent industries.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Bottom-Line Call Center Management |last=Butler |first=David L. |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}</ref>\n\nAs call centres expanded, unionisation occurred in [[North America]] to gain members<ref>{{cite book |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kumar |first2=Christopher Robert |last2=Schenk |title=Paths to Union Renewal |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-55193-058-7}}</ref> including the [[Communications Workers of America]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwa-union.org/news/entry/Improving_Call_Center_Jobs_a_Top_Priority_for_CWA_Customer_Service_Activist/ |title=Improving Call Center Jobs a Top Priority for CWA Customer Service |publisher=Communication Workers of America |accessdate=2011-02-23|date=2010-05-06 }}</ref> and the [[United Steelworkers]].

A contact centre is defined as a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies and strategies that provides access to information, resources, and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organisation.<ref>[[Brad Cleveland|Cleveland, Brad]], \"Call Center Management on Fast Forward (Third Edition)\", ''ICMI Press'', 2012</ref><ref name=\"Cactus Search\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |title=Cactus Search - List of Call Centre Management Roles We Recruit |publisher=Cactus Search |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129062129/http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}</ref> In contrast to in-house management, outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a \"pay per use\" model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients, thereby supporting a very cost effective model, especially for low volumes of calls. The modern contact centre includes automated call blending of inbound and outbound calls as well as predictive dialling capabilities dramatically increasing agents productivity. Latest implementations with more complex systems, require highly skilled operational and management staff that can use [[multichannel marketing|multichannel]] online and offline tools to improve customer interactions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.com/blog/reinventing-customer-service-the-modern-contact-center |title=Reinventing customer service: the modern contact center |last=Viswanathan |first=Ravi |last2=Sandell |first2=Scott |date=21 June 2016 |website=Nea.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genesys.com/solutions/contact-center-modernization |title=Contact Center Modernization |last=Staff |year=2016 |website=Genesys.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/cis/features/articles/301771-history-advancement-the-contact-center-the-customer-experience.htm |title=The History and Advancement of the Contact Center and the Customer Experience |last=Bernier |first=Paula |date=3 August 2012 |website=Tmcnet.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Callcentreterminal.JPG|thumb|Call centre worker confined to a small workstation/booth, using [[CallWeb]] Internet-based survey software]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=left\n | header_align=center\n | footer_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 380\n | image1 =Call centre desk lakeland florida.jpg| width1 = 2288 | height1 =1712\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 =Workstation\n | image2 =Aspect Tel-set telephone call centre.jpg | width2 = 1535 | height2 = 1112\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 =A typical call centre telephone.

Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies, both for inbound and outbound campaigns. This allows inbound calls to be directly routed to the appropriate agent for the task, whilst minimising wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in.\n\nFor outbound calls, lead selection allows management to designate what type of leads go to which agent based on factors including skill, socioeconomic factors, past performance, and percentage likelihood of closing a sale per lead.\n\nThe [[universal queue]] standardises the processing of communications across multiple technologies such as fax, phone, and email. The [[virtual queue]] provides callers with an alternative to waiting on hold when no agents are available to handle inbound call demand.\n\n===Premises-based technology===\nHistorically, call centres have been built on [[Private branch exchange]] (PBX) equipment that is owned, hosted, and maintained by the call centre operator. The PBX can provide functions such as [[automatic call distribution]], [[interactive voice response]], and [[skills-based routing]].\n\n===Virtual call centre===\n{{see also|Software as a service|Telecommuting}}\nIn a virtual call centre model, the call centre operator (business) pays a monthly or annual fee to a vendor that hosts the call centre telephony and data equipment in their own facility, cloud-based. In this model, the operator does not own, operate or host the equipment on which the call centre runs. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] telephone lines, or over [[voice over IP]].

It can be independently operated or networked with additional centres, often linked to a corporate [[computer network]], including [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[microcomputer/server]]s and [[local area network|LANs]]. Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the centre are linked through a set of new technologies called [[computer telephony integration]].\n\nThe contact centre is a central point from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of company's [[customer relationship management]] infrastructure. The majority of large companies use contact centres as a means of managing their customer interactions. These centres can be operated by either an in house department responsible or outsourcing customer interaction to a third party agency (known as Outsourcing Call Centres).\n\n==History==\n[[File:callcentre.jpg|thumb|A very large call centre in Lakeland, Florida (2006)]]\nAnswering services, as known in the 1960s through the 1980s, earlier and slightly later, involved a business that specifically provided the service. Primarily by the use of an [[off-premises extension]] (OPX) for each subscribing business, connected at a switchboard at the answering service business, the answering service would answer the otherwise unattended phones of the subscribing businesses with a live operator. The live operator could take messages or relay information, doing so with greater human interactivity than a mechanical answering machine. Although undoubtedly more costly (the human service, the cost of setting up and paying the phone company for the OPX on a monthly basis), it had the advantage of being more ready to respond to the unique needs of after-hours callers. The answering service operators also had the option of calling the client and alerting them to particularly important calls.\n\nThe origins of call centres dates back to the 1960s with the UK-based Birmingham Press and Mail, which installed Private Automated Business Exchanges (PABX) to have rows of agents handling customer contacts.<ref>[[Science and invention in Birmingham#cite note-45]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.callcentrehelper.com/the-history-of-the-call-centre-15085.htm |title=The history of the call centre |publisher=Call Centre Helper Magazine |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> By 1973, call centres received mainstream attention after Rockwell International patented its Galaxy Automatic Call Distributor (GACD) for a telephone booking system as well as the popularization of telephone headsets as seen on televised [[Christopher C.

The term \"call centre\" was first published and recognised by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 1983. The 1980s experienced the development of [[toll-free telephone number]]s to increase the efficiency of agents and overall call volume. Call centres increased with the deregulation of [[long-distance calling]] and growth in information dependent industries.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Bottom-Line Call Center Management |last=Butler |first=David L. |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}</ref>\n\nAs call centres expanded, unionisation occurred in [[North America]] to gain members<ref>{{cite book |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kumar |first2=Christopher Robert |last2=Schenk |title=Paths to Union Renewal |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-55193-058-7}}</ref> including the [[Communications Workers of America]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwa-union.org/news/entry/Improving_Call_Center_Jobs_a_Top_Priority_for_CWA_Customer_Service_Activist/ |title=Improving Call Center Jobs a Top Priority for CWA Customer Service |publisher=Communication Workers of America |accessdate=2011-02-23|date=2010-05-06 }}</ref> and the [[United Steelworkers]].

A contact centre is defined as a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies and strategies that provides access to information, resources, and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organisation.<ref>[[Brad Cleveland|Cleveland, Brad]], \"Call Center Management on Fast Forward (Third Edition)\", ''ICMI Press'', 2012</ref><ref name=\"Cactus Search\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |title=Cactus Search - List of Call Centre Management Roles We Recruit |publisher=Cactus Search |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129062129/http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}</ref> In contrast to in-house management, outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a \"pay per use\" model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients, thereby supporting a very cost effective model, especially for low volumes of calls. The modern contact centre includes automated call blending of inbound and outbound calls as well as predictive dialling capabilities dramatically increasing agents productivity. Latest implementations with more complex systems, require highly skilled operational and management staff that can use [[multichannel marketing|multichannel]] online and offline tools to improve customer interactions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.com/blog/reinventing-customer-service-the-modern-contact-center |title=Reinventing customer service: the modern contact center |last=Viswanathan |first=Ravi |last2=Sandell |first2=Scott |date=21 June 2016 |website=Nea.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genesys.com/solutions/contact-center-modernization |title=Contact Center Modernization |last=Staff |year=2016 |website=Genesys.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/cis/features/articles/301771-history-advancement-the-contact-center-the-customer-experience.htm |title=The History and Advancement of the Contact Center and the Customer Experience |last=Bernier |first=Paula |date=3 August 2012 |website=Tmcnet.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Callcentreterminal.JPG|thumb|Call centre worker confined to a small workstation/booth, using [[CallWeb]] Internet-based survey software]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=left\n | header_align=center\n | footer_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 380\n | image1 =Call centre desk lakeland florida.jpg| width1 = 2288 | height1 =1712\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 =Workstation\n | image2 =Aspect Tel-set telephone call centre.jpg | width2 = 1535 | height2 = 1112\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 =A typical call centre telephone.

Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies, both for inbound and outbound campaigns. This allows inbound calls to be directly routed to the appropriate agent for the task, whilst minimising wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in.\n\nFor outbound calls, lead selection allows management to designate what type of leads go to which agent based on factors including skill, socioeconomic factors, past performance, and percentage likelihood of closing a sale per lead.\n\nThe [[universal queue]] standardises the processing of communications across multiple technologies such as fax, phone, and email. The [[virtual queue]] provides callers with an alternative to waiting on hold when no agents are available to handle inbound call demand.\n\n===Premises-based technology===\nHistorically, call centres have been built on [[Private branch exchange]] (PBX) equipment that is owned, hosted, and maintained by the call centre operator. The PBX can provide functions such as [[automatic call distribution]], [[interactive voice response]], and [[skills-based routing]].\n\n===Virtual call centre===\n{{see also|Software as a service|Telecommuting}}\nIn a virtual call centre model, the call centre operator (business) pays a monthly or annual fee to a vendor that hosts the call centre telephony and data equipment in their own facility - Cloud based. In this model, the operator does not own, operate or host the equipment on which the call centre runs. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] telephone lines, or over [[voice over IP]]. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, rather than at the call centre operator's premises. The vendor's telephony equipment (at times data servers) then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.<ref>{{cite book |author=M. Popovic and V.

These are known in the industry as \"central reservations offices\". Staff members at these call centres take calls from clients wishing to make reservations or other inquiries via a public number, usually a [[Toll-free number|1-800 number]]. These centres may operate as many as 24 hours per day, seven days a week, depending on the call volume the chain receives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RqTgAAAAMAAJ&q=%22central+reservations+office%22&dq=%22central+reservations+office%22|title=Managing Front Office Operations|last=Kasavana|first=Michael L.|last2=Brooks|first2=Richard M.|date=1998|publisher=Educational Institute of the American Hotel & Motel Association|isbn=9780866121798|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Evaluation==\n=== Mathematical theory ===\n{{see also|Erlang distribution}}\n[[Queueing theory]] is a branch of mathematics in which models of service systems have been developed.
